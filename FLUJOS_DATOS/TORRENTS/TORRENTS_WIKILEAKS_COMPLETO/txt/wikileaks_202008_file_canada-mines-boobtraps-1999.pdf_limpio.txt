warfare 1mine warfare as we know it today had its origin on th battle fields of world war i with the introduction of th tank t overcome this new threat land mines were constructed usin g artillery shells the germans devised an electrically fired mechanis m which was remotely controlled from hidden observation posts the allies improved on this with the development of charge which wa s detonated when the t ank drove over it this was the forerunner of the modern antitank mine by the end of world war i delay action mines and booby traps had been used extensively 2between the two world wars the major european power s continued the development and the manufact ure of land mines with germany making the most progress mines were used at th beginning of world war ii howe ver their true value was not shown until the british held off german forces in north africa by using larg placed antitank minefields in italy there was increase d use of antipersonnel mines during world war ii more than 20 percent of all tank losses in all theatres were caused by mines with losses in specific battles ranging as high as 40 percent 3north korea made extensive use of mines during unite d nations operations in ko rea nearly 70 percent of all tank losses and 10 percent of personnel casualties were caused by mines 4when us marines first arrived in vietnam almost 6 5 percent of marine casualties were due to mines and booby t raps with training and awareness this figure was drastically reduced however extensive use still accounted for overall losses f 70 percent of all vehicle casualties and 33 percent of all pe rsonnel casualties 5extensive use of mines continued through the 197 3bgl320010fp001 122arabisraeli war egyptian minefields were w ell covered by fire and were highly effective israeli minefields however were not well covered by fire and were thus less effective both egypti an and syrian forces breached the minefields using soviet mine rollers 6during the sovi et occupation of afghanistan from 1979 to 1988 the afghan freedom fighters conducted widespread intensiv mining operations they were successful in hindering the soviet advance as well as demoralizing soviet troops and forcing the commitment of engineer time and resources to countermin operations the soviets also conducted the ir own mining campaign in an attempt to cut off afghan supply routes 7after eight years of war with iran the iraqi army wa s acutely aware of the importance of mine warfare during t he persian gulf war of 199091 the iraqis laid extensive minef ields throughout kuwait these minefields were well sited but were laid by poorly trained troops and the minefields were often not c overed by fire or observation some l anes and gaps were not even closed during the allied offensive the minefields were not hind rance to movement and did not become factor in the battle 8during the first two years of peace support operations in the former yugoslavia april 1992 to april 1994 mines and ex plosive accounted for 32 percent of war related casualties direct fire mine s and explosives and indirect fire 9the mines of the 1990s are far more sophisticated than th first mines artillery shells of world war i however the principles that govern the effective employment of mines remai n unchanged effectiveness of mines 10the history of mine warfare has seen extensive use of mines in all major wars yet they have rarely played the decisive rol in the outcome of battle measuring the real value of minefield remain s very difficult both qualitatively and quantitativel 11in later sections of this manual terminology will b ebgl320010fp001 123introduced to describe the relative effectiveness stopping powe r of particular minefield aga inst particular target this effectiveness can only be achieved when mines are used to enhance th defenders weapons systems not replace them 12a mine is weapon which can produce personnel an d vehicle casualties but its effectiveness shall be measured in terms of the resulting reduction of mobility and not just the nu mber of casualties caused the opposing force may be aware of particular minefield and divert his advance elsewhere avoiding the min efield how is the value of this minefield measured 13when single mine is detected it can be easily destroyed or avoided the use of several even thousands of mine s will delay the opposing force but mines alone c annot stop an opposing force to be effective they must be covered by fire the time delay described above will add to the effectiveness of the weapo n systems covering the mines by lengthening the period f engagement future developments 14the introduc tion of scatterable mine systems has in many ways revolutionized land mine warfare delivered by variety of systems including ground dispensers artillery gun and roc ket systems helicopters and fixed wing aircraft scatterable mines can be remotely delivered on targets at the forward edge f the battl area and in depth 15the technology of placed mines has also increase d dramatica lly the development of smart mines and area def ence weapons has broadened the scope of employment for mines the incorporation of shaped charges in min and improved design have made all such mines more lethal and simpler to depl oy 16countermine operations have also received more attentio n in recent years development of standoff detection s ystems signature simulators and improvements in mechanica l and explosiv breaching devices will provide more alternatives to countering mines experience has shown though that single method or device willbgl320010fp001 124counter all types of mines in all terrain and all we ather conditions therefore development in countermine equipment will continue to lag behind to some degree 17in view of the foregoing it is essential that all troops have an understanding of the i mportance of mine warfare on the modern battlefield bgl320010fp001 1a1annex references and standardization agreements 1the

employment of mines 2mines are employed as major defensive and harassin g weapon the nuisance value of mines is considered to be most equal to their destructive value mines are consid ered as combat weapon and are employed in both the offence and def ence 3mines may be used in the offence as follows afor flank protection of advancing units assembly an d attack positions intermediate objectives artillery an d antitank gun positions and approaches to bridges an d river crossing sites bto hold captured positions against counterattacks and cto block or contain withdrawing forces during pur

different problems and require diffe rent techniques and equipment for breaching adeliberate deliberate minefields consist of one or mor belts each laid in regular pattern these minefields may be buried and are usually covered by fire and tied int natural and artificial obstacles bypassing is difficult or impossible and coor dinated brigade or divisional effort is required to overc ome resistance and breach the minefield and bhasty hasty minefields may have particular pattern or density these may be laid mechanically or by hand an d may be buried or surface laid scatter able mines may also be laid by artillery or aircraft they are found in files bgl320010fp001 213214along highspeed avenues and in some cases scattere d randomly about the countryside bypassing may b possible and

characteristics and functioning of mines components 1mines generally consist of six parts fig 221 ca fuze or firing device which actuates the detonator r igniter da detonator or igniter which actuates the booster ca booster which may be attached to the fuze or be part of the main charge da main charge in container whic h usually forms the body of the mine ea safety and arming mechanism which prevents th unintentional or premature firing of the fuze and fthe outer casing or body which contains all of the pa rts listed abovebgl320010fp001 2222fuze fuze is device which initiates the explosive train fuzes come in variety of types including mechanical c hemical friction and electrical specific t ypes of fuzes are discussed later in this chapter 3detonator detonator is sensitive explosive that i s actuated by the action of the fuz and fires the booster or the main charge 4booster booster is less sensitive but more powerful tha n the detonator it is not always required but when us ed is ignited by the detonator and provides more powerful explo sion to actuate the main charge 5main charge upon detonation the main charg accomplishes the purpose of the mine by attacking the target with blast fragments projected metal slugs or flame some mines may also have propelling charge to expel the main cha rge 6body or case the body or case serves to hold the fuz holder and main charge depending on the desired degree of resistance to detonation and the purpose of the mine which ma be designed to cause damage by blast or fragmentation the body may be made of metal plastic wood or other materials 7safety and arming mechanism most mines have built i n safety devices to prevent unintentional functioning of th fuze depending on the type of mine the safety device is usually of the safety fork and arming dial type or safety pin r clip additional safety may be provided by the removal of components such as the fuze or detonator classification of fuzes 8the three classifications of fuzes are acontact target must come in contact direct or indirect with the fuze to provide the required functioning bgl320010fp001 223bcontrolled the mine is remotely controlled

antidisturbance devices and booby traps 14antidisturbance devices some mines are manufacture d with integral antidisturbance devices which will actuat the min when an attempt is made to remove it they may be fitte d to the mine or they may be separate charge causing it detonate when th mine is disturbed bgl320010fp001 227228fig 224 antidisturbance device connected to the mine fig 224

actuated when an attempt is made to c lear the mine they will not necessarily explode the mine but may take the form of an antipersonnel device separate from the mine similarly boobytraps may be set in minefields conn ected to pickets wire mine crates etc and designed to impede the clearance of the minefield by causing casualties 16the use of antidisturbance devices and booby traps i f authorized

ground boats or aircraft designed to wound kill or otherwise incapacitate personnel it may b detonated by the action of its victim by the passa ge of time or by controlled means 2placed mines placed mines are designed for laying by han d or mechanical means usually in pattern they may b buried r surface laid in pattern or randomly as the situ ation dictates 3scatterable mines scatterable mine s are those mines that are laid without regard to classical pattern and are designed to be delivered by aircraft artillery missile ground dispenser r hand once laid they will normally have limited laid l ife 4antitank mines an antitank mine is mine designed t immobilize or destroy tank it normally damages the vehicl tracks or wheels or penetrates the vehicle body antitan k mines normally contain large explosive charge weighing from 5 t 14 kg 5antipersonnel mines mine designed to wound kill r otherwise incapacitate personnel it may be detonated by th action of its victim scatterable mines 6although mine warfare has existed for long time th concept of scatterable mines is relatively new for the mo st part mines have been laid by hand or by mechanically placing them on the ground in pattern or randomly laying placed m inefield requires considerable time manpower expense and logisti c support with even more time required to record and repor tbgl320010fp001 232minefield locations the infantry company normally requires severa l hours to lay protective minefield system loaded wi th antipersonnel or antitank mines can accomplish the same task scatterable mines can accomplish the same task in mater f minutes using wide variety of delivery means they are laid without regard to pattern and usually have limite d life classification of mines by effect 7land mines can also be classified according to the effe cts they cause ablast produces casualties through shockconcussion however some secondary fragmentation will be prese nt bfragmentation detonation of the mine results i

undetectable mines 9mines which do not cont ain any metal are undetectable by inservice mine detectors however proper prodding and feeli ng techniques and the use of search dogs will disclose larg percentage of mines of this type bgl320010fp001 241section 4 mine indicators responsibilities 1all military personnel must be constantly on the alert f or mines and booby traps they must know their likely cations and the various indications that mines are present becau of the larg variety and number of mines found throughout the world it is prudent to conduct predeployment and intheatre ne awareness training for troops this can help ensure that troops are prep ared for the mines and mining techniques employed in the theatre mine identification 2it is imperative that all personnel involved in opera tions be prepared to encounter mines each theatre of operations will have its own particular set of mines and these mines will change over time as existing mines are modified or replaced and new mines are introduced countries throughout the world produce mines of ll sizes shapes and effects these mines can be factory made r improvised and can be made of variety of materials such as metal plastic or wood identification of these mines and knowled ge of their characteristics and of their employment is the key to successsful mine counter measures marked minefields 3nato

the minefield signs are placed in interval s along the fence mounted at about eye level on posts driven into the ground the method of marking minefields varies with thei r location fig 241 shows examples of perimeter fences employed throughout the world bgl320010fp001 243fig 241 examples of minefield perimeter fences unmarked minefields 6general the first indication of the presence of mines an d booby traps may often be casualty such casualties ar sometimes inevitable but much can be done to prevent them training and experience develops mine awareness which enables personnel to instinctively suspect the presence of mines our own intelligence will provide considerable informat ion on th type and location of mines and minefields from air photo s interrogation maps etc it is

all arms must bgl320010fp001 245246be trained to recognize the signs that indicate the presenc of mines and help locate their positions 9likely locations the following are some of the location s where mines are likely to be found ain bottlenecks and defiles where vehicles damaged b mines will block routes this is particularly effective where the recovery or clearance of damaged vehicles is di

booby traps antidisturbanc devices bo oby trapped mines and tripwires in minefields is is sued at the thea tre level the general theme of such policy is t restrict the unauthorized use of these devices because of t he danger to friendly troops within the terms of the theat re policy formation commanders may further restrict the use of booby traps and other devices within their area for reasons such as the safety of the local population and of their troops employment 2the aim of using booby traps is to create an attitude f uncertainty and suspicion in the opponents mind t hereby lower ing morale and inducing degree of caution which slows movem ent the casualties and damage inflicted are merely mean s towards this end 3booby traps are used in the following situations ain the withdrawal they are used to delay the enemy s advance in much the same way as nuisance mining buildings which the enemy may need for shelter approaches to attractive harbour areas and diversion s around obstacles are all suitable locations bin the defence booby traps may be laid in front of r among tactical obstacles eg minefields wire fences an d road blocks to impede enemy infantry and to preven t detailed reconnaissance and attempted neutralization the may also be used to give warning of opposing fo rce patrols and to deter them from using ground not otherwise covere d by observation or fire andbgl320010fp001 252cin the offensive during raids in enemy occupied territory charges with delay mechanisms may be used to caus damage casualties and to create confusion normal booby traps may also be left behind to damage and delay th enemy when he counterattacks to reoccupy the area responsibilities 4setting booby traps are used only on the orders of th divisional commander within the terms of the theatre policy as indiscriminate use is liable to cause many casualties to our ow n troops the plan must be carefully coordinated by the form ation staff booby traps are set only by engineers and assault pioneers the setting and clearance of booby traps is covered in b gl320 010fp002 engineer field manual volume 10 mines and booby traps part 2 engineers and assault pioneers

presence of booby traps they shall learn to avoid performing many of the normal actions of life without first t aking the necessary precautions field units are required t maintai n personnel trained to search for booby traps and mark thei r presence detection 6the detection of booby traps and the prevention f casualties is largely matter of personal discipline and tra ining knowledge of the subject is combined with keen eyesight and suspicious mind an understanding f the method of operation of booby traps and the principles used in siting booby traps assists in their detection actuating booby traps 7in almost every case booby traps operate by one of th following actionsbgl320010fp001 253fig 251 operation of booby traps apull by the movement of some concealed object such as thin trip wire connected to the device fig 25 1a bpressure by the direct pressure of foot wheel or trac k on concealed mechanism fig 251b cpressure release by the lifting of some apparentl harmless object from the c oncealed mechanism see fig 2 51c dtension release by the release of tension in taut wir fig 251d and edelay by some form of automatic delay mechanis m designed to function independently of any human agency the delay may be from few hours to many days fig 25 1ebgl320010fp001 2548in the first four types of booby traps the mechanism m ay actuate the charge immediately or with delayaction from few seconds to few minutes principles of siting booby traps 9the essence of booby trap is cunning and variety i t usually takes one of the following forms athe baited trap bthe tripwire or equivalent cthe double bluff or da combination of all three 10the principles descri bed below are normally observed when siting booby traps since the enemy also works on these principles an understanding of them is important in the detection of bo oby traps aconcealment the charges and mechanisms are concealed or made to resemble some harmless object th surroundings will be disturbed as little as possible and l signs of preparation are concealed or removed bconstricted localities the more constricted the site i n which booby trap is laid the more chance there is of it being actuated and the greater the difficulty of detect ion and clearance any form of defile is therefore suitable sit for booby traps cconcentration of booby traps booby traps are lai d whenever possible in concentrations to reduce the chance s of detecting them all without actuating some dumm ies are used freelybgl320010fp001 255ddouble bluff an obvious booby traps may be used to mask nearby wellconcealed booby trap

positions might indicate the presence of booby trap and da thorough understanding of the ways booby traps can be actuated assists in locating them 12vigilance there is guarantee that any particular square metre of ground any single room or any piece of jettiso ned equipment in territory recently abandoned by the enemy is fr ee of booby traps even international conventions for the conduct of war may be disregarded by an unscrupulous and desperate opponent an d instances ve been recorded of booby trapped dead and wounded personnel continual vigilance is vital and shall become sec ond nature 13likely locations since there is limit to the resources f time labour and material that the enemy can devote to b ooby trapping it is probable that his main effort will be made in places where the greatest number of casualties is likely to res ult the principles governing the selection of sites were detailed i n paragraphs 10 and 11 arecently occupied areas when following retreatin g opponent

2planning of minefields is done in accordance with th policies established by the highest operational commander the policy at each level of command must be consistent with t he overall concept of operations probable future tasks and availabl resources consequently the emplacement of certain types f minefields and mines is controlled at various level s of command 3subject to restrictions imposed by higher commanders subordinate commanders are normally permitted to use mines and minefields within their available resources for their own loca l protection to strengthen defensive positions and to disrupt or delay enemy movement 4the highest operational commander will set policies for atypes of mine and fuses permitted buse of antidisturbance devicesbgl320010fp001 312cminefield

available to prepare obstacles during defensiv operations will have considerable influence on the size of min efields and mines employed whether the mines are emplaced be fore or on contact with enemy f orces will depend on the tactical situation and the degree of mobility the commander requires f or his plan 9both placed and scatterable mines will be employe d extensively and used aas an economy

planning will always consider the mission own capabi lities terrain weather and enemy capabilities 2tactical objectives the tactical objective of the minefield will determine its type and size for

are essential i f the operation is to be completed successfully with minimum f casualties two important points to be observed ar areconnaissance thorough reconnaissance is essential and bcommand and control some noise is inevitable an d therefore the chances of laying the mines without enem interference are slim protection troops shall be provide d so that the troops who are laying the mines will have to fight only as last resort the command and control f the protection troops and those laying the mines shall be established prior to the commencement of mine laying t ensure contr olled and coordinated response in the event of an enemy attack bgl320010fp001 421section 2 classification of minefields general 1minefields are composed of antitank mines antipersonne l mines or mixture of the two they can be laid where nat ural obstacle exists or to reinforce other obstacles in the latt er case they can increase the delaying effect of t he existing obstacle or in conjunction with demolitions hinder repair work they are sited in accordance with the tactical plan types of minefields 2 the four types of minefields are aprotective minefield employed to assist the unit in it s local closein protection protective minefields consis t of mines without antidisturbance devices placed mines ar usually surfacelaid but may be buried if time permits protective minefields shall be removed when the unit leave s the position if this is not possible the unit comman der must ensure it is reported recorded and marked btactical minefield which is part of formation barrie r plan and which is laid to delay channel or break up n enemy advance all types of mines and antidisturbanc devices may be used most tactical minefields ar patternlaid either by hand or mechanically and may b surface laid or buried sensors trip flares and othe r warning devices may be incorporated into the minefield the recommended minimum depth of tactical minefield is 400 m cnuisance minefield laid to delay and disorganize th enemy and to hinder enemy use of an area or route l types of mines may be empl oyed nuisance minefields arebgl320010fp001 422seldom covered by observation or fire therefore i f authorized maximum use shall be made of antidisturbance devices and booby traps because surprise enhances th effects of nuisance minefields good camouflage an d concealme nt is required and consequently they are usually randomly laid to take full advantage of the concealmen t offered by selected site and dphoney an area free of live mines used to simulate minefield or section of minefield with the object f deceiving the enemy phoney minefield resembles s closely as po ssible an actual minefield the earth may be disturbed to simulate buried mines but care must be take n to ensure that the minefield is not too obvious live mines may be used however mines similar in all othe r respects to the live mine may be emplaced eg drill r practice mines the minefie ld will be covered by the same degree of fire as that provided for the minefield simula ted it is the practice of some countries to include at least one live mine in phoney minefield responsibilities 3the responsibilities for ordering siting and layin g minefield s are shown in the table at fig 421 however laying and siting authorization may be delegated down to the tactical commande r who must cover

mixed minefield which contains both pers and t mines 6tactical minefields may also be classified according t stopping power the stopping power of minefield is meas ure of its effectiveness in stopping enemy vehicles expressed as percentage the stopping power is determined by number f factors including the types of mines employed minefield d ensity and the presence of breaching equipment on the enemy vehi cles stopping power is fully explained in bgl320010fp002 engineer field manual volume 10 mines and booby t raps part 2 engineers and assault pioneers siting 7the tactical commander plans the detailed siting of th minefield the liaison between units in order to integrate th minefield is the responsibility of the officer in charge of laying the minefield reporting and recording 8any unit laying mines is responsible for the reporting recording and marking the minefield unless ci rcumstances preclude it detailed description of the various reports and r ecords is found in chapter 5 inspection 9units are responsible for the periodic inspection f minefield s in their area to determine if there has been any nemy interference with the minefield these inspections which nee d only be visual are independent of technical inspec tions which are an engineer responsibility minefields as well as th eir perimete r marking fences may be damaged by shellfire enemy actionbgl320010fp001 425426animals or weather units shall report any enemy activity and any damage to minefields and will repair perimeter mark ing and fencing in their area handover 10when one unit takes over responsibility of an area fro m another unit it is important in order to avoid ca sualties to our own troops that minefields of all types be handed over properl the location of the minefields perimeter fences and lanes is t be made well known to the incoming unit in static conditions when tim is available proper handover can be best done by representatives of both units visiting every minefield in the area to which acces s can be obtained handovers will normally be effected between incoming and outgoing formations with engineer assi stance 11a complete handover checklist is at annex minefiel d records will be transferred when the relief is effe ctedbgl320010fp001 431section 3 composition of minefields general 1the composition of minefield is dependent upon th terrain the time avail able for work and the types and quantities of mines that have been allocated 2in terms of laying technique minefields may be pattern laid or random laid 3minefield composition may vary depending on the layin g nation it is important to be aware of cf minefield pattern s and also those of other nations which may be encountered in the handover of obstacles random laying 4random laying may be used for protective or nuisanc minefields random laying is suitable only for mining small reas with limited number of mines 5mines are sited on likely enemy foot and vehicl approaches keeping in mind normal siting pr inciples concealment cover by fire and observation etc mines can be surfa celaid r buried if time and ground permit 6the laying unit will ways remember they may have to lift the mines or pass on complete details to receiving u nit accurate recording is therefore essential pattern laying 7pattern laying drills by hand or mechanically are used for tactical minefields and occasionally protective minefields if time and resources permit for protectiv minefields the laying is donebgl320010fp001 432by the unit in place with advice and supervision from gineers or assault pioneers 8minefields are laid in pattern to pr oduce better obstacle ie greater stopping power than random laying and to be located and lifted quicker this method is best suited to mining large areas measurements 9metres are used to measure distances in minefield canadian practice for manual laying is to use paces which ar converted to metres other obstacles 10antitank ditches wire obstacles log and post obstacles etc shall be included when time permits in minefield these obstacles will dramatically increase the effectiveness of minefield mine rows and strips 11a mine row is row of mines laid in straight line or in series of straight line segments the mines are spaced ccording to the design of the minefield spacing between mines may va ry from row to row but must be the same within part icular row 12a mine strip consists of two parallel mine rows laid three metres to each side of the strip centreline the mine s in the two rows are staggered and the distance between individual mine s is dependent on the type of mines laid spac ing between mines may vary from strip to strip but must be the same within partic ular strip 13one or more rows andor strips are used to make minefield individual mine rows or strips are not usually laid entirel straight nor parallel to each other they change direction to produce an effective minefield in depthbgl320010fp001 433fig 431 mine cluster mine clusters 14a mine cluster is small group of mines consisting of one central mine at or pers and up to four pers mines place d within semicircle of two metres from the central mine 15clusters may be used instead of individual mines to for m strips 16mine clusters are not used by the canadian forces landmarks 17a landmark is natural artificial feature that can be accurately determined on the ground from grid reference landmark s are used in siting and recording minefields and ar identified by t hree two foot pickets driven flush to the ground in triangular pattern turning points and end points 18a turning point is point on the centreline of mine row or strip where t he row or strip changes direction and are indicated by turning point marker identified by two foot pick et driven flush to the groundbgl320010fp001 43419end points markers are located at the beginning and end of mine strip or mine row they are indicated by an end p oint marker identified by two f oot picket driven flush to the ground irregular outer edge 20an irregular outer edge is short mine row or strip laid in an irregular manner in front of the first row of the minefield within th fence in order to deceive the enemy as to the type or extent of th minefield generally the irregular outer edge will only be used in minefields with buried mines 21the canadian forces do not use irregular outer edge sbgl320010fp001 441section 4 minefield lanes and gaps general 1general unmined lanes and gaps are left or breache d through minefield to provide safe passage for patrols or other troops eith er on foot or with vehicles or so that movement can be conducted safely 2planning minefield lanes and gaps are sited before min laying begins there will always be sufficient of each to nsure that if some of them become known to th enemy and have to be closed an adequate number remain 3control the siting of minefield lanes and gaps is controlle d at the highest practicable level minefield gaps part icularly must b sited so that they conform to any possible withdrawal route of forward friendly units and to the formation counter attack plan minefield patrol lanes 4layout minefield patro l lane is normally 1 m wide it is not straight throughout its length but zigzags throug h the minefield the centreline is marked out with tape cable or cord before mining begins mines are not laid within 1 m of t he centreline of the patrol lane the centreline is marked s described in paragraph 5 below before the white tape is lai d out and the placing of mines starts 5marking minefield patrol lanes will always be marked i n forward minefields it is important to give indication t the enem that lane exists the standard marking is leng th of signal cable or cord along the centreline fastened to spikes dri ven flush wit h the ground the ends of the centreline are marked by lane marker s in the rear perimeter fencesbgl320010fp001 4426concealment minefield patrol lane itself requires n concealment it becomes known to the enemy only throug h continued use there is an advantage in having many lanes so tha t one patrol lane is put to exces sive use also with many lanes it does not matter if one is discov ered by the enemy and has to be closed the unit responsible for the minefield patrol lan shall be prepared to close it by removing the marking and adding the mines minefield lanes 7layout minefield lane is normally 8 m wide it is s straight as possible and runs from the rear perimeter fence to the forward fence it is marked as described in paragraph 8 bel ow before the laying of mines starts mines are not laid within 2 m of the lane only lanes that are required will be used lanes that are not required re marked for future use but will not be signed unt il opened 8marking minefield lanes will always be marked but th method of marking varies according to the tactical situat ion the marking is constructed in sequence from initial marking t immediate marking and finally to full marking as operations develop in accordance with stanag 2889 or qstag 742 marking f hazardous areas and routes through them the marking itself is described as follows aa fence similar to the perimeter fence and bred and white pointed markers are fixed to alternate picket s in the fence with the white point toward the lane cgreen and white lights are fixed to the markers at night as follows 1at the entrance and exit two green lights fixed in th centre of the markers and 2in the lane one white light fixed on the top of th markerbgl320010fp001 443fig 441 lane and gap markers 9concealment like the patr ol lane the minefield lane itself requires concealment it becomes known to the enemy onl through c ontinued use there is therefore an advantage in h aving many lanes so that one lane is put to excessive use also with plenty of lanes it does not matter if one is discovered b the enemy and has to be sealed the unit responsible f or the minefield must always hold stock of mines and be prepared to seal any lan on short notice by completing the mine rowsbgl320010fp001 444minefield gaps 10layout the layout is similar to lanes however gaps ar normally minimum of 100 metres wide 11marking until such time as minefield gap is to be used fo r tactical movement marking is needed only for recording purposes when gap is required for tactical movement it must be fu lly marked throughout its length this is done by engineers using lane marking stores sometimes it may be desirable to move for ces through gap before it has been fully marked howeve r reconnaissance elements or engineers will mark the corner points of the gap 12concealment it is important that the location of gaps t be discovered by the enemy and that the gaps close ly resemble the rest of the minefield for this reason gaps are t fully marked until required the enclosed ground should be disturbed to the sa extent with tracks to represent the passage of mine carryi ng vehicles and occasional signs of diggings or scattered spoi l mine crates and other suitable evidence decoys may be emplaced so tha t enemy sensors cannot locate the gap by lack of si gnature recording 13minefield lanes or gaps shall be recorded it is ver important that full particulars are entered and that lanes nd gaps are recorded accurately see chapter 5 for more detail on recording methods of lane and gap closure 14if minefield lane is ordered by tactical commander the unit responsible for closing the lane and the means to be used will be designated lanes and gaps can be closed for number f reasons for example awhen lane has been discovered by the enemy and must b closed to prevent infiltration bwhen friendly troops forward of the minefield have bee nbgl320010fp001 445446withdrawn and the obstacle is to be closed and cprior to withdrawal from the position 15lanes and gaps are normally closed by one of the methods given below acompletion of mine rows this applies par ticularly to lanes and gaps the location for the mines required to comp lete the mine rows across the lanes are marked the mine s necessary to complete row are positioned on the left f the lane or gap bcratering cratering may be required to close roads throug h minefield this task is performed by engineers r assault pioneers only and cscatterable mines use of scatterable mines are th preferred method of closing minefield gaps their use t close lanes will be limited by the accuracy of the delive ry means 16after closure the minefield record will be updatedbgl320010fp001 451section 5 marking minefield general principles 1minefields are usually marked to avoid casualties to friendly troops marking will not be allowed to benefit the enemy w hen they attack and the beginning of the minefield from t he enemy point of view will therefore be concealed in order to deceive them 2the principles to be observed in marking minefields are aminefields will be marked with perimeter fence unles s otherwise ordered existing fences may be used wher suitable bthe fence will not conform to the shape of the minefie ld nor give away its extent it will always enclose som unmined ground cthe fence on the enemy side will not be obvious but mus t be visible to those who know its approxi mate position and dall fences existing or emplaced are to be marked wit h signs to show their nature standard perimeter marking fence 3siting the perimeter fence is not sited at constan t distance from the nearest mines and it does not run on the same bearing as the outer mine rows rather it is placed at v arying angles to the mine rows thus making it more difficult fo r the enemy to locate the actual minefield the rules for the sta ndard forms of fences are given below 4construction the fence consists of single strand of wire approximately wai sthigh suspended on pickets about 15 m apartbgl320010fp001 452and minimum of 15 m from the nearest mine later on it may be desirable to increase the number of pickets signs and wires to improve the fence 5marking fences on all sides are marked with red triangula r mine signs hung on the wire between fence pickets with the word mines written in white and displayed on the out side of the fence the mine signs shall be spaced at intervals not ex ceeding 50 m other signs such as boards marked dang er mines may also be erected on the perimeter fence for greater safety of our ow n troops and civilian population such additional notices are not compulsory and their absence does not mean the ground i s unmined as discussed in chapter 4 section 4 par agraph 8 lane s and gaps through minefields are fenced and marked as per th perimeter of minefield additional safe lane markers identify th lane or gap to traffic erection of fences 6for protective minefield the fence is erected in clockwise manner starting on the near left hand corner leavi ng gap in the near side fence until the mining is completed it is important that the fencing party keep ahead of the leading ning party and that one attempts to move back through any part of the minefield where mines have been laid if for any rea the laying party is withdrawn during the laying of minefiel d the perimeter fence will be completed and then reopened when mine laying restartsbgl320010fp001 461section 6 inspection and maintenance requirement 1the requirement for periodic inspections of minefields wa s introduced in section 2 these inspections are re quired to ensure that the minefields and the perimeter marking fences ve not been altered or damaged responsibility 2units are responsible for the inspection and maintenanc of protective minefields in their defended area other minefields are inspected as ordered by for mation hq technical inspections are done by an engineer officer or ncm minefields 3units shall carry out visual inspections of minefields i n their area to ensure that the enemy has not been picking up or neutralizing the mines the frequency of these inspections wil l depend on the proximity of the enemy and his activi ties fences 4perimeter fences will be inspected for damage by sh ellfire enemy action animals or weather so that repairs can be carried out immediately additional fence pickets are often required sinc only the minimum number were used in the first instance these inspectio ns shall be carried out daily where damage is likely or once every three days in more remote areasbgl320010fp001 462lanes and gaps 5minefield lanes and gaps shall be inspected frequently care being taken not to disclose them to the opposing forc through frequent use 6in cases where lane or gap is to support movement of large number of vehicles maintenance of the track or road will be included in the planning technical inspections 7technical inspectio ns are necessary to ensure minefield is still effective the functi oning of buried mines can be affected by amoisture entering into the fuze or body of the mine wher it can reduce the explosive power corrode metal parts or freeze this action can be further aggravated by loca l factors such as soil acidity or climatic conditions bfrost action following flooding can cause the mine t subside or be pushed up and cmechanical obs tructions caused by insects or vegetation 7technical inspections are conducted regularly on minefield s to assess their effectiveness these inspections will be conducte d at least every three months and more frequently when we ather conditions are severe eg flooding or alternating periods f freezing and thawing the minefield record shall be availa ble to the inspecting party 8when minefield falls below the required effectiveness decision will be required regarding the laying of additiona l minesbgl320010fp001 4a1annex handovertakeover checklist 1when handing over minefield the passage of informatio n in conjunction with the

when ying protective minefieldbgl320010fp001 513514laying rates 3laying mines it is impossible to quote fi rm times for laying protective minefields as they vary widely with the circumstances of each case the estimates below give some idea of the times l ikely to be required for pattern laying in average conditio ns rando m laying requires more time to site each mine 4buried mines platoon sized element working by da without interference will lay an average of a150 pers blast mines per hour c3a1a2 b40 pers fragmentation mines per hour m16a1 and c40 at mines per hour m21 or dm21 these laying rates assume the mines are ready for emplacement an d they are handcarried more than 200 m rates for mini ng at night will normally be half the daylight laying rat 5surface laid mines similar element under the sam circumstances will be able to lay on the surface a80 pers fragmentation mines per hour m16a1 b40 pers fragmentation mines per hour m18a1 c40 offroute at mines per hour c14 and d80 at mines per hour m21 or dm21 bgl320010fp001 521section 2 emplacing individual mines general 1mines shall be laid so that athe target that they are designed to stop can exert th necessary pressure to actuate the mine bthe mine is not readily discovered by the opposing for ce this is usually done by concealing the mine but care i s required to ensure that the concealment lows the mine to function properly and cthe individual mines are adequately spaced from adjacen t mines to prevent sympathetic detonation 2mines may be laid on the surface or buried surface laid mines 3many tripwire actuated mines are surfac elaid while some pressureactuated mines may be either surfacelaid or buried mines are generally surfacelaid when there is insufficien t time available to bury them or in the case of protective minefields whe n the mines re to be recovered by the unit laying them to b effective surfacelaid mines will be well camouflaged to prev ent easy detection and lifting dense ground cover is ther efore preferable the arming procedures are the same for mines buri ed or laid on the surface laying buried mines 4in order to determine the correct depth and method f burying mine it is necessary to consider the way in whi ch the firing mechanism is actuated some mines use small device onbgl320010fp001 522fig 521 burying at mines top of the mine in the form of prongs this is common meth od used for pers mines ther mines are actuated by forcing down the lid or pressure plate many at mines are of th is type 5mines with prongs are best sunk flush with the ground s that only the tips of the prongs are exposed to contact the targ et this ensures that the mine is held firmly upright and that t he contact exerts direct do wnward pressure rather than sideways thrust mine buried in this way is protected from damage and is very difficult to see if it is buried more deeply it b ecomes unreliable as th covering of soil may prevent the mine from being actuated by the target 6mines with pressure plates can still function whe n completely buried as long as the cushion of earth above them is t too thick at mines shall normally be buried with the top of the mine 50mm below ground level if the hole is too small the weigh t of the vehicle may be supported by shoulder of th hole and thus fail to actuate the mine this bridging action can be avoided b digging the hole wider than the minebgl320010fp001 5237mines must be laid on firm base so that the pressure f the wheel or track does not press the whole mine down withou t actuating it the bottom of the hole will if necessary be made firm by tamping it down before the mine is placed 8to allow for the loose earth sinking due to rain etc an additional covering of earth normally sod approximately 40m m thick is placed over the mine to form slight moun d with the sides of the hole well sloped care is to be taken tha t the mound blends with the surrounding ground and is as inconspicuous as po ssible fig 521 shows the principles described above applied to the layin g of an antitank mine 9to prepare hole for pressureactuated antitank nes aplace the mine on the ground busing shovel cut the ground approximately 030 m around the mine at 45 degree angle to the depth of th blade cset the mine aside droll the turf back as carefully as possible toward the l ikely direction of the approach for an opposing force keeping th turf attached escrape the soil out of the hole to accept the mine an d dispose of excess soil by spreading it over wide area fif required tamp the bottom of the hole or install fi rm base as per paragraph 7 and fig 521 gplace the mine in the hole and fillin around it w ith spoil harm the mine as directed and jreplace the turf and camouflagebgl320010fp001 524unfavourable ground conditions 10on very soft ground such s deep mud or in marshy areas the unders ide of the mine may not be large enough to support the pressure needed for actuation under these conditions foundatio n for the mine will be construct ed of rocks planks saplings or other materials packing crates for the mines also provide suitabl material for this purpose 11mine laying in snow covered areas is affe cted by the depth of snow mines shall be buried with the pressure plate at the surface when the depth of snow is less than 100mm for sno w depths of 100 to 300mm the mines shall be laid on the sur face for deeper snow the mines shall be supported on sandbags or planks so that the tops of the mines are within 100mm of the sno w surface 12if mines laid on frozen marshy ground are intended t remain during thawing period they shall be supported s for mines laid during the summer 13in wet weather or in snow covered terrain mines can b placed in waterproofed bags to decrease the chance of wat er entering the mine and causing malfunctions due to rusting r freezing coating seams and joints on the mine body with grease prior to laying also helps camouflage 14the purpose of minefield camouflage is to increase th effectiveness of the minefield this is accomplished in the case of nuisance minefields by surprising the enemy and by hinderin g efforts to define and bypass the minefield in all minefi elds breaching is made more difficult by denying the enemy knowledge of the minefield pattern the location of gaps or lan and mos t importantly the location of individual mines all mines whet her surfacelaid or buried shall be camouflaged to the grea test extent possiblebgl320010fp001 52552615burial provides the best camouflage the turf shall be ro lled back so that it can be replaced over the mine care must be taken that the hump created by the replac ed turf is not too conspicuous excess soil from the hole is disposed by spreading over it wide area additional grass and twigs may be added to complete th camouflage 16mines or fuzes on or above ground shall also b camouflaged only lightweight material shall be used t camouflage pers mines in order not to reduce the effectiven ess of the mine care must be taken that the camouflage material doe s not cause premature actuation or interfere with the fu nctioning of the mine 17white coloured mines may be used on snow covered terrain but are very conspicuous when th snow melts in general mines buried in the snow and camouflaged with vegetation are pre ferable 18the obliteration of tracks in s now covered or soft terrain is impossible an area may be covered with tracks to hide th minefield or track may be laid across the area prior to min ing in an attempt to deceive the enemy into thinking the r oute is open bgl320010fp001 531section 3 protective minefield laying conduct 1like all obstacles thorough r econnaissance is required to maximize the effectiveness of protective minefield and ensure th safety of the laying parties work will normally begi n on protective minefield until all trenches have been sited coordination done with flanking units and areas of responsibilit confirmed 2random mine laying of protective minefields at night shal l be restricted to command actuated mines because of si ghting recording and rec overy difficulties if other mines are to be laid at night they shall be surface laid in ro pattern drills 3random laying protective minefields are laid randoml when time is of the essence and the position is only going to be occupied for short period of time mines are normally surface lai d but they may be buried there is precise drill for random laying but the following apply apersonnel laying mines shall be fully instructed on the ai m to be achieved in each case bthe position and type of each mine on the ground is to b clearly marked before laying begins cpersonnel laying mines may work individually or in pairs dorders to each pair will specify clearly the route to b followed normally out and

ebgl320010fp001 532laying starts to lay tapes to mark safe routes the tape s are recovered by the laying party when finally leaving each site ethe distance between each laying party if possible is neve r less than 20 m fno trip wire shall be emplaced within 2 m of any other trip wire or adjacent pers mine gwhen antidisturbance devices or trip wires are employe d and soldiers are working in pairs one of the pair wil l withdraw out of the minefield before the mine is armed an d hmines are not armed until the order to do so is give n by the officer or nco in charge 4row pattern the principle method of laying protectiv minefield while in defensive position is by simple row pattern the laying unit will use simple rows of mines spaced m inimum interval of 6 m between mines the mine spacing within row is the same for the entire row there will be at least 8 m be tween rows of at mines and 15 m between an at mine row and an pers mine row trip wire shall be emplaced within 2 m of any other trip wire or adjacent pers mine the procedure for row pattern protective mining is as follows aprior to laying 1select reference points landmarks bearings 2select routes to and from the

fencing and marking is completed i n accordance with chapter 4 and dthe number of mines bearings distances and landmark s are recorded on the cf947 protective minefield record s detailed in section 5 of this chapter 5an alternative means of spacing the mines is to use measured piece of cordage with the mine spacing indicated b knots or tape this cordage is laid along the preselec ted bearin g then the mines are placed at the indicated marksbgl320010fp001 541section 4 reporting minefield reports 1general minefield reports are needed to avoid casualties t our own troops while knowledge f the existence and position of mines will be denied to the enemy as far as possible our own troops must have sufficient information to permit the saf movement of patrols and deployment of troops and ve hicles 2the primary reasons for reporting minefields is to ensu re current and accurate recording of minefield locations on t he operational maps of all units and hqs concerned fo r this purpose simple tactical reports are sufficient normal staff proc edures ensure that the information reaches everyone concerned i n particular the engineer hq at each level will be informed of all mining undertaken by other arms units 3responsibilities units requesting ordering laying an d recording minefields are required to make reports at various stages these reports are used for conventional and scatterable minefields the detailed message formats and the reporting procedu res are found in bgl303002fpz02 operational staff procedure s field message formats commanders authorized to order mine laying wil l report their intention to lay report of intent minefi eld to thei r next higher headquarters by the fastest secure means available report of completion usually oral will be forwarde d by

recording minefield records 1a minefield record is required for each minefield regardless of type the record is an important document in that it is used to locate and lift minefields there are two types of minefield records used by the canadian forces acf 947 protective minefield record and bcf 1275 minefield record 2the cf 947 protective minefield record is used by l arms when recording the location and composition of prote ctive minefields the cf 1275 minefield record is used by enginee rs and assault pioneer when recording all minefields xcept protective minefields protective minefield

mo dern battlefield that it is essential that all arms units take some resp onsibility fo r mine countermeasures it is imperative that all personnel recogniz likely locations and they be constantly on the lookout f or mines and booby traps 2mines the main responsibility for minefield clearance r ests with engineers and assault pioneers other arms units are required to have personnel specially trained for and assigned to detecting locating and clearing pers and at mines 3booby traps booby trap clear ance will only be conducted by engineers and assault pioneers however all fiel d unit personne l are required to be aware of the threat and to know how booby traps are detected marked and reported reconnaissance 4the engineer commander requires as much information s possible about the mined area if he is to advise the commander an d assist in planning breaching operation manoeuvre unit s are responsible for finding bypass around the obstacle and in th process will contribute to

informatio n to be obtained 8complete reconnaissance details are in bgl320010fp 002 engineer field manual volume 10 mines and booby traps part 2 engineers and assault pioneerbgl320010fp001 621section 2 detection intelligence 1successful offensive mine countermeasures are depe ndant on good intelligence over period of time good intelligenc will establish enemy mine warfare tactics and preferences infor mation judged against this intelligence form s the basis of selecting targets and approaches for offensive action 2valuable information abou t minefields and booby trap sites can often be obtained from prisoners of war particularly engineer prisoners local inhabitants may also have valuable informat ion about enemy mining activity all prisoners are evacuated to the rear but formation staffs will be able to have certain enemy personnel interrogated about various operational ac tivities including mining and booby traps 3additional information can be determined from the followin g sources apersonnel and vehicle casualties bpatrols cair photographs dinjuries to livestock or lack of livestock in rura l areas efriendly ground observations and fair reconnaissancebgl320010fp001 622current methods of mine detection 4there are five main methods which can be used for min detection avisual identification bmanual feeling with the hands followed by proddin g cmechanical really method of mine breaching an d clearance because mine detection is only verified by min detonation rollers and ploughs are normally designed s combat systems suitable for getting combat vehicles which have specific design characteristics ie low groun d pressure across obstacles to the objective and may t detect the presence of mines that would threaten vehicle s with greater ground pressures ie logistic wheele d vehicles delectronic detectors and eanimals 5visual method experience has shown that careful an d intelligent observation by the individual soldier often discloses the location of mine or booby trap visual alertness must ne ver be relaxed because of the presence of equipment detectors or l ocators it is imperative that all personnel know how to find pers mines 6manual method prodding is slow and labourious proces s but it is the only effective capable of locating all types of mines buried at normal depths in all climatic conditions it is therefore th standard method of detecting at mines when the presence f pers mines is suspected care must be taken to ensure th prodder does not actuate them first pers mines must be felt for with the hands and trip wire feelers trip wir feelers are made from piece of medium gauge wire of about one metre long an d stiff enough not to be bent readily or from thin s tick cut from abgl320010fp001 623hedge any mines found are either neutralized or marked nd avoided 7mechanical methods rollers ploughs and flails may b employed as mechanical detection systems 8electronic detectors most electronic detectors indicate th presence of metal objects in the ground their use as min detectors enables ground to be searched more rapidly than b prodding the use of metal is however becoming more limited with the introduct ion of nonmetallic mines few mines are completel nonmetallic but many have only small amount of metal in their fuzes the mine detector does not easily distinguished meta l in such small quantities from other small metallic objects likely to be present in the ground particularly on battlefield the u of detectors is therefore confined to following prodders to sear ch for metallic mines which are buried too deep and for any shall ow metallic mines they may have missed the current canadian mine detector is covered in annex b to this chapter 9animals animals particularly dogs can be trained t operate with humans to detect mines buried at normal depths they have their limitations and are to be regarded as s ubsidiary rather than main method of detection these limitations include aunavoidable limitations 1tiredness of d og or handler this can be minimized by resting the dogs at intervals during the task an d ensuring that the team is not kept waiting before r after tasking dog can effectively search for per iods of up to two hours 2sickness or injury of dog or handler 3inexplicable off day in dog 4distractions other dogs other animals f ood or peoplebgl320010fp001 624 5weather excessive wet heat or cold and 6darkness the handlers reduced ability to read his dog even in artificial light bavoidable limitations 1excessive movement or disturbance in or search area 2danger of setting off booby traps which can b minimized by systematic use of dogs and the visua l alertness of the handler 10the true value of animals is their ability to detect n on metallic mines and therefore they can be employed as part of mine clearance system manual mechanical electronic and animals to counter the mine threat in theatre where the mine threat includes at pers metallic and nonmetallic min bgl320010fp001 631section 3 minefield breaching and clearance of mines general 1there are three b asic methods of breaching minefields and clearing mines amanual bwith explosives and cby mechanical means 2manual manual breaching and clearance is done by visuall and physically with hands and prodders searching the rea manual techniques involve greater degree of risk due to the possible existence of antidisturbance devices and lack of protectio n from enemy fire modern surveillance devices have made the silen t hand brea ch risky operation manual breaching and clearan ce is an enginee r and assault pioneer responsibility except in the lifting of protective minefields 3explosives explosive clearance involves the destruction of mines insitu with small explosive charge or in the case of minefield breach by the use of an explosive device like bangalor torpedo or an explosive line charge 4mechanical means there are different means of breac hing and clearing minefields mechanically including pl oughs rollers an d flails these equipments displace neutralize or ctuate the minebgl320010fp001 632choice of method 5none of the bove methods are guaranteed to clear 100 of the mines in given area the choice of method depends on athe degree of opposition bthe nature of the ground cthe presence of physical obstacles dthe availability of equipment ethe importance of the site fthe tactical requirements of the situation gthe types of mines and the presence of antidisturbanc devices and hthe state of training and experience of the breaching or clearance party 6commanders ordering minefield breaching or clearance shal l appreciate the local situation and will clearly defin the degree of damage that is acceptable and amount of risk that i s justifiable ie whether mines are to be pulled or blown in place neutralize d by hand or merely marked and left manual breaching and clearance 7in case where manoeuver unit s are required to conduct manual breach or cleara nce of their own protective minefields the task shall be conducted as follows aneutralize the mines in accordance the procedures i n chapter 5 annexes and b andbgl320010fp001 633bdisarm is the mines in accordance procedures in chapter 5 annexes and b 8unknown mines or fuzes if an unknown type of mine r fuze is found during breaching or clea rance operations the options for manoeuver units are aif qualified destroy it in place using small explos ive charge or bmark the mine and report it immediately so that it can be investigated by engineers or assault pioneers explosive breaching and clearance 9general explosives can be used to explode individual mine s or mechanisms insitu or can be used to clear lan through mined areas the use of explosives to detonate individual mines or mechanisms is restricted to qualified personnel 10procedure small charge is placed as close as possible to the mine without touching it and detonated from safe dist ance thus exploding the mine these charges can be initi ated individuall or on ring main destroying more than one mine at time mechanical breaching and clearance 11general mechanical means of breaching include ploughs rollers and flails which are employed in accordance with bgl320 010ft002 engineer fi eld manual volume 10 mines and booby traps part 2 engineers and assault pioneers and bgl305 001ft001 armoured regiment in battle the full d etails of these are beyond the scope of this chapter but are summar ized below 12ploughs tanks can be fitted with plough attachmen t which ploughs through the ground in front of each track it lifts an mines in its path and pushes them to one side clear of the t racks if tank is fitted with the plough attachment its mo bility is restricted when ploughi ng and crossing hard ground is slow whichbgl320010fp001 634lengthens t he time the tank is exposed to enemy fire the plo ugh follows the terrain but it is unlikely to be effective in close country where there are roots and boulders or where there are num erous ditches if the leading tank only is fitted with ploughs t he following tanks must keep in exactly the same track which i s difficult under operational conditions otherwise the follo wing tanks may actuate mines pushed to one side by the plough as the plough covers only the line of the tracks the tank could also be immobilized by full width attack mines 13rollers tanks can also be fitted with heavy rollers which cover the ground in front of each track and actuate single pressure mines these rollers can be defeated by mines with double impuls fuses or full width attack mines if every tank were fitt ed with rollers then an attack through minefield could be mounted on broad front but the mobility of the tank is restricted when fitte d with rollers if only proportion of tanks have rollers the n the other tanks must cross the minefield by following exactly in the tracks of the leading tank this is technically not difficult but may be hazardous particularly if under direct fire and att empting t cross as fast as poss ible there is good chance that following tank will actuate mine which has not been covered by the roller 14flails proportion of tanks may be fitted with flail which is high speed rotating drum the width of the tan k with lengths of heavy chain attached the flail poses si milar restric tions to the mobility f the breaching tank described above but has the advantage of being able to actuate all mines over the full t ank width bgl320010fp001 641section 4 movement in minefield general 1personnel may find themselves in minefield under variet of circumstances known minefields will be the subject of formal minefield breaching and mine clearance operations however troops may easily find themselves in hitherto unknown neglec ted or scattered enemy and friendly force minefields to make ma tters worse forward minefields will very likely be covered by enemy fire survival and mission success will depend on individual tea m and unit training troops in contact 2manoeuvre forces manoeuvre troops may encounter mine s in the attack and in the defence to attempt to bull out of live minefield could be disastrous to remain in place even for short time might prevent mine casualties but it may well invi enemy fire unit mission and tasks and enemy activity particularly in the light of technical intelligence will determine subseque nt actions stopping in place or withdrawal may not be an option unit sops will deal with these situations and unit training shall exercise personnel in the various minefield drills 3patrols patrol preparation will include drills on encounte r ing mines deciding factor will be if the patrol is under fire r not another important factor will be the element of surprise t hat may have been lost unit training and sops will cater to these situation s troops not in contactbgl320010fp001 6424sandi personnel on resupply repair or recovery task s may also find themselves in minefield for troops n ot in contac t with the enemy the prescribed drill is sandi stop assess note drawback and inform 5stop adismounted troops immediately stand still and order all to halt and stand still this is particularly important if membe r of the group has just become mine casualty becaus of the natural tendency to rush to the casualty bmounted troops stop the vehicle or order the vehicle t halt initially stay in the vehicle 6assess visually search the area for trip wires expose d mines or signs of mining assess the ground to determine wh at route will be followed to drawback or w ithdraw from the hazardous

circustances otherwise require an immediate withdraw this may involve prodding path one metre wide to safebgl320010fp001 643area where there is obvious threat the drawbac k procedure involves the repetition of the following drills until clear of the area 1look for trip wires mines or indicators 2check for trip wires using the c7 rifle cleaning rod as trip wire feeler held gently between thumb and fi rst finger slowly push the rod forward at ground level supported by the other hand then slowly r aise the rod to level well above the head when standing repea t the procedure on the left side centre and right side f the one metre path to be cleared then holding the rod vertically slowly sweep the rod accross the one metre path to be cleared this procedure will ensure th detection of any trip wires running either parallel to r across the path to be cleared if trip wire i s encountered do not attempt to clear it clear pat h along the trip wire to one end or to location where it can be safely crossed and then contin ue clearing path to the desired destination in certain cases it may b necessary to select another drawback route if th hazard presented by trip wires is too great physically check for trip wires after loo king some trip wires are so thin they are virtually undetectable or may be hidden by vegetation 3feel in either prone or kneeling position gently feel the ground across the one tre path for mine fuzes or tops of mines 4prod see annex to this chapter and most important dont rush it is not worth missing mine for the sake of speed 5 mark if resistance is met by the prodder mark th spot using anything at hand and carefully bypass th area to the left or right mark any suspected m ines and the path to be followed bmounted if an engineer clearance team is not available orbgl320010fp001 644circumstances otherwise require an immediate withdrawal exit the vehicle via the rear or over the roof to the rear don t step down from the side of the vehicle step into th vehicle tracks created by the ve hicle or others in the convoy and withdraw to safety in the vehicle tracks using th dismounted drawback procedure described above any trip wires should have been tripped by the passage of vehicle s but visually search for them anyway the dismounte d drawback procedure is used because mines have been know n not to function in spite of having been driven over by vehicles if there are n vehicle tracks because the road is hard packed then withdraw on the hard packed surfac avoiding any soft disturbed damaged or freshly repaire d areas mark the withdrawal path as best as possibl 9inform once clear of the hazardous area sign or mark the approach record the location on the map and report this informatio n to headquarters if mounted approach alert other vehicles b marking the distance to the halt point on the warni ng sign casualty recovery 10often the first indicator of mines will be personnel r vehicle casualty keep in mind that the first reaction is to run to th aid of casualty this urge must be overcome to avoid furt her casualties 11dont panic control the situation aimmediate actions are sandi as described above for l noncasualties in the area maintain at least 20m dista nce between members in group and stay close to the ground continually reassure the casualty that help is coming and to stay as still as possible bclear path to the casualty if not in known safe ar ea start clearing path to the closest known safe area and then to the path being cleared to the casualty cclear an area around the casualty to permit people to move safely around the casualty while administering first aid and tobgl320010fp001 645646verify that the casualty is not lying over top of an other min dnow that it is safe provide first aid eevacuate the casualty along the cleared path fcomplete the reporting process if the casualty had th groups radio communications 12if the casualty is close when the mine strike occurs eg th casualty is in the same vehicle it is possible to administe r first aid immediately because it is safe to approach the casu alty 13remember when in this situation and not under direct r observed fire take your time dont rush since it may caus further casualties whenever possible call for combat engineer and medica l help as soon as possiblebgl320010fp001 651section 5 countering scattered mines and other submunitions general 1scatterable mines are submunition along with bomblets and grenades that are spread by vehicle or aircraft dispensers or dropped over target by missiles rockets or proje ctiles they may be pers antimaterial or at dual purpose chemical incendi ary or high explosive 2these submunitions are very small some function lik bombs exploding on impact some operate like conventional land mines others on hitting the ground eject trip wires ut to six metres from the mine dual purpose submunitions ve shaped charge for penetrating hard targets but may also be used gainst personnel some scatterable mines have magnetic fuzing and are actuated by magnetic signature ot hers have antidisturbance and self destruct fuzing these are area denial weapons an d will invariably be used in combinations of pers and at or anti material 3placed mines are buried or surface laid and camouflage d where possible scatterable mines lan d on the surface and usually can be seen however bush rubble and tall grass may hi scatterable mines as effectively as placed mines furthermore these submuntions may appear attractive and innocent look ing or may resemble the conventional pronged can 4rapid identification of the mine type and prior knowledge f its characteristics are important the most effective tactic to counter the effects of mines delivered on top of unit is directly related to knowledge of the mines themselvesbgl320010fp001 652delayed arming 5all scatterable mines are specifically designed to mini mize the possib ility of premature actuation either in or near the delivery system or upon impact with the ground the mechanisms t provide such safety feature vary from one mine type to nother and may incorporate clockwork mechanisms chemical reac tion with the atmosphere electronics and the like thus man scattered mines are not armed for periods ranging to about f ive minutes after impact this delay may offer an opportunit to redeploy if this is an option it may also be the only occasio n to physically remove the submuntions from the immediate area f vehicles cps trenches routes supply stocks etc mines arming upon impact 6if the scattered mines arm on impact or within second s there will be opportunity to react as described above if the mines are identified as not equipped with antidisturbance dev ices path can be cleared by physically removing mines from t he selected escape route if th unit is equipped with dozer tank or bulldozer and if influence fuzes are not use d such vehicles need only push the mines aside otherwise long sticks or an nonferrous material immediately at hand are used to push th mines aside unknown mines 7when mines of type not previously identified are empl aced upon unit extreme caution is required rapid expedient tests can be conducted on the mines small arms fire and hand grenades ar used to attempt to determine the existence of antidistur bance devices if mines are not easily detonated antidi sturbance devices have probably not been used and it may be possible to remove the mines physically manually or mechanically if small ar ms fire or hand grenades easily actuate the mines this method can be used to clear lane out of the mined areabgl320010fp001 653654submunitions used by allied forces 8the possibility of encountering mines and submunition s delivered by allied units cannot be ruled out nor can the possibility of enemy use of captured stocks training must include appropri ate drills in reactions to mines in our inventorybgl320010fp001 661662section 6 trip wires detection and clearance 1general trip wires may be used with almost any type f mine but they are most commonly used with pers mines and off route at mines they are normally laid at about ankle height wher they are well concealed by long grass or other vegetation in wooded areas trip wires may be used with pers mines fastened to bushes or trees well above g round level where they are likely to have greater effect against passing troops or vehicles when it is known or suspected that trip wires exist they must be located and removed as the countermine operation proceeds 2detection trip wires normally have matt surface and are dark in colour so that they cannot be readily seen even in bright sunlight if it is determined that trip wires exist in an are personnel shall attempt to leave the invested area by withdrawing along their own tracks if in doubt as to the safety of th is escape route trip wire feeler shall be used to check f or trip wir on the path out of the booby trapped area trip wire feeler is about one metre long made either from thin branch or piece of m edium gauge wire stiff enough not to bend readily 3clearance if personnel are qual ified to do so the trip wire mechanism and the mine is to be neutralized if the trip wir is slack or taut the individual traces the wire to both end s having ensured there is contact with ground not previou sly checked for other surfac laid mines or the fuzes or trip wires of buried m ines neutralizes any mech anism found then cuts the wire never pull slack wire or cut any wire taut or slack attempt to examine both ends of any wire before touching it in the case where the individua l is not qualified or confident in the neutralization of th trip wir mechanism it will be left alone marked and reported so tha t an expert can deal with itbgl320010fp001 6a1annex mine prodder and drills 1prodder mine non magnetic the current pattern min prodder is the prodder mine non magneti c nsn 6665998400116 eac 59817 2the prodder consists of central body section of ligh t hollow tubing to wh ich can be screwed at one end point section and at the other pistol grip handle the point is ma of hard n magnetic iconel alloy to prevent detonating magneti cally influenced mines the shape is chosen to prevent blunting and corrosio n which would increase friction the assembled prodder is 1 metre long and weighs 409 grams when it is used kneeling or lying on the ground the body section is omitted and the point is screwe d directly onto the handle when not in use the prodder i s dismantled and the point section is fitted inside the body ction the prodder is carried in webbing frog which can be slung from the web belt 3improvised prodder the prodder is the most efficient and least tiring implement to use occasions will arise whe n it is not available current policy on using ferromagnetic prodder ch as an improvised steel prodder or the bayonet is laid out by the director military engineering d mil as follows ferromagnetic objects should not b used to prod for mines except in an operational emergenc where it is deemed that the risk of personal injur due to accidental detonation is less than th operational risk 4effective prodders can easily be fabricated w hen necessary from wood or plastic rods the essentials are point at one end and hand at the other it can be made to suit the positi on it is to be used inbgl320010fp001 6a25method of using the prodder prodding can be done eithe r standing kneeling or lying on the ground but prodding in t he kneeling or prone position is the most effective the prod der is pushed gently but firmly into the ground at an angle to th horizontal of about 30 prodder must never be jabbed into the ground if it is there is good chance of any mine which i s encountered being detonated if the prodder strikes solid object mine is suspected it shall be firmly impressed on all soldier s engaged in prodding that any relaxation in the method of prodding will lead to casualties 6the correct prodding drill is athe soldier assumes the kneeling or lying position an d visually inspects or in darkness or obscurity feels th ground by hand as far forward as is possible t comfortably reach to locate any small pers mines tri p wires or prongs marks and bypasses or neutralizes an d removes any found bto minimize casual ties if mine is actuated not more than two soldiers will prod side by side to ensure that n ground is missed between the pair of soldiers proddin g together the area that each searches will overlap the start from common boundary and work outwards they keep pace with each other starting new line of prod s together if width of more than two metres is to b searched additional pairs may prod with distance of 2 0 metres between each pair cthe first pair will mark the edges of their cleared rea with mine tape mine tape dispenser s can be attached onto the webbing but they are not usually included in th equipment of most ar ms in which case method of laying out securing string tape or cable is improvised dwhen more than one prodding party is used the soldie r closest to th cleared area will reel in the marking tape asbgl320010fp001 6a36a4they proceed and the other soldier i n the second party will lay out the new boundary eprodding is very tiring and efficiency drops rapidly soldiers shall be relieved as often as possible feye protection shall be worn by all soldiers engaged i n prodding gunless only lane for personnel is required prodding will b followed by sweeping with mine detector to locate deepl buried metallic mines and hwhen the required lane

the most obvious and easiest ground without searching it first dmark and report all mines and booby traps that are found emark and report all lanes and areas which have bee n cleared fin the event of casualty follow the correct dril l and gremember that any mistake made may kill your comrades s well as yourself mining 2the importance of command and control at all levels during any mining operation shall be contin ually stressed all mines must be treated as dangerous as they may be detonated in any of the following waysbgl320010fp001 732aby all vehicles including motorcycles bby animals cby personnel walking running or riding bicycle or dby careless handling of the mine 3mines may detonate if dropped after they have been armed they are therefore armed only after they have been placed in the ground except in mechanical mining drills 4the following precautions must be observed d uring mining apersonnel on vehicles are not to enter the completed part f the minefield to ensure this the various parties mus t work in echelon with the party nearest to the enemy being furthest ahead therefore the fencing party must always b ahead of the party laying the outermost row bby night if soldiers have to withdraw from the minefiel d before it is c ompleted they shall do so by moving forward along the pickets marking their row until they reach safe lane or to the side perimeter fence if they follow th perimeter fence they shall keep to the outside only in an emergency such as an unexpected attack can withdrawal directly to the rear be permitted cno movement in the reverse direction to laying shall b permitted if an officer or nco needs to contact the tail of the laying party the officer or nco must wait until the reach his or her location dspecial care is required to
