implements the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1979 reference b and applies to electronic surveillance as defined in that act conducted by dod intelligence components within the united states to collect foreign intelligence information as defined in that act c512 general rules c5121 electronic surveillance pursuant to the foreign intelligence surveillance act dod intelligence component may conduct electronic surveillance within the united states for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes only pursuant to an order issued by judge of the court appointed pursuant to the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 reference b or pursuant to certification of the attorney general issued under the authority of section 102a of the act c5122 authority to request electronic surveillance authority to approve the submission of applications or requests for electronic surveillance under the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 reference b shall be limited

procedure 5 applies to electronic surveillance as defined in the definitions section for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes directed against united states persons who are outside the united states and who under the circumstances have reasonable expectation of privacy it is intended to be applied in conjunction with the regulation of electronic surveillance within the united states under part 1 and the regulation of signals intelligence activities under part 3 so that the intentional interception for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes of all wire or radio communications of persons within the united states and against united states persons abroad where such persons enjoy reasonable expectation of privacy is covered by one of the three parts in addition this part governs the use of electronic mechanical or other surveillance devices for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes against united states person abroad in circumstances where such person has reasonable expectation of privacy this part does not apply to the electronic surveillance of communications of other than united states persons abroad or the interception of the communications of united states persons abroad that do not constitute electronic surveillance c522 explanation of undefined terms c5221 electronic surveillance is directed against united states person when the surveillance is intentionally targeted against or designed to intercept the communications of that person electronic surveillance directed against persons who are not united states persons that results in the incidental acquisition of the communications of united states person does not thereby become electronic surveillance directed against united states person c5222 electronic surveillance is outside the united states if the person against whom the electronic surveillance is directed is physically outside the united states regardless of the location at which surveillance is conducted for example the interception of communications that originate and terminate outside the united states can be conducted from within the united states and still fall under this part rather than part 1 c523 procedures except as provided in paragraph c525 below dod intelligence components may conduct electronic surveillance against united states person who is outside the united states for

international terrorist activities or who conspires with or knowingly aids and abets aperson engaging in such activities c523212 aperson who is an officer or employee of foreign power c523213 aperson unlawfully acting for or pursuant to the direction of foreign power the mere fact that persons activities may benefit or further the aims of foreign power is not enough to bring that person under this paragraph absent evidence that the person is taking direction from or acting in knowing concert with the foreign power c523214 acorporation or other entity that is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by foreign power or c523215 aperson in contact with or acting in collaboration with an intelligence or security service of foreign power for the purpose of providing access to information or material classified by the united states to which such person has access c52322 the electronic surveillance is necessary to obtain significant foreign intelligence or counterintelligence c52323 the significant foreign intelligence or counterintelligence expected to be obtained from the electronic surveillance could not reasonably be obtained by other less intrusive collection techniques c5233 adescription of the significant foreign intelligence or counterintelligence expected to be obtained from the electronic surveillance 26 chapter 10 dod 52401r december 1982 c5234 adescription of the means by which the electronic surveillance will be effected c5235 if physical trespass is required to effect the surveillance statement of facts supporting finding that the means involve the least

surveillance directed at united states person who is outside the united states in emergency situations under the following limitations c5241 officials designated in paragraph c525 below may authorize electronic surveillance directed at united states person outside the united states in emergency situations when securing the prior approval of the attorney general is not practical because c52411 the

c52412 apersons life or physical safety is reasonably believed to be in immediate danger or c52413 the physical security of defense installation or government property is reasonably believed to be in immediate danger c5242 except for actions taken under subparagraph c52412 above any official authorizing such emergency surveillance shall find that one of the criteria contained in subparagraph c52321 above is met such officials shall notify the dod general counsel promptly of any such surveillance the reason for authorizing such surveillance on an emergency basis and the expected results 27 chapter 10 dod 52401r december 1982 c5243 the attorney general shall be notified by the general counsel dod as soon as possible of the surveillance the circumstances surrounding its authorization and

leaves the united states and it is known that the person is not in compliance with the administrative formalities provided by law that enable such persons to reenter the united states without regard to the provisions of law that would otherwise restrict an aliens entry into the united states the failure to follow the statutory procedures provides reasonable basis to conclude that such alien has abandoned any intention of maintaining status as permanent resident alien c53244 an unincorporated association whose headquarters are located outside the united states maybe presumed not to be united

whether concealed monitoring is to occur where the subject has a_ reasonable expectation of privacy is determination that depends upon the circumstances of particular case and shall be made only after consultation with the legal office responsible for advising the dod intelligence component concerned reasonable expectation of privacy is the extent to which reasonable person in the particular circumstances involved is entitled to believe his or her actions are not subject to monitoring by electronic optical or mechanical devices for example there are ordinarily reasonable expectations of privacy in work spaces if persons actions and papers are not subject to ready observation by others under normal working conditions conversely person walking out of his or her residence into public street ordinarily would not have reasonable expectation that he or she is not being observed or even photographed however such person ordinarily would have an expectation of privacy within his or her residence c63 procedures c631 limitations on use of concealed monitoring use of concealed monitoring under circumstances when the subject of such monitoring has reasonable expectation of privacy is
