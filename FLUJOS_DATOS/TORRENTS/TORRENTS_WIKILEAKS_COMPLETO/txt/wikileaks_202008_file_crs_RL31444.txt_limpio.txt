donald j marples specialist in public finance government and finance division firms that incorporate abroad for tax purposes corporate inversions and expatriation summary over the past several years reports indicate that an increasing number of us firms have altered their structure by substituting foreign parent corporation for domestic one such inversions typically involve the creation of new foreign corporation in country with low tax rates tax haven that becomes the parent of the firms foreign and us component corporations chief motive for inversions is apparently savings by firms on their us corporate income tax one source of savings is tax on firms foreign income the united states taxes corporations chartered in the united states on both us and foreign income but taxes foreign chartered corporations only on their ussource income an inversion can thus potentially reduce firms us taxes on foreign income other tax savings apparently result from earnings stripping or the shifting of ussource income from taxable us components of the firm to the taxexempt foreign parts in the long run inversions may be accompanied by some increased level of us investment abroad firm that inverts reduces its tax burden on foreign investment however any such shift may be small and the recent corporate inversions do not appear to be accompanied by substantive shifts of economic activity from the united states this leaves the impact of inversions on tax revenues as probably the leading nearterm economic effect as consequence one policy issue inversions present is that of tax equity unless offset by spending cuts or larger budget deficits the lost revenue is made up with higher taxes on other us taxpayers several bills introduced in the 108th congress appear to have had the revenue losses and tax equity as their primary concern and tax legislation aimed at restricting inversions was included in the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 an omnibus tax bill addressing business and international tax issues in 2006 additional tax restrictions were proposed in the senatepassed version of the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act tipra pl 109222 but were not contained in the final act there are indications that the 110th congress may look to the corporate income tax as an area where revenueraising measures might be found to offset tax cuts provided elsewhere in march 2007 the senate passed tax package that included inversion provisions as part of hr 1591 supplemental appropriations bill however the measure was not included in the conference agreement on the bill some have viewed inversions as symptomatic of burden they believe the us tax system places on the international competitiveness of us firms may 2002 us treasury report saw inversions as just one result of competitive problems posed by us taxes and called for more general reexamination of the us international tax system the reports nearterm recommendations for more stringent tax rules are confined to changes aimed at protecting the domestic tax base rather than us tax revenue from foreign income recent policy discussions of the us international tax system have included calls by some for adoption of territorial tax system under which us taxes would longer apply to foreignsource income inversions can be viewed in this larger context they have been described as doityourself territoriality and present many of the same policy issues this report will be updated as events in congress and elsewhere occur contents introduction 1 how inversions generate tax

inversions and expatriation introduction1 news reports and articles in professional tax journals over the past several years have drawn the attention of policymakers and the public to phenomenon sometimes called corporate inversions or expatriations instances where firms that consist of multiple corporations reorganize their structure so that the parent element of the group is foreign corporation rather than corporation chartered in the united states may 2002 study by the us treasury department concluded that while inversions are not new the statutory framework making them possible has long been in existence there has been marked increase in their frequency size and visibility2 comprehensive list of firms that have inverted has not been compiled some of the more highprofile inversions however include ingersollrand tyco the pxre group foster wheeler nabors industries coopers industries and stanley works stanley works however subsequently announced that it would not undertake its planned reorganization according to the us treasury department the transactions are increasing in size scope and frequency3 firms engaged in the inversions cite number of reasons for undertaking them including creating greater operational flexibility improved cash management and an enhanced ability to access international capital markets4 prominent if not primary however is the role of taxes each of the firms in the above list expects significant tax savings from its reorganization the tax structure that permits tax savings through inversions has long been part of the us tax system the question then arises why now one plausible explanation is the decline in the stock market that followed the bull market of the 1990s as described in more detail below an inversion is accompanied by required payment of tax by individual shareholders on capital gains the capital gains tax may 1 this report was originally written by david l brumbaugh specialist in public finance 2 us department of the treasury office of tax policy corporate inversion transactions tax policy implications washington may 2002 p 1 3 bna daily tax report may 13 2002 p g10 4 these reasons are cited by stanley works in february 8 2002 press release see also the november 2 2001 proxy statement by ingersollrand which cites variety of potential business financial and strategic benefits the statement is available on the ir website at httpwwwshareholdercomiredgarcfmpage2 crs2 thus serve as brake on inversions lower stock prices however may mean that capital gains are smaller and capital gains taxes less onerous another suggestion has been that increased globalization of markets has exposed us firms to more competitive pressures leading them to more avidly pursue taxsaving strategies and yet another reason is simply momentum firms may have been reluctant to incorporate abroad for fear of public relations damage once several firms undertook reorganizations the damage potential may have been perceived to have fallen and other firms followed5 the corporate inversions apparently involve little if any shifts in actual economic activity from the united states abroad at least in the near term see however the section below on policy issues for discussion of possible longrun effects bermuda and the cayman islands are the location of many of the newly created parent corporations jurisdictions that have corporate income tax but that do have highly developed legal institutional and communications infrastructures but the actual headquarters of inverted firms typically remain in the united states and an inversion does not apparently involve the outflow of capital from the united states abroad or the shifting of corporate jobs to foreign locations instead the chief nearterm economic impact of inversions is on us federal tax revenues which are reduced by the reorganizations and concern has been expressed about the potential erosion of the us corporate tax base6 this has also led some to draw conclusions about their impact on tax equity unless federal spending is cut or the deficit is increased the reduction in tax revenue must be made up by tax increases on other taxpayers7 some policymakers have sought remedy within the existing us system for taxing international transactions as discussed below in the section on alternative policy responses and proposals the 107th and 108th congresses have considered variety of proposals aimed at stemming the growth of inversions the proposals range from reimposing us taxes in manner that would undo the 5 for an analysis of the reasons firms undertake inversions see mihir desai and james r hines jr expectations and expatriations tracing the causes and consequences of corporate inversions national tax journal vol 55 september 2002 pp 409439 6 one commentator maintains that they may result in significant erosion in the corporate income tax base and terms them the most significant policy question the congress and the us treasury department face regarding the federal corporate income tax samuel c thompson jr section 367 wimp for inversions and bully for real crossborder acquisitions tax notes vol 94 march 18

treasury department has expressed concern over taxbase erosion but only in connection with the ability of inverted firms to shift ussource income to the foreign parent corporation us department of the

columnist robert trigaux of the st petersburg times compares the tax savings by inverting firms with liabilities of individual taxpayers and asks if more companies head offshore guess whos going to be stuck with the bills robert trigaux maybe evading taxes isnt such great idea st petersburg times march 10 2002 p 1h crs3 effect of the inversion to more incremental approaches such as denying the applicability of foreign tax credits and net operating losses to onetime us toll taxes that may be triggered by an inversion the latter more incremental approach was taken by the enacted version of the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 others view inversions as symptomatic of more general problems with the us tax system that have become evident as the world economy has become more integrated rather than disallowing inversions they recommend more general reevaluation of the tax code that drives them to do such thing8 the us treasury department views inversions as evidence of competitive problems with the us tax system the administration initiated study of inversions in february 2002 and issued preliminary report in may 2002 the report stated that nearterm response to inversions should ensure that inversions cannot be used to reduce inappropriately the us tax on income from us operations and thus makes several proposals designed to protect us tax revenues generated by us income9 in keeping with its concern for competitiveness however the report does not propose more stringent rules for foreignsource income and calls for reexamination of the us international tax system inversions have thus been discussed in terms of tax equity and competitiveness more detailed look at their implications for the us tax system in general is presented below in the section entitled policy issues first however it is useful to look at the mechanics of inversions and how they generate tax savings how inversions generate tax savings anatomy of an inversion although each corporate inversion has unique features common reorganization is apparently triangular stock transaction merger where new foreign corporation is created that is chartered in foreign country with low tax rates the new foreign entity creates uschartered merger subsidiary owned by the new foreign corporation the us parent corporation is then merged into the domestic merger subsidiary and becomes subsidiary of the new foreign parent for stockholders of the us corporation for example individuals institutional investors and other firms shares of the old us parent automatically becomes shares of the new foreign parent10 other forms of inversions are asset transfers where the domestic parent transfers its assets to newly created foreign corporation 8 house ways and means committee chairman william thomas as quoted in bna daily tax report april 16 2002 p g7 9 us department of the treasury office of tax policy corporate inversion transactions tax policy implications may 2002 p 30 10 this is the form taken by the recent ingersollrand inversion see lee sheppard ingersollrands permanent holiday tax notes international january 14 2002 pp 107 111 crs4 and dropdown transactions where the domestic parent transfers its assets to foreign corporation but the foreign corporation transfers some of those assets to domestic subsidiary11 the basic structure of us international taxation to see how inversions such as these generate tax savings it is useful first to look at the general structure of the us international tax system in the international context the united states bases its tax jurisdiction on residence it taxes corporations chartered in the 50 states or the district of columbia on their worldwide income foreign as well as domestic at the same time the united states generally exempts corporations chartered in foreign countries from us tax on their foreignsource income12 under the residence system firms us tax on foreign income depends on how the firms foreign operations are organized and result of the system is feature known as the deferral principle or simply deferral under deferral income that uschartered corporation earns directly through branch that is not separately incorporated is generally taxed by the united states on current basis since the income is earned by us resident in contrast foreign income earned through separate foreign subsidiary corporation is generally not subject to us tax until it is remitted to the us parent corporation as dividends or other income it is taxdeferred because of discounting13 this deferral confers tax benefit on income earned in foreign countries with relatively low tax rates the system has several additional complicating features one is the us foreign tax credit which is designed to alleviate doubletaxation where foreign countries tax us firms foreign income under its provisions the united states permits its taxpayers to credit foreign taxes they or their foreign subsidiaries pay against us taxes they would otherwise owe the foreign tax credit is generally limited to offsetting us tax on foreign and not domestic income but if firm pays sufficient foreign taxes it may use the credit to eliminate its entire us tax liability on foreign source income whether us precredit taxes are deferred or apply on current basis another important feature is set of antideferral regimes that limit the availability of deferral in some cases the broadest and most important of these is the tax codes subpart f provisions that were enacted in 1962 as means to limit the concentration of passiveinvestment income by firms in tax havens under subpart f us parent firms can in some cases be taxed on particular types of subsidiary 11 for more detailed description of these categories and specific examples of each see willard b taylor corporate expatriation why not taxes vol 78 march 2002 pp 146152 12 us taxes generally do apply however to foreign corporations income from the conduct of us trade or business and on certain investment income earned in the united states 13 discounting is the fundamental economic principle that given increment of funds say dollar is more valuable the sooner an economic actor has control of it for firm this is because the sooner dollar is received the sooner it can be invested and earn return crs5 income even if it is not repatriated to the us parent firm subpart f however only applies where foreign subsidiary is controlled more than 50owned by those us stockholders who own large blocs at least 10 of the subsidiarys stock the type of income subject to subpart f is generally income from passive investment and certain types of income whose source is thought to be easily manipulated second antideferral regime is the passive foreign investment company or pfic rules in contrast to subpart f the pfic provisions apply to foreign corporations that invest intensively in passivetype assets regardless of the degree or concentration of us ownership and even to income that is not itself from passive investment although the pfic rules permit deferral of us tax in some cases the rules apply an interest charge to the delayed tax payment thus negating the benefit of deferral before explaining how an inversion within this us tax structure generates tax savings we first note that foreign taxes are not irrelevant foreign countries frequently tax corporations chartered within their borders as does the united states thus whatever us tax savings an inversion generates could be offset if the country where the new parent corporation is chartered were not to have corporate tax rates lower than those of the united states indeed bermuda and the cayman islands have been frequent destination for recent inversions and neither imposes corporate income tax14 us tax consequences of inversions given the us tax structure inversions potentially provide tax savings in two general ways by reducing us tax on foreign source income and by reducing us tax on us income that is shifted outside the united states in earnings stripping or similar transactions where they occur these tax savings are ongoing but only save taxes at the corporate level under the corporate income tax inversions can potentially trigger onetime tax on gain that is required to be recognized when an inversion occurs the capital gains tax can apply to individual stockholders or at the corporate level further inversions may be unable to generate tax savings to firms whose foreign tax credits have eliminated us tax on foreign income to see how these results occur we look at the straightforward example of firm that is initially uninverted the firm includes uschartered parent corporation that is publicly owned and traded on us stock exchanges the parent corporation earns foreign income through foreign subsidiaries under current law as long as firm has dearth of foreign tax credits at least some us tax burden applies to the firms foreign income some of the income may be taxed on current basis either through subpart f or the pfic provisions and while other foreign income may be taxdeferred it is nonetheless ultimately taxed when it is repatriated at the 14 as an illustration ingersollrand reported to its shareholders that the firms payments to bermuda will be limited to fixed annual fee whose current amount is 27825 in addition bermudas minister of finance has assured ingersollrand that even if bermuda enacts an income tax it will not apply such tax to ingersollrand until 2016 see the proxy statement posted at httpwwwshareholdercomiredgarcfmpage2 crs6 stockholder level shareholders who are private individuals generally pay individual income tax on dividends from the us parent corporation and on capital gains when the stock is sold however some shareholders may hold their stock in tax free vehicles for example individual retirement accounts iras while other shareholders for example pension funds may be tax exempt now suppose the firm inverts so that the both the former us parent corporation and the foreign subsidiaries become subsidiary to new foreign parent corporation first since the conglomerates foreign income is now earned by foreignchartered corporation us corporatelevel tax on the foreign income that was either deferred or currently paid under the antideferral regimes is eliminated thus one source of tax saving is us tax on foreign income inverted firms may also employ earnings stripping to reduce us tax on domestic income earnings stripping shifts ussource income from us corporation to foreign parent by means of transactions between the related parts of the firm while the transactions can take variety of forms prototypical earnings stripping transaction involves foreign parent lending funds to domestic subsidiary the subsidiary is able to deduct interest payments to its parent from its us taxable income thereby reducing its us tax liability according to the treasury report on inversions feature common to many inversions is the presence of substantial indebtedness from the former us group to the new foreign parent or one of its foreign subsidiaries15 foreign corporations are generally subject to us withholding tax on ussource interest received from related us corporations the withholding tax rate is generally 30 however the withholding tax is in many cases reduced or eliminated by taxtreaty provisions thus if an earningsstripping transaction is structured so that interest payments are made to related lender in treaty country the tax can be avoided provisions designed to limit earnings stripping by foreign firms investing in the united states were enacted with the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989 pl 101239 the provisions deny deductions for interest payments to related corporations but apply only after certain threshold of interest payments and level of debtfinance is exceeded16 as noted above although inversions can generate ongoing tax savings at the corporate level under the corporate income tax they may generate taxes at the shareholder level under the individual income tax one source of new taxes may be capital gains section 367 of the tax code and treasury regulations issued under that section impose capital gains tax on transfers of stock by us stockholders to foreign corporations thus for shareholder of an inverted firms domestic parent any appreciation that occurred from the time of purchase to the time of the inversion is 15 us department of the treasury office of tax policy corporate inversion transactions tax policy implications p 22 16 for further information on the earnings stripping provisions see aaron rubenstein and todd tuckner financing us investments after the revenue reconciliation act of 1993 tax adviser vol 25 february 1994 pp 111117 crs7 generally subject to capital gains tax17 the purpose of the provision is to prevent capital gains from flowing out of us tax jurisdiction without being subject to us tax at some point18 the triggering of capital gains tax suggests divergence of interests among an inverting firms stockholders with those of taxable shareholders differing from those whose stock is not taxed eg pension funds and those with holdings in iras indeed lawsuits were filed by some ingersollrand shareholders that sought to block the firms inversion although stockholders subsequently voted overwhelmingly to approve the reorganization and the lawsuits were settled19 for its part stanley works has pointed out that only 40 of its shares are in taxable accounts20 the antideferral regimes may also be factor at the shareholder level inversions commonly result in stockholders at large owning the new foreign parent corporation subpart f with its thresholds requiring control and concentration of ownership are not likely to be factor the pfic rules however may be more likely to apply if foreign parent passes the pfic passiveinvestment and income thresholds individual stockholders may be subject to the pfic regime where they previously were not21 economic effects of inversions tax equity as noted above the chief nearterm economic effect of inversions is to reduce us tax revenue22 if the us government has fixed revenue requirement 17 for detailed description of section 367 see vikram gosain working with the new section 367 rules after the final regs and tra 97

crs8 inversions revenue loss has implications for fairness the lost revenue is made up by higher taxes elsewhere either on other corporations and businesses or on individual taxpayers equity is one of the chief grounds on which inversions critics have assailed them economic theory however points out that equity is difficult concept to apply in the case of the corporate income tax to begin corporations are not people but agglomerations of stockholders employees creditors and managers each of whom has his own particular income and wealth characteristics it is therefore not very informative to compare the tax burden of corporation with that of an individual matter how eyecatching the comparison may be to make equity comparisons even more difficult the ultimate repository of the taxs burden is difficult to determine with any certainty in the short run the burden of corporate income tax or the benefit of its reduction as with inversions likely falls on the corporate stockholders in the long run however economic analysis suggests that market adjustments and behavioral reactions to the tax result in its burden being spread beyond corporate stockholders to all owners of capital thus inversions may reduce the tax burden on capital in general relative to the burden on labor income and to the extent capital income is associated with individuals with higher incomes inversions may reduce the progressivity of the tax system investment and competitiveness in the short run inversions probably have little impact on real economic activity firms undertaking inversions have indicated that they are only changes in legal structure and substantive headquarters functions will continue to be conducted in the united states at the same time however inversions do reduce the corporate tax burden on foreignsource income relative to that on domestic income an inverted firm may face lower overall tax rate on investment in lowtax countries than it does on investment in the united states as consequence more longrun result may be for inverted firms to shift some amount of investment and business operations from the united states to locations where foreign income taxes are low what are the implications of this possible impact on investment flows in assessing the impact of taxes on investment economic analysis focuses on economic efficiency and ultimately on economic welfare according to traditional economic theory taxes best promote economic efficiency when they are least distorting of investment decisions when taxes do not distort investment decisions investment is generally employed in its most productive location as consequence economic welfare is maximized economic theory also holds that taxes are least distorting of the location of investment when the tax burden on investment is the same in every location in the international context taxes do not distort investment location when the tax burden on foreign source income is the same as that on domestic income in tax parlance tax policy that promotes equal taxation of foreign and domestic investment is policy of capital export neutrality since inversions reduce the tax 22 continued inversions would increase federal tax revenues by 4 billion over 10 years bna daily tax report june 3 2002 p g1 crs9 burden on foreign income compared to domestic income their availability likely nudges the us tax system away from capital export neutrality with corresponding loss in economic efficiency and economic welfare but any loss in economic efficiency that may result from inversions is not likely to be large because features of the us tax system that exist quite apart from inversions already reduce the tax burden on foreign investment the ability of firms to defer us tax on subsidiary earnings in lowtax countries reduces the tax burden on foreign investment as do certain us foreign tax credit rules while inversions likely do reduce the tax burden on foreign income by granting permanent tax exemption rather than just deferral of tax it is likely their incremental change in the tax burden is not enormous while capital export neutrality is thought by economists to maximize world economic welfare business leaders and others have emphasized the importance of taxes impact on us competitiveness and the ability of us firms to compete in world markets this analysis recommends policy sometimes called capital import neutrality under which the united states would not tax income from foreign business operations and would limit its tax jurisdiction to ussource income for example several european countries operate territorial tax systems that do not apply homecountry taxes to foreign income it is argued that the united states should likewise adopt territorial system to place its firms on the same tax footing as firms from territorial countries the availability of corporate inversions introduces an element of capital import neutrality into the us system supporters of capital import neutrality are likely to view inversions in more positive light than supporters of capital export neutrality capital import neutrality recommends an exemption for foreign income and inversions accomplish that for inverted firms and as noted above some policymakers have suggested that inversions may signal need for tax changes that would make the us tax system more competitive alternative policy responses and proposals proposed policy responses to inversions vary widely depending on what is viewed as their chief threat for example those that are chiefly concerned about the revenue and tax equity results of inversions make little distinction between inversions loss of tax revenue from us sourceincome on the one hand and foreignsource income on the other their proposals seek to reimpose us taxes on firms when inversions occur in contrast others view inversions as symptomatic of competitive burden imposed by the us tax system and have suggested more general reforms of the us method of taxing foreignsource income may be in order the 2002 treasury department report for example recommended more stringent treatment of us but not foreignsource income for example more effective measures of limiting earningsstripping and called for general reexamination of the us system of taxing foreign income crs10 congressional proposals the house and senate eti bills number of bills were introduced in the th 108 congress that addressed inversions prominent among these were two broad business tax bills passed in 2004 by the senate and house s 1637 and hr 4520 respectively that had as primary focus the controversy over the us extraterritorial income exclusion eti tax benefit for exporting both bills proposed to repeal the eti benefit and proposed variety of tax cuts both for domestic and overseas investment the bills contained many overlapping provisions but also contained differences including some in the area of inversions the differences between the bills were resolved in october by conference committee and the conference committee version of hr 4520 was enacted as the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 s 1637 senator grassley was approved by the senate finance committee on october 1 2003 and included several inversionrelated provisions among variety of revenueraising proposals designed to offset the cost of the bills investment tax benefits23 s 1637 proposed to impose two new tax regimes on inversions depending on ownership thresholds and on when the inversions occurred under the first regime s 1637 would have taxed foreign parent corporation like domestic corporation if it passed continuityofownership threshold thus nullifying much of the tax benefit an inversion can generate the test would be met if at least 80 of the foreign corporation is owned by the former shareholders of domestic corporation or partnership that had transferred substantially all of its property to the foreign parent the threshold also required the foreign parent and its affiliates not have substantial business activities in the country of incorporation and applied only to inversions that occur after march 20 2002 s 1637s second regime was based on 50 ownership test and would potentially have applied whether the inversion occured before or after march 20 2002 the second set of rules would not apply however to postmarch 20 inversions subject to the bills first regime the second regime would act as type of toll tax on the shifting of the firms foreign subsidiaries from the former us parent to the new foreign parent the tax would apply the highest corporate tax rate or the highest individual tax rate in the case of partnerships to stock received by the former domestic parent from the new foreign parent in exchange for ownership of the firms foreign subsidiary corporations neither foreign tax credits nor net operating losses would be permitted to offset the tax an additional provision of s 1637 proposed to impose an excise tax on stock options related to inversions thus addressing an area in which the interests of corporate officers with respect to inversions might diverge from those of stockholders see the discussion of capital gains taxes at the shareholder level above on pages 67 under the provision officers directors and 10 owners of 23 the inversion proposals were similar to those contained in the senatepassed version of the may 2003 taxcut bill jgtrra the jobs and growth tax relief and reconciliation act pl 10827 but which were not included in the conference committee bill crs11 inverted firms would be subject to 20 excise tax on compensation that is directly linked to the value of an inverting corporations stock such compensation would include stock certain stock options generally nonqualified stock options and other stockbased compensation for stock options the tax would apply to the value of the option at the time of the inversion determined by an optionpricing model specified by the treasury department the excise tax would apply however only when the inversion in question triggers recognition of shareholderlevel capital gains the bill also contained provisions that would extend current laws earningsstripping restrictions on the deductibility of interest paid to related corporations see pages 56 above to partnerships and s corporations the restrictions currently apply only to corporations according to estimates by the joint committee on taxation s 1637s inversion provisions would have increased tax revenue by 26 billion over 10 years the house passed hr 4520 representative thomas on june 17 2004 like s 1637 hr 4520 included more stringent treatment of inversions in conjunction with broad set of unrelated provisions that would repeal eti while enacting other investment tax benefits the house bills inversion provisions however were generally narrower than those of the senate bill note however that temporary inversion provision comparable in scope to that of s 1637 was included in hr 6 the housepassed energy bill as described below under current law the transfer of foreign subsidiaries or other assets from us parent corporation to new foreign parent corporation may give rise to corporatelevel tax sometimes referred to as toll charges under several different tax code provisions however tax attributes such as foreign tax credits or net operating losses if available may offset the tax hr 4520 proposed to deny the applicability of tax attributes in the case of inversions like the senate bill the house bill contained provision that applied an excise tax on stock options related to inverted corporations the applicable rate of the tax however would be 15 rather the 20 rate imposed by s 1637 unlike s 1637 the housepassed bill did not contain restrictions on interest deductions aimed at limiting earnings stripping in this respect it is distinct from the 2003 ways and means committee bill hr 2896 which did contain earnings stripping provisions according to joint committee on taxation estimates the house bills inversion and earnings stripping provisions would together increase tax revenue by an estimated 488 million over fiscal years fy 20042014 the american jobs creation act ajca pl 108357 like the senate bill the conference agreement on hr 4520 adopted two alternative tax regimes applicable to inversions which one applies depends on continuityof ownership thresholds the new rules applied to inversions occurring after march 4 2003 the new law provides that when new foreign parent is at least 80 owned by the former parents stockholders the new law treats the foreign parent as domestic corporation thus generally denying to the firm the tax benefits of the inversion the second regime applies when there is at least 60 continuity of crs12 ownership but less than 80 in the latter case the new foreign parent is not taxed like domestic corporation but in manner similar to the house bill any toll taxes that apply to transfers of assets to the new entity are not permitted to be offset by foreign tax credits or net operating losses the conference agreement provides an excise tax on stock options as did both the house and senate bills the rate of the tax however will be the maximum capital gains tax rate for an individual 15 through 2008 and 20 thereafter according to jct estimates the conference agreements inversion provisions will increase tax revenue by 937 million over 10 years contracting restrictions several bills not directly pertaining to taxes have contained antiinversion provisions in the 107th congress section 835 of the homeland security act pl 107296 contained restrictions on the agencys contracting with inverted corporations the measure that was approved contained broader waiver conditions than those in the earlier house or senate bills and provided that the prohibition can be waived in the interests of homeland security to prevent the loss of jobs or to prevent the government from incurring higher costs in the 108th congress the senate returned to the procurement restrictions issue on january 23 2003 the senate approved an omnibus appropriations bill hjres 2 that would tighten the enacted waiver conditions by making waiver of the contracting restrictions possible only if the secretary of homeland security certifies that it is essential to national security the provision was included in section 101 of division l of the conference committee version of the bill that became pl 1087 2006 budget reconciliation legislation hr 4297 additional tax legislation aimed at restricting inversions was included as one of several revenue raising offsets in the version of budget reconciliation legislation passed by the senate in november 2005 the proposal would have applied restrictions to inversions occurring after march 20 2002 rather than those occurring after march 20 2003 as under the ajca in addition the plan would have reduced the 60 threshold that applies to ajcas second inversion regime to 50 continuityof ownership threshold thus expanding the scope of ajcas restrictions the proposal would also have tightened the tax codes earningsstripping restrictions see above in the case of inverting firms the senate proposal was not contained in the final version of reconciliation legislation enacted in may 2006 tax increase prevention and reconciliation act pl 109222 2007 senate small business tax bill on january 17 2007 the senate finance committee approved s 349 containing package of tax benefits for small business along with set of revenueraising measures designed to offset part of the tax benefits revenue loss the bill included expanded restrictions on inversions scaledback version of the 2005 proposals described above as one of the revenue raisers the provisions were subsequently included in hr 2 the minimum wage bill passed by the full senate in february and in hr 1591 the supplemental appropriations bill approved by the senate in march the inversion measure was not however included in the conference agreement reached on hr 1591 nor was it in crs13 the small business tax package that congress ultimately passed as hr 2206 pl 11028 the senate inversion provision generally applied part of ajcas anti inversion regime which are the provisions applicable to firms meeting the 80or greater test to inversions occurring up to approximately year earlier than the effective date specified by ajca as described above ajcas provisions apply to inversions occurring after march 4 2003 with some modifications the senate measure also applied the ajca provisions to inversions occurring after march 20 2002 the modifications were apparently designed to limit the retroactivity of the expanded date under their terms the tax regime that ajca applied to 80 inversions treatment of the new offshore parent as domestic corporation do not apply until the first year after tax years beginning in 2006 other approaches an approach to inversions that is similar to those contained in the legislative proposals would modify the antideferral regimes contained in subpart f or the pfic provisions these proposals have not however been introduced as legislation as with the legislative proposals these suggestions would identify reorganizations that qualify as inversions and apply their tax rules in such situations the subpart f or pfic rules would be modified so that the stockholders of foreignchartered inverted parent corporations would be subject to us tax on at least some of its foreign income24 in contrast to the proposals that would apply only when inversions occur another suggested approach would modify the tax codes concept of residence such an approach would be more fundamental and might be viewed as treating the cause rather than the symptoms one analyst has pointed out that the residence test applied by the british tax system looks beyond the place of incorporation and generally establishes firms residence as the country from which the firm is centrally managed and controlled such system would appear to avoid some potential administrative problems inherent in attempting to identify inversions by means of thresholds as do the legislative proposals on the other hand the british system has apparently encountered difficulties in identifying the substantive location of management and control control can in some cases be established in tax havens simply by conducting pro forma board meetings there25 the may 2002 treasury report the treasury departments may 2002 report voiced three principal concerns that the earningsstripping opportunities from inversion may erode the part of the 24 samuel c thompson jr

consisting of ussource income that the current tax system may give foreigncontrolled firms competitive advantage and that inversions reduce confidence in the fairness of the tax system26 the treasury department report noted that earnings stripping is not confined to inversions but can occur within foreigncontrolled groups in general the reports concern with the practice was reflected in number of proposals aimed at restraining the practice as described above the tax code already places limitations on interest deductions when certain thresholds are exceeded the treasury concluded that the prevalent use of foreign relatedparty debt in inversion transactions is evidence that these rules should be revisited the report listed number of specific ways the rules could be tightened27 the report also suggested that further work is needed in incomeshifting areas apart from relatedparty debt specifically the tax systems transfer pricing rules in the area of intangible assets28 as with earnings stripping the treasury reports concern for competitiveness was broader than just inversions the report viewed inversions as being one aspect of more general result of the us tax system the reports analysis concluded that the us system places uscontrolled and headquartered firms in general at disadvantage relative to foreigncontrolled firms disadvantage that is believed to occur because the united states taxes the worldwide income of its corporations while some foreign countries use territorial systems that exempt foreign income29 the report viewed not only inversions but growing number of acquisitions of us firms by foreign companies as possible symptoms of the disadvantage30 as result of its concern for competitiveness the treasury report stopped short of proposals that would negate the tax savings on foreignsource as well as domestic source income contrast with bills listed above instead the report stated the policy response to the recent corporate inversion activity should be broad enough to address the underlying differences in the tax treatment of usbased companies and foreignbasedcompanies without regard to how foreignbased status is achieved measures designed simply to halt inversion activity may address these transactions in the short run but there is serious risk that measures targeted too narrowly would have the unintended effect of encouraging shift to other forms of transactions to the detriment of the us economy in the long run31 26 us department of the treasury office of tax policy corporate inversion transactions tax policy implications

recommended evaluating the merits of exempting foreignsource business income and reevaluating the usefulness of the antideferral regimes and limitations on the foreign tax credit32 the report was generally confined to describing the current legal framework and presenting policy options it does not present rigorous economic analysis of inversions or the broader impact of us taxes in the international context with its focus however on protecting the domestic rather than foreign us tax base and its concern with competitiveness the reports perspective appeared more closely akin to the capital import neutrality perspective described above conclusion the apparent recent increase in corporate inversions has aroused concern in its own right the spectacle of us corporations engaging in expatriation in tax saving technique not available to most individual taxpayers may in the words of the treasury department reduce confidence in the fairness of the tax system but inversions can be viewed in broader context recent tax policy debate has tended to focus on the international economy sparked in part by the european unions successful challenge of the us foreign sales corporation export tax benefit and in part by the perceived new challenges posed by an increasingly integrated world economy some observers and policymakers have suggested that the time is right to consider fundamental reform of the us tax system one approach might be to adopt territorial tax system under which the united states would exempt foreign business income from tax inversions present many of the same policy issues as would be presented by adoption of territorial system the end result of an inversion after all is the exemption from us tax of firms foreign income33 accordingly the debate over the respective merits of capital import neutrality and capital export neutrality occur in much the same manner over inversions as they occur in debate over territoriality and the administrative problems inversions present in protecting the us domestic tax base the problems presented by earnings stripping and income shifting transactions would be presented by territorial tax system thus if the question of adopting territorial tax system moves to the fore of the tax policy debate the debate over inversions may have provided preview 32 ibid p 29 33 however an inversion exempts all foreign income from us tax including income from passive investment some territorial tax proposals would only exempt income from active business operations for other versions of this document see
