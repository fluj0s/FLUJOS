obscure budget practice advance appropriations received considerable attention in time of budgetary constraints advance appropriations provide opportunities to include spending in appropriations measures that are not imme diately counted two related but less discussed practices are forward funding and advance funding see httpwwwcrsgovproductsguides guidehomeshtml for more information on federal budget process appropriations measures generally make budget authority or ba1 available for use or obligation at the start of the fiscal year covered by the measure for example the fy2002 appropriations acts generally made budget au thority available on october 1 2001 sometimes appropriations bills provide different starting date for specified budget authority within the act so that the funding cycle does not coincide with the fiscal year generally covered by the act there are three types of this kind of budget authority advance appropriations forward funding and advance funding

year covered by the act an advance appropriation in fy2002 appropriations act could have provided that the budget authority for specified activities would not become available until october 1 2002the start of fy2003or later advance appropriations are generally scored2 in the fiscal year the funds first become available therefore an advance appropriation and resulting outlays for fy2003 that was included in fy2002 appropriations act would be included for calculating total budget authority and outlays for fy2003 but not fy2002 the funds would not be in cluded in calculations to determine if the appropriation violated the fy2002 spending ceilings established in the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 3 or additional spending ceilings associated with the annual budget resolution g8g152g155g160g138g155g141g561g8g158g151g141g146g151g144g561 forward funding generally becomes available for obligation in the last quarter of the fiscal year of the appropriations act and the availability c ontinues the following fiscal year forward funding in fy2002 appropriations act could have provided that the budget authority for specified activities would not become available until july 1 2002 and would remain available through fy2003 1 budget authority is the authority provided by federal law to incur financial obligations that will result in immediate or future expenditures or outlays involving federal funds examples of financial obligations are entering into contract to build submarine or purchase supplies 2 scoring refers to estimates of budget authority outlays revenues and deficit levels resulting from congressional budgetary action these estimates are usually prepared by the congressional budget office and office of management and budget and compare congressional action to targets and ceilings such as budget resolution spending ceilings 3 2 usc 621645 pl 93344 as amended section 303 of the congressional budget act exempts certain advanced appropriations from the prohibition against considering spending legislation until after congress has agreed to the budget resolution for the fiscal year for more information on congressional budget

becomes available budget authority in fy2002 appropriations act woul d be included in the fy2002 calculations since forward funding generally becomes available near the end of the fiscal year the office of management and budget and congressional budget office may estimate4 that most of the outlays will occur in subsequent fiscal years such forward funding outlays would not be scored for the first fiscal year but would be scored for subsequent fiscal years g3g141g159g138g151g140g142g561g8g158g151g141g146g151g144g561 advance funding is budget authority authorizing obligations late in the fiscal year if needed however unless used the budget authority is charged to the succeeding fiscal year advance funding is contingency funding for few programs that require federal payments in which the funds are borrowed from the succeeding fiscal year advance funding is used to fund benefit payments that are difficult to predict such as unemployment compensation an appropriations act would provide specific amount of budget authority but would also state that if needed an agency may obligate additional funds to meet benefit needs if advance funding is used budget authority for that fiscal year is increased by the amount obligated and budget authority for the succeeding fiscal year is reduced by that amount
