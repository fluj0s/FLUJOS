tv demobasic auditing lecture and demo lecture and demonstration given on 4 december 1963 how are you today thank you now this is the 4th of december isnt it fourth of december 1963 saint hill special briefing course what youre going to see here today and what youre going to hear is an extremely novel demonstration and were going to combine lecture with demonstration im going to try to give you some idea of the presence of auditingthe use in handling of basic auditing now recently recently you had something called itsa and itsa has always been present and actually theres difference between auditing in 1952 and auditing today really theres difference id say probably 1954 was more like it or 1955 theres real difference and everybody seems to have interpreted itsa as some new strange commodity that doesnt have anything to do with what we were doing well i have more or less always handled itsa and i found out that auditors werent handling it and that they needed different viewpoint and different perspective from which to view an auditing session so as to make their auditing better now all this is very interesting but auditors in actual factand this goes for im sure central organizations field auditors and so forth as well as this coursehave all of sudden dropped into some kind of category of itsa that nobody ever heard of and that was never intended and this is pretty awful bad i couldnt say how much i mean ithis tapes going out in public so i cant swear dont you see but its pretty grim do youdo you know that auditors are permitting their pcs to draw pictures not to illustrate anything just sit there and draw pictures and pc is humming and the auditor marks down the ta action while the pc is humming and what is this i mean what on earths going on here this is madness auditor sitting back giving the pc nothing to do not handling any control of session not doing anything in the session of course your ta is going to pieces well now look the place to get your basic auditing together is at class ii and class iii theyour basic auditing ought to be very nearly perfect at these levels because youre never going to be able to do an ot process unless your basic auditing is nearly perfect there frankly is difference between class ii auditing and class vi auditing difference really as far as basic auditing is concerned now the basic auditing is that fundamental which handles the pc handles the session handles the auditing comm cycle and handles the meter regardless of what else is occurring now the situation that you face here is that there is thing called perfect basic auditing there is thing called perfect basic auditing and at class iii itnow as we know it it now handles the meter it adds that into it but at class ii all basic auditing is doing is simply handling the pc the session and keeping the auditing comm cycle going and intact now there is room for improvement in this nearly everybodys auditing had room for improvement frankly the demand of an ot process on basic auditing is so great that you cannot have frail basic auditing and run anything really at class v or class vi and expect any result to occur but for an auditor to be sitting there letting the pc doodle for an auditor to be sitting there with the pc humming with an auditor to be sitting there silent while the pc had nothing to say these things are fantastic violations of basic auditing your basic auditing has got to be good now im laying it on the line to you here and it may be very cheeky of perhaps to play one of my own sessions on this sort of thing but for the last three months i knew that auditing could be improved i knew my own auditing could be improved how about yours so ive been working for about three months to get my own auditing improved as far as i could improve it and ive been very careful of various things and ive been grooving myself in along this particular line the trick is to do all these things and keep the session rolling now of course at class vi youre right on top of the session youre kicking it all the way along the line youre speeding it up youre rolling it very quickly and so forth but frankly its different that it should be at class ii or class iii all of these auditing lessons then apply to all classes above 1 basic auditing is something that should be very smoothly done indeed now what i have been able to improve in my own auditing are these particular points handling the pcs itsa receiving it knowing when the pc has spoken acknowledging what the pc has said and not cutting off the pcs itsa now of course one of the ways to quote play this safe is just not to say anything to the pc at all and then of course you never cut his itsa well how about cleaning cleans the pc will just go on self audit if you sit there silently so this is beautifully balanced situation youve got to be able to answer the pc without cutting the pcs itsa and without putting in big silence there which will also really not handle his itsa so its case of knowing whenfor the auditor when to talk the auditor should know when to talk and when not to talk and its quick proposition it is not slow now theres lot of ways by which auditors comm lag and ive noticed auditors comm lag down through the years but the pc saidyoure asking the question do fish swim and the pc says yes they do auditor oh oh yeah okay and the auditor says do fish swim and the auditor hm oh very good yeah veryeah all right excellent excellent yeshmhm yes jushjush mmhm well of course yes thank you thank you very much for what the hell is that but auditor comm lag see the comm lag of silence the comm lag of stringing out whole bunch of acknowledgments so hoping that something will happen these two things are auditor comm lag nothing else whats the auditor doing comm lagging well maybe hes comm lagging because he doesnt know the technique well all right he can learn the technique but if he is comm lagging his basic auditing just doesnt happen to be good it happens to be bad his basic auditing is very very very poor now most everybody in auditing believes that if they just knew the technique they would be all set well now auditing is now divided into basic auditing technique and case analysis three sections the truth of the matter is that basic auditing is basic auditing and it doesnt matter what technique you are running your basic auditing must be adequate now do you know that it doesnt even change from technique to technique its just basic auditing its the pc says something you answer it pc isnt saying anything you get the pc to say something you know pc hasnt got anything to think about or say give him something to think about or say you keep this thing rolling you keep it going you keep your action up in the session youre right on top of the session thats what gives you tone arm action tone arm action totally stems from keeping the session rolling theres all kinds of ways of mishandling pcs itsa but the secret of good handling the pcs itsa when the pc has answered it or said what hes going to say the auditor then and there at that moment knows the pc is finished talking and answers it once in while he makes mistake the pc had something else to say fine let the pc say the something else and acknowledge it again when the pc has got nothing to say give the pc something to say give him something to think about give him something to work on in other words its the auditor who injects the busyness into the session now ive given you itsa and the response to itsa is to fall away and do nothing the auditor does nothing now in the session except record and hope the pc by selfaudit will get somewhere well believe that is not auditing and it never will be auditing belowabove ratherit wont be auditing above level i yes we expect level i person to sit there and let thelet the individual talk we expect this to happen thats what we expect to happen but thats level 1 well none of you characters have been in level i for long time youve always been doing formal auditing well who stopped you from doing formal auditing i didnt but at level w i thought you could get some idea of measuring communication and letting the pc talk and learning to listen to what the pc was saying and i thought that would be beneficial but you youve carried it all the way through and you are going to audit somebody up along the line clear to vii i suppose sitting there comm lagging saying nothing while the pc doodles thats not auditing you hear now i mean im strenuous on this and im being rough on this because i was plainly shocked i conducted survey of this and well youve just simply misinterpreted what is itsa now the points ive had to improve in my own auditing were handling the pcs itsa be right up on top of it i found out that it was i who was causing the dirty needle it was i in my auditing handling basic auditing who occasioned the occasional arc break the pc had next thing i had to concentrate on was promoting and increasing the pcs itsa in other words i never pulled information off of meter or grabbed information from anyplace unless i couldnt get the pc to give the information independently you got it i didnt ever assessi stopped assessing solely and totally by meter i gave the pc chance to tell what it was the pc couldnt tell then i got it by meter promoting and increasing the pcs itsa giving the pc every opportunity to increase his ability to itsa because that is the road out the pcs ability to itsa must be improved or the pc isnt getting any better number three not talking while the ta is in fast motion youve got ta over here and its goingits going like this well during that period of time youre silent like this see pc says something and you see your ta all right at that moment you say thank you you didnt say anything while that ta was in violent motion but also not waiting to see if the ta was going to move again ill give you the idea what this is see we getthe pc says caterwump was the item all right and we see the ta go were silent during that period now if we kept silent here hoping the ta was going to move again we get this kind of picture that doesnt count now ill show you the right way to do this and you can see this ta moving and heres big broad sweep of the ta pc says caterwump auditors silent you see thank you all right just as long as that was on smooth even sweep why the auditor was silent because he would have upset the pc if he had talked during that period because the pcs very badly introverted now this is wrong pc says caterwump and weve got this smooth downward sweep of the ta here auditor silent auditor remains silent see that ta pumping around working thats wrong thats wrong in other words that ta is pumping around of course if the pc is itsaing at the same time and talking well it would be because the pc was talking that you kept silent but ordinarily for reason of tone arm alone you just take those big broad sweeps and you shut up during those sweeps and then you dont sit there and wait endlessly for theto see if the meter is going to move again because actually thats in violation the meter has stopped moving hasnt it so at that point of stopped motion why its perfectly all right for the auditor to start talking see you can push this so painfully far that pc never gets an opportunity to actuallywell hes just left without an auditor thats all now actually at level vi youll get this situation that after the thing has blown down and come back up this pumping motion that you now see here this little pumping motion ofregardless of what hes saying and so forth is in actual fact coming from the next item not yet found youve got all of your ta action out of the item youve found with that long broad sweeps and now youre just bleeding ta out of the bank someplace but thats particular thing about tr 6 it works with any process then that the auditor should not be talking while the ta is in fast motion but not waiting to see if it moves again see once it stopped moving the auditor has business now sitting and waiting to see if its going to move again he just simply now says good you got the idea it isnt case then of sitting there haunting the meter its sitting here at 35 and youre haunting the meter wondering if the meter is going to drop well it drops to 325 and then sitting there and waiting to see if the meters going to move again and finally after four or five seconds the meter does shift up to 33 see thats wrong thats wrong what were talking about when the meter is not moving we dont want the auditor talking on these warlarge sweeps thats what were interested in so thats another point involved here on basic auditing its basic auditing point technique point now taking up and handling the pcs problems either at session start or as they arise or at session end now thats all part of basic auditing you cant audit and get auditing gains with pc with ptp the pc says he has ptp whether that occurs in setting his goals he apparently has ptp or in mid ruds he apparently has ptp or induring the running of the thing as he discusses things he suddenly brings up present time problem or at session end he now has present time problem keep the pcs present time problems handled with regard to the session now you think of present time problem as something that happens outside sessions great many present time problems happen because of auditing now we havefor instance imwill even go to this point now is just before i give the end of the body of the session note that theres goal up here that the pc has set and this goal that the pc has set up here is very definitely ahasnt been touched in the session see its sort of ptp kind of goal you see to find out if i really am bright or if i find out if i really am stupid we havent had any of this in the session at all and take it up before the end of model session now this goal up heredont wait for goals and gains see you can all take this up right after the sessionright after the end of the body of the sessionbut you notice theres an outstanding problem there you hoped it might turn up and solve during the session it didnt you say well how do you feel about that is that really problem to you the pc says something or other sother sother sother and soon and soon and what considerations have you had about that well soandso and soandso how do you feel about that now oh i feel all right okay thank you very much end of the body of the session and then just go into his goals and gains as though you hadnt paid any attention to it you get the idea pc says in anow heres middle session thing pc suddenly says well i dont know whether i really answered the question or i didnt answer the question you know see its very very difficult to tell whether i answered the ques know youre looking at ptp all right so you handle it as ptp and you say to the pc all right well what considerations have you had about it youre of course going to wear this one out because it appears to be pat thing there are thousand ways to handle this thing but youre going at it on this basis ptp well i dont know i well what was the answer to it well it was soandso and soandso well i dont really know i didnt really know at the time well all right well good well what was the question that was asked at that particular time oh soandso oh oh yes soandso oh well yes the answer was soandso oh all right and i come right off of it because we handled the ptp get the idea dont let the pc pack up bunch of ptps in the session now ill give you these four points again handling the pcs itsa thats number one thats not talking and cutting off his itsa and not being silent and giving him nothing to itsa that has two sides two promoting and increasing the pcs itsa in other words you give possible opportunity so that you dont tell him or the process doesnt let him find it out or meter rather thehe doesyou dont going to find it on the meter when the pc can tell you in other words get pc first on this sort of thing get him to itsa get him to look at it get him to find the answer himself do all you can to get the pc to find out the answer himself without barging him down and making him feel like hes getting help you can also do this to point where he feels hes getting help at all number three not talking while the tas in fast motion but not waiting to see if it moves again thats all part of it number four taking up and handling the pcs problems either at session start or as they arise or at session end dont let pc have ptps now theres basic auditing basic auditing is something that an auditor is this is something he does and when i get the idea that all the auditors in scientology are going to sit around and handle session this way well what consideration have you had about problems for the next hour pc saying nothing doing nothing the auditor sits there and looks at the pc look if all auditing if all auditing i thought was going to degenerate into that if it was going to degenerate into that id go on vacation and i wouldnt come back now you justmind you now ive given you the threat heres yourhere is something interesting here from standpoint of model session now youre going to hear on this tapeim going to play you little bits of this youre not going to hear complete session youre going to hear little bits of this and im going to give you this tape in chunks and although this tape is very valuable this happens to be present time truncated gpm found on pc the goal found and the all sixteen items in that gpm run in three hours with total ta division of one hundred and seventyfive thats in three hours and this is very valuable because its probably the only tape that gives us the full complete rundown on finding items or anything else completely aside from the fact that it is tape on technology and gives technique and its patter it is study in basic auditing now lets see if youre good enough to hear the basic auditing that is going on in this particular tape lrh this is what 3 december pc yes lrh the tone arms rather high here pc is it really where lrh 475 pc oh lrh all right cans in your lap squeeze your cans all right thats fine your havingness is in good shape were going to continue with actual goal processes okay pc all right lrh and i think ill start out this pt situation pc mmhm lrh and if not well go on with what we were doing okay pc mmhm lrh all right is it all right with you if i begin this session now pc yes lrh all right start of session has the session started for you pc mmhm lrh anything worrying you pc lrh all right very good what goals would you like to set for this session pc if we work on it find the ninth ninth gpm lrh hm pc if we work on it find the ninth gpm lrh all right pc clear up any doubts about the present time gpm thats it lrh all right very good now well get our since mid ruds in here pc mmhm lrh all right since the last time i audited you when was that pc last night lrh very good since the last time i audited you has anything been suppressed pc i suppressed um myself to go to sleep last night so i would go to sleep lrh oh yeah pc yeah because id been staying up late and lrh all right pc um i suppressed annoyance today at not being able to locate the um your old passport i suppressed annoyance at arthur because he wouldnt let read didnt want to read christmas the way christmas is celebrated in different countries he figured that was too grownup for him thats all lrh all right ill check that on the meter since the last time i audited you has anything been suppressed well that tends to rough it up just little bit pc i suppressed concern about getting this affidavit out and done i suppressed concern well what if we dont find your passport you see i suppose your police book would do um also you know had the american embassy call again and found out that we didnt have to go down there do you see what i mean always you know like can we have it notarized here and then send it there and then they handle it you see of course you see yes so um you see but mary called up and she asked about it well theyd have to come down here to the american embassy and bring their passports and you see what i mean so its all right now and we have notary coming down to notarize it here and we dont have to go to the embassy in london well well i suppressed um i suppressed that um as usual with governmental type things i found out that uh my passport has been out of date since you know february 63 and um i thought well thats to be thats certainly true anytime i come into contact with governments i suppress i dont want to have to do it see and uh so i suppress i suppress doing all their little actions that ones supposed to do and forget all about em thats all lrh all right very good check that on the meter again since the last time i audited you has anything been suppressed that protest pc im protesting the question yeah lrh i didnt leave anything pc oh i suppressed my legs are tired tonight standing out there on the cement cold cement and watching students you see audit well its like um like jumping up and down on steel deck you know lrh hm pc cold floor hard cement lrh all right pc thats all lrh all right since the last time i audited you has anything been suppressed well that didnt read pc mmhm lrh all right since the last time i audited you is there anything youve been careful of pc oh to write up this affidavit with plenty of therefores and thereofs and wherebys and whereofs and ic witness all ye men and you know legal jargon and um i was careful to make complete search for your passport ive looked all around thats all lrh all right ill check that on the meter since the last time i audited you is there anything youve been careful of all right that apparently didnt read since the last time i audited you is there anything you failed to reveal all right now youveyouve seen this going on to this degree im sorry for the slow start there actually the machine had to be considerably adjusted there at the beginning now you heard blank you heard blank right after she did the last careful of you heard blank that was tone arm blowdown and as an auditor i just simply made notes on what she was doing and watched the tone arm blow down and when it hit bottom and so forth was in there and acknowledged it now do you get that that isnt just blank hoping something will happen it is in actual fact this now do you see any difference so far in what you are doing with model session and what you are hearing on this record im going to play you the rest of these mid ruds and let you listen to that pc the passports i kept thinking there was something i didnt i never found it lrh all right okay since the last time i audited you is there anything you failed to reveal pc lrh all right ill check that on the meter since the last time i audited you is there anything you failed to reveal is there anything you failed to reveal well that didnt read do you agree thats it pc mmhm lrh all right since the last time i audited you has anything been invalidated the last time i audited you has anything been suggested theres some read on suggest pc i dont think so lrh you dont think so pc lrh all right since the last time i audited you has mistake been made yes pc havent done any mistake i dont know of any mistake lrh mmhm pc oh just just students making mistakes in their auditing lrh all right very good since the last time i audited you has mistake been made yes another one now i want to call to your attention the fact that the pc is actually given time to answer the auditing question the auditor doesnt go on talking you see because the pc is taking time answering the auditing question those are the pcs comm lags the pcs blanks they are not the auditors blanks the question is asked or implied to the pc and the pc is then given time to answer the question so there is your those silences that you hear there is the auditor giving the pc chance to answer the auditing question and the pc is floundering around trying to find if there is any answer to it pc i cant think of any mistake lrh protest seems to be latent protest ill check the question again since the last time i audited you has mistake been made pc well i dont know what mistake has been made lrh all right was there mistake about case analysis that read what mistake in case analysis pc well that was just one of the students not getting the charge off before doing case analysis lrh all right does that answer it pc yeah well i covered that on the on student auditing mistakes lrh all right very good since the last time i audited you has mistake been made all right that seemed clean since the last time i audited you has anything been protested since the last time i audited you has anythingis there anything youve been anxious about last time i audited you has anything been decided yes whats been decided pc ive decided to get these uh get these uh wigs and and uh false noses and and makeup grease paint and false beards and so forth for diana and make her up disguise kit you see lrh oh all right pc these noses these false noses or rubber noses you see and you can put them on and then n makeup putty you see you can put the putty around and then cover the putty up with grease paint and so on and they also have little book about how to make up you know how to make yourself look old and how to make yourself look this or that or sad or you know so um should be interesting lrh all right pc i also got her some beard some crepe hair to make uh make beards or mustaches or sideburns or what have you two um two womens or ladies wigs and one wig of man thats all lrh all right since the last time i audited you has anything been decided all right that seemed clean all right and one more checkout here missed withhold have i missed withhold on you yes maam pc well i still havent thought of what to get you for christmas lrh oh this is pc missed withhold from too lrh comes christmas time pc yes lrh all right have i missed withhold on you im afraid there is one there suzie pc yeah lrh there pc well that was um mary long wont be here tomorrow she has to go up to uh guys hospital uh they want to have another look again at her thyroid and shes going to refuse shes been refusing an operation on it but uh shes going up tom tomorrow to see how its going to run and uh she showed one of the tests you see and that they would conduct on her and it seemed like it was pretty good uh she was able to you know youre supposed to hold your arms out and stretch them out and something or another if your fingers shake or something well then this indicates parathyroid trouble and uh her fingers were pretty steady so it looks improved to lrh all right have i missed withhold on you theres one pc mm student not being facile in questioning on case analysis you know ask question and and they dont know how to ask another question in order to verify what theyve gotten do you see what i mean you know also this one student everyth everything the pc said he checked something different you know so i thought dear sort of refusing the itsa of the pc by at least not being courteous enough to check it you know even though it is wrong you can at least be courteous enough to check it well thats all lrh all right very good very good i will check that one more time have i missed withhold on you all right that do you agree thats all clean pc mmhm lrh all right very good thank you very much take momentary break would you pc mmhm all right now there youve just heard the routine actions that youre supposed to take in starting session and the silences you heard were not the auditors silences that may come as horrible shock to some auditors they were all the pcs silences the auditors right up on top but except one instance when the ta was moving like it was taking off from launching pad all those silences were the pcs and the auditor was riding right up straight on top of it bang in other words the pc finished off finally bang the auditor was in there again bang hes in there again bang you got the idea this isthis is not worked the reverse way that the auditor sits silent while the pc has nothing to do and so forth there you see of course the fast check on the last five buttons and permissive check on the first three in other words the first three of suppress careful of and fail to reveal of course are permissively checked they are not checked on the meter until the pc says thats itsaid thats all and then theyre checked on the meter and the rest of them are just rapidly checked on through this is standard and you even saw an instance of steering and that instance of steering was on the last button there of the mid ruds i think it was and it was just matter of pc couldnt think of anything there couldnt think of it well having given the pc all possible scope to promote and increase her itsa naturally we had onewed gone to point where the pc couldnt think of anything in particulari think that was on missed withholdpc couldnt think of anything in particular and the auditor then watched the meter and when it ticked the auditor said there to attract the pcs attention to what the meter was saying but you see that was only carried out when the pc was just floundering was unable to see what was making the meter read now therethere is just standard terribly terribly standard hard fast model sessioning the number of ta divisions which were gotten in that little short space of time were fourteen that was not twenty minutes much less than that i dont know its on the report here someplace but theres fourteen ta divisions in that short space of time why well the auditor was working the auditor was being pro the auditor wasnt there for the ride anybody who doesnt audit that way handling those things is going to get minimal ta action now i dont say im the worlds most perfect auditor but im doing better than you are right now so lets take look at that now lets get into something complicated lets notwell just pass over finding this next goal i was able to find that rather easily but did it in rather unorthodox fashion since it was right there ready to be grabbed i was able to list up from the top oppterm of the previous bank because the pc had already had great many found lets just cut into this at random here and see what we find lrh this list complete ticks you have any heat on this list pc mmhm lrh you have pc yes lrh well we may have something on it okay we listing closer to present time or are we listing earlier neither one of them read let null this list and see what you get here pc mmhm lrh to be wild to be wild to be impetuous to be impulsive to be dashing to do whatever i want to do whatever i want to have gay time to throw caution to the winds to be incautious to be uninhibited to dare to be daring to proceed courageously to proceed courageously you thought of another one or something pc to do as i please i thought is that is that the same wording as the ones there lrh i dont think so okay pc mmhm lrh hows that pc hm lrh all right to act with courage to be carefree you thought of another one pc just that to do as i please that seems to have heat on it lrh is that so pc yeah only i never do as i please so it might if there if that is goal its failing already lrh to do as i please to do as i please on this item has anything been suppressed pc well i always want to do as i please but i never do as i please you see lrh hm pc oh i know good one for that to be irresponsible lrh okay all right if i continue with the list pc mmhm lrh all right to be carefree to be carefree to be careless to not care to not care to care about nothing to care about nothing to follow any whim to follow any whim to go off halfcocked to be daredevil to do as i please to do as i please to be irresponsible to be irresponsible pc isnt there to be daring on there somewhere youve already read it lrh yes there is to be daring check it again for you to be daring to be daring to be daring pc and then i thought of another one to dare lrh all right to dare to dare to to dare to dare to dare thats still in heat on it pc mmhm lrh all right ive got one over here that tried to go to act with courage to act with courage to act with courage pc oh that just went because it was amusing you know i justthat just read because it was amusing it was one of those you know lrh all right pc to live with honor die for die for goals lrh all right read some more of these ill check this one now to be daring all right and this one was trying to read to dare to dare to dare it is not now reading and to do as i please to do as i please and to be irresponsible to be irresponsible to be irresponsible well im sorry i havent got anything reading there pc mmhm are we listing for nothing lrh are we listing into nowhere are we listing for nothing are we listing into nowhere i dont get read is there an item where were listing for is there gpm here well that tends to slow is there gpm here all right did you get more heat on this list when i nulled it pc as you were nulling yes hm lrh what had the most heat on it pc um to do as i please and uh to dare and uh to be daring lrh all right to do as i please to do as i please thats now reading to do as i please to thats reading pc mmhm lrh now is that the pt gpm is that an actual gpm what do you think pc i dont really know is that an actual gpm do you think lrh is that an actual gpm it ticks ill check the rest of it is it an implant gpm is it only goal is it only goal is it an actual ri is it only ais it lock on an ri i get tick here and when you said so it rocket read that its an actual gpm pc mmhm lrh what do you think about this pc well i think thats very interesting if thats the case its uh pretty high its got quite few items in it because uh i uh never do as i please lrh all right this an actual gpm well that reads all right is this the gpm thats closer to pt than to proceed with caution is this gpm closer to pt than to proceed with caution or is this gpm earlier on the track pc its earlier on the track is it does it read lrh i got tick is this gpm earlier on the track is this closer to pt than to proceed with caution what did you think of pc im just getting so much heat off i cant uh you know i cant tell which way uh it goes lrh or is this earlier on the track earlier on the track or is this closer to pt its closer to pt earlier on the track neither one of those are reading now i had tick there that it was earlier on the track but that just might have been your startlement pc hm lrh hm pc well check it again is this closer to present time than to proceed with caution or is this um further from present time than to proceed with caution lrh when you say it my dear it falls very heavily on closer to pt than to proceed with caution pc oh was that on assert lrh hm pc was that on assert i havent asserted it lrh well asserts dont ordinarily read full dial pc caught yes lrh now is that the gpm that is the pt gpm rocket read pc rocket read lrh pt gpm thats number one gpm to proceed with caution then is number two gpm is to proceed with caution number two is it number three number four number two to proceed with caution is number two gpm pc hm lrh and to do as i please is the pt gpm number one is that correct pc number one yeah yes lrh that is the pt gpm pc yes lrh the one that comes into pt pc hm lrh is that to do as i please all right would to do as i please would the goal to do as i please oppose to proceed with caution pc yes because it doesnt matter caution doesnt enter into the thing its merely just to do what i please whether its incautious oror safe or sane oror responsible or anything lrh hm it would oppose it then pc yes lrh mmhm that rocket reads all right very good and lets check how many ris in this gpm if we can all right have you got any estimate pc i thought fifteen lrh all right fifteen ris in this gpm more than fifteen less than fifteen fifteen i get trip of the needle on fifteen that too many too few i notice its an odd number pc hm lrh there must be some odd number under sixteen pc it may it may be sixteen lrh hm pc it may be sixteen lrh are sixteen ris in this gpm now that reads nicely sixteen ris in this gpm so that takes it up to about the what would normally be the third the third or fourth pair pc mmhm lrh hm pc mmhm lrh in the gpm so that would make eight pair eight pair from the bottom pc um yeah eight pa eight pair from the bottom yes lrh yes and itd be about the f eight pair from the bottom that reads nicely pc and about two pairs maybe about two pairs from the top if there are twenty items in the gpm lrh mm your guess is as good as anybody elses pc yes lrh yours contain variously twenty twentyfour twentytwo twenty pc anyway i know what the top opp top terminal is lrh oh you do pc yes lrh all right give it to pc doing as im told lrh top terminal huh pc mmhm lrh doing as im told well that seems to blow down is that your item pc yes lrh all right doing as i am told all right something suppressing it pc yes i thought uh what the uh was thinking what the terminal oppterminal might be in there lrh and what did you get pc and i got uh people who wont specifically tell what to do but emphasis on the specifically lrh well you know that read and blew down like shot beautiful pc hm lrh people who wont specifically tell what to do all right something suppressed on it it read but short pc um well just amusement lrh oh all right people who wont specifically tell what to do all right pc specifically was really the main thing people say well um uh you know maybe my mother would say well now um well go to town and see if you can find any any thread or something like that hm well what color what size spool what uh uh commercial ou uh what what sort of cotton you know i mean you know lets be specific about all this you know what exactly and precisely you know or uh someone says um well um write up that bulletin for would you you know well what ill do with the bulletin you know its specific like you know generalities lrh all right people who wont specifically tell what to do im getting small kick on that whats up here youre not paying attention here to pc well lrh huh is that pc maybe not lrh is that it pc hm lrh people who wont specifically tell what to do people who wont specifically tell what to do there it goes people who wont specifically tell what to do whats happening here pc well i suppose my ball of charge is blown off of it lrh all right people who wont specifically tell what to do all right it reads for it reads big strokes when you say it but its sort of against cushion here is there any ri above this is there any ri below this all right is this the top oppterm of this gpm all right is this thewhatd you think pc oh well it could be inspecific people lrh inspecific people inspecific people and people who wont specifically tell what to do im not trying to spoil your itsa here in any way pc its people who wont specifically tell what to do lrh well that reads every time you say it people who wont specifically tell what to do ah now its reading for people who wont specifically tell what to do it gets choke on it pc oh lrh im not trying to make you nervous here im sorry pc hm lrh but pc i get heat on it lrh i know but its choking down pc oh all right lrh is there suppression going there pc its just my item and it read and it blew down and so on and i dont know why were and its read for you you called it and its read lrh well actually its blown down twice pc right uhhuh and you called it and it did read on an instant read once lrh all right yes yes it has read pc hm lrh this is just auditor nervousness top opp bank bad pc hm hm lrh top opp wrong bankblooey pc hm lrh all right respect your itsa i got to just people who wont specifically tell what to do all right itityou have an allergy to my reading this all right now just technical note here because youre actually listening to this for itsa but technical note is naturally the top oppterm of the pt gpm unlike any other oppterm in the whole bank all the track of course should just blow up and shouldnt keep on reading see it should just go and then thats the end of that dont you see and in this particular case it didnt do so so heres the pc having hard time now the auditor knows by this time that the pc has wrong item and is itsaing wrong item and is selling it now how can the auditor get out of this trap because the auditor knows it this item didnt blow up and cease to read this item is now continuing to read now that would be the only item in the whole bank that will do this so this is very peculiar little piece of technology here the top oppterm of the pt gpm amongst all other oppterms is the one which blows up and ceases to read almost at once because theres charge in front of it of course now why didnt this do this thats what the auditor is asking here whats going on and here we get into considerable tremble and scramble pc is getting arc breaky because the pc has wrong item now all youd have to do is miss your itsa once here and youd have screaming arc break itd be the session mid rud would key in the bypassed charge of the ot process lrh is this the top oppterm of this gpm is this the top oppterm of this gpm is this the top oppterm of this gpm that reads is this correctly worded is this incorrectly worded is this correctly worded yes all right that reads nicely is there any ri above this is there any ri is this ri below the top oppterm or is it the top oppterm pc i keep wanting to itsa there are items below it lrh well im sorry well im sorry my dear all right pc very amusing i keep thinking of that and i get and you say are there any items above this and i dont get anything and i think what hes going to ask are any items below this and the heat comes pouring off you know are there any items below this lrh all right people who wont specifically tell what to do all right thats your item pc hm lrh all right pc ye s lrh and how does this item relate to this gpm pc oh isnt it the um top oppterminal ask the question um would it relate uh would sol solve would the terminal solve that lrh im going backwards im going to take off from here pc all right lrh now would the top terminal solve people who wont specifically tell what to do pc well i dont know what the top terminal is lrh i dont want to list it pc oh lrh i just want to know its relationship to the bank pc well i suppose thats top term top oppterm lrh well whats whats the matter pc well i want the question lrh youre going to list it the other way pc all right well well list it the other way but i dont know whether i cant tell you whether weve got the top pair until iive looked at that question lrh all right i want to list in the other sequence pc all right lrh im sorry pc hm lrh something wrong here pc n lrh arc break pc well you never did it that way before lrh well thats because i dont want to oppose this twice pc hm lrh i dont like that system pc hm lrh you got an arc break all right you okay pc mmhm lrh all right we made an error here whats the error pc oh that you didnt tell what you were going to do and i naturally supposed that you know finding an item put in the steps on it im sort of on wait now waiting for that question to be asked of lrh all right who or what would solve people who wont specifically tell what to do pc oh i have to look at the item i forget it lrh doing as im told pc oh doing as im told lrh doing as im told doing as im told doing as im told on this item has anything been suppressed pc well yeah we i i did it the other way to now were doing it the other way around lrh all right pc i dont know if youre going to get any more reads on it or not lrh all right doing as im told its very flat item its read pc hm lrh and blown down all right would people who wont specifically tell what to do be solved by doing as im told pc they oppose but they dont solve lrh all right whats correct here is the top oppterm correct top oppterm incorrect top oppterm ticks as correct people who wont specifically tell what to do is that correct pc well i guess so i didnt start out on that basis i started out on the basis of the top terminal being correct i think lrh well which is correct here the top terminal or the top oppterm this which is this is it people who wont specifically tell what to do is that the top oppterm or is that incorrect as the top oppterm is that correct as the top oppterm i dont get read on either one here you shut off here whats the matter pc i dont know it uh you see i suddenly was trying to ask myself that question you see i felt something was wrong and i wanted the question asked and i had to wait to go through all this paraph this this you know round robin in order to get the question you see lrh yes pc and uh they dont solve they oppose lrh all right well which is correct pc the top terminal is correct lrh is the top terminal correct is the top oppterm correct top terminal is correct is doing as im told the top terminal im getting my reads on the fact that its the top oppterm thats correct pc could be protest couldnt it lrh is that protest in this session has anything been protested yes pc well doing it doing it that funny way weve never done it that way before it confused lrh ye s pc that it upset my certainty lrh all right sorry in this session has anything been protested seems clean in this session has anything been decided pc i decided that the top terminal is doing as im told lrh all right this reads now doing as im told doing as im told doing as im told on this item has anything been suppressed doing as im told youve gotten off on the wrong foot here suzie pc well all right lrh something something in error here im not quite pc well lets list for the top terminal then lrh do you have to do it from the top terminal pc hm well thats normally the way top bank is done isnt it lrh ye s pc thought so thats why i said that lrh because i think i found the top oppterm everything reads that ive found the top oppterm but not the top terminal pc oh all right lrh unless thats big suppress pc i dont know lrh all right have we bypassed some charge here all right is one of these items correct is neither of these items correct is there some other item are some other items the top ris of this gpm dont get read on anything pc hm well im lrh whats gone wrong here i upset you with procedure pc were maybe on hm lrh maybe on what pc i dont know i thought were maybe on cat uh kittycorner but uh were not lrh all right are we running correct goal yes all right lets list here bit for the top terminal pc mmhm lrh you got doing as im told pc mmhm lrh that rocket read but tightly doing as im told all right what might be the top terminal of this gpm pc being obedient all right now cutting into this of course it turned out that doing as im told was the top terminal because when it was all listed got straightened out and the top oppterm in this particular case even though it had beenit had read and everything else finally the top oppterm turned out to be being disobedient which shed put down on the top terminal list this all straightened out very nicely two items were taken from the top terminal went on down the bank in the remainder of the session and the only thing that happened of any vast significance there was just panning out that area now this of course is most confusing area and the auditor upset her slightly by shifting the procedure which she didnt expect but that was beside the point there was an arc break situation if anything ever happened im just pointing your attention now to the simple basic auditing this pc was permitted to say what the pc was permitted to say the pcs itsa was handled promoting and increasing the pcs itsa was paid attention to and not talking while the ta was in motion but not waiting to see if it moved again several instances of that showed up along the line and everything went along swimmingly but that was basic auditing now thats considerable trial for basic auditing now you probably when you went over that were paying attention to technique technique seems to fascinate everybody and basic auditing is the char that keeps the whole place clean and running but nobody ever pays any attention to but the basic auditing in that area the pcs itsa was not cut so we didnt have an arc break also the pc wasnt left with nothing to itsa so we didnt have an arc break all kinds of errors could have been made there in basic auditing because if it good heavens this pc had wrong top oppterm and the pcs right top terminal doing as im told had been abandoned now how complicated could you get wed accepted the wrong item and abandoned the right item now that of course is bypassed charge to end all bypassed charge and there was reason under gods green earth for that session to have continued on smoothly that should have just been screaming mess from there on well lets just cut into the session at random here and see what weve got pc thats it lrh all right lot of heat on it pc mmhm lrh being socially acceptable all right is that your item pc yes thats my item lrh all right very good thats your item pc yeah lrh all right is that correct item pc yeah lrh correct in this locale you got blowdown of about 75 on it does that item by the way take care of the others on the list pc mmhm lrh hm pc oh yes lrh all right hm pc all of them lrh all right very good now would social confusion be solved by being socially acceptable pc yes lrh all right would social confusion be solved by being socially acceptable pc mmhm lrh yeah there was little bang left on it there all right all these items correct to date all right read now what is the relationship between being socially acceptable in this gpm pc third terminal lrh all right very good all right we hm pc thats all lrh all right are your items all correct to date all right let see if that item was left on there theres nothing wrong with this social confusion pc what are we reading lrh im just reading the item were listing from just making sure pc oh lrh social confusion social confusion pc its cruelty doing that because im already thinking about what my next item is you know lrh well is social confusion still reading pc lrh social confusion are you thinking about your next item whats your next item who or what would being socially acceptable solve pc not being socially acceptable social ostracism being outlawed by society being an outlaw being exiled being sent to coventry thats all lrh all right very good do you know which one it is pc ostracism lrh thats an additional item pc hm its ostracism or being ostracized one or the other lrh what pc its ostracism or being ostracized one of the other of those lrh all right ostracism ostracism being ostracized all right being ostracized all right is that your item pc yes yes the thing i dont like is being all by myself i like to do as i please but i sure as h as the devil hate to do as i please all by myself its fun lrh all right thats your item pc mmhm lrh and would being socially acceptable solve being ostracized pc hm definitely lrh did you have your mind on what i was saying pc lrh hm pc not definitely lrh all right would being socially acceptable solve being ostracized pc yes lrh all right now what is the relationship between being ostracized and this gpm pc its the um sixth oppterm lrh third oppterm pc fourth lrh third terminal pc pardon fourth its the fourth oppterm lrh yes thats correct fourth oppterm all right pc mmhm lrh well by calculation theres what twelve more in the bank pc well we found how many thats the fourth oppterm so weve found uh three six seven and weve found seven items and we have something like sixteen in the bank so therere nine more to go arent there lrh yeah nine more all right im sorry pc nine more to go that means four pairs huh yeah lrh four pairs and one pc four pairs and one lrh all right and heres your question who or what would solve being ostracized well now thats the way it went and that was the pacing out along the line and by the end of the threehour session the whole bank had been run hundred and seventy five ta divisions had been racked up the pc was perfectly happy and cheerful making all goals and everything was fine and swimming but this was actually although very useful from this line since this is the only tape extant which gives the exact procedure and actually hasnt even been written in bulletins for modern ot processes what ive been calling your attention to is itsa and itsa itsa you notice i wasnt talking when the pc was trying to think up the answer to something i wasnt talking while the ta was moving those inexplicable blanks that you hear on the tape are actually fast moving ta and its just held until the ta ceases to move now thatsthat is an auditing session regardless of whats going on there is high level of discipline in action in this session it is the auditor who inserts the discipline into the session this pc was never left with nothing to do nothing to say and nothing to think about it was simply from the auditors point of view simply drive drive drive drive and from the pcs point of view pc appears very leisurely about all this but thats just the pcs speed of running that had nothing to do with what the auditors speed of running was you dont qanda with the pcs speed of running here we have in essence auditing auditing the way she should sound and if your auditing doesnt sound that brisk and if its not right up on top of it that way but there it is but it doesnt matter whether youre running ii level ii level iii level iv it doesnt matter what youre running these problems are problems of basic auditing and if anybody starts missing problems of basic auditingi played that rather bad patch of finding the top oppterms its awfully hard to do this particularly in the pt gpm got off on the wrong foot nevertheless if there had been very many mistakes in handling the pcs itsa in failing to promote and increase the pcs itsa the amount of strain which occurred at that point of the bank would have arc broken this thing across the boards well i played you little bit piece little later in this session and we found the pc very very happy and laughing and cheerful and so forth how why well its simply because in spite of the bypassed charge that might have been generated at any given moment and then was straightened out the pc was not given an opportunity to arc break because the basic auditing was held in very solidly and hard now there in essence are the problems of auditing and that basic auditing is basic auditing if your sessions dont sound like that i dont care what process youre running if your sessions dont sound like that why dont call yourselves an auditor okay thats tough to lay it down like that but if i hear of anybody doodling and letting the pc doodle and whistle and so forth ill have his certificate man because its not auditing its fraud you drive it keep that session driven keep that ta flying the auditor takes action lets have him take action take action right now and keep the session going keep the session whirring and thats auditing now i was just using my tape there as an example because ive been studying itsa and the handling of itsa here for some months if you care to listen to those bits and pieces again on that piece of tape which will be available to you for study you will see that it is the handling of the itsa the promoting increasing the pcs itsa its not talking while the ta is in fast motion but not waiting to see if it moves again and taking up and handling the pcs problems either at session start or atas they arise or at the session end these things and the handlingthe good handling of the meter of course these things are the problem of basic auditing now if you dont get good at that youre not going to make the way up along the line youre just going to close yourself right off along the line so lets not have any more nonsense about itsa is sitting in doughy slump with the pc trying to make session out of it thats the job of the auditor and you make sure that you do okay we still all friends thank you very much good night
