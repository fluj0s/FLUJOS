exceptions congressional employees cannot be required to take polygraph test workplaces in the legislative branch must be free of hazards that are likely to cause death or serious injury some

house officers may employ staff who are subject to the house employees position classification act 2 usc 291 and regulations on applicab employment standards issued by the committee on house

where personnel practices and guidelines are deve loped practices could va ry from office to office all decisions regarding activities and operations in members office are within the discretion of the

2 usc 611d1c2 similar explicit authority for member of the house was identifiedinterpreted with care using data from the house and senate studies raises concerns for several reasons related to data co llection and the poten tial consequences of organizing data by position title data collection issues electronic versions of the chamberappropriate survey were sent to 440 house member ffices and 100 senate personal offices the house study indicated that its data we re based on the responses of 141 320 member offices while the senate study indicated that 81 senate personal offices replied the house study asserts that its information allows for stable conclusions to be drawn about the po licies and practices of th current member offices18 the potential precision of that assertion is not clear since the report provides none of the supporting evaluations or qualif ications of how well its da ta sample might represent the whole population of house personal offices similarly the nate study provides explanation of how representative its da ta are with an 81 response rate differences between the survey results and actual practice are likely to be smaller than differences in the house report neverthele ss senate data could be affected by the challenges of surveying samples of re latively small populations and the potential diversity of employment and compensation pr actices in senate offices as with any survey based on sample of selfselected respondents there is risk that the resulting data may not be represen tative of the population as whole finally survey of the type conducte d for the house and senate requires reliance on respondents some problems ma arise due to lack of timely responses to the questions and in having to rely on the survey respondents to be forthcoming in responses knowledgeable about the c hoices from which they select and in possession of complete information qu estions concerning who in each member office responded to the survey and how potential differences among individual respondents might affect the fi nal data are not addressed in either report neither report provided any information regarding the characteristics of survey respondents organizing data by position titles categorizing congressional staff positions by position title19 relies on an assumption that similarly titled positions in house and senate personal offices carry out the same tasks unde r essentially similar circumstances while personal offices may carry out similar activities the assumption might be questionable given the differences in staff resources in house and senate offices as well as potential di fferences within offices of each chamberhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34545crs6 20 each member of the house may employ more than 18 permanent

at large representative representative from state with one seat in the house attends to the same constituency as that of senate office from the same state but the senator would have at his or her disposal budget that could potentially support up to twice as many staff as would the representative20 at the other end of the spectrum there may be differences in the nature of operations in the offices of senators from states with large populations with staffs as much as fi ve times larger than those of their house colleagues who represent districts of cons iderably smaller populations within those states since an elemen t of staff position respons ibilities might be based on organizational size and complexity th differences between house and senate member offices could result in differences in job duties between incumbents in similarly named positions within the senate there might be differences in the nature of position duties in the offices of senators from states with larger or smaller populations within either chamber there may be differences in staffing approaches due to varied approaches to the work of congressional office or because members have wide range of varying priorities that particular staff positions serve acknowledging the imprecision inherent in congressional job titles an older edition of the senate handbook states throughout the senate individuals with the same job title perform vastly different duties21 other concerns regarding the organiza tion of data according to job title are related to the unique congressional empl oyment environment as well as the aggregation of position data in the surveys these factors might have an effect on the validity and reliability of any of the congressional duties and functions presented for any position in either chambers studies the analytic reliability of information contained in the surveys may be questi onable due in part to the following differences between the surveys position descriptions and what incumbents in those positions actually do of concern in both surveys is the question of how we ll position descriptions proffered by the survey administrators matched daytoday activities performed by incumbents in those positions table 1 summarizes responses to questions that attempted to distinguish differences between the proffered position descriptions and the activities respondents actually carry outhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34545crs7 22 this finding excludes partial job titles that do not match one of the 14 titles as well as compound titles such as legislative counsel legislative aide and counsel etc if systematic approach to including partial matches to the 14 titles were pursued the number of alternate titles for each position could rise substantiallyimprecision and lack of consistency of job titles in congress the house and senate surveys identif ied several alternate titles for each of the 14 positions the lists were created by asking respondent offices for alternate titles in the senate responde nts identified 118 alternative titles to the 14 titles offered by the survey administrators and appearing in both surveys in the house similar questions identified 69 unique titles applicable to the sample job descriptions provided by the survey administrator similarity of tasks carried out by staff with similar or dissimilar titles it may be the case that congressional staff in some positions with vastly different job titles perform similar duties in several instances alternate titles match one or more of the 14 titles evaluated here as well as several of the pos itions that were identified in only one chamber22 cross listed job titles are presented with each positions duties and functions breadth of roles carried
