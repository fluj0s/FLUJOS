sensitivity of the data drives many of the policies and restrictions that control access to the br and prtt bulk metadata however because of the different roles and responsibilities of analytical and technical personnel both have different authorizations to touch the metadata recall from module 1 we defined touching the data as any form of data handling that creates an opportunity for violation of the fisc orders to occur these activities may include data acquisition modifyingpreparing the data querying viewing results of the queries and even oversight and compliance functions analytic

the metadata for intelligence analysis purposes must be done in controlled way via tools designed to limit intelligence analysis access to ras approved identifiers and to the appropriate number of hops using these tools also provides reasonable assurance that these queries are tracked and top secretsinoforn page 10 of 10 top secretsinoforn technical personnel info audio file name ovsc_1205_m5_5040_t tssinf technical character technical personnel create test and implement tools to make this data easier for analytic personnel to use while validating that safeguards appropriately control analysts access to the bulk metadata additionally technical personnel may access the metadata to perform those processes needed to make the metadata usable for intelligenceanalysis these processes may include metadata validation the defeat of the collection processing or analysis of metadata associated with identifiers and the maintenance of records to demonstrate compliance with the terms of the authority tssinf in order to do this work effectively technical personnel are allowed to access the metadata using identifiers that are not rasapproved in the case of identifiers technical personnel may use nonrasapproved identifiers to query the metadata to confirm if the identifier is hidentifier and thus should not be included for target analysis they may then share the identifier and the fact that it is aidentifier with authorized personnel however other information resulting from such queries can be used for intelligence analysis purposes tssinf technical personnel must take great care with their responsibilities because they may be accessing the data through tools that do not have safeguards such as that impose restrictions and minimize the chances of violation of the fisc orders as result we need to maintain boundaries between technical and analytical personnel and be crystal clear as to the circumstances under which the two groups can interact top

authorizations to touch this metadata because of these different authorizations we must be careful when the two types of personnel are interacting with regard to this metadata specifically outside of the sharing ofidentifiers for defeat purposes technical personnel should only be providing analytical personnel information under certain conditions tssinf hmc character1 sometimes when analyzing the results of intelligence analysis queries one or more of the specific results may seem out of the ordinary is it identifier that was overlooked is the identifier misnormalized is there something that just seems out of place or perhaps there is particular data field in your results that you dont understand in such instances intelligence analysts may require assistance from certain technical personnel responsible for data integrity functions tssinf technical character in these instances technical personnel may assist authorized intelligence analysts but any and all assistance must be based on rasapproved identifiers and those results found within the number of hops authorized for intelligence analysis purposes essentially when providing information to analytical personnel in these circumstances the technical personnel must abide by the rules for the analytical personnel tssinf technical character in the end all personnel have vested interest and shared responsibility in
