aﬀairs defense and trade division february 15 2008 abstract there is large and growing diﬀerence between the oﬃcial trade statistics released by the united states and the peoples republic of china according to the united states the 2007 bilateral trade deﬁcit with china was 2563 billion according to china its trade surplus with the united states was 1629 billion 934 billion less this paper examines the diﬀerences in the trade data from the two nations in two ways first it compares the trade ﬁgures at the two digit level using the harmonized system to discern any patterns in the discrepancies between the us and chinese data this comparison reveals that over twothirds of the diﬀerence in the value of chinas exports to the united states is attributable to ﬁve types of goods the second approach to examining the diﬀering trade data involves review of the existing literature on the technical and nontechnical sources of the trade data discrepancieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs226401

defense and trade division summary there is large and growing difference between the official trade statistics released by the united states and the peoples republic of china according to the united states the 2007 bilateral trade deficit with china was 2563 billion according to china its trade surplus with the united states was 1629 billion 934 billion less this paper examines the differences in the trade data from the two nations in two ways first it compares the trade figures at the two digit level using the harmonized system to discern any patterns in the discre pancies between the u s and chinese data this comparison reveals that over twothirds of the difference in the value of chinas exports to the united states is attributable to five types of goods the second approach to examining the differing trade data involve s review of the existing literature on the technical and nontechnical sour ces of the trade data disc repancies this report is updated annually after the release of official trade data by china and the united states us trade with the peoples republic of china china is becoming increasingly contentious as the us bilateral trade deficit rises1 debate over this trade deficit is hampered because of disagreement between the two countries on how large the deficit actually is according to official us figures china surpassed canada as the largest supplier of us imports running up bila teral trade surplus of 2563 billion in the process however according to the chinese its trade surplus with the united states was only 1629 billion 934 billion less than the us figure see table 1 the size of the bilateral trade deficit so is an issue in proposed legislation addressing trade relations with china for instance hr 1002 which would impose tariffs on chinese imports unless china revalues its currency explicitly lists the official us figures for the bilateral trade deficit with china among its findings similarly hrhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22640crs2 2 china values its export data using the free on board or fob method and its imports are valued using the cost insurance and freight or cif method the united states values its exports using the freight along side or fa s method and its imports are valued using the customs value method the implications of the different evaluation methods is discussed later in this report782 and s 364 which would classify exchan ge rate misalignment or exchange rate manipulation as countervailable export subsidy both cite bilateral trade deficits as evidence of exchange rate misalignment or manipulation comparison of us and chinese trade data table 1 lists the official trade statistics from the united states and china for the years 2001 to 2007 using official trade data2 according to both countries the us trade deficit with china is large and growing where the two sides differ is how big the deficit is and how fast it is growing from the us perspective its bilateral trade deficit with china more than trebled in value over the last seven years from just over 83 billion in 2001 to over 256 billion in 2007 however from the chinese view its bilateral trade surplus with the united states increased nearly sixfold over the last seven years from about 28 billion in 2001 to nearly 163 billion in 2007 table 1 us and chinese trade figures 20012007 billion us dollars yearus trade figures ch inese trade

and loading the goods as result the fas value of shipment is less than its fob value 9 the customs definition only includes the actual cost of the goods it does not include the cost of insurance and freight as result the customs value of shipment is less than its cif valueunited states precious stones was 18th5 the 10 chapters listed above provided 758 of the value of what the united states said it imported from china in 2007 and 724 of what china said it exported to the united states on the other side of the trade equation there were three chapters where chinas imports exceeded us exports by more than 1 billion and two chapters where us exports exceeded chinese imports by more than 1 b illion chinas imports from the united states of machinery 84 electrical machinery 85 and optical and medical equipment 90 were more than 1 billion greater than the us exports to china however us exports to china of iron and st eel 72 and aircraft chapter 88 were more than 1 billion greater than chinas imports from the united states it is also worth noting that on both sides of the trade balance equation two of the greatest differences in the official trade sta tistics of the two nations occurred in the same hs chapters machinery 84 and electrical machinery 85 the discrepancies between the official trade statistics for these two type s of goods have been consistently large for flows in both directions since 2001 this indicat systemic difference in the evaluation of the bilateral trade of these goods explaining the differences summary of the literature the question as to why chinas official statistics are routinely much lower in value than the official us trade statistics has been and continues to be the subject of analysis by scholars government officials and other in terested parties the following is short review of some of the key explanations provided in this literature categorized into technical and nontechnical explanations technical explanations refer to procedural or administrative causes for the discrepancies nont echnical explanations include causes arising from nonproce dural or administrative sources technical ex planations official definitions of exports and imports in its official statistics china evaluates exports using the more commonly used free on board fob definition6 and the cost insurance and freight cif definition7 to evaluate imports the united states however reports its exports evaluated by using the freight along side fas definition8 and values imports using customs definition9 as result official us trade data places lower value on both us exports to china and imports from china than the official chinese data in add ition direct comparisons of th official us and chinesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22640crs5 10 after

reexports resulte d in 22 billion reduction in the trade balance difference for 2003 trade balances reported in the media are pot entially misleading because the goods trades are being evaluated using diffe rent methods for more accura direct comparisons the trade data for both nations should be deter mined by using the same definition such as general internationa l convention of fob for exports and cif for imports definition of territory the united states includes puerto rico and the us virgin islands in its trade data china does not comparatively minor source of difference in the trade figures timing because of the distance between ch ina and the united states it takes time between the export of the goods from china and their import in the united states goods in transit at the end of the year are counted as exports by china but not as imports by the united states however the lag between ship ments occurs at the beginning and the end of the year and thus minimize the effect of timing on the overall trade balance difference declaration of c ountry of origin the current practice of us customs is to rely on the declaration of the importer to dete rmine the country of origin some analysts believe that importers are identifying significant amount of imports as chinese exchange rates because chinas currency th renminbi peoples money is allowed to fluctuate within small range against basket of foreign currencies the exchange rate between the renminbi and the us dollar changes over time the value of shipment may change between the date it leaves china and it arrives in the united states due to changes in the exchange rate althoug h the renminbi has appreciated against the us dollar over the last couple of years exch ange rate changes are not considered major factor in the discrepancy in the trade figures nontechnical explanations intermediation although estimates vary most analysts agree that large portion of chinas exports arrive in the united states via third party hong kong being the most commonly identified location10 the intermediation of shipments raises two sources of discrepancies first the ex porter from china may not know that the goods will eventually be shipped to the united states and will list the third party eg hong kong as its destination but us customs will list the sour ce of shipment as being china second the value of the shipment may change with or without any actual change in the goods between its arrival in and depa rture from the third location as result the chinese export value will be less than the us import value underinvoicing some analysts believe that chinese importers may intentionally under value imports from the united states to lower the import tariff due on the shipment in addition some analysts believe that ch inese exporters may in tentionally under value exports to the united states to maximize th eir net proceeds overseas for various tax andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22640crs6 11 david

is difficult to assess how much this may be contributing to the differences in the trade data implications for congress just as in past years the release of th official us trade figures for 2007 was soon followed by expressions of concern about the u s bilateral trade defi cit with china peter morici university of maryland professor reportedly made the following comment on the uschina bilateral trade balance gap in exports compared to imports creates drain on demand for us goods that will push us into recession11 china however does not accept the accuracy of the official us figure for the sino us trade balance in 2007 china s foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said imbalances in chinaus trade are an objective fact but this is also related to the two sides different st atistical methods12 also when considering means or actions designed to reduce the us trade deficit with china it is useful to know which g oods are the main sour ces of discrepancies between chinese and us trade figures and how important they are in the overall trade flow between the two nations so that trade remedies may be better targeted at the problem according to this report the main problems appear to be in the trade figures for electrical machinery machinery and toys and sporting goods for those causes of the differences re sulting from data compilation such as misidentification of value or country of origin of imports congress may choose to appropriate additiona l funding for the responsible us agency andor provide for training or assistance to chinas customs services in other cases more detailed analysis of the trade data may be helpful in persuading china to amend or alter its laws regulations and policies pertaining to the import or export of goods to the united states
