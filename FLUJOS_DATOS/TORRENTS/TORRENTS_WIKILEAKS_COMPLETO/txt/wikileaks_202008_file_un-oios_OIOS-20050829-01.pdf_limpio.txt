important weaknesses in financi controls highlighted in its 1999 and 2002 audit reports had not been addressed marked shortcomings in financial management persisted at the representation in 2005 basic proc edures were neglected leading to failure of critical internal controls rendering the representa tion vulnerable to financial loss overpayments and fraud oios detected apparent overpayments of solarhazard allowance amounting to some us 76000 which upon subsequent examination by th representation turned out to have been embezzled by the finance assistant the financ assistant who had not been

review focused on 2001 projects covering expenditur of us 45 million the audit assessed the operations as average with significant shortcomings in financial manageme nt and procurement oios regrets that its 2005 audit cond ucted some three years later showed little improvement in financial management at the represen tation 3 in 2004 there was significant increase in the volume of unhcr operations in burundi in addition to the two old caseloads of r efugees there was mass influx of refugees from the democratic republic of congo drc two ne w projects were set up to deal with this latest unforeseen influx of up some 35000 golese refugees from the drc in july 2004 an additional project in 2004 involved the nticipated return of up to 90000 burundian refugees back to burundi in view of the magnitude of the returnee population supplementary programme for the return and reintegr ation of burundian refugees was set up this followed the november 2003 peace negotiations between the government and rebels though the security situation still remains tense nd uneasy 4 oios assessed the unhcr operations in burundi as be low average in 2003 and 2004 while generally agreeing that shortfalls and weaknesses existed in the operations the representation indicated that performance should be viewed in the context of the substantial upsurge in operations and also the financial and hu man resources placed at its disposal the representation pointed out that despite repeated re quests to the headquarters duly supported by the desk and the bureau the staffing for unhcr burundi was not strengthened until october 2004 5 the findings and recommendations contained in this report have been discussed with the officials responsible for the audited activitie s during the exit conference held on 5 may 2005 summary of preliminary findings and recomm endations was shared with the representative in may 2005 the comments which we re received in june 2005 are reflected in this draft report

04sbbdirp33 2 and 04abbdiem141 with expenditure of us 25 million our review concentra ted on the activities implemented by gesellschaft fur technische zusammenarbeit gtz expenditure of us 59 million austrian relief programme arp expenditure of us 137 million commission national reinsert sinistres cnrs government partner exp enditure of us 13 million min laction socialepromot fepade expenditure of u s 03 million centre pour lautosuffisance cadi expenditure of us 094 million and african humanitarian action aha expenditure of us 108 million we also r eviewed activities directly implemented by unhcr with expenditure of us 63 million 8 the audit reviewed the administration of th representation at bujumbura with administrative budgets totalling us 733 million f or 2003 and 2004 and assets with an acquisition value of us 112 million and current value of us 207 million the number of staff working for the unhcr operation in burundi wa s 145 this included staff on regular posts united nations volunteers and staff on missi on 9 the audit also followed up on findings and recommendations made in the 2002 oios audit regarding financial management 10 the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents in particular for solar and hazard payments and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations review of implementing partners 11 for the six partners reviewed reasonable assurance could be taken in respect of gtz cadi aha and cnrs that unhcr funds were properly ccounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subagreements in respect of t he remaining two partners namely arp and fepade oios could not obtain assurance that fun ds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with subagreements oios ssessed that internal controls of most partners were generally weak and not operating effe ctively and as consequence attention was required on these aspects during project verifi cation 12 audit certificates for all partners were r eceived in respect of the 2003 subprojects tors for the selection of an audit firm for verific ation of 2004 ips accounts have been issued and the exercise will take approximately month to complete gtz i accounting and financial management 13 oios observed during its review that gtz d id not use their usual standard accounting software winpaccs to record and monitor unhcr pro ject expenditure and instead made use of excel tables for accounting requirements ios requested for winpaccs and ams 3 printouts but was provided only with excel outputs gtz responded that they had indeed been using winpaccs and ams in burundi the account ing in excel was temporary measure pending verification of spmrs by unhcr upo n acceptance of the spmr the expenditures were recorded in the ams with furth er possibility to make changes oios cautioned against using excel alone for accounting in view of the potential for manipulation and unauthorized changes the representation stated that they would be vigila nt in ensuring that authorized changes would be made between th interim excel accounting results and the final recording in winpaccs 14 observing transfers between budget lines nd sectors in excess of the permissible limits oios recommended that transfers between bud get lines are carried out within the level of authority delegated to the partner and that the permission from unhcr should be obtained for any transfers that exceed the stipulated 15 per cent limit gtz took note of the recommendation and assured that they would avoid tr ansfers in excess of permissible thresholds the representation would monitor compli ance ii insurance payment 15 the gtz truck fleet operates under insuran ce cover obtained internationally and the insurance premiums are paid by unhcr under the sub project accordingly in the event of mishap involving an insured vehicle the partner is expected to immediately inform unhcr and also to credit funds received from insura nce claims to the corresponding sub project in june 2002 unhcr truck was involved i n an accident that claimed the lives of several burundian refugees being repatriated to the ir homeland following protracted negotiations an agreement was reached to compensat the families of the victims to the extent of some us 120000 the compensation amoun t was apportioned equally between unhcr and gtz with unhcrs contribution being char ged to the repatriation subproject in 2002 2003 and 2004 16 oios however found that gtz had received some us 130000 from the insurance company in july 2003 but had not disclosed this to unhcr and in the meantime continued to charge unhcr subprojects in 2003 and 2004 oios accordingly recommended that gtz should immediately reimburse to unhcr an amount of us 66351 representing the amount charged to the repatriation subproject and appropr iately credit the eu project original source of funds further when the insurance compa ny pays for the repair of the damaged vehicle estimated at some us 12000 this amount too should be reimbursed to unhcr acting promptly gtz reported that an amount of us 66351 had been transferred to unhcr headquarters in may 2005 oios confirmed that the amount had been received and further recommends that the eu project be credited accordingly and that the costs of the repair of the accident vehicle estimated at some us 12000 should also be pursued with the insurance company the representation later informed that an amount f euro 8580 had been received by gtz from the insurance company for repair charges and would be refunded to unhcr iii procurement 17 supporting documentation was lacking for g tz international procurement of spare parts purchases of some us 09 million made in 20 032004 were supported only by spreadsheet order status report summarizing the stimated costs of the various orders and the expected delivery dates in the absence of copi of the payment vouchers andor invoices oios was not in position to assess whet her the amounts charged to the spmrs 4 were substantiated and free of material errors oio s assessed that in 2004 some us 327000 was charged to the spmrs even though the spare part s had not been received gtz stated that the last consignment of spare parts ordered in 2004 had reached bujumbura and reconciliation would be done between spares ordered and spares received in order to improve the tracking and management of spare parts gtz will also install the new version of the pms software 18 procurement procedures used for purchases were not compliant with gtz own manual on procurement oios noted frequent procurem ents in excess of the threshold of 12500 that should have been approved by gtz head quarters this was the case for the procurement of several consignments of gas oil and of construction materials for procurement below the threshold proper procedures were not always followed procurement activities were not fully and transparently documen ted and we observed cases where proper competition was not evidenced gtz responded that corrective measures had been introduced and that all procurement above the ceili ng of 12500 would be approved by gtz headquarters and below this ceiling by the local of fice unhcr would also be invited to participate in the bidding process iv fuel management 19 fuel management required improvement and ios observed weaknesses in receiving procedures nonavailability of waybillsdelivery n otes and discrepancies in quantities of fuel despatched to the field and what was received in th field controls over receipt of fuel by gtz were particularly weak with none of the fuel t anks gas oil and petrol equipped with functioning dipsticks or fuel flow meters receipt of fuel is acknowledged only on the basis of the suppliers documents and independent meas urement was done accordingly gtz had means of assessing their daily stock levels or if the vendor had supplied the contracted quantity however the consumption of fuel could be measured at the point of dispensing the fuel from the pump following reports of discrepancies in fuel records between the unhcr logistics unit and gtz the representative set up team to review these differences the team has presented its report that is under conside ration though in the meantime some new control measures to monitor fuel management have be introduced by gtz gtz added that three fuel tanks of 17500 litres equipped with flo w meters were now operational in field locations v vehicle utilization 20 oios reviewed the utilization of trucks fr om january till march 2005 and noted that the utilization levels were rather low ranging from 14 per cent in january 2005 rising slightly to 17 per cent in february and peaking at 27 per ce nt in march 2005 the low levels of utilization also meant that the 23 drivers on the p ayroll were also underutilized this was indicative of lack of proper planning as at the sa time other implementing partners including cnrs and cadi spent substantial amounts f or the rental of trucks records evidencing vehicle utilization in 2004 were not ava ilable unhcr and gtz should keep the utilization levels under regular review and if the present trend continues consider reassessing the overall fleet requirements at ruyigi the representation informed that fleet utilization rates had improved due to increase in the number of returnees from tanzania and deployment of the fleet to assist rwandan asylum ekers and transfers of refugees from bujumbura to gasorwe and gihinga the representation further indicated that the weekl meeting between the logistics sections of unhcr and gtz would continue to monitor the fleet utilization rates 5 b austrian relief programme 21 the austrian relief programme arp has be working with unhcr in burundi for some years in 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005 the partnership with the ngo was under strain and encountered numerous difficulties arising mainly out of accounting reporting and management problems within the ngo i n early 2005 unhcr decided to suspend the partnership due to several adverse repo rts the representation later informed that the suspension of partnership was lifted following arps commitment to improve its managements practices in view of the gravity of ios findings as detailed below however it is emphasized that the reinstatement is contingent upon the partner demonstrating concretely its pledge to improve i double charge of subproject expenditures 22 oios was not satisfied with the excel base d accounting system operated by arp as this does not provide the necessary security and da ta can easily be altered or manipulated oios noted that considerable number of transactio ns with significant amounts had been duplicated resulting in an overcharge to the 2004 s pmr of at least some us 15000 the double charges were too numerous to be considered s mere errors occurring during accounting on excel in some cases the double pos ting was intentional and there was an attempt to inflate expenditures as the original sup porting documents were photocopied and used to support the same amount elsewhere to reduce the incidence of such problems and in the interests of harmonization and standardization unhcr proposes to purchase the sage saari software for its implementing partners arp also stated that an amount of fbu 1122 million us 10300 was refunded to unhcr since the double posting identified by oios amounted to us 15000 the balance amount of some us 4700 was pending recovery following oios recommendations an additional amoun t of fbu 763 million us 7000 has been identified for recovery and will be recove red shortly 23 the filing system adopted was less than sa tisfactory with purchase order invoice payment voucher and delivery notes all filed separ ately in various folders though pertaining to the same expenditure oios did not see any part icular justification for such filing methods and could not exclude that some of the doc uments may be used to justify the same expenditure under different funding given that arp was also cofunded by the european union austrian cooperation the american embassy nd various other donors the representation stated that arp is under regular clo scrutiny by the project control officer and all project documents funded by unhcr would be stamped with the unhcr logo ii expenditures incurred beyond liquidation dates 24 observing commitments for large amounts an d expenditures beyond liquidation dates in 04sbbdirp332 04abbdiem141 and also for 04abbdirp370 oios recommended that arp should strictly adhere to the clauses of the subagreement and not incur expenditures beyond the liquidation date mor eover the final 2005 spmrs should be thoroughly scrutinized to ensure that expenditur relating to 2004 commitments previously charged to the 2004 subprojects are cha rged again arp stated that they noted the recommendation and assured that they would work clo sely with unhcr to avoid expenditures after the liquidation dates in the fut ure arp also refunded unhcr an amount of fbu 4498 million us 41300 being the unspent balance of 04sbbdirp332 the representation added that c lose scrutiny by unhcr project control would preven t recurrence of the same problem in 2005 6 iii procurement 25 arp is not prequalified to make procureme nt and hence must abide by unhcr ip procurement guidelines for purchases our review of procurement processes at arp showed that the procedures followed were deficient and non compliant with the guidelines procurement documentation was wanting for most purc hases evidence of competitive bidding goods received notes waybills and proper invoices were not available in some cases only handwritten invoices supported some vou chers even though the amounts involved exceeded us 10000 purchases of doors an d windows etc were made from several suppliers between august and december 2004 for some us 83400 despite the large amounts involved there was evidence that compet itive bidding procedures had been applied procurement documentation for the numerous construction projects implemented in particular relating to the choice of contractors wa s deficient and there was evidence that competitive procedures had been adopted several ma jor construction projects were mostly awarded only to two contractors the representation stated that arp had started to f ollow bidding procedures and would invite unhcr for the pening of bids and awarding of contracts and also that project control and logisti cs section would monitor compliance with procedures iv common costs 26 since there are numerous donors in the in terests of transparency and fairness arp should reach an agreement with unhcr on the methodo logy to be used for allocating common costs such as communications utilities off ice supplies office rental salaries etc according to arp currently these costs are simply charged to unhcr subprojects up to the amount provided in the relevant budget lines with any excess absorbed by arp and other donors the representation informed that discussions were u nderway with arp to agree on modalities for allocation of common costs recommendations head2right the unhcr representation in burundi should given t he management accounting and other problems confronti ng the austrian relief program closely observe the ac tivities of the partner by frequent monitoring visits the l evel of procurement delegated to the partner should be rest ricted till the partner develops the capacity to follow th ip procurement guidelines rec 01 head2right the unhcr representation in burundi should request the austrian relief program to agree with unhcr transparent methodology for allocating common costs among the various donors rec 02 c cnrs 27 for the 2004 repatriation subproject oio s observed commitments of some fbu 59 million us 5400 and recommended that they shoul d not feature in final spmrs controls over bank transactions also required strengthening as reconciliations were being carried out and there were substantial differences between the bank balance and the amounts reported as unspent balance in the spmr cnrs stated that commitments would not be included in the spmrs and that monthly bank reconciliation would be carried out and independently 7 reviewed payment vouchers and standard procedures were not used for authorization and approval of expenditures also the unhcr subprojec t was not clearly indicated on the voucher and expenditures were not properly supporte d cnrs took action to introduce the use of payment vouchers that are duly authorized and ap proved with unhcr project codes endorsed thereon in view of common weaknesses among implementing par tners the representation also proposes to conduct training fo r partners on accounting financial reporting internal controls bank reconciliation nd procurement procedures 28 procurement procedures were weak and subst antial amounts were spent without proper competitive bidding and full documentation w as also not available for instance some us 100000 was spent on the hiring of trucks and t he ip procurement guidelines that the partner was obliged to follow were not observed the representation advised that the programme and logistics sections would conduct an i nternal review of procurement procedures adopted by implementing partners in orde r to recommend course of action for the 2006 subagreements 29 in august 2004 new unhcr vehicle was st olen from cnrs employee while parked at his house according to cnrs they had w arned staff not to take any official vehicle to private residences especially in certai n specific areas including the area where the vehicle was stolen from and that the concerned em ployee had disregarded the warning cnrs explained that the services of two staff membe rs have been terminated following lambs recommendation to request cnrs to refund the depreciated value of the stolen vehicle us 19600 letter was issued to cnrs cnrs expressed their inability to reimburse the value of the stolen vehicle and advis ed that legal proceedings had been instituted against the former head of cnrs in makam ba and the driver who were allegedly involved in the theft in order to ensure that recovery is effected the re presentation will recover the amount due us19600 by retaining the equivalent amount from the next instalment to be paid to cnrs under subproject 05 sbbdirp332 in view of the large amount involved oios requests for confirmation of recovery d fepade 30 unhcr terminated the partnership with fepa in january 2005 following series of unprecedented developments such as the disappea rance of the director project coordinator with all the accounting records chequ ebooks computer on which the records were maintained and also the carjacking of the unhc r vehicle and loss of cash amounting to some us 4600 despite highlevel discussions betw een the ministry of social affairs and the ministry of justice attempts to secure the ret urn of accounting and other records from the former director have proved unsuccessful the carja cking case is pending with the tribunal and decision is awaited the ministry of social ffairs has sought and obtained freeze on the fepade bank account that had balance of some fbu 32 million us 2950 31 it was assessed after reviewing the interi m spmr and the bank statements that some fbu 178 million us 16400 could not be substant iated and should be returned by fepade unhcr has since formally requested fepade to refund this amount the representation confirmed that most of the unhcr ass ets held by fepade had been returned to unhcr and the recovery of the remaining assets would be pursued oios requests to be informed once the recovery is made i potentially fraudulent transactions 8 32 oios was informed that the former project coordinator director was the only signatory of the bank account and she kept the che quebook in her custody it was understood that she alone made all accounting entries and prep ared the financial reports though there was an accountant for such work oios review of t he bank statement for 2004 showed significant cash withdrawals for payment to supplie rs in bujumbura for example within one week from 14 through 21 june 2004 she withdrew total of fbu 9865 million us 90594 for the cash purchase of agricultural equipment from local suppliers oios discussed the matter with the new coordinator who was previously the field coordinator who explained that the supporting invoices were pro bably fake as these were pro forma invoices altered to appear as an invoice he could not however substantiate that the transactions were fraudulent oios questioned the j ustification for the huge cash payments as most suppliers accept cheques and given the signifi cant sums of money involved the matter needs to be probed further it was brought to our n otice that in 2003 the auditor gave qualified opinion due to the lack of appropriate pporting documentation 33 the representation stated that they were following up the transactions but that they lacked access to the supporting documentation furt her that on 1 june 2005 letter was written to the procureur general republique requesting his intervention to pursue with the former fepade coordinator to account for t he utilization of the funds recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in burundi should in conjunction with fepade verify if the amount of fbu 986 million us 91000 withdrawn in cash in june 2004 was actually spent for the purchase of agricultural equipment by examining relevant records if the pur chases cannot be substantiated appropriate legal remedies for recovery should be pursued rec 03 head2right the unhcr representation in burundi should recover from fepade an amount of us 16400 representing 2004 expenditures that could not be substantiated rec 04 cadi 34 cadi incurred expenditure on subprojects after the liquidation period did not refund unspent balances promptly and spent money on items not authorized in the subagreement based upon oios observation the representation re quested cadi for refund of some fbu 2071 million us 19000 that the partner agr eed to refund the amount in installments internal controls over cash and bank transactions w ere weak and needed to be improved bank reconciliations were done in 2003 and the firs t bank reconciliation was dated february 2004 and was prepared by the accountant though the re was evidence of review by an independent official the representation agreed that bank reconciliations were not being done properly by most partners and will organize tr aining sessions for the partners 35 oios review of construction contracts sho wed that proper tendering procedures had not been consistently applied adequate supporting documents were also not available for construction expenditure totalling some fbu 11923 million us 110200 similar inadequacies were noted for transport and furniture contracts cadi stated that supporting documentation has been sent to the representation w here these are being reviewed the representation also informed that in view the inade quacies of the partner the advisability of 9 continuing the partnership with cadi in the context of the 2006 programme would be evaluated recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in burundi should ensure t hat cadi makes the refund of us 19000 in installments as agreed rec 05 f african humanitarian action 36 weaknesses in banking procedures were note d as the partner did not carry out bank reconciliation properly the representation will conduct training in this ar ea aha is not prequalified partner for procurement though it wa s entrusted with significant procurement of drugs totalling some us 286000 this procurement was mostly done from single vendor at prices that were markedly more expensive than in ternationalsms prices for essential drugs oios recommended that bulk drugs should be p urchased under existing unhcr frame agreements thus allowing significant savings local procurement of drugs should be limited to urgent requirements acting promptly the representation revised the 200 5 sub agreement and will undertake part of the purchase f drugs through sms under existing frame agreements b other programme issues 37 oios assessed that project financial and p erformance monitoring was systematically done and verification notes were prepared enabling the identification of problem areas in advance and subsequent remedial action however gi ven the nature of oios findings on most partners the frequency of monitoring visits s hould be increased in respect of those partners with weak systems and internal controls five per cent support costs to international ngos 38 the eligibility to five per cent headquart ers support costs for international ngos has not been consistently determined in accordance with unhcr guidelines for instance the support costs for aha were not correctly calculated after excluding the local procurement component that was some 40 per cent of the budget leading to overpayment of headquarters support costs according to unhcr manual chapter 4 section 51 where the total budget for local procurement to be undertaken by the inter national partner exceeds 30 per cent of the total project value then the whole amount budgeted for local procurement should be taken out of the calculation the overhead costs propos ed for other international ngos should also be reviewed to ensure that the overhead costs have been correctly calculated the representation stated that the programme section wo uld conduct comprehensive review of the five per cent overhead costs budgeted for inter national ngos for the 2005 programme and inform oios of the cumulative financial impact of the review european union project 39 oios reviewed certain aspects of the 25 million voluntary repatriation project funded by the eu and were concerned about expenditu res unrelated to the repatriation of burundian refugees being charged to the eu project and about lack of transparency in allocating common costs oios was of the view that this may affect the accuracy and 10 reliability of the financial reports to the eu as w ell as the reputation of unhcr visàvis the eu as of april 2005 the stock loaned for congoles refugees had still not been returned with corresponding credits to the eu project oios recommended that any stock loaned from eu project valued at some us 225000 should be ret urned and that methodology be established for allocating part of the costs of war ehousing workshop vehicle fleet and other services to those projects and activities benefitin g from these services the desk for burundi stated in may 2005 that all items borrowed from the eu project to meet the emergency requirements of the congolese refugees had been re turned the representation stated that the final report on the eu funded voluntary repatri ation project has been submitted to the chief european aid cooperation office on 30 june 2005 40 the eu project included budget of 500 000 for external evaluations and independent audits by the end of 2003 unhcr had spent less than 14000 under this budget line representing the cost of audit certifi cates for implementing partners it was not until october 2004 less than three months before t he end of the project period that unhcr burundi approached the european commission to seek their approval to transfer the amount budgeted for evaluation and audit into 2005 in nov ember 2004 the ec delegation in burundi informed unhcr that the funds for evaluatio n and audit had to be used within the operational period of the project ie prior to 31 december 2004 and that it was therefore longer feasible to arrange for the evaluationaudit foreseen under the project agreement instead the ec itself intended to conduct finan cial verificationexpost evaluation in september 2005 41 as result the funds totaling more than us 06 million provided for evaluation and audit may have lapsed it is unfortunate that unhc r did not discuss the modalities for the arrangement of an evaluationaudit and the funding conditions at an earlier stage when it was not too late to take an alternative course of actio n c supply management i procurement 42 an lcc was established and functioning dur ing 2003 2004 and 2005 however oios noted that unhcr procurement procedures were n ot always adhered to and various instances of noncompliance with the established th reshold for local procurement us 100000 came to notice as assessed by oios the cumulative value of contracts not submitted to the coc excluding the fuel contracts was some us 400000 oios noted with concern that in some instances the representation i ntentionally bypassed the unhcr procurement rules and the lowest bidder was sometim not selected simply because the total payment to that particular supplier had already rea ched the threshold of us 100000 and any further payments would necessitate submission t the coc 43 the representation procured fuel valued at some us 840000 in 2003 and 2004 and fuel was purchased from several suppliers on the ba sis of shortterm contracts for relatively limited quantities oios questioned why the procure ment could not be done through annual contracts which would lead to savings in time and cost the representation attributed the practice of small lot purchases to the absence of logistics officer hope of obtaining exemption from dutiestaxes and lack of adequate st orage capacity the representation subsequently informed that with the arrival of gistics officer greater control is exercised and longerterm orders are being placed for procure ment of fuel 11 ii asset management 44 asset management at the representation req uired attention though the lamb has been constituted there was considerable gap betw een its meetings for instance following the lamb meeting of august 2002 the next meeting wa s only in april 2004 due to the infrequent meetings the lamb is inundated with cas relating to the early 1990s and this means that the lamb cannot devote its time to more current work the lamb was not fully aware of its authority and jurisdiction and had to be reminded by the hamb that fully depreciated assets should not be submitted to the h amb and decisions affecting such assets should be settled at the field level 45 the assettrak software is operational and able to produce various kinds of reports the logistics assistant responsible for updating as settrak is however overwhelmed with the backlog of entries there were other lapses ou t of list of 50 accident vehicles in 2003 2004 only one case had evidence of police report only one case had duly completed gs 45 and gs 46 forms repair estimates were also lackin g and in the absence of such information it was doubtful whether referrals to the hamb could be made the representation stated that they faced difficulties in organizing lamb meetings due to the frequent movement of international staff members and the absence of dicated logistics officer an exercise to update assettrak is currently underway and the repr esentation will also complete administrative formalities for submission of the ac cident vehicle cases to the lamb the representation later also advised that lamb meeti ng was held on 30 june 2005 and that effective august 2005 the lamb would hold minimu m of two sittings each month iii private use of vehicles and generators 46 international staff members currently pay us 50 per month for private use of motor vehicles us 30 in 2004 and earlier and unvs stil l pay us 20 local staff was paying fbu 1985 per month less than us 2 monthly for g roup transportation to and from the office oios considered such charges as being unre asonably low and recommended revision effective may 2005 the representation has increase d the monthly group transportation charges for local staff to us10 47 international staff members are required t pay us 80 per month for the private use of unhcr generators from 1 january 2003 as per iom fom 022003 the representation however delayed application of the higher rates fo r two years till december 2004 and until then made recoveries only at the old rate of us 25 per month oios recommended that appropriate recuperation totalling some us 3200 s hould be made from concerned staff to make up for the amounts short recovered the representation stated that their finance officer was not aware of the revision of rates and that it would be unfair to request for retroactive recovery oios wishes to point out that the revised rates were properly disseminated to field offices lack of awareness of rules and policies cannot justify short recovery at lower rates on oios reiterating its recommendation for recovery the representation agreed that recoveries would be made by september 2005 d security and safety 48 bujumbura is under phase iii while some reas adjoining drc are under phase iv the security and communications cell in burundi assessed in december 2004 that unhcr is not fully moss compliant the memo from t he cell highlighted the need to introduce trauma kits protective film for windows antimine measures in field vehicles in 12 addition the fsa based in bujumbura has prepared document to add additional items to this list the representation agreed with oios that the locati on of the main office was in relatively insecure location owing to the large vol ume of traffic and emergence of commercial enterprises in the vicinity however there was an acute shortage of office space with the arrival of the onub mission measures will nonethel ess be taken to enhance security both at bujumbura and at the field offices administration 49 there were fundamental problems in some ar eas of administration and finance and unhcr offices in burundi did not fully and consiste ntly comply with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures basic principles in financial and cash management were ignored exposing the organization to potential fra ud loss and overpayments internal controls over solar and hazard payments in particul ar were assessed as very weak and in some cases even nonexistent i cash and financial management 50 unhcr bujumbura operated three bank accoun ts dollar account and two local currency accounts one convertible and the other nconvertible account cashbooks 9 10 and 11 corresponded to these bank accounts conve rtible account is normally an account expressed in local currency that can be used under local currency regulations for the purchase of other currencies however at the representation the convertible currency account was being used for daytoday transactions the authori zation from treasury to operate these accounts was requested by oios but was not provide d the representation stated that the convertible account would longer be used for day today transactions unsystematic filing of vouchers 51 the filing of vouchers required immediate improvement us dollar local currency adjustment notional and receipt vouchers were not properly segregated during review oios determined that many vouchers including receipt vou chers were not available in the monthly binders and could not be traced the missing vouchers were initially not satisfactor ily explained to oios and it transpired later that the finance assistant who had perpetrated fraudulent transactions had deliberately removed t he vouchers to conceal fraud the representation has since put in place an appropriat filing system using file dividers for different types of vouchers additionally the repr esentation is in the process of compiling detailed list of all missing documents and will the reafter request the bank for copies of any payment documents to establish the names of payees for any missing document this exercise is envisaged to be completed by the end of septembe r 2005 b noncompliance with cheque procedures 52 chapter 6 part 4 section 43 of the unhc r manual requires that field offices using foas follow certain basic instructions with regard to handling of cheques and cheque payments oios review showed that contrary to inst ructions i the representation was using more than one chequebook simultaneously ii large number of cheques were not in the name of the payee iii the payee approved man payments to himselfherself iv there were discrepancies in the cheque numbers shown in t he foas and those actually used to make payments in the bank iv the person who appr oved the voucher was different from the person whose name appeared as the approving officer and v bank reconciliation was not 13 satisfactorily performed reacting promptly to oioss observations the repre sentation stated that measures have been instituted to ensure that all chequebooks received will be serially updated into foas immediately upon receipt from the bank the representation has also taken measures to ensure only one cheque book is used at time names of payee on the cheques are exactly as reflected on the payment vou chers payees approve payments to themselves and that cheque details on the payment vouchers are correct and all bank reconciliations are routinely done and adequately reviewed c voided cheques used for payments 53 cheque voided owing to an error in its p reparation must be cancelled to prevent its fraudulent use all cheques must be accounted for whether cashed or voided in some instances the cheque numbers endorsed on the vouch er did not correspond to the cheque number actually used to make the payment in two ca ses observed by oios the finance assistant did not correctly feed in the cheque numb ers into foas when he received the chequebooks payment of some us 10400 was made in these two cases even though the voucher description stated that the cheques had bee n voided in two other payment vouchers oios observed that though cheques had been voided these had not been attached to the voucher though this is mandatory requirement in one of these cases payment of some fbu 48 million us 4400 had been made and the c heque had actually not been voided the representation clarified that the situation had been corrected and that all cancelled cheques would be dealt with in accordance with pres cribed procedures and henceforth be attached to payment vouchers 54 upon subsequent detailed analysis of fin ancial transactions oios determined that from january 1999 to may 2005 there were more than 500 voided cheques on average some 100 per year this cannot be explained only by fre quents errors but points to manipulation the single cheque limit of us 4000 set by treasur was also constantly ignored and oios assessed that total cheque payments in excess of th authorized limit amounted to some us 11 million during the period 19992005 oios c onsiders the huge number of voided cheques and other deviations to be critical flaws t hat undermine the integrity and credibility of financial transactions at the representation oi recommends to establish procedures and controls in accordance with chapter 6 of the unhcr manual and to conduct an indepth review of all financial transactions from january 1 999 onwards 55 in the december 2002 audit report oios h ad cautioned that the finance assistant should not be allowed to handle cash as among other things he had lost petty cash amounting to us 2700 prior to this in its october 1999 au dit report also oios highlighted the fact that payment vouchers were missing and that finance staff should not receive payments on behalf of others although oios was assured at tha t point in time that corrective measures were taken regrettably during our 2005 audit we bserved the very same issues detected in both previous audits denoting clearly that lessons were not learned the representation will ensure closer supervision of finance staff to avoid recurrence of such incidents additionally cash counts will be routinely performed to control loss or misuse of petty cash 56 training for 29 staff members was held in july 2005 on financial rules and regulations by headquarters team and attended by national and international staff from administration finance logistics human resources and programme sections another team from headquarters also conducted financial s ystems review and their report is awaited the recruitment of new finance assistant and finance clerk has commenced and the representation plans to have them in place by s eptember 2005 meanwhile the 14 representation has sought and obtained the services of two finance assistants from unhcr conakry ii solar and hazard payments 57 oios review of solar and hazard payments initially revealed what appeared to be considerable overpayments to international staff mbers amounting to some us 76000 in 2003 and 2004 as many solarhazard vouchers were m issing and there was significant failure of internal controls over financial managem ent oios considered that an indepth review was warranted including tracing cheques at the bank and accordingly requested an immediate followup review by the finance officer t the representation this review unearthed systematic embezzlement and forgery perp etrated by the finance assistant in 2003 and 2004 and possibly earlier as well in his repor t dated 16 june 2005 the finance officer estimated that the magnitude of the embezzlement co uld be some us 120000 in view of the gravity of the findings the matter has been re ferred to the igo the representation subsequently informed that besides fraudulent solar payments the finance assistant had also fraudulently withdrawn rental payments meant f or the muyinga office authority for lifting the diplomatic immunity of the finance as sistant has been obtained so as to expedite legal proceedings against the staff member 58 solar and hazard payments were poorly hand led with oios repeatedly observing lack of basic record keeping and deficient supporti ng documentation for these payments oios was concerned that the entire responsibility f or regulating solar payments was exclusively vested with the finance assistant whos work was not adequately supervised oios also noted that when the payment was made the description on the voucher was not sufficiently detailed names of staff members were often incorrectly written and on many occasions did not mention the month it pertained to also solar payments for several staff were often made through the same voucher without fficient detail in the voucher description making the tracing of payments difficul t payments for several months were also lumped together in one payment voucher payments we re also often made in advance every month and the vf 521 receivable account was used vi rtually as bank account 59 important procedural requirements were not followed resulting finally into significant loss for the organization for instance instructio ns further require that all payments of solar hazard allowance and other entitlements must be recorded on the reverse of the gta this important control was never complied with by the representation the accounting entries for solarhazard payments were also not don properly all these factors cumulatively facilitated the embezzlement and allow ed it to remain undetected until the 2005 audit 60 the representation acted promptly and issued instru ctions that all staff members must immediately open bank accounts and that the payment s of entitlements would be made into the account directly at the end of the month the v f 521 account will longer be used and the gta will be attached to every solarhazard paym ent with all payments being recorded on the reverse of the gta solar nonrecovery of rental deductions 61 international staff members who live in ho uses provided by the organization are subject to rental deductions to maintain equity in the application of post adjustment among staff members staff members who have been provided staff housing and who are in receipt 15 of solar are accordingly subject to deduction from solar at prescribed rates the rate of deductions depends on whether the accommodation has been categorized as substandard or standard the deduction being 25 per cent for subst andard accommodation rising to 50 per cent if it is standard substandard accommodation is defined as any type of housing or housing unit in staff compound or housing that cks basic amenities such as water andor electricity supply 62 the accommodation at ruyigi is categorize d as substandard even though it is not located within compound and has running water ectricity and satellite tv although the accommodation could be considered as standard oios is not questioning the categorization made by the representation oios does however tak exception that deduction rates were even below those applicable for substandard accommo dation since the solar in burundi is us 3900 per month the correct rate of deduction for substandard accommodation would be us 975 per month however staff members were payin g only some us 300 per month which implies short deduction of us 675 per mont h oios estimated the cost implications for unhcr on account of the short recovery at some us 80000 per year oios recommended that deductions be made at the prescrib ed rates with immediate effect acting quickly the representation enforced the correct duction rates from 1 may 2005 iii communications 63 controls over the recording of official an d private calls were assessed as weak for landline calls number of telephone request forms for both official and private calls had not been authorized as required where calls were show n as official the reason for the call was not indicated although there was provision for this on the form calls declared as official and private by staff members were neither adequately ve rified nor certified the representation stated that the forms would be filled out as requir ed and that manual system is in place to track and recover the cost of private calls landli ne and mobile made by staff members with the introduction of the new pamatetrak tracking sy stem additional controls will also be in place for identifying private calls new billing system would also be installed for faster and more accurate controls iv overpayments in travel claims 64 mistakes were noted in the processing of t ravel claims for international staff members in receipt of solar who were transiting through nai robi on their way to other destinations as nairobi is the apa for international staff recei ving solar dsa is payable for the time spent in nairobi oios however noted that this was repeatedly done at the representation and in the cases checked by oios ov erpayments of some us 1636 were observed the representation has since suspended the practice and will recover the amounts overpaid in one travel claim overpayment of some us 2670 was observed due to incorrect calculation of solarhazard and nondeduction of travel advance the representation will initiate recovery v medical evacuation 65 improvements were required in the document ation and recording of medical evacuation medevac cases file is maintained fo r medevac cases but this is incomplete and in some instances did not contain re levant supporting documentation the accounting for medevac was not done correctly as ex penditure charges to account 171 were largely missing suggesting that several cases were not coded properly the 16 representation will ensure that the medevac file is duly completed and kept updated the medevac control sheet will be prepared and the acco unting done correctly vi staffing 66 staffing constraints have had their impact on the management of operations between september 2003 and october 2004 the representation managed the rapidly escalating scale of operations with only five professional staff an d limited local staff during this period the staffing situation was characterized by shortages quick turnover of staff and reliance on shortterm missions 67 at the time of the audit the burundi oper ation was still dependent on staff on mission unvs consultants and deployed staff and t here were numerous vacancies particularly for professional staff six staff memb ers were on mission of varying durations and 11 unvs were posted at various locations besid three consultants the turnover of staff was rapid and key international positions suc h as deputy representative operations senior administration and finance officer and senio r programme officer were yet to be filled the representation informed that the senior program officer had since joined and that the two other posts would be filled by october 2005 as of august 2005 there has been marked improvement and 35 out of 40 professional staff and 95 out of 99 of the gs staff had been appointed through appbappc in the past even though fast track procedures were being used there were delays in staff members assuming posts to which they were appointed oios was told that in some cases staff m embers selected and appointed did not take up their functions for personal or for operat ional reasons vii medical insurance plan 68 procedural weaknesses were observed for th medical insurance plan mip number of cases were found where enrolment of staff members took far more than the benchmark of 30 days several payments were not pr operly processed and we noticed cases where the claimant had not signed the form and it w as also not certified also the representation did not maintain list of selected hospitals pharmacies doctors etc and the standard rates applicable this means that there i s benchmark available that can be used to provide guidance while regulating mip claims in veral cases where staff members obtained treatment abroad there was indication that the fundamental principle of reasonable and customary charges at the staff members country of residence were applied for regulating mip claims the representation informed that the delay in enrol ling staff on mip had occurred due to pressure of work and that with the arrival of the new fs human resources assistant the situation would improve the discrep ancies noted by oios have been rectified and the representation would apply the principle of reasonable and customary costs for regulating mip claims v acknowledgement 69 i wish to
