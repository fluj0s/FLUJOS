funding levels types of programs and problems in implementation of us assistance to other countries in fy1994 the new states of the former soviet union fsu collectively became the second largest recipient of us foreign assistance made available from all sources reflecting the exceptional importance attached by the us government to the region whether and how the assistance program is helping to bring about democratic systems and free market economies is increasingly question of interest to congress and the public at large since implementation for most of the aid program is only in its second year it is too early to judge success or failure however the program has attracted widespread comment and criticism on number of fronts questions include is the program being implemented fast enough although measures have been taken to speed up the process past obstacles have included the slow pace of reform lack of knowledge of the region an inability to identify reformist elements and congressional notification procedures is the program wellcoordinated at least 16 us agencies are playing role making coordination complicated and cumbersome process it is the responsibility of the state departments new independent states nis coordinator to develop strategy and allocate assistance to meet that strategy is assistance reaching the grassroots some believe that an approach favoring small nongovernment organizations ngos volunteer programs and exchanges is the best way to reach the people of the fsu what is the appropriate role of us consultants and contractors some suggest there are too many highly paid consultants performing questionable job is assistance being used for corrupt purposes despite the limited potential for corrupt uses of us funds concerns remain is us

may be useful to congress as it considers funding levels types of programs and problems in implementation of us assistance to other countries introduction in fy1994 the new states of the former soviet union fsu1 collectively became the second largest recipient of us foreign assistance made available from all sources2 this leap from program at all only three years before reflected the exceptional importance attached by the us government to the region and the multiple foreign policy objectives political economic and strategic that the aid program is intended to meet in the pronouncements of both the bush and clinton administrations as well as in series of authorization and appropriations bills approved by congress the united states seeks to foster democratic systems free market economies and responsible security policies in the fsu whether and how the assistance program is helping to bring about these objectives is increasingly question of interest to congress and the public at large oversight hearings congressional delegation visits and most recently amendments to the fy1995 foreign aid bill have focused on implementation issues prominent members of both parties have criticized the program for its slowness misplaced priorities and administrative disarray and have raised concerns regarding possible corruption and waste critical press reports most prominently in major publications such as us news and world report forbes and the wall street journal have generated additional interest largely as result of these multiple concerns congress cut the administration request for fy1995 nis aid funding from 900 million to 850 million further efforts to trim funding have been initiated on december 12 1 also known as new independent states nis consists of 12 of the former republics excluding the baltic states which were never recognized by the united states as part of the soviet union 2 the fsu received 22 billion in foreign operations appropriations grants including 16 billion fy1993 supplemental signed into law on september 30 1993 the supplemental is treated by the state department as part of the fy1994 aid budget counting food aid and dod nunnlugar disarmament assistance total grant aid in fy1994 was approximately 28 billion in fy1995 the region is likely to hold the number three position in us aid with more than 13 billion crs2 1994 senator mcconnell new chairman of the senate foreign operations appropriations subcommittee issued foreign aid proposal for fy1996 that includes 12 cut in assistance for the fsu from the fy1995 level the issue wrapped in hyperbole and distortion needs clarification this report first describes some essential features of the aid program types of assistance and specific activities being undertaken it then frames the basic issues that have arisen during its early implementation period and those that are likely to arise in future years and places the debate in perspective that will facilitate reasoned congressional deliberation overview of the us assistance program to the former soviet union purpose of assistance program judging by the freedom support act authorizing legislation subsequent appropriations bills and executive branch aid strategy statements congress and both bush and clinton administrations have held to the same objectives with regard to the use of foreign assistance in the fsu that is chiefly the establishment of democratic societies the promotion of free market economies the meeting of humanitarian needs and control and dismantlement of nuclear weapons3 in its january 1994 strategy paper the clinton administration added to these crosscutting theme the environment reflecting its emphasis on this subject in its worldwide foreign policyassistance program while all foreign aid is meant to serve us foreign policy the aid program for the fsu has been framed by congress and two administrations as more closely tied to this purpose than others what many believe to be the most important foreign policy focus of the united states is in large part an effort to facilitate an internal makeover of the new states something many believe foreign assistance can help advance the programs foreign policy tie is particularly reinforced by the appointment of the state department as coordinator of the program and the state department has repeatedly emphasized the programs unique and distinct 3 the latter objective is dealt with directly by the defense departmentfunded nunnlugar program and is not part of the traditional economic assistance program it is aimed exclusively at the four nuclear states russia belarus ukraine and kazakhstan although included in some specified aggregate aid amounts in this paper nunnlugar fund activities are not discussed in this report crs3 historic foreign policy purpose by noting that it is shortterm that the bulk of the russia program is destined to end by fy1998 and the others shortly thereafter4 to some extent the delivery of us aid is at the very least strong statement of us support for the changes occurring in the new states but assistance is intended as more than that us government commercial guarantees and insurance programs can facilitate us private investment considered by many to be key to the economic and political transition in the fsu technical assistance and training programs can help bring the recipient countries step closer to achieving an economic and political environment that would encourage that investment humanitarian aid can alleviate social and political stress strategic assistance can help encourage and facilitate disarmament to the extent it meets these multiple objectives the assistance program is playing useful role as an instrument of us foreign policy amount and terms of assistance us bilateral assistance something as seemingly straightforward as the amount of assistance provided by the united states has become the source of much confusion and misinterpretation yet getting it right is central to any judgment of the efficacy of the aid program since the program began some have argued that funding has been insufficient while others argue that large sums have been spent to effect how much does the united states in fact provide the answer to the question hinges in large part on what one counts as foreign assistance during the first two years of the program for example the state department tried to make the size of us contributions look significant presumably to demonstrate strong us support for the political and economic transition to an fsu as well as g7 audience5 although state has since developed somewhat more sound presentation of us aid contributions its old claims 176 billion as late as january 1994 may easily be viewed as overstated and are instructive in the potential for widely varying interpretations of the size and content of the aid program for example at one point more than half of the state departments aid total was made up of credit guarantees and insurance this sum included commodity credit corporation ccc agriculture credit guarantees program that insures the repayment of market rate loans used to purchase us food commodities it is commercial program rarely if ever considered foreign aid and in fact is prohibited by statute for such use state department figures even included 19 billion in loans provided to the region prior to the dissolution of the soviet union russia has assumed responsibility for this debt further although the overseas private investment corporation opic and the exportimport bank eximbank are 4 limited aid budget resources and the sense that russia and some of the other republics are not underdeveloped in human and natural resources lead state department policymakers to make distinction between more longterm aid to developing countries and that to the fsu russia is not rwanda is one such refrain 5 the group of 7 industrial nations the united states france germany britain canada italy and japan has taken leadership role in organizing donor assistance to the fsu crs4 part of the annual foreign operations bill which appropriates most foreign aid the face value coverage of their guarantee and insurance programs has never before been calculated and purveyed as specific dollar benefit to recipient aid country like the ccc program the eximbank is also commercial program designed to benefit us exporters finally unlike government reporting for other countries the state department aid levels included private donations delivered with publicly funded transport on the other hand it can be argued that the state department has been correct in including the face value of credit guarantee programs because other donors do so for the fsu program although none appear to include insurance coverage of the sort provided by eximbank and opic in addition russian defaults in the ccc program and rescheduling of debt have given it temporary concessional element6 finally all these programs can be defended as instrumental in supporting the regions economic and democratic transition some also suggest that aid totals might appear exaggerated because much of the claimed assistance either credit or grant has not yet been either obligated or disbursed further some charge that the aid is not directly benefitting the recipients but is remaining in the united states these last two concerns are discussed in more detail below given the varying interpretations that might be made of aid figures it is difficult to put precise dollar amount on us assistance to the fsu grant aid since fy1992 that has been made available but not necessarily obligated yet is roughly 67 billion 6 some suggest that given the odds of default the subsidy amount currently required to back up loans is insufficient see general

fy1993 were lost due to failure to obligate funds by end of fy1993 and fy1994 respectively in addition an estimated 669 million in concessional food loans and 55 billion in variety of commercial credit guarantee programs have been provided since fy1992 in fact the actual budget outlays for these programs are as little as crs6 onefifth of these amounts since only the subsidy cost has to be

guarantees fy1995 credits are figures available as of october 1994 b food for progress and pl480 title i programs loans made at low interest rates with longer than normal repayment terms us assistance and international financial institutions ifis from the start it has been generally understood that however much assistance the united states promises to provide to the region it is merely fraction of what is needed for example the international monetary fund imf calculated that russia alone would require at least 20 billion in outside assistance to meet its foreign exchange needs in both 1992 and 1993 as they put together programs of assistance in those years the g7 anticipated that the bulk of funding would come from three international financial institutions the imf the world bank and the european development bank ebrd7 member of these institutions the united states contributes between 10 and 20 of their costs and has often argued that similar proportion of their programs in the fsu may be viewed as us contribution to the region additional to its bilateral program for several reasons both the imf and world bank have provided much less assistance than was originally anticipated by the g78 the imf bases its loans on 7 the asian development bank also provides loans to central asian republics to date it has committed 60 million to kazakhstan and 40 million to kyrgyzstan 8 in april 1992 the g7 proposed 105 billion in multilateral assistance for russia including 6billion ruble stabilization fund to be allocated in 1992 in the end only 16 billion was offered in april 1993 the g7 proposed 184 billion in multilateral assistance for russia to present it has received roughly 66 billion of this see jeffrey sachs continued crs7 policy reforms which russia and the other states have been slow to adopt the g7 led by the united states have pressured the imf to forego its usual reticence and provide loans prior to reforms as way of encouraging progress rather than rewarding implementation the world bank has sent numerous experts to design prospective loan projects in wide range of sectors but few were approved by the russian parliament which was reluctant for the country to assume more debt in the past year however ifi programs have moved much more rapidly as of november 1994 they had provided or reached agreements to provide an estimated 113 billion of this sum the imf has lent 54 billion 42 billion of which went to russia in all the world bank approved 37 billion in loans 57 in 1994 alone for 28 projects russia accounts for 3 billion 82 of this total followed by kazakhstan with 276 million 7 of total the ebrd has approved roughly 21 billion 13 billion of which is for russia direction of funding which of the dozen new states receives us assistance has been continuing issue some observers including members of congress have expressed concerns that russia has been getting too high proportion of us assistance relative to the other republics indeed in absolute terms most aid to date has gone to russia reflection of its reformist policies enormous geography larger population and its importance in us security and economic policies as of september 30 1994 russia accounted for about 58 of total nis account obligations the bulk of the grant program 8 continued toward glasnost in the imf challenge mayjune 1994 p 411 for another view of what has been provided crs8 figure 1 us grant obligations by republic nis account fy19921994 although difficult to capture an everchanging program figures suggest that russia was receiving little more than half of bilateral grant aid allocations under the bush administration under the clinton administration the 1993 vancouver and tokyo announcements shifted allocations dramatically so that as much as twothirds of the us program was targeted for russia congress approved this formula in the 25 billion fy1993 supplementalfy1994 foreign operations bill in september 1993 after conferees overrode senate report language that criticized the emphasis on russia at the same time however it earmarked 300 million for ukraine although this could come from other aid spigots including nunnlugar after the december 1993 russian parliamentary election and increased criticism of the perceived russia focus the administration promised to provide future assistance on fiftyfifty basis some members of congress have continued to push for greater funding of the non russia republics as result in the fy1995 aid appropriations pl 103306 congress recommended but did not require that 150 million 75 million and 50 million be provided to ukraine armenia and georgia respectively russia is currently expected to receive 44 of fy1995 appropriations critics have taken the view that us policy is too russiacentered and given the political uncertainties there greater emphasis should be placed on fostering the transition in the new countries on its fringe some would counter however that the reason other countries have not until now received larger share of funds is that they crs9 have been far behind russia in meeting the basic conditions imposed by congress for such aid economic and political reform further according to the state department although russia receives the most funding in absolute terms it does not on per capita basis taking population into account armenia is the main beneficiary of us nisaccount grant assistance and russia is only fifth figure 2 us grant obligations on per capita basis nis account fy19921994 major categories of assistance the chief vehicle authorizing assistance for the former soviet union the freedom support act of 1992 laid out thirteen sectors in which assistance could be provided the fy1994 foreign operations appropriations bill broke the assistance program down into six more generic categories and unlike the authorizing legislation and the fy1993 appropriations earmarked specific amounts to be spent under each the fy1995 bill does not categorize the assistance many of these categories of assistance under what is now called the nis account overlap with one another for instance housing energy and democracy activities will facilitate private sector development the exchanges and training activities under democratic initiatives will bolster all the other sectors the commodity import program helps both the environment and us trade most but not all of the nis account assistance programs are managed by the agency for international development aid programs lying outside the foreign operations appropriations are also providing assistance these include the department of defense managed nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction program fy1992fy1995 1271 billion available and department of agriculture grant concessional and commercial programs crs10 fy1992fy1994 11 billion 669 million and 31 billion respectively in addition to defense and agriculture programs wide range of us government departments and agencies have been conducting their own small programs of technical exchanges many of which predate the fall of the soviet union and are funded from their own budgets fy19921994 activities estimated at 164 million set out below are descriptions of the major sectors and estimates of nis account grant obligations and other funds directed at the fsu under the foreign operations bill through fy1994 most of the projects described under each sector only started operating in 1993 or later and are only located in those states where they are expected to have an effective impact specific project activities noted are illustrative this is not comprehensive list figure 3 total direct obligations or transfers by sector fy19921994 private sector development estimated fy1992fy1994 obligation 980 million or 356 of total the bulk of us grant technical assistance has gone toward variety of efforts to promote the development of private sector in the fsu the main activities are crs11 privatization this project considered by many to be the most successful us effort to date has provided technical assistance and equipment to gki the russian body that has privatized 80000 small businesses and 14000 medium and large enterprises much of this privatization has been done through national auction system that is the progenitor of stock market other republics are beginning to follow suit the project is also providing advice in land titling and privatization of farms postprivatization us advisors are beginning to implement number of activities in russia to help businesses and farms once privatization has occurred one effort is to find ways to breakup monopolies that are the heritage of large government enterprises including the food warehouse system and trucking industry another is to help set up the basis of payments system allowing the transfer and deposit of funds throughout the country and an independent securities and exchange commission us experts are also assisting in the development of commercial laws further number of credit related activities are underway as noted below g7 sponsored programs the united states has pledged 125 million to the special privatization and restructuring program g 7 effort to provide postprivatization capital and technical assistance of this 100 million has created fund for large enterprises 1000 to 10000 employees sponsored by opic and aid the united states has also contributed 9 million to an ebrd small business fund to assist microenterprise lending enterprise funds the russianamerican enterprise fund approved in september 1993 is eventually expected to receive total of 340 million to lend funds to and invest in small and medium up to 2500 employees business ventures and provide some technical assistance central asia fund and western nis fund were

exportimport bank the bank provides export financing in the form of insurance direct loans and guarantees although previously drawing on its general budget for fy1994 the eximbank received 300 million in subsidy costs to support its program in the fsu the first time congress has earmarked specific regional appropriation for the bank most activities to date have been in russia but the bank has also established operations in belarus kazakhstan turkmenistan and uzbekistan so far it has approved 15 billion in mediumterm guarantee commitments for russia including the first tranche of projected 2

aspects of democratic systems governance judicial process ngos and the media in particular there are also exchanges and training programs which while dispersed over an array of sectors share the notion that exposure to the united states its people and business will inculcate an appreciation for democratic ideals and behavior more successfully than other means the major initiatives under these categories are listed below exchanges and training the sabit program implemented by the commerce department provides internships in us businesses more than 288 to end of fy1994 the usdaimplemented

represents only portion of the humanitarian assistance that has gone to the fsu since fy1992 in addition roughly 15 billion in food and medical assistance has been provided under the auspices of usda administered food aid programs and department of defense food and medical excess stock donations and transport assistance programs the main freedom support act efforts are listed below food and medical aid although the united states is not paying for the socalled social safety net it is transporting and providing food and medical assistance to some of the most highly vulnerable groups affected by the transition and political disruptions in some of the new states particularly infants pregnant women lactating mothers pensioners and families displaced by ethnic strife health support hospital partnerships program links us and fsu institutions 227 partnerships to date through which training and equipment are being provided in an effort to improve vaccine and pharmaceutical production technical assistance is being supplied on manufacturing standards and regulatory practices equipment and raw materials have been supplied and efforts are being made to stimulate us private sector investment energy and environment fy1992fy1994 2831 million or 103 of total much of the fsu is an environmental disaster area with severe consequences for human health and productivity

and troop withdrawal fy1992fy1994 2145 million or 78 of total the united states is taking twopronged approach to help develop private housing sector in the fsu policy reform and actual housing construction housing sector reform aid is helping to develop solutions to various problems of housing ownership it has helped privatize the maintenance of apartment buildings whose individual units have themselves already been privatized it has helped establish condominium model of ownership and is advising banks and governments on the creation of housing finance market and mortgage lending officer resettlement in april 1993 president clinton promised the construction of 450 housing units for officers returning from the baltics construction is currently underway an additional 5000 units were to be constructed but problems in the pilot project scarcity of serviced land local corruption inflation in construction costs led to change of plan now 2500 units will be constructed and 2500 vouchers worth up to 25000 will be crs16 provided allowing officers to find their own housing many credit the successful withdrawal of russian troops to this program12 assistance implementation issues between december 1991 and april 1992 the first significant allocations of funds for technical assistance and training were made13 aid teams were sent to the former soviet union to assess problems and propose projects by the time contracts were signed and the first wave of contractors aid and other government personnel appeared in moscow and several of the other new states it was late summer 1992 what the assistance implementors encountered were societies with few of the legal political economic or social institutional frameworks that characterize most modern free market industrial democracies deficient or commercial taxation or civil law meager private sector with almost none of the financial or other service institutions that support that sector elsewhere and weak and undeveloped non governmental organizations of the sort that compose the bedrock of democracy in the west the us assistance program sought to help change this at this time only small part of the assistance program is more than two years into implementation and less than onefourth of available funds for technical assistance have been spent concrete achievements include the shaping of privatization programs in russia kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan formulation of russian civil code part of which has been approved by the parliament and introduction of jury trials in russia while there is movement on many fronts it is still too early to judge the success or failure of specific projects nevertheless much can be said regarding aspects of project implementation that might have bearing on success of the whole aid program and us policy in the region the program has attracted widespread comment since its inception members of congress analysts and other observers question the pace of program implementation the development of an aid strategy and the success of efforts to coordinate program implemented by numerous government agencies they question whether the assistance is getting beyond recipient governments to reach the maninthestreet and if the aid is being used for corrupt purposes many also are concerned regarding the impact an extensive use of consultants and contractors is having on the program and if the program is sufficiently utilizing and helping us business finally observers critics and supporters alike want to know if us 12 see crs report 94812 f russian officer resettlement program by steve woehrel for further information 13 in december 1991 the bush administration notified congress of 5 million economic support fund allocation on march 31 and april 1 1992 the house and senate respectively approved hjres 456 the further continuing appropriations bill allowing the president to utilize reprogrammed esf resources for further assistance another 230 million was provided crs17 assistance is being used effectively to meet us policy objectives in the region this section examines the range of such concerns is the program being implemented fast enough pressures to accelerate and delaying factors since the attempted coup in august 1991 that led to the dissolution of the soviet union policymakers and analysts have viewed this period as rare and perhaps fleeting window of opportunity to affect successful transition to democracy and free market economies prior to introduction of the freedom support act in april 1992 many in congress were highly critical of what they perceived as the bush administrations failure to react to these changes with an appropriate sense of urgency in bringing foreign aid programs to bear on events in the region in fact the bush administration had begun to formulate program using the existing economic support fund esf in december 1991 but the slow pace of implementation of this program even after it was supplemented with freedom support actbased appropriations in october 1992 continued to draw criticism therefore when the clinton administration sought to show support for president yeltsins reforms at the vancouver summit in april 1993 it made point of promising rapid implementation of its 16 billion package of assistance14 by the end of july 1993 officials stated that 64 had been obligated and by september 30 97 had been obligated15 the issue however was raised again following passage of the 25 billion aid package for fy1994 by the end of june 1994 only 694 million of the 21 billion16 in fy1994 funds available under the nis account had been obligated17 however by december 1994 18 billion 86 of the fy1994 funds had been obligated although obligations are sign of movement there can be considerable gap between the signing of contracts and the placement of technical assistance experts and other incountry project activities leading to actual expenditures for example the russianamerican enterprise fund whose contract was signed at the end of september 1993 did not provide loan until july 1994 there is question 14 the vancouver aid package consisted mostly of 700 million in food for progress concessional aid 194 million in food aid grants 215 million in nunnlugar only about 260 million was aid assistance 15 obligations are the legal commitment of funds by the us to recipient governments contractors and other entities expenditures or outlays represent funds paid from the us treasury 16 of the 25 billion 300 million was provided directly to eximbank 55 million was rescinded and dod kept 55 million earmarked for transfer using it for nis programs 17 there were number of plausible reasons for this delay including congressional holds and the sizable growth in the appropriation nevertheless three to four month gap between the appropriation and transfer of dod funds to aid appears to have been delay caused by bureaucratic snafu crs18 however that overall more and more projects are coming on line and their activities becoming visible in the field18 aid has taken steps to shorten the project timeframe typical of projects elsewhere in the world officials have eliminated paperwork and delegated responsibility so that at least in the case of the high priority privatization project workplan for up to 2 million can be initiated without cumbersome approval process and team can be put in the field 30 days after the workplan is completed process that used to take 45 months now takes one this policy however is inconsistently applied and many contractors complain of lengthy delays in getting workplans approved procurement procedures have also been accelerated but it still takes five to seven months to select new contractors obstacles ironically in the name of expediency most of the programs were developed and until recently largely run from washington rather than in the field as is the case with most aid activities most decisions still have to be reviewed and approved by washington both by aid and by the state departments nis coordinators office further squabbling between agencies has also slowed the process see below aid in particular has been criticized for the length of time it takes to approve the six monthworkplans that each contractor has to submit prior to taking action in the field in authorization and appropriations language congress established general criteria and specific conditions on provision of assistance failure to meet these conditions has been an obstacle to aid delivery many countries ukraine and belarus are examples have not adopted basic economic reforms that might assure us assistance will not be wasted recent commitments by ukraine have led to dramatic increase in promised us aid turkmenistans political and economic situation discourages large aid program there the security situation in some countries tajikistan for example prevent more than provision of humanitarian aid those who criticize the administration for not disbursing aid more widely to nonrussia republics ignore these constraints arguing that the assistance would help to move events in more positive direction initial ignorance on the part of us policymakers and aid implementors regarding conditions players and problems in russia and the rest of the fsu has been severe obstacle to rapid implementation contractor personnel some with experience of the region seem to have had difficulty getting their bearings and establishing working projects on the ground the lack of knowledge of an uncertain and fluctuating situation within the fsu led aid to establish broad sector projects using rolling design process in which technical resources are drawn from pools of consultants as needs and appropriate local counterpart organizations are identified but the imprecise and flexible nature of these projects has made the detailed notifications congressional committees are accustomed to receive difficult to draft some projects were put on hold while 18 annual expenditures have increased from 231 million in fy1993 to 609 million in fy1994 aid expects expenditures to rise to 1 billion in fy1995 crs19 negotiations were conducted with the appropriations committees consequently notifications to obligate funds are provided only 30 to 90 days prior to obligation when greater detail of project activities can be supplied some believe this process diverts aid staff time to briefings and paperwork rather than project implementation variety of legal and procedural concerns have further slowed things down nuclear industry representatives refused to begin work on an aid project to help improve safety at fsu nuclear power plants until their liability in the event of future accident was established the enterprise funds for the fsu were unable to go forward until problems and concerns raised in practice by the eastern europe funds were resolved to the satisfaction of the house appropriations foreign operations subcommittee and according to one report lengthy congressional review delayed by 11 months independence for the eurasia foundation19 too fast some would argue that the program has in some ways been implemented too rapidly they say that the political impetus to show us action led to poorly thought out projects some suggest that in order to obligate funds quickly the larger us consulting firms received amounts of funding far greater than these regionally inexperienced firms knew what to do with them meanwhile smaller more grassroots and culturally knowledgeable organizations they say were left to await funding as subcontractors is the program well coordinated at least 16 us agencies are playing an implementing role in the us assistance program leading to early criticisms of coordination project duplication little project complementarity and coherent aid strategy are among the complaints heard during the past two years as the fsu program got underway in december 1991 president bush having already faced similar criticisms of the eastern europe aid program appointed an aid coordinator in the department of state deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger and richard l armitage as his deputy under president clinton ambassador thomas w simons jr has served as aid coordinator and the focal point for the us assistance program20 congress in the freedom support act made the state department coordinator responsible for designing an overall assistance strategy ensuring coordination among us agencies pursuing coordination among other donors insuring proper management implementation and oversight by those agencies and resolving disputes between them in recognition of the foreign policy importance of 19 management systems international evaluation of cooperative agreement with citizens democracy corps april 15 1994 p 11 20 strobe talbott who served as ambassadoratlarge for the nis until he was replaced in february 1994 by james collins has played prominent role in the program until he became deputy secretary of state the appointment of talbott was said to have improved aid coordination partly because unlike eagleburger he could devote full attention to the region and add his clout to interagency squabbles crs20 the assistance program presidential charter of may 1993 put ambassador simons in charge of the assistance coordination group an interagency body under the direction of the policy steering group headed by strobe talbott and all under the national security council according to the charter the assistance coordination group was responsible for the allocation of us assistance resources and the interagency process for design and implementation of all policies and programs dealing with bilateral assistance both bush january 1993 and clinton january 1994 administration strategy statements contain general guidelines that tell what the us objectives are outline specific approaches ie emphasis on use of the private sector for example and explain broad country goals and priorities changes in the assistance strategy during the first year of the clinton administration illustrate the role of the coordinators office in setting broad guidelines for assistance in the course of 1993 an effort was made to make the assistance program target more grassroots peopletopeople activities focus added assistance on the private sector and nongovernmental organizations and concentrate on areas outside moscow this approach is reflected in the january 1994 strategy statement it may be some time before its programmatic changes are actually implemented in the field by the numerous agencies involved in the program but in theory the assistance strategy is the marching order for the us assistance program in the fsu table 3 major us government assistance providers obligations from nis account through fy1994 in millions aid 19225 department of commerce 306 us information agency 1492 department of state 176 securities

tda 310 department of treasury 171 congressional research service 29 crs21 during the past year the coordinators office with input from other agencies as well as us embassies in the fsu has also begun to develop and produce individual country aid strategies these are slightly more detailed than the regional statement and try to tailor the program to fit country needs the strategy for russia was approved on may 19 1994 for ukraine on june 23 for countries of central asia on july 8 and armenia and azerbaijan on october 31 strategies for belarus and georgia are expected to follow the ability of the coordinator to translate broad policy into aid programs and projects has been questioned some believe that the coordinator acts more as an arbitrator of agency differences than dictator of policy much of the time it handles the bickering and disagreements of the numerous implementing agencies in the face of agency heads with their own influence in the administration it appears that the coordinator has had insufficient clout to dictate action in many cases the coordinators authority to allocate resources does allow him to mold program content the coordinator strongly supported the housing construction program the enterprise funds and special opic fund in the face of adamant opposition from some agencies when it was decided to spend 200 million on educational exchanges and training the coordinator reviewed the different programs and allocated funds between aid and usia he mandated funding of peace corps operations through the fsu account budget over aid opposition when the trade and development agency tda proposed support for the russian land commissions privatization effort and aid opposed it on the grounds that the body was not sufficiently reformist the coordinators office led the interagency discussions that led to final determination on which russian body would receive us support the coordinator was also reportedly responsible for new shift in emphasis and resources from technical assistance to trade and investment leading up to the yeltsin summit in september 1994 nevertheless there has been widespread impression that the coordinator office has little power part cause or part effect of this is the rise of other centers of decisionmaking on assistance issues the white house national security council and the gorechernomyrdin commission have played major roles in determining assistance priorities during the past year in april 1994 then congressional leaders richard gephardt and robert michel produced memo to secretary christopher severely criticizing the coordination effort the initial response to this congressional criticism was to seek replacement of coordinator thomas w simons jr despite wide respect for his competence and knowledge the state department was said to have been looking for higher profile person who might have more clout with other agencies two such people reportedly turned down the position and ambassador simons has been continuing in his post many however believe it is the power of the office not the occupant that needs strengthening aid and other agencies much of the nis coordinators time has been employed allocating resources and resolving turf wars between agencies most of the disputes appear to involve friction between the agency for international crs22 development and other agencies not surprising because most of the assistance funds ostensibly flow through aid allocations or transfers from aid to other agencies totalled 5246 million or about 21 of nis account fund obligations made to the end of fy1994 although aid sees assistance programs as its charge the unusual foreign policy motivation of the fsu program and the weakness of aid in recent years resulting from poor management and perceptions of incompetence have given other agencies an opportunity to carry out these programs first in eastern europe and now in the fsu some argue that russia is not like number of developing countries and aid is illequipped to run program there but other agencies have not operated in the fsu either and do not have the management experience aid can argue it possesses for insuring effective project monitoring and financial accountability the legal argument for or against aids sense of ownership of the funds they call them our funds not the taxpayers say critics is not entirely clear cut21 house report language on the freedom support act suggested that where there was expertise within the us government it should be used but it also expected that aid would be responsible for overseeing and implementing the majority of us bilateral assistance the final bill adopted senate provision that provided blanket authorization for all agencies conducting eastern europe activities to conduct activities in the fsu as well but it did not attach specific agencies to projects in the way the seed act had done22 it gave chief authority for implementation to the state coordinator but subsequent appropriations legislation has insured that funds would be funneled through aid to other agencies involved in the program funds move from aid to other agencies in two ways under section 632a of the foreign assistance act funds are transferred to other agencies which then obligate them under certain terms and conditions aid is not expected to monitor or evaluate the use of those funds alternatively under section 632b transfers aid has oversight responsibilities funds are provided for use by another agency but they are considered part of aids budget obligated by it and the recipient agency must allocate funds and meet aid reporting requirements as though they were an aid contractor in the first year of the fsu aid program most transfers were 632b now they are mostly 632a and interagency friction has reportedly diminished according to the freedom support act sec 102d implementing agencies are accountable for funds made available to them providing funds to other agencies through aid whether 632 or b unfortunately creates the problem of focusing all blame on aid and in the view of its own inspector general is excuse for not monitoring their use however other agencies have much less experience monitoring programs and do not have many or any field personnel in place one aid 21 see aidig report of february 26 1993 aids oversight role for interagency agreements under the central and east europe and nis programs needs clarification 8 0009302 22 the support for east european democracy act of 1989 pl 101179 authorizes assistance to the states of east and central europe crs23 officer who dealt extensively with 632b transfer agencies has remarked on the inability or unwillingness of some to provide aid with even the most basic budget information23 if true this may stem from simple failure to recognize congressional requirements for accountability lack of experience with corruption in other countries or agency resistance to being managed by aid like contractor from aids point of view contractors are preferable to agencies the former have financial incentive to show impact while the latter cannot be controlled24 field coordination how coordination or the lack of it affects actual project implementation in the field is concern for policymakers when many agencies and contractors fail to coordinate programs redundancy the most often cited consequence is only part of the problem in the volga region there were repeated seminars during 1993 on privatization banking and related topics conducted by the peace corps and aids privatization contractors it is not so much that one may repeat what the other has done but that there may be an overload of activities targeted at the same audience that produces level of frustration and disillusionment with the aid program among the recipients this is particularly exacerbated by the lack of strategic planning that failure to coordinate simply reflects everyone in the field admits that the real need of fledgling businessmen and farmers alike is credit at reasonable interest rates but us aid projects have until recently only been able to offer seminars and advice comprehensive and integrated program might link up peace corps business advisers with private sector consultants and microand small businesscredit program in one region alone where sufficient funds might be made available to make difference until the past year there has been failure to make the assistance program one of teamwork as late as september 1993 peace corps volunteers most in touch with local businessmen in the volga region had contact with usia regarding exchanges that might benefit their clients voca volunteers in cooperative assistance farmertofarmer officers were aware of some of the exchange opportunities offered by aid and usda but only because of their own spadework not any coordinated outreach on the part of us government officials during 1994 however aid began to develop more integrated program it is establishing at least ten small business development centers throughout russia that draw on iesc peace corps the mba enterprise corps the aid education and training projects the citizens democracy corps and other assistance efforts there are number of factors in the field that have exacerbated the coordination problem up to now decisionmaking is still made in different agencies in 23 according to the aidig report reports are often not submitted p vi feb 26 1993 report 24 according to aid omb circular a76 says that government agencies should be used only where they are uniquely suited and not competitive with private enterprise two examples suggest that an inclination of agencies to use their own personnel rather than contractors can cause problems epa reportedly had begun sending stream of its staff to do series of tasks leading the russians to complain about the lack of continuity and having to explain the same things over and over again the center for disease control reportedly sent out junior fellows to advise the russians crs24 washington and feedback from field personnel has been dispersed among them rather than directed at the state coordinators office the aid mission presence remains small concentrated solely in moscow for the russia program almaty for all of central asia kiev for all the ukraine moldova and belarus and yerevan for all of the caucasus only few other agencies usia commerce peace corps agriculture have field mission personnel who could be responsible for developing complementary programs while relationships between agency personnel in the field are said to be cordial and interagency meetings are regularly held in the aid office to discuss what others are doing there was little effort in the first two years of the program to create an interrelationship and teamwork among consultants and project implementors there was mandate for them to do so contractors coordinated activities among themselves on an ad hoc basis to insure that coordination has an impact at the implementation level of the assistance program the gephardtmichel memo recommended that deputy coordinator be placed in moscow the idea of local coordination czar had been considered for some time previously and appears to have been adopted by state in the form of an assistant to the ambassador susan johnson who arrived in moscow in early autumn 1994 is assistance reaching the grassroots many critics argue that us assistance does not directly reach the maninthe street and is not allocated in way that lets the general public in the fsu know the united states is supporting reform in response to these concerns the clinton administration announced in april 1993 that it was seeking to make its assistance program more visible to the average russian citizen the president claimed that 75 of new russian assistance would be used outside of moscow and the same proportion would be provided to nongovernmental bodies it is plausible that the administrations numerical target will eventually be met however it likely to take long time before fsu populations are broadly cognizant of the impact or source of us assistance programs for one the level of us assistance is simply not substantial enough to blanket the fsu with programs secondly different types of assistance affect discrete groups and have different repercussions for the economic and political transition in the region these impacts should be kept in mind when the united states allocates assistance or observers judge its success for example humanitarian activities food aid to vulnerable groups and provision of vaccinations in central asia directly benefit the grassroots however while these are highly beneficial to particular groups and possibly serve to still political discontent they are shortterm solutions not contributing directly to the political and economic transition and represent only small proportion of the nis account although the idea of providing social safety net was supported by number of prominent analysts including harvard economist and russian government adviser jeffrey sachs the united states never considered it as something it could do alone it would require immense sums crs25 policy reform projects deal closely with fsu government agencies and often appear to have the least direct impact and least visibility at the grassroots level however many would argue that it is precisely such programs that might have the most long term and widespread impact on peoples lives and on the success of the transition privatization reform for example although largely conducted at the national level has pervasive impact on how the grassroots live and conduct business although many consider these activities the most successful use of us aid funds in russia the concern that russian nationalist sensitivities not be exacerbated by an overt and obtrusive us presence has led the program to maintain low profile further as local reformers are identified policy reform technical assistance is increasingly being provided at the oblast and municipal levels those favoring grassroots programs while not opposing humanitarian or policy reform assistance call for greater support financial and programmatic for wholly different approach they argue that grassroots programs are often more effective in transferring skills and knowledge to emerging entrepreneurs and government personnel than other technical assistance programs because they are more responsive and quicker to respond to the needs of people are more culturally sensitive establish long term relationships with the us private sector and therefore carry multiplier effect and build local nongovernmental institutions that are the building blocks of both free markets and democracies25 there are many different grassroots programs and each has different impacts volunteer technical assistance programs the farmertofarmer program the peace corps and the international executive service corps iesc bring us volunteer specialists to the fsu exchange programs bring fsu nationals to the united states including educational exchanges the reverse farmertofarmer program and the sabit program that provides internships in us businesses ngo support programs eurasia isar and the ngo development program fund institutional development of local organizations the key feature of most of these programs is that they attempt to reach out to local people and assist them directly to do this most have set up field offices outside of the major capitals often employing young and culturally sensitive americans and many more fsu nationals eurasia foundation grants and the development projects of ngos and pvos private voluntary organizations are good examples of grassroots activities that may have broad impact although high proportion of their funds go through us organizations26 the emphasis of their small grants is to reach local ngos and others in joint programs that might develop the local organization assist in local policy reform or facilitate management and administrative training to entrepreneurs tens of thousands of small local ngos have sprung up throughout the fsu in the past few years in country which always depended on government and has lost its charitable traditions the success of these pvos and ngos is essential to any sustainable democracy but assisting them 25 forthcoming study by nancy lubin for the project to reform aid to the nis funded by private foundations highlights the achievements of grassroots projects 26 as eurasia foundation establishes more field offices three new ones in fy1994 it expects higher proportion of direct grants to fsu organizations crs26 carries some risk in that many are likely to fail due to poor management and limited funding sources and many are suspect in their intentions and leadership environmental programs run by us organization the institute for soviet american relations isar are repeatedly praised by observers with aid funding isar has supported environmental organizations throughout the fsu it has established an electronic mail network linking these organizations currently more than 60 groups are linked in this way provides grants to support educational and other programs disseminates information on environmental activities elsewhere in the world and is supporting joint projects between us and fsu groups reports on farmertofarmer volunteers consistently attribute significant increases in production or sales to wellplaced advice for instance fivefold increase in the productivity of private fruit and vegetable storage facility due to suggestions on use of labor incentives and better hiring practices27 some however question the cost effectiveness and impact of grassroots approaches they argue that grassroots technical assistance generally affects only individual farms actually former collectives now budding agribusinesses industrial firms or ngos not the agricultural or commercial systems as whole the way assistance to governments can in fact while volunteers tend to be targeted on specific farm or organization they are often utilized on wider scale and the demonstration effect of their work also has broader impact while smallscale grassroots operations volunteers and forprofit are usually if not always less expensive than experts when operational costs and length of service are taken into account it is difficult to calculate the relative value of these activities visavis experts28 in the end impact depends on the match of volunteer or grassroots worker to recipient organization the length of service and the experience connections and knowledge of the individual concerned29 similarly some believe that educational exchanges and training strongly promoted by some members of congress are costly and have an impact on the relatively few who can be brought to the united states30 these exchanges in fy1994 there were 8300 funded by aid and 9300 by usia appear to be largely discrete activities not bonded together as part of any coherent program as was the 27 isar midterm evaluation july 22 1994 by mary heslin and edward hodgman internal evaluation for farmertofarmer program in russia of tri valley growers inc march 1994 by ted weihe 28 during 1993 153 iesc volunteers each served roughly eight weeks in the fsu at cost to taxpayers calculated on worldwide basis of roughly 31000 each in 1994 peace corps volunteers serving one year in russia cost about the same expert costs both salaries housing and benefits by comparison can be as high as 252000 per annum 29 even volunteers must be matched to reformers if there is to be an impact for example see underwhelmed in ukraine across the board may 1994 p 4850 30 perhaps the best defense of bringing people to the united states is the old russian saying better to see once than to hear seven times crs27 case for instance during the marshall plan31 but again their impact depends largely on who is targeted from what sector and qualifications and what kind of training they receive length and quality ie internships degree programs specialized tour high school student exchanges managed by usia have little immediate impact on institutions in the fsu but may be good public relations and an investment in the future32 short term up to sixweek visits for government and business people may have little impact unless tailored for individual needs perhaps making specific business connections or transferring particular skill33 some charge that exchanges are chiefly benefitting the old guard elite who are more likely to speak english and to have access to us officials if volunteer and ngo programs located in the field are drawn upon for candidate nominations the exchanges are more likely to represent grassroots needs there is evidence to suggest this is beginning to happen alternatively many believe setting up management and accountancy training facilities in the fsu itself would affect more people and be more sustainable in the longterm the director of the volunteer mba enterprise corps for example asserts that the most useful assistance would be education and training to create an understanding and prepare people for participation in the private sector and most effective would be instruction of the entire staff of an enterprise something that 31 some analysts argue that costeffective exchange model provided by the marshall plan be extended to the fsu program the productivity campaign provided highly specialized study tours of us industry to managers labor officials engineers and the like with an emphasis on how us management marketing and production techniques had made it the worlds most productive country lesson not without relevance to the fsu the campaigns had the virtue of extensive follow up for instance they required participants to write handbooks of what they learned for later dissemination to their peers back home and they helped set up productivity centers in each country to provide training materials and other assistance to enterprises media campaign worked in tandem according to some analysts enterprises experienced 25 to 50percent increase in productivity within year of exposure to the campaign while industrial conditions in the fsu require more than this complete restructuring and dramatic change in the policy environment the model shows what good followup and comprehensive approach thousands of enterprises participated can do see jumpstarting excommunist economies leaf from the marshall plan by james m silberman charles weiss jr and mark dutz in foreign affairs janfeb 1994 v 73 p 2126 according to aid officials the fsu assistance program does pay some attention to follow up concerns for each trainee or student 1000 is allocated to support followup activities it can be used for course professional workshop or journal subscription and many trainees are part of larger project that may maintain contact in the longrun 32 in fy1994 4631 nis students came to the united states and 2195 us students went to the nis 33 september 1993 aidig audit of the department of commerce sabit program that sends russians to intern in us businesses found returned interns interviewed reporting favorably of the experience participants said it exposed them to us business practices and promoted understanding between americans and nis citizens but half of rather small sample doubted they would be able to use their training crs28 could only feasibly be done in the fsu34 aid has begun to support series of training institutes located throughout the fsu what is the appropriate role of us consultants and contractors corollary to the assertion that aid funds are not making it to the people of the fsu is the complaint that all the funds are going to us consultants as wall street journal article put it hordes of us consultantsare gobbling up much of the us aid pie35 among other concerns some have suggested that consultants get paid too much there are too many of them and contracting procedures are unfair and bureaucratic consultants in addition to other major components of us assistance humanitarian aid educational exchanges infrastructure equipment and loans to business technical assistance provided by us consultants whether highpriced financial market specialists or lowstipend peace corps volunteers is an essential element the purpose of us consultants here as in foreign aid programs worldwide is to transfer knowledge and skills in short supply in the recipient country in this case it can be argued that americans have experience in the transition process from communism but they do know substantially more than locals regarding the structure and function of free markets and democratic institutions there are however number of legitimate concerns regarding the use of consultants russians are bothered that they have to rely on others for help but to some extent this is an unavoidable price of receiving aid there is nevertheless concern regarding strategy of assistance that might ignore the cultural norms of recipient country or fail to utilize sufficiently the expertise and skills of local people which in the case of the fsu is considerable such program would not be likely to successfully adapt us advice to the social and political environment of that country and would fail to be accepted at times the assistance program has been charged with exactly this deficiency the gap between announcement of the aid program and actual implementation in the field the predominant use of us contractors and the delay in establishing grassroots programs noted above helped foster the sense that local people were not being used at all lack of familiarity with the recipients and difficulty in identifying appropriate local expertise likely inhibited their use in the early stages and may still be factor however while for practical and political reasons most project experts are going to be drawn from the united states local personnel are being used increasingly in support and other roles for one thing as us contractors have set up offices and initiated their projects they have generally hired local staff at all 34 jack behrman assisting private sector transformation in russia business the contemporary world 1994 behrman specifically argues against training of single managers in the united states 35 us aid to russia is quite windfall for us consultants wall street journal february 24 1994 p 1 see also faltering western aid helps bring defeat for russian reformers wall street journal europe edition december 15 1993 crs29 levels especially in the chaotic political and economic environment of the new states successful contractors will lean heavily on local expertise one example of this is the large privatization project that has essentially joined forces with the state property committee gki the government body it largely assists the secret of its success to date according to aid staff is the high level of russian involvement and commitment to the purposes of the project throughout actual privatization activities began at grassroots level with various pilots first one in one region then ten in ten regions once model was perfected the project expanded to the national level in addition while foreign experts were dominant in its early experimental stages once it became highly visible national program it evolved much more into russian program run largely by russians trained for the tasks required russians have also expressed displeasure at the flyin and flyout methods of many consultants36 in the first two years the majority of technical assistance experts were in the fsu on shortterm basis of few months or less37 this approach has been criticized because it implies lack of knowledge of the local situation but some suggest is also less effective because the fsu culture is highly personalized one where ideas are more likely to be accepted on the basis of friendship than merit alone both aid and state say they are now aware of this problem and are emphasizing longerterm assignments38 another concern regarding use of us consultants arose when it was suggested by the wall street journal and others that they were paid extremely high salaries funds that could have been spent directly on russians except in the case of peace corps and the other volunteer programs it is true that us experts are paid substantially higher salaries than those of the recipient country first the discrepancy between recipient country economies and that of the united states is one of the reasons the aid program exists second in the case of the fsu in particular the united states is seeking to provide the most sophisticated expertise to facilitate complex economic transformation in some cases us financial market accounting etc experts have accepted less than their usual salaries to gain experience in the 36 according to moscowbased us official russians also complained regarding the number of assessment teams at the beginning of the rule of law project they did not understand the visits and delays in project activities leading to perception that the united states was doing little except talk 37 most egregious according to some american peace corps volunteers were the public relations activities on privatization oneday seminars provided by flyin consultants with little or advance preparation in different centers around the country 38 even the volunteer programs iesc and farmertofarmer by their short term nature are subject to this criticism the farmertofarmer program for example has been asked repeatedly by russians to lengthen the term of service for its volunteers now roughly three weeks but this move has to be weighed against the numerous demands for experts in other locations and possible diminishing value over time limiting shortterm assignments means loss of specialized expertise one response by the treasury department has been to assign longterm economic advisers who provide continuity for both the recipient government and shortterm advisers brought in for specific tasks crs30 russian market39 even so us aid salary levels were distorted in the press to include the overhead for their office operating expenses there is fixed us governmentwide ceiling on salaries low by us private sector standards that according to aid has only been breached for ten individuals all in fy1993 as result of these criticisms of technical assistance some have suggested that other types of assistance specifically some kind of cash transfer might be emphasized many in the russian government would have preferred direct grants made to the foreign aid body they set up to coordinate the activities of the various donors the office for international cooperation and development it would then delegate funds to the programs it thought useful others recommend using assistance funds for central government budgetary support to reward policy reform efforts however us funding levels may not be high enough to make much of dent on fsu debt or have much leverage over policy the one exception is ukraine to which the united states in november 1994 committed 72 million to cover costs of gas imports from russia some energyrelated policy reform will be condition of this aid meanwhile in russia requests for cash transfers have been replaced by requests for more support for trade and investment in september 1994 the administration responded by shifting 100 million in resources from the nis account to opic and related agencies in november letter to secretary christopher russian ambassador vorontsov specifically requested that trade and investment funding be emphasized in the administrations fy1996 aid request although the longterm trend in the aid program will likely be for increased amounts for this sector while technical assistance begins to dwindle foreign minister kozyrev has told delegation of us senators that russia also needed us technical assistance and wished it to continue40 contractors within the united states many concerns have been raised regarding the contractors ie the private forprofit firms or charitable private voluntary organizations pvos which provide the consultant experts these implement the vast majority of us assistance projects worldwide in the case of the fsu there have been complaints regarding the absence of competitive selection process the amount of paperwork involved in applying for aid grants geographical imbalance in those selected and an unfair preference for those with prior aid experience41 presumably due to its high profile and political import thousands of public organizations universities and private firms have sought to participate in some fashion in the fsu program in addition to formal project bidding there have been numerous unsolicited proposals submitted to aid 983 to date requesting up to 47 billion in funding of this amount roughly 84 million has been granted 39 some critics see harm in this it is however consistent with the us strategy of leveraging assistance 40 interfax september 6 1994 41 for example see the testimony of linas j kojelis president of the usbaltic foundation before the subcommittee on foreign operations house committee on appropriations april 25 1994 in fy1995 hearings part 3 page 608615 crs31 while there are legitimate grievances regarding the contracting process it is difficult to discern them among the gripes that emanate from hundreds of unsuccessful bidders many of whom lobby their representatives and the press since undertaking aid work is new experience for many successful as well as unsuccessful bidders the onerous paperwork requirements of the aid proposal and contracting process are shock42 many agree that reform of this process has been long overdue although lot of the accountability requirements exist in order to protect the interests of the taxpayer and are not peculiar to the fsu aid program under political pressure steps were taken early in the fsu program to try to circumvent the traditional contracting process and speed up the program for one instead of tens of small projects being put up for bid several large umbrella projects were established in major sectors these were contracted to major firms who then subcontracted pieces of the whole project to other firms this imposed less burden on the subcontractees and freed aid of much of the accounting and program responsibility and consequent personnel and paperwork requirements that managing numerous small projects would entail second using its freedom support act waiver authority aid let some contracts without going through standard bidding procedures consequence of these novel contracting procedures were complaints that aid favored its usual roster of contractors ie those with experience in developing countries and that therefore most of the contracts went to firms in the washington area members of congress in particular have criticized the possible geographic imbalance in the program in some cases pointedly remedying the situation by recommending funding for northwestern us efforts in siberia and noting its concern on this issue in report language43 in selecting the primary contractor for its umbrella projects it stands to reason that aid under time pressures imposed by the state department would tend to go with known experienced quantities44 further aid would point out that the far more numerous subcontractors represent more diverse pool of organizations and geographic locations rough count of major aid beneficiaries as of august 1994 shows that washington area firms and organizations represent 57 of total primary contractors and grantees but only 24 of sub contractors and grantees responding to congressional criticism aid has increasingly sought to attract procurement from outside washington advertising opportunities in wider range of publications opening an office in california and holding procurement conferences in different regions 42 in dramatic gesture meant to illustrate the point at hearings of the house appropriations foreign operations subcommittee on may 10 1994 chairman david obey held up foot high stack of paper saying that one contractor claimed that was what he had to respond to in applying for an aid contract according to an aid official the stack included an internal procedural handbook not related to contract requirements 43 most recently in senate report 103287 accompanying hr 4426 the foreign operations export financing and related programs appropriation bill 1995 p 72 reported june 16 1994 44 on aid official has stated that in general only 25 of bidders had never worked with aid before crs32 some critics reserve special disdain for the larger contractors because they appear to encapsulate their perception of the worst features of the assistance program lack of knowledge of the region high expenses and little to show for it in the field to highlight these failures these critics point out disparity in performance between the large firms and the small us ngos conducting programs throughout the fsu in the effort to spend money quickly aid provided these large contractors with tens of millions of dollars technical assistance contracts amounted to 714 million in fy199445 the firms critics say had experience of the region and ended up spending much time and money sending out teams to help them figure out what they should do with the funds several are still reportedly wondering how to spend the money in contrast the ngos have been able to act quickly disbursing funds rapidly and working with local people while there is an element of truth to each of these charges there may also be elements of distortion aid does not possess sufficient staff to monitor hundreds of small contracts this is the job of large contractors the large contractors may not be versed in fsu culture but they are supposed to hire people who are to carry out the programs this may not always occur finally some contractors have moved slowly partly because project objectives changed fsu relationships have been slow to develop and poor management46 how is the program helping us business and investment and trade consultants and contractors are not the only americans who benefit financially from the fsu aid program through both bush and clinton administrations the executive branch and many members of congress have argued that the us private sector not government would ultimately provide the critical financial resources to transform the russian economy and that one role of the aid program was to mobilize the us private sector to this end given the limited amounts of foreign aid available this was pure realism but it has also been way to draw political support for the program inasmuch as us companies are expected to benefit substantially from the increase in trade and investment in more stable fsu as noted earlier there are number of ways in which us agencies facilitate us private sector trade and investment in the fsu tda feasibility studies opic risk insurance and investment guarantees usda ccc agricultural credit guarantees pl480 concessional loans eximbank export guarantees commerce department business information and service centers and trade missions conducted by all of these in addition aid focuses considerable effort on getting the recipient countries to make their political and economic environment more hospitable to us business all these spigots received greater attention and emphasis during the visit of president yeltsin in september 1994 when roughly 1 billion in trade and investment 45 this was 34 percent of the nis account it should be noted that many of these funds are later subcontracted to smaller firms and ngos 46 see forthcoming study of the project on reform of aid to the nis for further views on ngo successes crs33 understandings were signed including 100 million in greater assistance through opic tda and department of commerce of course major advantage of opic usda and eximbank guarantee programs is that their main cost to the united states is the subsidy amount needed to support repayment in case of default depending on the risk involved small subsidy can leverage large sums of loan coverage of the 300 million subsidy provided to eximbank in the fy1994 appropriations bill the 227 million utilized in fy1994 leveraged 13 billion in loan guarantees47 some argue however that the subsidy is too low and does not account for the high risk involved in lending to the region recent gao report calculates 676 risk that russia will default on loan and 807 chance that ukraine will default48 such concerns led the eximbank to structure possible 2billion oil and gas framework agreement so that loan collateral will be generated from current production proceeds in the first two years of the aid program trade and investment activities moved slowly on the russian side there was some reluctance to incur further debt especially following temporary default in november 1992 on repayment of ccc guaranteed loans that brought use of that program to halt of roughly 165 applications referred by eximbank for russian approval in fy199293 russia approved about ten in addition fsu governments which remain the largest potential purchasers of us goods and developers of projects that could utilize us investment were not yet in position to launch major development projects that might use foreign investment the uncertain business climate and lack of investment laws also had its effect on us businessmen and like aid opic has been criticized by us businessmen for being too slow in making decisions and offering difficult terms for credit although opic and eximbank reported large numbers of registrations and expressions of interest in their programs by us business early on actual commitments and final approvals were few these numbers have grown substantially in the past year in fy1993 eximbank guaranteed 184 million in face value loans and opic 135 million in fy1994 they covered 13 billion and 700 million respectively it is not possible to say whether the insurance and guarantee programs intended to compensate for inherent risks are having an impact on those who otherwise would not have invested in the region or that the investments supported to date mostly in extractive industries are helping to restructure fsu economies however their very establishment requiring agreements with the fsu governments is one factor in helping to create the right business environment as noted above russian officials have called for increased us support for these programs in addition to these programs the us government has also used its political pull through summits the gorechernomyrdin process and trade delegations led 47 opic and eximbank claims of funding activity represent face value coverage not us government expenditures further opic insurance is entirely paid for by the business and brings profit to the us government 48 gao credit reform us needs better method for estimating cost of foreign loans and guarantees gaonsiadggd9531 december 1994 crs34 by high profile us officials to encourage completion of business deals in particular the usrussian joint commission on economic and technological cooperation cochaired by vice president gore and russian prime minister chernomyrdin initiated by the vancouver summit in 1993 has been effective in reaching agreements in the fields of business energy space technology and defense conversion that have in turn led to development of significant business transactions supported in part by us trade and investment agencies is assistance being used for corrupt purposes evidence that russia and the other republics are suffering from widespread corruption and criminal activity coupled with suspicions regarding the susceptibility to corruption of all foreign aid has led to charges that us assistance to the region is being used for corrupt purposes49 to the extent that the fsu is riddled with corrupt officials and businessmen the program may be marginally benefiting these individuals for example some believe members of the corrupt elite are benefitting from free trips to the united states provided by exchange opportunities or if they occupy key policy positions that their influence is increased by having say over where us technical assistance and exchanges are provided to the extent that aid is truly targeted at reformers these situations will be rare some would also add that the constructive purposes of the aid are more important than whether few members of the corrupt elite benefit peripherally from it similar response might be provided those critics who charge that criminal elements have benefitted from the privatization program first by forging vouchers that allow them to accumulate more than their legal share of newly privatized company stock and second by evidently thriving in an emerging free market economy50 it seems unlikely that the privatization program was specifically designed to facilitate criminal elements growing concern in the administration and congress regarding the impact of crime on success of democracy and free markets however has led to 30 million earmark in the fy1995 appropriations to help the fbi treasury and justice provide law enforcement technical assistance and training to their fsu counterparts for the most part however the us aid program is not structured in manner conducive to fraud or corruption by recipients in the fsu technical assistance the bulk of the aid program is provided largely by american citizens and much procurement funded out of the nis account office equipment and energy and environment equipment is conveyed to russian citizens under the presumably watchful eyes of us pvos and consultants foreign assistance can most easily be used corruptly where there are large monetary sums or fungible goods made available in this regard the major 49 for example see seymour m hersh the wild east in the atlantic monthly june 1994 p 6186 50 seymour hersh says an unidentified government employee guessed that 30 to 50 percent of aid money for privatization is spent in way that ultimately benefits criminal interests p 82 crs35 opportunity to put us activities to corrupt uses has been the food aid program two magazine articles in august 1993 though filled with errors and distortions presented examples of how us food aid shipments to russia and the other new states encountered problems at ports as officials sought bribes and payoffs they also described the suspect roles of three russian organizations responsible for handling the donated commodities and shipping them to their end destinations51 following the shift from commercial agricultural exports to food aid shipments as result of russian default in payments on usda guaranteed loans in late 1992 different laws and program terms took effect russian officials and others took advantage of the chaos and the opportunities for financial gain that the new importing arrangements offered and in turn some problems the articles allege likely did occur in response to these charges secretary of agriculture espy however countered that food aid 1 served the objective of delivering adequate volumes of food to those who needed it requiring that usda deal with former state monopolies in russia that were the only organizations capable of doing so and 2 constituted part of the comprehensive us assistance package important to avert potentially destabilizing food shortages in the short term and to ensure the survival of president yeltsins reformminded government52 the use of local currency funds generated by the sale of us agricultural commodities donated under section 416 presented another opportunity for corruption here food aid is monetized and provided to the russian humanitarian commission which is required to allocate it for rural development projects some knowledgeable americans report that the first round of grant distributions decided by the commissions tender committee provided funds directly benefitting members of the committee itself and for other questionable uses later the committee refused to provide assistance to selected beneficiaries unless they maintained funds in bank selected by the committee it was inferred that members of the committee were receiving benefits from the particular bank although usda has representative on the committee some believe it was more interested in getting food commodities into russia than in what happens to the monetized aid later53 reportedly the state department has since raised the issue with usda as result local currency is now distributed through new rural commissions based on successful model employed in poland both usda and us ngo representative participate and loans are repaid to local communities which have vested interest in insuring accountability while food aid is dwindling ruble and dollar allocations of assistance are increasingly likely to be made available directly to russians through the growing number of enterprise funds and grassroots grant programs intended to help the private sector and encourage democratic institutions up to 25000 in grant funding can be provided without requiring us government audit something most small fsu 51 the old guard feeds at the aid trough us news and world report august 23 1993 p 3842 food mischief forbes august 16 1993 p 4041 52 usdas response also offered detailed rebuttal of the examples and incidents these articles mentioned in congressional record september 23 1993 p e22402242 53 for one version of this story see us aid to russia farmers fails to make it to the silo angeles times washington edition january 31 1994 pa1 crs36 organizations are not equipped to accommodate many eurasia foundation grants are therefore limited to this amount funds so allocated may not be used as promised but the issue here is not so much corruption as it will be careless programming of the funds to begin with one early aid project that provided grants to fsu environmental ngos dealt with fears of corrupt use of these funds by providing initial grants of roughly one to two thousand dollars offering more if these sums were well used unfortunately this is highly labor intensive administrative process not practicable on large scale54 managers of enterprise funds have indicated that efforts would be made to insure that funds are not lent to criminally owned businesses but identifying such business may be problematic ultimately the best defense against corrupt uses of assistance as well as bad project design and ineffective projects is the presence of aid and other implementing agency accountants and program managers in the recipient countries identifying who can best utilize the aid and monitoring its use are two of the main purposes of aid mission personnel however the large number of other agencies now responsible for components of the assistance program may not be accustomed to implementing projects abroad in manner that will ensure adequate accountability catching malfeasance after the fact would be facilitated by more regular auditing by agency inspector general offices as of september 1994 the aid inspector general has completed ten audits of projects representing roughly 1178 million in obligations criminal misuse of funds was found but audits of large projects still need to be done is us assistance being used effectively ultimately the success of us assistance programs will be measured by the outcome of political and economic events in the fsu and this is dependent on great many more factors than the inputs of us assistance55 some analysts view the current flow of events in the region favorably others are not so sanguine it is just too early to tell for the moment without knowing ultimate outcomes many policymakers are wisely seeking to insure that the us aid program is being run in the most effective manner possible and the impact of us assistance maximized to the extent possible the us aid program has been in existence for less than three years and actual implementation on the ground is for most projects much less than two years old while it hardly seems fair to make judgments at such an early stage patterns and problems have emerged in this time that may need correction if the program as whole is to be more effective in achieving us aims 54 isar midterm evaluation july 22 1994 by mary heslin and edward hodgman 55 political events may have very direct affect on the us aid program as indicated by the january 5 1995 ban on foreign advisers by the new head of the privatization agency gki us assistance to gki has been centerpiece of the us aid program although overruled by anatoly chubais the first deputy premier and former head of gki the outcome was not known as this report went to press emboldened russian hardliner threatens privatization drive washington post january 10 1995 a14 crs37 views abound regarding possible flaws in the aid policy process program priorities and project design and implementation many of these are subject to skepticism they generally fail to note constraints faced by the program they overlook its rapidly changing nature and they are rarely argued with specific examples although agreement on the ultimate objective free markets and democracy is universal everyone seems to have different idea of how to use assistance to get there56 but certain underlying and interrelated problematic issues concerning focus implementation and risk have troubled enough people that some steps have been announced to address them much to the credit of those who have raised them and those in government who are moving to correct them strategic focus many of the criticisms of the aid program most notably those made by house leaders gephardt and michel in their april 1994 memo congregate around the issue of focus there has been general sense that one has firm hand on the tiller this relates strongly to the issues of coordination and slow implementation discussed above but ultimately leads one to ask what is being coordinated and implemented in what direction is the program going as the spending figures show the united states is doing little of everything diluting the effect of executive branch strategy statements during 1992 the bush administration initiated range of projects and congress has since encouraged this trend with multiple program and project allocation earmarks and recommendations state and aid officials argue that without these allocations they might provide aid differently on more rational basis foregoing sectors that in their view are less critical and providing greater funding to countries and sector ministries that are more reformist57 while the executive branch may argue that congressional politics has skewed rational prioritizing others argue that the fsu aid program profoundly foreign policydriven has been politicized by the state department they say number of programs sabit and peace corps for example were started up to fulfill political need for visibility for programs that sounded good or met desires of different parts of the us government to be involved without due consideration of strategy of assistance or meeting specific development goals one of the few projects that most agree has been an utter failure an effort to provide temporary 56 among more interesting or wellargued

flexibility and not give the new states and supporting interest groups the idea of aid entitlements state avoided providing specific country budget figures in the first years crs38 grain storage silos to russia was reportedly begun at the insistence of secretary of state baker in the interest of offering demonstration of us support58 dispersing aid among numerous agencies and the rise of alternative power centers has potential drawbacks each has its own policies to promote it appears to be an accepted fact among many us observers in russia that all usdarun programs are designed primarily to facilitate agricultural exports and that development aspects of their projects are secondary the gorechernomyrdin process skews the aid program toward promotion of environmental programs in the first two years of the program the little of everything approach was exacerbated by political pressure from both state and congress to get activities quickly on the ground it was further aggravated by an environment where all decisions were made in washington and where information was still scanty on who supported reform who was corrupt and who was worth helping in local government the first years were characterized by an effort to push out all kinds of assistance at once without coherent strategy to guide the timing training bankers when there is banking system sending peace corps business advisors to assist new entrepreneurs when credit programs were yet available this is what us media business and congressional observers reported that helped create negative impression in the united states of the initial aid program59 further lost in the play between different interests some suggest has been the presumed target of this foreign policy the citizens of the fsu the periodic usled pronouncements promising g7 aid and then not appearing to deliver the stream of technical assessment team visits to fsu government and private sector officials that appeared to lead nowhere the apparent failure to cut through us cultural and political ignorance regarding the region by hiring sufficient numbers of fsu specialists and requiring more grassroots programming despite the administrative obstacles may all have contributed to the reportedly disillusioned fsu public if the 58 in early 1992 when many were concerned regarding possible famine due to the incapacity of the food production and distribution system the united states offered the region grain storage silos despite opposition from aid many observers believed the program was inappropriate because the planned facilities were temporary required large investment 3000 contribution on the part of the private farmers for whom they were intended that for similar investment permanent structure could have been designed and that at 2000 metric tons capacity they were too large for the small farmers for whom they were supposedly intended eighty facilities were to be built by december 1992 but as of march 1994 only one was fully installed the others in varying stages of completion decision to terminate the project was made in june 1994 59 to some the state department appeared opposed to strategic approach aid interviewees asserted that they were forbidden to use the word strategic on this program and that state had rejected aid proposals for strategic country planning one outside evaluation of the range of aid democracy projects based on interviews with more than dozen aid officials management systems international supporting democracy april 20 1994 p16 states the initial grants were described as having been written on the back of an envelope at time when the agency was specifically enjoined from conducting assessments or developing strategy according to an aid official it was aid that initiated the fsu strategy development process crs39 conduct of the assistance program is leading to the alienation of its targets one us foreign policy objective is well on its way to being lost60 it must be said that none of the negatives described above have ever been true across the board despite problems and obstacles there have always existed good projects welcomed by russian officials as well as ones appreciated by local people and by 1994 there were number of positive signs for program implementation generally knowledge of field conditions had certainly improved track record of existing projects had begun to take shape coordinators office representative had been placed in moscow program weaknesses some of which were pointed out by congressional leaders of both parties were being addressed in both regional and more focused individually tailored country strategies as result if sectoral priorities were not as explicit as some would like number of guiding strategic principles of the program seem to have become more sharply defined the four most prominent are approaches that support targeting of reformers complementarity linkages and leveraging of resources targeting reformers is strategy perpetuated from the first executive branch statement in january 1993 it has always been us policy to favor reforming republics as the levels of aid for russia and most recent increases for ukraine demonstrate beyond this at the local level was the idea of bundling projects to create what secretary eagleburger called symbols of success under the principle of as ambassador simons put it aid following reform to support this concept officials in simons office proposed concentrating all resources in select reformist regions of russia to achieve maximum success congressmen gephardt and michel called for concentration on five regions current policy is to focus efforts on 13 cities in 5 reformist regions related to the targeting of reformist efforts is the bringing together of diverse programs run by the different agencies in way that would complement each other creating synergy for example aid and usia are working together on joint media project with aid doing the financial management technical assistance and training and usia handling journalist training recurrent theme in program rhetoric is to create linkages between people in the united states and the fsu it links the desire for grassroots impact with those who support us private sector solutions the argument made is that fsu nationals are at level of development and education to benefit most from peopletopeople experiences farmertofarmer hospital partnerships business internships etc also create long term relationships that might benefit both parties beyond the immediate ussupported assistance activity related to the creation of linkages is the idea of leveraging private sector assistance that runs throughout much of the assistance program and is likely to grow as trade and investment programs develop it recognizes that the united states has insufficient funds to maintain the program indefinitely and that the russians and 60 see overrun by ugly americans by yelena khanga for one view new york times august 20 1994 crs40 ukrainians in particular are seeking private investment and trade opportunities the agribusiness projects enterprise funds opic tda eximbank and other activities are seeking to stimulate us private sector commercial programs these approaches form coherent strategy that arguably would make the assistance program more effective however it is not yet clear whether the administration strategy is being enforced at the project level in coherent consistent and forceful manner management and evaluation actual implementation of whatever programs and strategies are approved could be made more effective through improved management and evaluation capacities one problem contributing to ignorance of the recipient country and inadequate coordination has been the lack of field presence in its early stages projects were developed and run entirely by washingtonbased management aid and other agencies formulated projects based largely on reports from visiting teams this approach argued the state department was necessary for rapid creation of programs the aid mission presence in moscow only began in september 1992 and workable although arguably still inadequate staff presence of 23 direct hires cannot be said to have been established until early in fy1994 these manage an aid program with obligations ranging from 270 million in fy1993 to 843 million in fy1994 by comparison the fy1991 kenya program of 355 million was managed by 23 direct hires61 as aid staff resources have grown the clinton administration has shifted some project development responsibilities and most project monitoring to the field us embassy restrictions on the number of aid staff permitted in moscow partly due to the need for reciprocity with the size of russian embassy staff in washington have hampered aid in this respect there was reportedly yearlong hold on new moscow posts in 199293 because state needed to approve them and state rejected some aid posts in ukraine even for the smaller posts in the nis the approval process had been timeconsuming several positions requested in the spring of 1994 had not been approved by september most other agencies have little or monitoring presence in moscow in 1993 usda had three americans and two nationals in moscow to monitor and implement program in eleven countries other agencies now responsible for components of the assistance program have been vying for posts in moscow it has been argued that eximbank in particular should have presence but instead it relies on the department of commerce to represent its interests 61 this comparison is bit rough as mission management is supported as well by non national personal service contractors in fy1994 the moscow mission had 39 of these kenya had 15 crs41 one important role for monitoring agencies is to learn from the inevitable mistakes and feed this knowledge back into the system this is particularly important in tumultuous and shifting political environment where recipient agencies both the us contractors and fsu organizations and political bodies are relatively unknown quantities the evaluation process is an important indicator of efforts to learn and correct mistakes when the fsu program began it suffered from dearth of evaluations of eastern europe programs from which to learn but evaluations of ongoing fsu projects seem to be occurring earlier in their term as of september 17 formal outside project evaluations had been completed by aid representing however only 30 million in 1992 projects none of the very large programs such as the privatization program have been evaluated yet although these are scheduled for 1995 the first round of interagency agreements neglected to include budget line for evaluations of project progress this reportedly has been corrected further the coordinators office now requires that agencies receiving transfers have an evaluation plan budget and description of the project with milestones goals program for meeting goals and regular reviews the office also sends out its own people to conduct periodic inhouse assessments ultimately the extent to which evaluations and audits are utilized is more important issue negative audit of the crop storage program led to termination of that program in june 1994 however severe criticisms of that project had been in circulation for more than year prior to project termination on the other hand viable response to the question of misuse of local currencies by the russian humanitarian commission was formulated by state department in the form of the rural commissions whether the aid coordinator office is willing to take strong action to identify correct or terminate questionable programs or activities does remain an issue and crucial test of the usefulness of the position risk and accountability from the start the assistance program has suffered from tension between the desire for risk and accountability from the outset the bush administration explained the fsu program as an experiment they were functioning in unknown territory under pressure to act quickly and with assurance of success at the end of the day although russia is increasingly stabilized as political and economic entity reports of corruption and crime and the sudden plunge of the ruble are reminders of the unpredictability of the situation there all the other republics remain economically and politically fragile both bush and clinton administrations have had to face the issue of how much risk they are willing to take with us taxpayer dollars in order to achieve us foreign policy ends in the freedom support act congress allowed the executive branch an unusual amount of flexibility tempered by the need to inform and gain approval for appropriations it approved notwithstanding clause that would allow the president to ignore other legislative restraints62 as the program was implemented 62 according to the state department notwithstanding authority was used sparingly to disregard certain bureaucratic procedures and accountability requirements in effect its use continued crs42 members of congress and other observers encouraged the executive branch to act boldly on the other hand congress limited flexibility by earmarking funds for specific sectors pressuring the administration to fund specific countries and put holds on proposed programs until they were explained in detail and accountability concerns laid to rest these conflicting messages translated into an assistance program in which some believe the united states has been too cautious in its approach and that aid programming has not been creative enough to meet the challenges posed by the transition they assert that aid programs including enterprise funds supposedly designed to make risky investments may be overly encumbered by accountability requirements the notwithstanding language is rarely applied both administrations have turned deaf ear to radical suggestions for such things as social safety nets to direct funding of russian organizations and been accused of being overly conservative and unimaginative as result these charges must be weighed against the need for accountability many believe the entire aid program would be undermined if reports of corruption waste and bad programming became common that is why monitoring agency presence and forceful action on the part of the aid coordinator to correct or terminate questionable programs are necessary conclusion the role of congress one of the most striking aspects of the fsu aid program has been its broad bipartisan support in congress each year the program has been approved by wide margins and during the first two years the chief criticism made by congressional opponents in both parties was that the dollars requested were better spent helping americans in 1994 however critical attention increasingly shifted to implementation of the program itself with both praise and condemnation delivered on bipartisan basis following house delegation visit to the fsu in april house leaders gephardt and michel reportedly with the close participation of then minority whip newt gingrich wrote wellpublicized memo laying out their critical concerns regarding the leadership of the program and project priorities63 in may an amendment to the foreign aid appropriations bill was offered by representative callahan that would cut 62 continued has allowed noncompetitive selection of some contractors permits the enterprise funds to adopt more private sector orientation and allows hiring of personal service contractors in washington to beef up scarce career staff capabilities 63 specifically the members of congress criticized the slow delivery of assistance and the lack of strong coordination leadership suggested targeting specific reformist regions for assistance recommended that the russia enterprise fund target small investments and proposed greater emphasis on exchanges 50000 visitors in fy1995 and assistance in tax policy reform and law enforcement according to the memo americas current assistance program is simply inadequate in its strategy its intensity and its implementation crs43 funds for russia partly on the grounds that the assistance program had had impact yet on democratization and free markets the house rejected the amendment in 286144 vote in september bipartisan senate delegation led by the chairman of the appropriations foreign operations subcommittee senator leahy visited the region their trip report contains an extremely positive assessment of the assistance program and its own set of project preferences64 by the end of the year there were suggestions that the assistance issue was becoming more partisan65 surely the program will be closely scrutinized in 1995 the fsu aid program is intended to support what many in congress and elsewhere continue to believe is the most important purpose of us foreign policy assisting peaceful transition in the fsu to stable free market democracies as the program has developed over time it was always likely to attract more criticism from us interest groups consultants business people and analysts weeding out the important criticisms from irrelevant or selfserving ones is of congressional concern because unfounded criticism undermines support for the program while legitimate critiques can be used to strengthen it because its interest has been strong from inception the senate foreign relations committee called the freedom support act joint executive legislative commitment many believe congress itself must take some of the responsibility for what happens to this program66 some suggest that it has been sending mixed messages regarding the direction the program should take congress provides unusual flexibility with its notwithstanding clause and other language yet adds program earmarks and report language recommendations it asks that funds go only to reformers and then recommends funds for nonreformers individual members have criticized the program in every way this report has mentioned not enough risks are taken too much waste too much paperwork for contractors too many contractors the program should be run with flexibility aid should provide more detail on programs and so forth the disparity of congressional views on implementation of the aid program is not unusual except in terms of the relative unanimity of views that existed in 64 with senators thad cochran j james exon and hank brown specifically they praised the privatization agricultural exchange farm privatization opic peace corps and eurasia foundation programs recommended law enforcement programs and efforts to construct the legal framework for private sector activities and expressed caution regarding the new business development program according to the codel report although it took time the us assistance program for russia is now in full operation russian government and non government representatives with whom the delegation met were virtually unanimous in praising the contributions of the program and many requested increases in technical assistance for elements of the reform program congressional record december 1 1994 s1545015453 65 russian aid under siege by gop new york times november 25 1994 p 25 66 senate foreign relations
