signed by unog with other entities for th provision of support services for extrabudgetary activities such agreements were in itiated by unog to formally list the services and billing conditions performance measurement wa s later introduced unog total expenditure for these services amounted to 244 million in the 20022003 biennium while income amounted to some 263 million oios met with unog services and client entities to assess the efficiency of mou management and client satisfaction most of the clients regar ded the services per as satisfactory and the implementation of the mous as an improvement but c onsidered the billing process as complex and too late at the exit conference on 20 october 2004 unog pre sented oios with copy of revised delegation of authority on financial matters dated 27 july 2004 on this basis unog plans to change the manner it charges secretariat entitie s for services to extrabudgetary funded activities and the format of written agreements for these services while taking this recent development into account oios maintains that unog regardless of the type of agreement could benefit from findings and recommendations to improv the mou format cost accounting process and tools to further develop communication with and reporting to client entities unog division of administration has accepted most of the recommendations made and is in the process of implementing them entities serviced by unog stsgb20004 dated 24 january 2000 entitled organ ization of the united nations office at geneva does not give complete view of the unogs client entities serviced by unog and the extent of the services provided to them oios recommends an updated stsgb to reflect that unog provides administrative and other support services to variety of entities the unog division of administration indicated that it h ad submitted to the directorgeneral the proposed revision of section 5 division of adminis tration of the stsgb20004 content of the mou not all services to certain client entities finance d by extrabudgetary resources were covered by an mou or other written agreement among those exi sting some have expired or did not include current services unog concurred with oios that it would ensure that all administrative and support services are covered by pertinent written agreements clauses of the mou providing for joint reviews of p erformance were seldom complied with in practice formal reviews were the exception rather than the rule the content of the mou and the implementation should be reviewed with the aim to establish clear communication and reporting lines with client entities unog agreed to oios recommendations to review the frequency and format of the joint performance revie ws performance measurement performance indicators measure of performance to ward the achievement of planned outputs should be reduced to few representative ones tar geting priorities or focus areas that are agreed with the client entities and regularly moni tored performance measurement should aim for cost efficient and quality services unog agreed to oios recommendation to reduce simplify and monitor performance indicators cost accounting and billing there was standard methodology for monitoring wo rkload and time spent in providing the services the cost accounting process is complex nd cumbersome but yet not as accurate as planned this delayed the final billing for servic for several months after the end of the year unog noted oios recommendation to streamline the m ethodology to use appropriate cost drivers and considered the difference between actua l and standard costs as insignificant in its plan to charge single support cost ratio t some of its clients unog should try to keep unique cost recovery formula based on clear indi cators to avoid duplicating work andor introducing more complexity to the system unog plans to obtain the approval of the controller for simplified way to charge support c osts the calendar of the billing process and the issuanc of the final adjustment figures to the client in julyaugust of next year are not satisfactory oios recommends that the process be expedited and that prior agreement on the charges s hared be reached with the clients unog replied that it would expedite the process in order to issue bills by the end of june at the latest assessing client satisfaction unog last undertook client satisfaction survey in 2000 although this exercise covers wider clients and services than just mous the resumption of such an exercise would allow unog to identify possible areas for improvement and priorit ies for action unog plans to launch the client satisfaction survey shortly march 2005 table of contents chapter paragraphs i ii iii introduction

september 2004 oios conducted an audit of unog mous with users the audit was conducted in accordance with the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing 2 as stated in stsgb20004 on the organization f the united nations office in geneva one of its main functions through its divi sion of administration is to provide administrative and other support services in 200 4 unog provided such services to 19 offices and units and 22 other entities of the c ommon system 1 the coordination and monitoring of agreements in this regard rest with t he programme planning and budget section within the financial resources management service the most comprehensive agreements on the services are memoranda of underst anding mous which list the terms and conditions governing the provision of these ser vices to entities financed on extrabudgetary funds unog total expenditure for s uch services amounted to 244 million in the 20022003 biennium 3 subsequent to the audit unog presented to oios copies of delegation of authority on financial matters dated 27 july 2004 and memor andum from the controller dated 12 october 2004 on how to adapt mous and cost recovery accordingly as result unog is anticipating major changes in the cost recovery met hodology applied for secretariat clients and is reconsidering the principle of signi ng mous with those clients for client entities outside the secretariat the situation should not vary or if it does only slightly 4 oios has considered these subsequent development s in finalizing the report while some observations refer to past events and should nly be noted others should be considered in the light of new arrangements with secretaria t clients or as improvements in current services to non secretariat entities 5 the findings and recommendations contained in th is report have been discussed during the exit conference held on 20 october 2004 with the director division of administration the chief financial resources mana gement service frms and the chief programme planning and budget section ppbs dr aft of this report was shared with the director division of administration on 21 decembe r 2004 whose comments have been reflected in the report in italics unog division of administration has accepted most of the recommendations made and is in the process of imple menting them ii audit objectives 6 the main objectives of the audit were to evaluat the existing monitoring and reporting tools as well as procedures related to mo us to assess the adequacy and efficiency of unog mou management the transparency and accuracy of the reporting proc ess the satisfaction of unog clients ¹ proposed programme budget for the biennium 20042 005 section 29e administration geneva 2 iii audit scope and methodology 7 the review focused on mous signed between unog nd other entities and the implementation thereof since 2002 considering the multiplicity of clients and the variety of services rendered the review was not one of specif ic unog services and processes or accounts but an assessment of each partys role an d controls in implementing the mou 8 using the provisions in the mou as standards tha t the signing parties had set for themselves oios compared them with existing practi ces and processes in meeting with unog services oios also assessed the tools in plac to monitor the activity cost drivers and performance in rendering the pertinent services ios review of the billing process aimed to understand the calculation of costs and the invoici ng timeframe oios also met with most mou clients to collect their views on the quality nd performance of services and on the mous themselves iv audit findings and recommendations entities serviced by unog 9 stsgb20004 dated 24 january 2000 entitled organization of the united nations office at geneva states in section 21 that the u nited nations office at geneva unog provides administrative and other support servi ces for the office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights ohchr and co nference services for the united nations meetings held at geneva and other locations as well as for the specialized agencies understanding or special arrangements actually per section 29e administration geneva of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2 0042005 unog services 19 offices and units as well as 22 other entities of the united nations common system 10 as already recommended by the board of auditors in its management letter dated 22 may 2002 unog should clarify its responsibilities visàvis other entities through an updated stsgb setting out the entities and the pe rsonnel financial and general services provided unog mentioned that to include all servic in the stsgb would require frequent revisions as the entities they service constantly c ould change oios does not expect the stsgb to list each and every entity serviced by og but to clearly reflect that unog provides services to variety of entities within nd outside the secretariat recommendation head2right the unog division of administration should initiate revision of the january 2000 stsgb on the organization of unog to properly reflect that unog provides administrative and other support services to variety of entities within and outside the secretariat rec 01 11 unog division of administration indicated that it h ad initiated the revision submitting new draft of the section 5 division f administration of the stsgb20004 to the directorgeneral to record this implementation as implemented oios requests copy of the revised stsgb20004 once issued 3 b content of the mou 12 starting 1999 unog initiated memoranda of unde rstanding mou as way to formally list the services provided on cost recov ery basis to client entities financed from extrabudgetary funds and billing conditions performance indicators were later included in the agreement 13 from the list of third parties which unog bil ls for administrative support activities under special account oios noted that several entities unep unctad ece had signed mou with unog which represented that they w ere under negotiation furthermore out of the ten existing mous five had expired and at least two unhcr and undp did not reflect recent major changes in the level of servic provided specialized agencies in geneva which make use of mail and pouch services h ad updated agreement detailing the conditions smaller organizations from which unog retains the full programme support have mous 14 unog division of administration replied that only t wo mous could be considered expired at the time as all other agreements were ither openended or contained clause for the annual review of the mou either through corresp ondence or by calling for joint review meeting related exchanges of correspondence were however not provided to the auditors 15 unog explained that the overall policy is to im plement mous with unogs major clients as priority services representing the m ost significant income for unog are covered under signed agreement unog further advised oio s that following its revised delegation of authority and the controllers preference for n agreed annual apportionment of programme support resources with secretariat cl ients the practice of mous with such clients would be discontinued and replaced by let ter to departments mous would then only apply to nonun secretariat clients 16 oios does not object to the discontinuation of mous with secretariat entities as long as services provided and cost to be reimbursed have been agreed in writing recommendation head2right the unog division of administration as set forth i n financial rule 10511b should ensure that each management and support services arrangement shall be covered by written agreement between the and the entity on whose behalf the services are to be provided such agreement shall inter alia specify the servi ces which the united nations is to provide in return for full reimbursem ent to the united nations of any costs incurred by it in providing th services rec 02 17 unog concurred with the policy recommended oios would consider this recommendation as implemented when it receives copi of the seven signed agreements unep unctad ece unccd unssc ocha unhcr and u ndp joint review clause 18 existing mous generally provide for an annual j oint review andor joint working groups however joint review took place althoug h the mou with unhcr allowed 4 replacing the joint review with an exchange of corr espondence in the event of force majeure oios was provided only with minutes of meeting wi th unhcr in 2002 and another one with ocha in 2003 ppbs explained that the reviews were more of an informal kind and that formal meetings were the exception rather than the rule unog further explained that ad hoc performance reviews involved managers and administ rators particularly for ict and financial services with an established protocol oi appreciates the explanation given nevertheless if an annual joint review is consider ed to be too frequent or is to be replaced by less formal exchange of views the clause in the mou should be amended to reflect that reviews and meetings are optional unog could also avail itself of regular meetings with group of clients to improve communication as well s mutual understanding of all parties expectations recommendation head2right the unog division of administration should reconsid er the frequency and format of the annual joint reviews fo reseen in the standard mou and should amend the mou as appropria in order to bring it in line with existing practices rec 03 19 unog indicated they intend to carry out review of the frequency the format and level of joint reviews and that clients would be co nsulted to ensure that they agree with the new procedure to be consistently reflected in all m ous oios will record this recommendation as implemented upon receipt of copie s of minutes or results of discussions of unog with client entities c performance management 20 table of performance indicators for each acti on is annexed to all mous unog frms regarded these indicators as an improvement of those used for results based budgeting however oios found that the indicators listed were not always adequate as some of them were not measurable and were mere indi cations of actions to be taken by unog to perform the services of the measurable ind icators update was available and the clients did not monitor performance either theref ore the use of performance indicators as tool to monitor or review arrangements as planned i n the mous did not materialize although maintaining that the majority of the perfo rmance indicators of the current mous are measurable unog would revise those that are not in amending the mous 21 unog started to monitor indicators in 2004 for some services with reporting to the client so far frms has developed scripts to xtract data from imis frms monitors the standard deadline for each action and analyses acti ons that do not meet the targets the mailing and pouch section has developed and plans t circulate questionnaire to users to assess their satisfaction of the services icts is also considering performance monitoring with the creation of baseline and plans to undertake needs assessment as unhq is planning to monitor performance future steps to implement perf ormance measurement in the icts area shall be determined in concerted manner 22 in oios opinion beyond cost recovery the imp lementation of the mou should be reviewed with the aim to ensure clear communication and reporting lines with client entities as other entities are contributing increasingly through cost reimbursement mechanisms to the budget of unog administrative services and re not only seen as users but also as 5 clients unog should develop client orientation as well as increase accountability and transparency 23 unog is currently using numerous performance in dicators performance indicators measure of performance toward the achievement of pl anned outputs are more efficient if only few are established and monitored unog should t hus reduce its indicators to few representative ones targeting priorities or focus areas identified and agreed with the client entities unog could then regularly monitor them an d as provided for in some of the mous use them for discussion with the clients to improve existing arrangements performance measurement would then turn into efficiency and qua lity drivers recommendations head2right the unog division of administration should consider reducing the number of performance indicators used for administr ative and other support services to limit the cost and time of coll ecting data and reporting results focussing on few performance i ndicators that can be generated with reasonable investment of time rec 04 head2right the unog division of administration should develop processes for the measurement of their performance as well as trols for initiating corrective actions in case performance targets are not met rec 05 head2right the unog division of administration should clarify with clients its approach for performance measurement and reporting and the use of the results of performance evaluation to refine per formance indicators and targets in subsequent periods through joint exercise with the clients rec 06 24 unog concurred with the recommendations and the pro posed courses of action oios will record this recommendation implemented wh it receives copy of the amended performance indicators targets and related monitor ing processes d cost accounting and transparency 25 services provided by unog are billed based on t he following factors direct costs for services provided by dedicated sta ff or for directly invoiced goods and services indirect costs through an apportionment of staff co sts for common services 26 while the first factor is simple cost transfe r exercise the second results from multiple layer costaccounting exercise using work load indicators work months and standard staff costs oios reviewed the various factors cost drivers for the reimbursement of services workload indicators 27 apart from very limited number of services fo r which the criteria for cost accounting 6 is available payroll based on the number of staff payrolled the basis for cost accounting for common services rests on workload statistics speci fic actions required to perform the service are identified and summed up to reflect the annual workload of unit 28 in the same area but for different services t he criteria used to apportion the cost varied and could be streamlined payroll services provided by frms were charged on t he basis of ratio of the serviced entitys number of staff to grand total of staff pa yrolled payroll related services by imis were charged on the basis of the number of ins tances staff member went through payroll to the total number of instances for imis s upport to the payroll module human resources services were charged based on ra tio of personnel actions performed for the client to total personnel actions performed by hrms imis support for the hr module was recovered based on ratio of number of months of post occupancy for staff of serviced organization to the total number of m onths of post occupancy for imis support to the human resources module 29 the above examples show that the current worklo ad indicators are overly complex and could be streamlined from service to service 30 workload statistics for imis support as update d in 2002 and provided to ppbs for annual invoicing to clients show different basis for calculation from the workload indicators in the latest version of the mou work months calculation 31 together with the workload statistics each ser vice needs to provide the work months spent in each service for delivering the work in some instances the methodology to determine the work months could not be documented altogether oios observed that there is unogwide policy for estimating the work months as result some services include in their calculation of workload provision for manag ement overhead hrms while some do not mail pouch the decision appears to be lef t at the discretion of the chief of each service 32 unog stated that such overhead costs are appropriat for some services and not to others however going by the definition of overhead as in curred in the upkeep or running of premises or business oios is of the opinion tha t all services provided by unog induce overhead costs at least with the service general m anagement and the issue lies with their invoicing to client entities or not 33 oios compared in table 2 work months and worklo ad statistics for given unit from one year to the other to assess their consistency nd found clear relationship between the two unog emphasized that changes such as technology procedures can have an impact on the output of unit oios concurs with unogs statement but is still not certain of the correlation between the outputs and the related inp uts 7 table 1 workload and work months statistics for unog suppo rt services in 2002

recurring icts service fee 34 in addition to mous service level agreements slas have been developed for information technology services whenever an mou i s finalized any existing sla is attached to the agreement the sla provides detail ed information on the it services to be provided by unog and is specific to each client 35 in all slas fixed recurring service fee per workstation has been determined based on the new york fixed fee as the chief of icts ex plained clear standard had to be used to start with this fee should be reviewed to bette r reflect cost incurred at unog since the cost structure and staff costs are different in gen eva b formula for the calculation of reimbursement co sts 36 as stated in the finance manual 12036 t he level of services provided and reimbursement received is based on workload statist ics reflecting the percentage of given service used by relevant organizations cost re covery for unog services is mostly based on such workload statistics unog is currently usi ng the following formula table 2 formula for cost recovery of support services provi ded under an mou agreement wm x standard salary costs c total cost fo r one action wm workmonths for each staff grade involved in t he process of given action total number of actions performed s client w orkload in percentage number of actions performed for the client c x s total cost for the client x percentage of xb funds amount to be billed 37 to be accurate standard salary costs are used bearing in mind that the actual workload may not necessarily be applied to the actu staff costs of the entire account representing one full organizational unit oios wishes to highlight that the existing cost calculation formula as shown in table 2 above des pite its complexity does not reflect actual cost incurred by unog in delivering the services b ut is only an approximation based on standard salary costs even with the most sophisti cated workload statistics the result will always contain certain deviation from actual cost s the benefit of overly detailed and complex workload statistics which are time and res ource intensive may therefore be questionable 38 in meeting with the clients oios noted that mo st of the clients considered the billing process as complex in three instances clients we lcomed simplified system based on 9 fixed fee or single ratio such simplified sys tem should soon apply for secretariat clients as the controller has recently recommend ed and unog agreed an annual apportionment of programme support resources based upon straight forward assessment of the proportion of programme support costsfunctions incurredperformed by unog in relation to the proportion of programme supportfun ctions incurredperformed by the client unog commented further that the simplified version of charging regular and extra budgetary funds for support activities would be sub mitted to the controller for his approval 39 it is oios understanding that such simplifie d ratio of support cost for secretariat clients will need to be justified and t hat parallel billing system for other client entities such as unicef undp or unfccc will contin ue to avoid duplication and additional complexity to the system the same cost assessment should be used for both categories of clients 40 the most accurate cost accounting would be base d on time accounting which would call for the implementation of special system and significant time investment on the part of unog services another option would be to introduc unit pricing an approach similar to undps universal price list obtained after an in depth cost study an approach unog has already adopted for language training charges t hird option would be to determine fixed percentage of expenditure as fee for certain stan dard service packages eg personnel administration financial services procurement pa yroll regardless of the number of actual transactions involved such an approach would also require an indepth workload and cost study to determine the reasonableness of the percen tage rates to be applied recommendation head2right the unog division of administration when implement ing simplified method for reimbursement of cost for sup port services to secretariat clients should seize the opportunit to modify its cost accounting system also for nonsecretariat clients taking into account the following apply consistent methodology of cost accounting f or the same type of services provided to different clients develop simple streamlined pricing method based n time monitoring or b documented and justified unit pri ces or c fixed percentage of expenditure rec 07 41 unog noted the recommendation that unog should deve lop simple and streamlined pricing methodology unog considered t hat the use of actual costs is overly complex and thinks that the deviation from standard costs was insignificant unog should review and evaluate variances to ensure accuracy an d fairness of their bills to client entities oios will consider this recommendation implemented upon receipt of copy of the simplified methodology for cost accounting billing for support activities 42 all income generated under mou arrangements is recorded under special account for administrative support activities zeb for the 20022003 biennium income totalling 263 million was generated from cost reimbursement versus 244 expended the reserve of 6 million at the beginning of the period thus i ncreased to 8 million as at 31 december 10 2003 ppbs explained that the excess of income over expenditure results from administrative support to conference services income calendar for billing 43 the most frequent modality for payment for mou clients are two billing exercises per year ohchr itc unfccc uncc unicef undp eve ry semester the client is invoiced for half of the estimated cost of services provided table 3 below illustrates the billing timeframe table 3 standard calendar for the mou billing process 44 this billing timeframe results in delay of seve ral months after the yearend cut off for financial reporting of client entities and therefor causes noncompliance with the cutoff principle set out in the united nations accounting standard 37 as the final billing is only made in june of the following year client entities cannot fully account for the cost of the services rendered in the preceding financial year the board of auditors has already raised this problem on several occasions but it still rem ains to be addressed 45 on the basis of the memoranda for the reimburse ment of services sent to the clients we checked the compliance with the above timeframe table 4 calendar for the issuance of the billing memoranda to mou clients in 2003 and 2004 first billing memo 2003 receivable recorded

midaugust 2004 clients had not yet received the final 2003 adjustment and the first 20 04 estimates oios does not view as satisfactory the billing process and the underlyin g cost accounting process which requires more than half year to issue actual data recommendation head2right the unog division of administration should expedite the process for consolidating actual workload statistics and is suing the final billing to its clients rec 08 47 preferable solution as also mentioned by the controller in his memorandum to unog frms dated 12 october 2004 would be to agree on the charges prior to the beginning of each year however unog does not believe that this would result in an improvement in the accuracy of the data provided 48 unog replied further that it would endeavour to exp edite the process in order to issue the billings at the latest at the end of june collection and analysis of workload data of previous year takes time if accuracy has to be ensu red oios is of the opinion that if unog could achieve accuracy and timeliness as it simplif ies its costing and billing processes oios will assess the implementation of the recommendatio n when it receives copies of the 2005 billing memoranda to client agencies b specific billing conditions 49 oios observed that contrary to the provisions of the mou with unccd for funding document to be issued at the end of the yea r against programme support funds the billing is done on the 5050 basis as described abo ve 50 mous signed with unhcr and unicef set the swiss franc as the billing currency oios noted however that the billing is done in us dollars recommendation head2right the unog division of administration should review t he billing provisions of all signed mous to ensure that they re implemented as required or amend them as necessary rec 09 51 oios requests copy of the decision of the cli ent agencies to be billed in certain currency or amended mous c recovery of administrative support related expe nses 52 oios reviewed long outstanding receivables on t he zeb account the highest one being from unops in the amount of 12324 however unops overall indebtedness to unog amounts to 37 million comprising uncleared
