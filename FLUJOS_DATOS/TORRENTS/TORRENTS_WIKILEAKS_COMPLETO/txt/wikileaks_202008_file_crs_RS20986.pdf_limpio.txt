not held on all nominations the closest scrutiny in hearings is given to the most senior appointments and also to controversial nominees to afford committee members an opportunity to question nominee

to extract commitments from nominee in addition to investigations already conducted by or at the behest of the white house each senate committee may have its ow n questions or forms for the nominee and may conduct its own investigation often nominee is introduced at hearing by senator or both senators from his or her home state and may be accompanied by other members of congress supporters and opponents of nominee are occasionally permitted to testify most committees have rules governing how soon after hearings the committee may vote on nomination the committee has the option to report the nomination favorably unfavorably or without recommendation or to take action at all if the committee votes to report the nomination it is then filed with the legislative clerk who notifies the
