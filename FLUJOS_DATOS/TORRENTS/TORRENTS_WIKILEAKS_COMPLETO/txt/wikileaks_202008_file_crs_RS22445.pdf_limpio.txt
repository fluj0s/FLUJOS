been an important part of tax policy debates and most recently has been prominent in discussions about fundamental us tax reform for example in executive order 13369 president bush stated that one goal of reform should be to strengthen the competitiveness of the united states in the global market place and in july 2007 the us treasury department hosted conference on business tax policy to explore ways in which the us tax system might be reformed to enhance competitiveness yet despite its prominent use the meaning of competitiveness is often vague with its definition frequently depending on the perspective of the user this report looks at competitiveness from three different perspectives that of individual domestic firms that of multinational corporations and that of domestic labor in each case the report then applies economic analysis to the competitiveness concept which adds clarity by identifying the specific ways in which taxes affect international trade and investment with trade tax burdens can affect what is traded its overall level and who benefits from trade but they do not directly affect the trade balance further it is the pattern of relative us taxes within the domestic economy that matters for trade not how firms taxes compare with those of its foreign competitors with investment taxes can affect the extent to which us firms establish operations abroad and can affect economic efficiency and welfare as well as the distribution of income within the domestic economy and between the united states and foreign countries this report was originally written by david l brumbaugh specialist in public finance it explains basic economic principles and will not be updated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22445g22g138g161g142g156g561g138g151g141

exclusively domestic operations for such firm the focus of competitiveness is trade the company and its componentsits owners managers employees and perhaps even the community in which it is situatedlikely define competitiveness as the firms ability to compete for market share against imports from abroad or to compete with foreign firms in overseas export markets from this perspective the impact of taxes on competitiveness likely seems straightforward taxes are an item of cost and so how the us firms own taxes compare with those of its foreign competitors likely appears to be of critical importance and from the firms perspective targeted tax relief probably seems an obvious way to improve the firms competitive position for example foreign governments may appear to be subsidizing the us firms foreign competitors consequently tax benefit for exports or perhaps tax credit or accelerated depreciation allowance may seem like useful ways to level the playing field 1 the focus here is on trade but although economic theory agrees that taxes can affect trade they do so in ways that are frequently at odds with the results that may seem intuitive at the firm level the reason for the diverging views is differences in perspective economics points out that the impact of particular tax policies reverberates throughout the economy causing adjustments that offset effects that may seem obvious at the firm level as result to see the impact of taxes on trade accurately the perspective must move beyond that of the individual firm to that of the economy as whole in shifting to the economic perspective we look first at the economys trade balance perhaps what is popularly viewed as how us firms in the aggregate fare against their foreign competitors here the economic conclusion appears almost counterintuitive taxes on export income or on importcompeting goods have direct bearing on the balance of trade 2 the reason is exchangerate adjustments which act to neutralize the impact of tax policies targeted at trade an example may prove helpful suppose country implements tax benefit for exporting that is designed to offset foreign subsidies real or perceived economics indicates that if foreign consumers are to buy more of the exports they will require more of the domestic currency ie dollars the increased demand will drive up the exchange rate making dollars more expensive for foreign buyers the increased price of dollars will make exports more expensive for foreign buyers and imports of foreign goods less expensive for domestic buyers some or all of any initial expansion in exports will be offset by the adjustments and imports will expand after the adjustments there will have been change in the countrys trade balance in short taxes on trade do not directly affect the trade balance although this conclusion may seem counter intuition its explanation is more ea sily understood when we look at the nature of the trade balance itself an economys trade balanceeither deficit or surplusis simply the 1 for an example of this perspective see us congress house committee on small business the wtos challenge to fsceti rules and the effects on americas small business owners hearing 108th cong 1st sess may 14 2003 washington gpo 2003 pp 1718 2 this sets aside the impact tax revenues may have on the trade balance through their effect on the governments budget deficit for example tax cut that reduces government revenue may increase the budget deficit placing upward pressure on real interest rates the higher interest rates in turn may attract greater inflows of foreign capital the exchange rate adjustments that result may increase the trade deficit httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22445g22g138g161g142g156g561g138g151g141

amount of goods and services it actually produces trade deficit is the excess of countrys current use of goods and services over what it produces trade surplus is the value of its production minus the value of what it keeps for itself the intuition is this just as an individual cannot consume more than he earns in given period unless he borrows country cannot run trade deficit unless it in effect borrows by importing capital from foreign countries to finance the difference countrys trade balance in short is mirrored by its balance on capital account for example countrys trade deficit is necessarily mirrored by the excess of its imports of investment over investment outflows thus the capital and currentaccount balances move in lockstep the trade balance can change only if capital flows change at the same time under the particular institutional framework of the current international economy flexible exchange rates maintain the relation between the trade balance the current account and the investment balance the balance on capital account in short if tax cut does not change the balance on capital account the trade balance does not change if taxes do not affect the trade balance what is their impact standard economic analysis relies on one of the basic foundations of international trade theory ricardos theory of comparative advantage without presenting comprehensive treatment of the theory its essence holds that countries trade in effect in order to specialize in the production of those goods and services they produce most efficiently thus it is the economys own internal pattern of costs that matter rather than how its overall cost of production compares with those of foreign economies according to the theory of comparative advantage taxes do not alter the balance of trade but they can potentially alter the composition of trade for example if countrys taxes apply unevenly across its various industries they will likely alter the particular mix of products the country imports and exports building on the above illustration where tax credit or accelerated depreciation is targeted at an industry threatened by foreign competition this analysis indicates that the targeted industry may well see its exports or importcompeting sales increase as the targeted tax benefit alters the pattern of relative costs across the economy at the same time the international position of that countrys less favored industries will decline as part of the impact of taxes on the mix of goods that are exported and imported economic analysis also indicates that tax policy towards trade can alter how economic welfare is distributed within the economy for example targeted tax benefit designed to boost the competitiveness of one sector may in the short run benefit the owners and employees of the favored sector at the same time however it will likely reduce economic welfare in sectors of the economy that do not receive the benefit again however economics emphasizes an economy wide perspective here it generally concludes that tax policy that applies unevenly across sectors of the economy distorts the allocation of resources and diverts them from their most productive uses thus although an uneven tax policy may produce winners in some sectors and losers in others on balance the economy registers reduction in economic welfare because of the reduction in economic efficiency an uneven distorting tax policy that is meant to improve trade performance likely means that the economy will specialize in the production of items it is not particularly good at making to the detriment of overall economic welfare according to trade theory each country that is partner to trade obtains benefits from that trade trading partners are not competing such that one countrys gain is the others loss rather there are mutual gains from trade because trade allows coun tries to specialize in activities they do best and trade for products they make less efficiently under certain conditions tax policy can alter httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22445g22g138g161g142g156g561g138g151g141 g561g11g151g157g142g155g151g138g157g146g152g151g138g149

g345g561how the gains from trade are shared among countries but in ways that are again counterintuitive for example to the extent that an export subsidy is passed on to foreign consumers as lower prices the subsidy shifts economic welfare from the subsidizing country to the foreign consumers of its exports in economic parlance the subsidizing countrys terms of trade are worsened or if country has market power such that the burden of taxes on some goods is borne by foreign consumers judiciously applied tax policy could improve the terms of trade however even setting aside the international legality of such policy and the possibility of retaliation identifying the product areas where this might occur is problematic

based in the united states but that has production facilities abroad what economists term foreign direct investment3 such firm likely defines competitiveness as the ability of its overseas operations to compete for market share with firms from foreign host countries or firms from third countries with respect to taxes th firm is likely to focus on how its own taxes compare with those of its foreign competitors from this perspective policy that helps competitiveness is one that reduces the multinationals taxes visavis foreign firms multinationals have traditionally argued that policy that exempts foreign operations from homecountry ie us tax ensures that us multinationals are not at competitive disadvantage with foreign firms the focus of this view of competitiveness is invest ment rather than trade as with trade however economic theorys conclusions about the impact of taxes on investment differs from that of the firm economics agrees that homecountry taxes can affect the attractiveness of overseas investment and thus alter the extent to which us firms undertake foreign direct investment according to theory however the important compar ison is not how foreign firms taxes compare with those of the us multinationals instead the crucial comparison is between taxes on overseas investmentboth us taxes and any foreign taxes that applyand the us tax burden that would apply to alternative investment in the domestic economy where taxes on overseas investment are lower than taxes on domestic investment firms undertake more foreign investment than they otherwise would hence th is tax policy increases foreign investment where taxes on foreign investment are high foreign investment is discouraged and where taxes are the same in either location tax policy does not alter the extent of foreign investment theory acknowledges that homecountry exemption for foreign income may well maximize the competitiveness of the home countrys multinationals again however economics indicates that broader perspective produces different results first theory holds that if left to their own devices profitmaximizing firms will employ their investments in the most productive locations possiblea result that maximizes the economic welfare produced by the investment taxes in turn will not distort firms investment decisions if tax burdens on domestic and foreign investment are equal in short although tax exemption for foreign investment might maximize the competitive position of the home countrys multinationals tax policy that equalizes tax 3 for an example of this perspective see us

g346g561burdens at home and abroad maximizes world economic welfare in contrast an exemption policyone that maximizes multinational competitivenesswould likely distort the location of investment resulting in more investment where foreign taxes are lower than taxes in the united states and lower investment when foreign taxes are higher the economics literature has developed labels for the different policies as follows competitive neutrality or capital import neutrality is an exemption policy that maximizes the competitive position of countrys firms capital export neutrality is policy that produces equal tax burdens at home and abroad and that as result maximizes world economic welfare because investment flows to its most efficient global location economics also concludes that the perspective of multinationals home country may differ from that of the foreign host countries world economic welfarethat is the welfare of the home and foreign countries combinedis maximized when capital is allocated to its most productive location but if country is capitalrich as is the united states the capital exporting countrys economic welfare is maximized when tax policy to some extent discourages overseas investment in such cases foreign labor bears part of the burden of the exportdiscouraging tax and policy increases the taxinclusive return to the foreign investment that does occur countries with less capital lack sufficient market power to pass on the burden of their taxes tax policy of this nature termed national neutrality would apply higher tax burden to foreign operations than to domestic investment thus damping the flow of capital abroad as discussed further below although policy of national neutrality maximizes the capital exporting countrys welfare it also alters the division of income between capital and labor shifting income towards labor and away from capital because national neutrality distorts the location of investment it produces an inefficient deadweight reduction in world economic welfare it is beyond the scope of this report to describe how current us tax policy affects foreign investment here we simply note that us policy varies widely depending on the situation of the investing firm and the particular country where investment occurs different features of the system are consistent with different principles for example the ability of us multinationals to in some cases indefinitely defer us tax on foreign income is consistent with competitive neutrality other provisions eg the foreign tax credit and subpart fs limit of deferral are consistent with capital export neutrality the foreign tax credit itself is limited however feature consistent with national neutrality

third perspective on competitiveness is that of domestic labor in general4 as described in the first sections discussion of competitiveness from the individual firms perspective an individual firms employees are likely to share concerns about trade with the firms other stakeholders like the firms owners and managers trading firms employees are likely to define competitiveness in trade as the firms ability to compete against foreign firms in export markets or in markets within the united states labors policy prescriptions are likely to be in accord with those of the firms owners targeted tax relief 4 for an example of this perspective see the testimony of aflcio official thea lea in us congress house committee on small business the wtos challenge to fsceti rules and the effects on americas small business owners p 15 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22445g22g138g161g142g156g561g138g151g141 g561g11g151g157g142g155g151g138g157g146g152g151g138g149

g347g561in contrast labors perspective on competitiveness and international investment generally diverges from that of multinational firms owners rather than viewing itself as being in competition with foreign multinationals as us multinationals often do domestic labor frequently views the competition as being between investment sites labor tends to view competitiveness as the ability of the united states to compete with foreign countries as location for what it views as jobcreating business investme nt the tax policy prescription that results is in accordance with this view domestic labor has tended to support tax polices that act to discourage overseas investment in some cases supporting tax measures explicitly designed to penalize runaway plantsbroadly plants that shut dow n operations in the united states and shift production abroad what does economic theory say about labor and international investment here again theory reaches certain conclusions that counter intuition first economic analysis is skeptical about the ability of international investment flows to affe ct the total level of employment in economy in the short run the closure of domestic factory and its movement abroad will doubtless cause unemployment in the closed factorys location in the long run however the economy tends to absorb much of the labor released when firm shuts down or simply goes out of business the economy as whole moreover always has cert ain amount of such transitional unemployment that occurs when firms alter their operations by for example shutting down operations in one location and moving to another either at home or abroad the economic change behind such transitional employment is the result of variety of factors ranging from technological progress to exogenous shocks to changes in institutional policies theory suggests however that permanent policy of discouraging the movement of us firms abroad would not appreciably alter the economys overall level of employment economists generally believe that monetary and fiscal policy are the most effective methods of addressing spikes in unemployment and that adjustment assistance is the most effective policy prescription for shortrun local job loss although investment flows do not alter aggregate employment theory does indicate that capital flows do affect the distribution of incomes within the domestic economy this result was briefly noted in the previous sections discussion of national neutrality the shift occurs because labor is more productive the more capital it has to work with as result wages are generally higher and labor receives larger share of income and capital smaller share the higher is the domestic economys capitallabor ratio thus it is not surprising that labor views the flow of capital abroad with distrust notwithstanding its tendency to see its results in terms of their impact on employment
