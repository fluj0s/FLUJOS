and current issues kevin r kosar analyst in american national government government and finance division summary when congress put the us postal service usps on selfsustaining basis in 1971 it continued to subsidize the mailing cost s of such groups as the blind nonprofit organizations local newspapers and publishe rs of educational ma terial by providing an appropriation to usps to cover the revenues that were given up or forgone in charging belowcost rates to these groups appropriations for these subsidies mounted as postage rates and the num ber of nonprofits grew appr oaching 1 billion annually in the mid1980s successive administrations s ought to cut these costs by reducing eligibility and having other mailers bear more of the burden congress failed to appropriate enough to cover co sts in the early 1990s and re fused as well to allow usps to invoke its statutory right to raise rates to cover the shortfall usps pleaded that providing social subsidies was not part of its mission hindered its competitiveness and was more regressive than taxation in its impact on the public the revenue forgone reform act of 1993 eliminated appropriations to support reduced rates for nonprofits transferring th costs to other mailers the act retained free postage only for the blind and for overseas absentee balloting materials appropriations for subsidizing that narrow pur pose

overview of the appropriations provided since 1972 changes brought about by the revenue forgone reform act of 1993 and current issues regarding the appropriation it does not cover appropriations for em ergency preparedness costs the concept of revenue forgone the pra1 established the postal service as an independent entity with mandate to operate as business and cove r its expenses through postal revenues before then the post office was an executive branch depar tment and congress was heavily involved in such basic decisions as mail classes postage rates and annual wage increases postage rates were set by law and because raising them was po litically difficult the substantial annual postal deficit often as much as 25 of cost s was covered by appropriated funds there was long history of especia lly favorable even free postage rates for mailers providing edu cational materials political discour services to the blind and other eleemosynary benefits with its business orientation and costrecovery mandate however usps was not expected to provide social services or subsidies rather congress recognized its own responsibility to appropriate specific funds fo r any subsidies and to compensate usps for any revenues that it would normally be entitled to for providing the service ie for forgoing those revenues as failsafe provision 39 usc 3627 authorized usps if congress failed to ppropriate funds to cover the costs of free or preferred rates for any class of mail to adjust its rates so that the increased revenues received from the users of such class will equal the amount for that class that the congre ss was to appropriate thus for example if congress failed to appr opriate an adequate amount of money usps could and vowed it would raise rates for nonprofits the blind incounty newspapers or books to the full regular rate applicable based on the cost of service as verified by the postal rate commission usps strongly opposed suggestions that it pick up subsidy costs it argued that shifting costs for social subsidies from the taxpayer to the mailing public was not only in conflict with the usps mission it would hinde r uspss efforts to meet competition and perhaps also be regressive compared to c overing the same costs through taxation usps suggested that the need to appropriate money would in turn force congress to consider more carefully the costs and benefits of each subsidy2 growth of appropriations in early years in the early years number of preferred rates carried over from the prepra days free mailing privileges were provided for the blind and

religious educati onal fraternal scientific agricultural labor and vete rans organizations and forprofit agricultural periodicals reduced thirdclass bulk rates were available to certain nonprofits and to authorized political committees books films and recordings could be sent at reduced fourthclass rates including from publishe rs to schools and libraries the pra provided complicated formula fo r determining and gradually raising postage rates for preferred mailing groups it depended on the separation of costs of handling into two categories direct or attributable costs that could be tied to each class of mail and overhead or institutional costs of maintaining the system such as costs of facilities vehicles pensions debt service management nd administration the postal rate commission was established to oversee the cost determination and ratesetting processes the pra set out 16year schedule for phasing in increases in preferred rates until they fully covered attributable costs it was contemplated that congress would continue in perpetuity to ppropriate funds to cover the in stitutional costs for preferred rate mailers assumed at the time to be about half of total costs associated with these mailings over the years as nonprofit organi zations grew in size and number and regular postage rates increased the annual revenue forgone subsidy became quite costly amounts appropriated rose from 441 million and 557 million in fy1972 and fy1973 to 800 million in fy1979 782 million in fy1980 and 789 million in fy1981 see figure 1 at the same time commercial interests began to complain that they were losing business to nonprofits frequently cited example was the alumni association of wellendowed university able to send out travel and cruise advertisements at subsidized rates in competition with commercial travel agents president reagans first budget early in 1981 for fy1982 recommended substantial cuts in revenue forgone funding cong ress eventually provided 620 million about 180 million less than full funding for the subsidy consequently usps did raise secondclass preferred and library rates closer to their act ual costs and raised the nonprofit third class rate to the full attributable cost level effective in january 19833 under pressure from the office of management and budget omb the postal rate commission gradually changed its cost allocation principles so that attributable costs became larger share of the total thus reducing the propor tion for appropriations to cover the high point of revenue forgone appropriations was fy1985 when 970 million was provided the program was fully f unded during the rest of the 1980s but at diminished amounts because of the cost llocation principles changes 716 million in fy1986 650 million in fy1987 517 million in fy1988 436 million in fy1989 and 460 million in fy1990 see figure 1 about three quarters of these amounts went for the costs of thirdclass bulk ma iling for nonprofit organizations during the first

dappropriation was 81 million short of what was due in fy1992 it was 71 million short and in fy1993 it was an additiona l 360 million short the shortfall was particularly sensitive that year because it pushed usps from narrow profit into an overall loss for the year the reason usps did not take advantage of the failsafe provisions of 39 usc 3627 by raising rate s for nonprofits was that it was expressly forbidden to do so in the appropriations acts much of the discussion in the fy1994 appropriations hearings was devoted to the shortfall which seemed likely to grow by another halfbillion dollars in that year revenue forgone reform act of 1993 part of the rationale fo r not appropriating full reve nue forgone amounts under then current law was that the bush adminis tration proposed in the fy1991 and fy1992 budget submissions to permanently change th eligibility of certain nonprofit mailers for preferred rates particularly classes with ma jor advertising or commercial content the fy1992 budget submission also proposed that charitable educational and benevolent groups would continue to receive reduced rate s but they would be required to pay about 60 of the overhead cost share for their ma il with the revenue forgone appropriation covering the other 40 n onprofit mailers objected str ongly and action was taken other than cut in the appropriation pres ident clintons first budget proposal released february 17 1993 likewise termed the revenu forgone mail subsidy an inefficient means of supporting charitable and nonprofit organizations and asserted that many loopholes exist that allow some mailers to take advantage of the system in compromise brokered by the house committee on post office and civil service this proposal eventually resulted in the revenue forgone reform act of 1993 title vii of the treasury postal service and general government appropriations act 1994 pl 103123 107 stat 1267 the act entirely eliminated the authorization of appropriations for preferred rates for any class of mail in its place the act created mechanism to continue prefe rred postage rates for restrict ed categories of nonprofits by phasing in higher rates and having other mail classes bear the remaining institutional costs that had previously been c overed by appropriations non profits gradually went from situation where they paid none of the institutiona l costs attributable to others in their class in fy1993 to onetwelfth in fy1994 then in annual steps to onehalf in fy1998 and beyond the remaining half is absorbed w ithin rates charged other mailers pl 106 384 114 stat 1460 modified the formula but not in way that affected appropriations the revenue forgone reform act did pres erve one appropriate d subsidy however free mailing privileges for the blind and visually impaired for voting materials under the uniformed and overseas citizens absentee voting act and for certain consular and diplomatic officials on recipr ocal basis the latter sub category has been too minor to warrant mention in subsequent appropriations reque sts or hearings because usps was owed substantial amounts for the failure of appropriations in fy1991fy1993 and because it would have additi onal costs during the phasein period for the nonprofits the act also authorized the appropriation of 29 million each year from 1994 through 20354 this was gradual payment to reimburse the postal service for losses which it incurred as result of insufficient appropria tions for fy 1991 fy 1992 and fy1993 and for anticipated expenditures through 1998 relating to nonprofits intere st on the debt washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21025crs5 5 the cost of free mail for the blind is well ov er 90 of the total appropriation even in an election year usage has gone from 466 million

statements on postal operations 19801990 us office of management and budget budget of the united states government appendix washington gpo 19902006 note since usps uses accrual rather than cash acc ounting figures in its annual reports do not match these data usps has recognized revenues forgone in 19911998 as earned revenues in those years and accounts r eceivable even t hough the revenue forgone reform act of 1993 does not provide for final payment of the debt until 2035 current appropriations and issues in the years since 1994 congress has regu larly appropriated th requested amounts for revenue forgone in providing free mail fo r the blind and for overseas voters including the 29 million due each year for the 19911993 shortfall because only the blind overseas voters and few dipl omatic officials are still elig ible for subsidy amounts are only fraction of what they were before actment of the revenue forgone reform act5 for example the fy2005 appropriation was 907 million including 617 million for revenue forgone in fy2004 and 29 million due annually under the 1993 reform act some issues however remain first beginning in fy1999 congress has made the revenue forgone appropriations payment not in the year during which the expenses were incurred but in the following fiscal year thus the fy1999 appropriation was made payable october 1 1999 after fy1999 had ende d as an advance appropriation this meant that only 29 million was scored in fy 1999 the george w bush administration in its fy2002 budget proposed to reverse the misleading budget practice of using advance appropriations simply to avoid annual spending limitations by providing the fy2002 funds on current basis the fy2002 tr easury postal service and general government appropriations ac t pl 10767 115

the law actually relieved usps from the prospect of overpaying its obligations to the civil service retirement fund by 103 billion under the previous payment schedule 7 letter from the postmaster general to the honorable ted stevens chairman senate committee on appropriations feb 2 2004 and feb 26 2004 house appropriations testimonyuntil fy2007 the postmaster general in his house appropr iations subcommittee statement on february 26 2004 complained about the financial burden usps bears by not being paid for year after mailings have been handled and delivered an issue arose in 2004 and 2005 ab out the annual payment schedule for revenue forgone in past years that is set forth in th revenue forgone reform act as explained above the act authorized annual payments to usps of 29 million through the year 2035 for 11 years the payment was provided as matter of course in its fy2005 budget however the bush administration proposed to provide funds for the payment and included it in list of 65 terminations to discretionary programs in the budget congress provided the funds anyway howev er added by the senate in the fy2005 omnibus appropriations measure pl 108 447 division h in its fy2006 budget the president again proposed to eliminate the paymen t the subsequent budget justification mentioned that congress and the administra tion had in passing pl 10818 relieved usps of the obligation to pay 3 b illion per year for pension costs more than compensating the organization for the loss of the small revenue forgone appropriation6 when the termination was first proposed usps complained to congress about this dramatic departure from past presidential budget submissions the postmaster general has warned that since usps booked the obliga tions as accounts recei vable in the years in which congress subsidized nonprofit mailers the whole amount due might have to be charged to current ratepayers in the next rate case because the postal service is required under generally accepted acc ounting principles to reduce the value of an amount receivable to reflect an uncerta inty as to full payment the failure to receive these funds may require the postal service to treat these remaining payments as bad debt7 thus while the administrations budget propos would save the taxpayer 29 million in fy2006 it could wind up costing postal ratepa yers 870 million in the next rate case this calculation is apparently what persua ded congress to provide the funds in both fy2005 and fy2006 finally the fy2006 budget requested 21 2 million less for revenue forgone in providing free mail for the blind and overseas voting than usps had estimated these subsidies will cost in fy2006 this is not as serious matter for usps as the annual 29 million payment of past debt because bot h the amount requested by usps for fy2006 79935000 and the amount in the pres idents fy2006 budget 58767000 are both estimates of the actual expense it has always been the case that when final audited mail volumes are available rec onciliation adjustment is made in the budget to bring the actual payment into line with past estimates for example the budget request for fy2006 included 28583000 reconciliation ad justment reflecting that actual use of the subsidy in fy2003 was underestimated by that amount presumably if the administrations request is below actual usage in fy2006 fu ture reconciliation adju stment will make up the difference
