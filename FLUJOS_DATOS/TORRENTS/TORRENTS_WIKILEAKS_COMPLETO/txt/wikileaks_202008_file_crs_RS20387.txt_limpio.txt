the third such meeting since the wto went into effect on january 1 1995 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 previous ministerials the first ministerial meeting was held in singapore on december 913 1996 at that meeting trade ministers discussed the functioning of the wto since it went into effect implementation of the uruguay round agreements and other issues the meeting resulted in three working groups on topics considered new issues 1 the relationship between trade and investment 2 the interaction between trade and competition policy eg antitrust policies and 3 transparency availability of information in government procurement trade ministers directed that the wto council for trade in goods which reports to the chief administrative body the general council undertake further work on the simplification of trade procedures trade facilitation they also agreed to plan of action to improve the capacity of leastdeveloped countries to respond to trade opportunities capacitybuilding they recognized the international labor organization as the competent body to establish and deal with labor standards further large number of participants signed declaration to reduce barriers to trade in information technology products the second ministerial was held in geneva on may 18th and 20th 1998 and coincided with the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the modern multilateral trading system the wtos precursor the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt had been established in 1948 at the second ministerial participants directed the general council to prepare work program for the wto with recommendations for consideration at the third ministerial the communique at the end of the ministerial stated that the general councils recommendations could cover implementation of the uruguay round the future agenda of talks that were mandated by the uruguay round agreements the builtin agenda future work on the basis of the singapore program followup to the program on leastdeveloped countries or any other matters trade ministers also directed the general council to prepare work program on global electronic commerce and report on the progress of the work program and any recommendations for action at the third ministerial they agreed that countries continue the practice of not imposing tariffs on electronic transmissions issues for the seattle ministerial when trade ministers meet in seattle at the end of this month the leading topic will be an agenda for new round of multilateral trade negotiations1 the core of this agenda will be the socalled builtin agenda which was mandated under the agreements reached during the uruguay round the most important topics of the builtin agenda are agricultural trade and trade in services the uruguay round agreement on agriculture states that talks on continuing substantial progressive reductions in support and protection resulting in fundamental reform should begin by january 1 2000 the agreement on trade in services calls for negotiations on services with view to achieving progressively higher level of liberalization that should begin by the same date these negotiations on agriculture services and any other topics mandated by the uruguay 1 for further information on the new round of negotiations see crs report rl30270 the world trade organization future negotiations by arlene wilson crs3 round agreements are considered the backbone of new round of multilateral trade negotiations that will begin after the ministerial although most countries recognize their obligations to address the topics of the built in agenda they are far from agreement on how these topics should be addressed on agriculture for example the united states and other members of the cairns group group of agricultural exporters advocate the reduction or elimination of agricultural export subsidies and other assistance in testimony before the house agriculture committee on october 20 1999 us trade representative ustr charlene barshefsky said that us proposals in agriculture for the new round are 1 elimination of export subsidies 2 substantial reduction of tradedistorting supports 3 lower and bound tariff rates 4 better administration of tariffrate quotas 5 stronger disciplines on state trading enterprises 6 improved market access for leastdeveloped wto members and 7 trade in biotechnology products based on transparent predictable and timely processes2 the conflict between the united states and the european union eu on agriculture that dominated the uruguay round is continuing in the preparations for the ministerial for example the united states has charged that the eu is pushing comprehensive agenda for the new round to take attention away from agriculture the united states also opposes the eu position on the multifunctionality of agriculture which means the use of agriculture for rural development and other purposes aside from food production the united states has conflict with canada over statetrading enterprises although canada and the united states share many objectives on agricultural trade canada insists on maintaining its marketing boards including the wheat board us farmers want disciplines on canadas wheat board and claim that the promotional efforts of the wheat board give an unfair advantage to canadian farmers countries are far from agreement as well on how trade in services should be addressed in the new round us objectives mentioned by deputy ustr susan esserman during testimony before the senate finance subcommittee on trade on october 21 1999 include 1 liberalized restrictions on broad range of services 2 increased participation in telecommunications and financial services agreements 3 rules for new technologies and 4 discrimination against certain modes of delivering services countries disagree over whether the scope of the new round should be limited to the builtin agenda or expanded for more comprehensive talks and trade ministers will address this question in seattle developing countries argue for more narrow agenda saying that the developed countries have not yet implemented the commitments made under the uruguay round developing countries are insisting on time extensions to the commitments they made during the uruguay round before they agree to significant additional commitments the eu and japan are promoting broad agenda the eu has proposed that the round include the builtin agenda items of agriculture and services as well as investment trade facilitation competition trade and environment technical barriers to trade and government procurement3 in testimony before the senate finance committee on september 29 1999 ustr barshefsky said that the core of the round should address market access concerns and the rounds agenda should be 2 for further information on agriculture in the new round see crs report 98254 agriculture in the next round of multilateral trade negotiations by charles hanrahan 3 for eu policies on the new round see httpeuropaeuintcommdg01dg1newroundhtm crs4 complemented and balanced by forward workprogram to address areas where consensus does not yet exist in other words the united states does not support the broad agenda of the eu and japan another issue related to the scope of the new round is whether countries should sign agreements as they are reached early harvest or wait for an overall agreement that includes tradeoffs among many topics single undertaking this question also is expected to be decided by the end of the ministerial as countries prepare for the seattle meeting they will face the question of whether or not to expand the new round to include social issues at conference in midaugust the g15 developing countries announced that they opposed linking social clauses such as labor issues with trade and protested attempts by developed countries to add items that would impede market access to developing countries4 the eu wants these items on the agenda the united states proposes further study of most of these issues but wants work program established on trade and labor in her september 29 testimony ustr barshefsky noted that the united states already submitted proposal in the wto for establishment of workprogram to address trade issues relating to labor standards she also stated that the united states will seek enhanced links between the wto and the international labor organization through mutual observer status other topics that have been mentioned as possible items on the agenda for the new round include trade facilitation to make customs procedures simpler and more understandable the three topics for the working groups that were established at the first ministerial in singapore investment competition and government procurement and the environment controversial topic is antidumping the united states is adamant that this topic not be included in future negotiations but large number of other countries including japan are pushing to have it added many other issues will be considered in seattle either as part of the discussion on the new round or separately one issue is special treatment for lessdeveloped countries on november 18 1999 the chairman of the wto general council circulated working papers for wto ministerial declaration5 the papers showed that wto members concurred on very little but they did agree that the principles of the new round should include development objectives such as economic development and eradication of poverty and special and differential treatment for developing countries another proposed topic for the seattle meeting is market access for nonagricultural products sectoral negotiations began as the early voluntary sectoral liberalization program under the asia pacific economic cooperation apec forum and talks on eight of those sectors moved to the wto as the accelerated tariff liberalization atl6 the 4 washington trade daily august 19 and 20 1999 5 earlier draft texts for the declaration were released on october 7 and on october 19 1999 6 the eight sectors being considered under the accelerated tariff liberalization atl initiative are chemicals energy equipment environmental goods fish and fishery products forest products gems and jewelry medical equipment and instruments and toys see crs report rl30286 asia continued crs5 united states wanted to complete the atl talks before the seattle meeting but according to some reports completion by the ministerial might be unlikely in addition to sectoral negotiations talks have been underway in the wto on information technology products and the united states is pushing for second agreement on these products to follow on an agreement reached few years ago further the 1998 ministerial in geneva called for work on electronic commerce and ambassador esserman testified on august 5th before the house ways and means committee that the top immediate us priority at the seattle ministerial is to ensure that cyberspace remains dutyfree the eu has questioned whether such electronic commerce should fall under the trade in services not goods agreement temporary extension of the dutyfree treatment on electronic commerce that was reached at the second ministerial and proposal to study the issue further are under consideration an important proposal that has had little discussion in the past is how to make the wto decisionmaking process including dispute procedures more open to non governmental organizations and others affected by the outcome of wto decisions both the united states and the eu have taken the position that the wto needs to better address the concerns of its constituents the united states also supports institutional reforms to make the wto more transparent and more understandable to the public the us proposals on wto transparency openness however has not received broad support from other countries many groups that oppose the wtos decisionmaking process or its trade rules are expected to be in seattle to voice their positions the national wildlife federation nwf for example is calling for balance of economic and environmental concerns in us trade policy reform of the wto to reflect environmental priorities more open democratic procedures and wto trade rules that are consistent with environmental protection goals7 the aflcio wants wto rules changed to incorporate workers rights address how trade liberalization affects incomes and make proceedings more open and visible8 these and other nongovernmental organizations will try to influence the agenda for the upcoming wto talks in the time before the ministerial starts wto officials are trying to build consensus on the topics for discussion in seattle the november 18th working papers by the chairman of the wto general counsel was one step toward that end the papers however show that countries are still wide apart on large number of major issues the time remaining before the ministerial is seriously limited wto officials had hoped to have more refined draft text for trade ministers to consider what is not resolved before the seattle meeting which appears to be extensive will be brought to the table for trade ministers to resolve 6 continued pacific economic cooperation apec and the 1999 summit in new zealand by dick k nanto 7 nwf web site at httpwwwnwforgnwfinternationaltradewtoactionnowhtml 8 the aflcio web page includes call for workers to join march and rally on november 30th in seattle see httpwwwaflcioorgwtoindexhtm number of environmental groups are also expected to join the protests crs6 issues for congress since the ministerial is expected to focus on the agenda for the new round of multilateral trade talks an important legislative issue is what kind of authority if any congress should grant to the executive branch for the new round in the past congress gave goahead in the form of fasttrack negotiating authority which assured timely upordown vote on an agreement on the condition that trade officials consulted adequately with congress during the entire process currently there is fasttrack trade negotiating authority and congress has not approved set of objectives for the new wto round so us trade officials will attend the meeting in seattle without mandate from congress what does the absence of fasttrack authority mean for the upcoming wto talks some trade observers point out that president reagan did not have fasttrack authority when the uruguay round trade negotiations began in 1986 at that time proposals to grant fasttrack authority were under consideration in congress and fasttrack authority was eventually approved in 1988 these observers suggest that delay in granting fast track authority will not prevent the new round from moving forward however other observers believe the situation then was more supportive of the round of negotiations if this round begins and while it is underway congress grants fast track negotiating authority to finish it then the negotiating process might not be disrupted but if the round begins and congress grants fasttrack authority or grants authority that would require major change in the us position then the consequences might be significantly different without fasttrack authority any legislation needed to implement agreements would be subject to the normal legislative process which means that implementing legislation could be amended possibly requiring renegotiation or might not be brought up for vote beyond fasttrack there are other perspectives to the seattle ministerial one perspective is that the fate of the seattle ministerial should not be viewed as referendum on us support for open trade while there remains understanding that increased trade and lower trade barriers raise countrys standard of living over time there is much debate within the united states about the distribution of benefits both among trading partners and within countries second perspective is the leadership role of the united states in world trade for most of this decade the united states was the chief proponent of multilateral trade negotiations to reduce trade barriers now however there is widespread public debate about the us commitment to open trade and whether the united states needs to negotiate with other countries to achieve an optimum trade policy if the united states is reluctant to continue as leader in world trade talks then serious questions arise where do we go from here if the new round fails to get off the ground will the world trading system slip toward protectionism should open markets longer be the main objective of commercial talks but instead be only one element along with other issues such as social normalization should new alliances be formed among countries and new leadership evolve for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20387
