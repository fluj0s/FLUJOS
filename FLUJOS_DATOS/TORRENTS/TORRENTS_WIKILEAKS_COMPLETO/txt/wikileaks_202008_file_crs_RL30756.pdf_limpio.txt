rmaceutical industry the industry has been described as patentintensive enterprises within this sector frequently obtain patent protection and enforce patent rights and reportedly place higher comparative value on patents than do competitors in many other markets the patent law is based upon the patent act of 1952 codi fied in title 35 of the united states code this statute allows inventors to obtain patents on processes machines manufactures and compositions of matter that are useful new and nonobvious granted patents confer the righ t to exclude others from making using selling offering to sell or importing into the united states the patented invention the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 the 1984 act commonly known as the hatchwax man act made several significant changes to the patent laws designed to encourage innovation in the pharmaceutical industry while facilitating the speedy intr oduction of lowercost generic drugs these changes include provisions for extending the term of patent to reflect regulatory delays encountered in obtaining ma rketing approval by the food and drug administration fda statutory exemption from patent infringement for activities associated with regulatory marketing approval establishment of mechanisms to challenge the validity of pharmaceutical patent and reward for disputing the validity enforceability or infringement of patented and approved drug the 1984 act also provides the fda with certain authorities to offer periods of marketing exclusivity for pharmaceutical independent of the rights conferred by patents many experts agree the 1984 act has had significant effect on the availability of generic substitutes for brand name drugs lower cost generics tend to be rapidly marketed after patent expiration increasin g investment in rd and gains in the research intensity of the pharmaceutical indus try appear to indicat that the act has not deterred the development of new drugs however some questioned whether the law is needed to achieve the stated goals critics maintain ed the necessity of patent related incentives for innovation is mitigated by other federal activities

interest in methods to pr ovide drugs at lower cost particularly for the elderly has rekindled discussion over the role th federal government plays in facilitating the creation of new pharmaceu ticals for the marketplace among the various federal laws that affect tec hnology development are those dealing with intellectual property rights particularly patents legislation concerning the ownership of inventions is intended to encourage dditional private sector investments often necessary to further develop marketable pr oducts the current approach attempts to balance the public sectors interest in new and improved technol ogies with concerns over providing companies valuable bene fits without adequate accountability or compensation questions have been raised as to whether or not this balance is appropriate particularly with respect to drug discovery critics maintain that the need for technology development in centives in the pharmaceutical andor biotechnology sectors is mitigated by i ndustry access to governmentsupported work at cost monopoly power through patent protection and additi onal regulatory and tax advantages such as those conveyed through the drug price competition and patent term restoration ac t and the orphan drug act supporters of the existing approach argue that these incentives are precisely what are required and have given rise to robust pharmaceutical and

rights and reportedly place higher comparative valu on patents than do competitors in many other markets3 role of patents in pharmaceutical innovation the patent system is grounded in article i section 8 clause 8 of the us constitution and is intended to stimulate new discoveries and their reduction to practice commonly known as innovation the constitution states that the congress shall have power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries th award of patent permits the creator of an idea to exclude others tempor arily from use of that concept without compensation currently 20 years from the date of filing it also places the information associated with an invention within the public domain patent ownership is percei ved to be an incentive to innovation the basis for the technological advancement that contributes to economic growth it is through the commercialization and use of new products and processes that productivity gains are made and the scope and quality of goods and services are expanded award of patent is intended to stimula the investment necessary to develop an idea and bring it to the marketplace embodied in pr oduct or process pa tent title provides the recipient with limitedtime monopoly over the application of his discovery in exchange for the public dissemination of information contained in the patent application this is intended to permit the inventor to receive return on the expenditure of resources leading to the discovery but does not guarantee that the patent will generate commerc ial benefits the requireme nt for publication of the patent is expected to stimulate add itional innovation and other creative means to meet similar and expanded mands in the marketplace innovation typically is knowledgedriv based on the application of knowledge whether it is scie ntific technical experientia l or intuitive innovation also produces new knowledge one charact eristic of knowledge that underlies the patent system is that it is public good good that is not exhausted when it is used as john shoven of stanford univer sity points out the use of an idea or discovery by one person does not in most cases reduce the availability of that information to others4 therefore the marginal social cost of the

information is near zero because the stock of knowledge is not depleted ordinarily society maximizes its welfare through not charging for the use of free good5 however innovation typically is costly and resource intensive patents permit novel concepts or discoveries to beco property when reduced to practice and therefore allow for control over their use they create incentives that maximize the difference between the value of the intellectual property that is created and used and the so cial cost of its creation6 studies demonstrate that the rate of return to society as whole generated by investments in research and devel opment rd leading to innovation is significantly larger than the benefits that can be captured by the person or organization financing the work it is estimated that the social rate of return on rd spending is over twice that of the rate of return to the inventor7 ideas often are easily imitated the knowledge associated with an innovation dispersed and adapted to other products and processes that in turn stimulate growth in the economy that can happen in the absence of appropriability defined as factors excluding firm and market structure that govern an innovato rs ability to capture the profits generated by an innovation8 the appropriability of an invention depends on the level of competition in the industry and the type of information related to the innovation the more competition and the more basic th knowledge the less appropriable it is9 the difficulty in securing sufficient returns to spending on research and development has been associated with underi nvestment in those activities the patent process is designed to resolve the problem of appropriability if discoveries were universally available without the means fo r the inventor to realize return on investments there would result much lower and indeed suboptimal level of innovation10 while research is often im portant to innovation studies have shown that it constitutes only 25 of the cost of commercializing new technology or technique thus it is the expenditu re of substantial amount of additionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30756crs4 11robert p merges

practice for 20 years from date of filing that is intended to encourage those investments n ecessary to further develop an idea and generate marketable technology issuance of patent provides the inve ntor with limitedtime monopoly that is influenced by other mitigating factors particularly the requirements for information disclosure the length of th patent and the scope of ri ghts conferred the process of obtaining patent places the concept on which it is based in the public domain in return for monopoly right to the pplication of the knowledge generated the inventor must publish the ideas covered in the patent as disclosure system the patent can and often does stimulate other firms or individuals to invent around existing patents to provide for parallel technical developments or meet similar market needs the patent system thus has dual policy goals providing incentives for inventors to invent and encouraging inve ntors to disclose technical information11 disclosure requirements are factors in achie ving balance between current and future innovation through the patent process as are limitations on sc ope novelty mandates and nonobviousness considerations12 they give rise to an environment of competitiveness with multiple sources of innovation which is viewed by some experts as the basis for tec hnological progress this is important because as robert merges boston university and richar d nelson columbia university found in their studies when only few orga nizations controlled the development of technology technical adva nce appeared sluggish13 not everyone agrees that the patent system is particularly effective means to stimulate innovation it is argued that pa tents do not work in reality as well as in theory because they do not confer perfect ppropriability in other words they allow the inventor to obtain larger portion of the returns on his investment but do not permit him to capture all the benefits patents can be circumvented and infringement cannot always be proven thus patents ar not the only way nor necessarily the most efficient means for the inventor to pr otect the benefits gene rated by his efforts study by yale universitys richard vin and his colleagues concluded that lead time learning curve advantages eg fa miliarity with the sc ience and technology under consideration and salesservice activities were

determined through reverse engineering taking the item apart to assess how it was made that information then could be used by compe titors if not covered by patent because it is more difficult to identify the procedures related to process other means of appropriation are seen as preferable to patents with the attendant disclosure requirements14 the utility of patents to companies varies among industrial sectors patents are perceived as critical in the drug and chemi cal industries that may reflect the nature of rd performed in these sectors where the resulting patents are more detailed in their claims and therefore easier to defend15 in contrast one study found that in the aircraft and semiconductor indus tries patents are not the most successful mechanism for capturing the benefits of investments instead lead time and the strength of the learning curve were determined to be more important16 the degree to which industry perceives patents as effective s been characterized as positively correlated with the increase in duplication costs and time associated with patents17 in certain industries patents significan tly raise the costs incurred by nonpatent holders wishing to use the idea or invent around the patent an estimated 40 in the pharmaceutical sector 30 fo r major new chemical products and 25 for typical chemical goods and are thus viewed as important however in other industries patents have much smaller impact on the costs associated with imitation eg in the 715 range for electronics and may be considered less successful in protecting resource investments18 principles of patentability patentable subject matter patent law is based upon the patent act of 1952 codified in title 35 of the united states code section 101 defines th subject matter that may be

statutory categories processes machines manufact ures and compositions of matter may be subject to socalled utility patent actors within the pharmaceutical industry principally claim inventions that are compositions of matter or processes in addition to such things as mixtures and alloys compositions of matte r include chemical compounds20 when composition of matter is presented in the fashion of patent claim it is defined in terms of its constituent elements patent claim that is expressed as series of steps is known as process or method claim process claims are comm only divided into two sorts method of using and method of making claims21 suppose that an i nventor manufactures new pharmaceutical compound and also disc overs that the compound may be used to treat particular ailment the manner in which the pharmaceutical may be employed to achieve result may be drafted in the form of claim towards method of using as well the inventor may obtain claims for method of making the compound stating the techniques he em ployed to synthesize the compound section 100b of the patent act notes that process includes new use of known process machine manufacture composition of matter or method22 the statute thus allows inventors to obtain proprietary interest in newly discovered property of known product suppose for ex ample that an inve ntor discovers that wellknown chemical compound understood to act as an explosive also serves as heart medication the inventor could not obtain patent protection on compound that already lies within the public domain but he could seek patent claiming process of using the compound as heart medication23 utility section 101 of the patent ac t also mandates that pate nts issue only to useful inventions24 utility ordinarily presents minimal requirement that the invention be capable of achieving pragmatic result25 patent applicants need only supply single operable use of the invention that is credible to persons of ordinary skill in the art although the utility requirement is readily met in most fields it may present significant obstacle to patentability for pha rmaceutical inventions here inventors sometimes synthesize compounds without precise knowledge of how they may be used to achieve practical working result when patent applications are filedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30756crs7 26385 us 419 1966 27ibid p 53435claiming such compounds they may be reject ed as lacking utility within the meaning of the patent law the utility requirement should be viewed in light of the considerable incentives chemists biologists and physicians posse ss to obtain patent protection on compounds of interest as soon as possible fo r example in the case of pharmaceutical compounds food and drug author ities require considerable product testing before the pharmaceutical can be broadly marketed before investin g further time and effort on laboratory testing and clinical trials actors in the pharmaceutical field desire to obtain patent rights on promising compounds even where their particular properties are as yet not well understood but when patent applications are filed too close to the laboratory bench inventors have discovered that the utility requirement may block the issuance of patent the supreme court opinion in brenner v manson addressed such situation26 the inventor manson filed patent application cla iming method of making known steroid compound although the particular com pound ma nson was concerned with was already known to the art chemists had yet to identify any setting in which it could be gainfully employed however as skilled artisans knew that another steroid with very similar structure had tumorinhibiting effects in mice mansons new method of making the compound wa s research tool of interest to the scientific community the us patent and trademark offi ce uspto board of patent appeals affirmed the examiners rejection of the application the board reasoned that because manson could not identify single use for the steroid he produced the utility requirement was not satisfied the bo ard was unimpressed that similar compound did have beneficial effects noting that in the unpredictable art of steroid chemistry even minor changes in chemical structure often lead to significant and unforeseeable changes in the performance of the compound manson then appealed to the court of customs and patent appeals ccpa which reversed key to the ccpas reasoning was that the sequence of pro cess steps claimed by manson would produce the steroid of interest according to the ccpa because the claimed process worked to produce compound the utility requirement was satisfied the supreme court granted certiorari and once more reversed thereby upholding the patent office rejection at least within the context of scientific research tools the court imposed re quirement that an invention may not be patentable until it has been developed to point where specific benefit exists in currently available form27 chief among the courts concerns was the breadth of the proprietary interest that could result from claims such as those in mansons application until the process claim s been reduced to production of product shown to be useful the metes and bounds of that monopoly are not capable of precise delineation such pa tent may confer power to bl ock whole areas of

to the public28 the court closed by noting that patent is not hunting license it is not reward for the search but compensation for its successful conclusion patent system must be related to the world of commerce rather than to the realm of philosophy29 although brenner v manson appears to take strict view of the utility requirement more recent lower court opinion on utility in re brana 30 suggests more limited role like manson brana cla imed chemical compounds and stated they were useful as antitumor substances the scientific community knew that structurally similar compounds had shown antitumor activity during both in vitro testing done in the laboratory using tissue samples and in vivo testing using mice as test subjects the latter tests had been conducted using cell lines known to cause lymphocytic tumors in mice the uspto board rejected the application for lack of utility and on appeal the united states court of appeals for the fede ral circuit federal circuit reversed among the objections of the uspto was that the tests cited by brana were conducted upon lymphomas induced in laborator animals rather than real diseases the federal circuit responded that an inventor need not wait til an animal or human develops disease natu rally before finding cure31 the uspto further argued that brana cited clinical tes ting and therefore had proof of actual treatment of the disease in live animals the federal circuit reasoned that proof of utility did not demand tests for the full sa fety and effectiveness of the compound but only acceptable evidence of medical effects in standard experimental animal32 the holding of brana along with its failure to discuss or even cite brenner v manson suggests that the federal circuit will adopt more liberal approach to the utility requirement than did the supreme court33 the federal circuit did indicate that in cases where the invention lacks we llestablished use in the art the applicant must disclose specific credible use

the prevailing party in the interference is usually the individual who was the first to invent the claimed technology 52 postgrant uspto proceedings uspto involvement in the patent syst em does not necessarily end when it formally grants patent two significant postgrant proceedings are worthy of note here first patentee may employ the reissue proceeding to correct patent that he believes to be inope rative or invalid53 for example suppose th at subsequent to the issuance of patent the patentee discovers prior art that would invalidate the patent due to anticipation or obviousnesss by in corporating additiona l limitations into the patent claims through the reissue proceeding the patentee may yet be able to define patentable advance over the prior art the second significant postgrant pro ceeding is known as reexamination feature of us law since 1981 the reexamin ation statute allows that any individual including the patentee licensee and even the uspto director himself may cite patent or printed publication to the uspto and request that reexamination occur54 if the uspto determines that this reference raises substantial new question of patentability55 then it will

might be judged noninfringing however where experimental uses of the invention are in fact motivated by commercial purposes this experimental use doctrine will not serve as an infringement defense as described above congress subsequently modified these experimental use principles with an eye towards the pharmaceutical industry the patent statute also includes provisions concerning contributory infringement and the active inducement of anothers infringement67 under these statutes individuals who encourage the unauthorized practice of anothers patent infringement may themselves be liable for patent infri ngement in certain ci rcumstances suppose for example that supplier sells medication that has both infringing and noninfringing uses if the supplier pr ovides instructions distributes advertising or offers training that promotes the infringing use then it may be guilty of active inducement and liable for patent infringement68 although the exclusive rights provided by patent are founded upon the claims they are not necessarily limited to them although the courts have long recognized the value of clear and certain claims they have sometimes expanded the scope of protection associated with patent under the socalled doctrine of equivalents the doctrine of equivalents arose from judicial efforts to stop competitors who would introduce insignificant modifications from the claimed invention in order to avoid literal infringement69 as provided in the 1997 supreme court opinion in warner jenkinson co v hilton davis chemical co an accused product or process that presents insubstantial differences from the claimed invention will judged an equivalent and therefore an infringement70 defendants intent is irrelevant to the outcome of an infringement inquiry even an individual who has never previous ly known of the asserted patent may be found to be an infringer71 as well the exclusive patent rights do not provide an affirmative right for the patentee to employ the invention himself72 for example the fact that an inventor obtains pate nt on pharmaceutical compound does not allow him to market this medication to others approval of the appr opriate food and

this case the alpha patent is said to be blocking or dominant patent over betas improvement or subservient patent in such instances the holders of the dominant and subservien t patent often possess

countries74 individuals must obtain patent protection in each nation where they wish to guard against unauthorized use of their inventions under the first sale or exhaustion doc trine an authorized unrestricted sale of patented product depletes the patent right with respect to that product as result of this doctrine the purchaser of patented good ordinar ily may use or resell the good without further regard to the pate ntee the courts have reasoned that when patentee sells product wit hout restriction it impliedly promises its customer that it will not interfere with the full enjoyment of

could be directly infringed only by the performan ce of those steps suppose for example that an inventor holds patent on pa rticular method of making pharmaceutical by itself the act of selling the pharmaceuti cal does not infringe this method patent the seller would also have to make the pharmaceutical by the patented method in order to be liable for infringement76 this general principle was

litigation and bears the burden or proving that infringing acts have occurred81 however congress recognized that patentees may face great difficulties in proving that particular product resulted from the performance of the patented process the patent act theref ore creates presumption that product is made by patented proce ss if two conditions are met82 first there must be substantial likelihood that th product was made by the pa tented process second the plaintiff must have made reasonable effort to determine the process actually used in the production of the product and was unable to so determine the effect of the presumption is that the accused infringer has the burden of asserting that the accused product was not made by the patented process infringement litigation the patentee may file civil suit in federal district court in order to enjoin infringers and obtain monetary remedies83 although issued patents enjoy presumption of validity accused infringers may assert that the

pharmaceutical safe and effective for consumer use for example but the uspto could rule that the compound does not present sufficient advance over public domain knowledge to be worthy of patent lternatively it is readily within the power of the fda to judge that pharmaceutical presents too great risk for use as medication within the united states despite the fact that the uspto has allowed patent to issue claiming that pharmaceutical as result of the independence of patent ownership and mark eting approval the pharmaceutical industry must acc ount for both in order to sell drug without

infringement litigation against the approved drug manufacturer court may issue an injunction and award monetary liability for patent infringement despite the fact of fda marketing approval although

sorts of studies were not available for all drugs howev er further at times the food and drug administration requested additional studies to deal with safety and efficacy questions that arose from experience with the drug following its initial approval the result is that some generic manufacturers were for ced to prove independently that the drug was safe and effective even though their pr oduct was identical to that of previously approved drug some commentators believed that the approval of generic drug was needlessly costly duplicative and timec onsuming process prior to the 1984 act105 fda safety and efficacy requirements sometimes required clinical trials for example which could prove very expensive some observers noted that although patents on important drugs had expire d manufacturers were not moving to introduce generic equivalents for these products106 as the introduction of generic equivalents often causes prices to decrease the interest of consumers was arguably

defe nse lies under the socalled experimental use doctrine perhaps the first discussi on of this infringement defense occurred in the 1813 decision in whittemore v cutter 109 there justice joseph

approval procedures however when competitor becomes interested in marketing the generic equivalent of drug patented by another it may wish to commen ce the clinical trials and other procedures during

next considered two contentions offered by bolar first bolar urged that the experimental use defense exempted its efforts to comply with federal food and drug law after reviewing the preceden ts judge nichols disagreed concluding bolars intended experimental use is solely for business reasons and not for amusement to satisfy idle curiosity or for strictly philosophical inquiry bolars intended use of flurazepam hcl to derive fda required test data is thus an infringement of the roche patent bo lar may intend to perform experiments but unlicensed experiments conducted with view to the adaptation of the patented invention to the experimentors business is violation of the rights of the patentee to exclude others from using his patented invention it is obvious here that it is misnomer to call the intended use minimus it is trifle in its economic effect on the parties even if the quantity used is small it is not dilettante affair such as justice story envisioned we cannot construe the experimental use rule so broadly as to llow violation of the patent laws in the guise of scientific inquiry when that inquiry has definite cognizable and not insubstantial commercial purposes118 bolar finally urged the federal circuit to resolve perceived conflict between the food drug and cosmetic act119 and the 1952 patent act120 bolar observed that substantial regulatory delays were associated with the receipt of fda marketing approval according to bolar if generic manufacturer could not commence seeking fda approval until the appropriate patents had expired then the patentee could preserve

validity or infringement consisting of 180 days of market exclusivity to the first generic applicant to file patent challenge against any approved drug the 1984 act modified the 1952 patent ac t by creating statutory exemption from certain claims of patent infringement as codified in 271e1 this provision mandates that it shall not be an infringement to make use offer to sell or sell within the united states patented inventi on solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information under federal law which regulates the manufacture use or sale of drugs or

satisfy the fda the intermedics court then applied this reasoning to the facts before it concluding that number of accused activ ities fell within the safe harbor of 271e1 the court held that device

appears more complex the data suggests that rd funding as well as rd intensity are increasing while there are direct measures of innovation these figures along with the number of new drugs approve d and those in development do provide indicators of continuing innovation in the industry however it is not clear whether the innovation occurring is facilitated by the 1984 act or is independent of its provisions some experts argue that the expiration of patents and the desire to generate new replacement drugs not the extension of patent ownership is the stimulus to innovation182 the portions of the legislation that ve accelerated the introduction of generic products have affected the brand name firms in various ways that may or may not influence innovation in the industry th congressional budget office found that originator drugs lose more than 40 of their market on average to generic versions after patent expires this is combined with research that indicates the rate of market share decline is increasing studies by grabowski and his colleagues indicate that while these brand name drugs lost more than 31 of their market share per unit in the year betw een 1989 and 1990 during the first

of these provisions see introduction to the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984despite competition from generics that have appreciably lower prices the prices for brand name drugs often increase after patent expiration grabowski and vernon found that innovator drug prices continued to increase at the same rate as before the introduction of generics even as market sh ares declined at the same time generic prices for the comparable drugs fell184 brand name firms have reacted to the opportunities for establishing generi c market provided in the 1984 act by maintaining and even raisin g the price of the brandname product on the theory that the demand for it was more inelastic than the demand for the pricesensitive segment they have embarked on new aggressive st rategy designed to serve the brandloyal segment and capture substantial share of the generic market185 such price increases are based on the recognition that when generic substitutes are available the market bifurcates priceinsensitive consumers will pay more for brand name while consumers that respond to price will buy the generic186 one expert fm scherer notes that price competition worked much more powerfully among relatively undifferentiate d generic products than between differentiated branded products and undi fferentiated generics187 to protect their market share brand name companies focus on developing brand loyalty they also may encourage doctors to move to improved versions of the drug still covered by patents188 an indication of what might be considered th success of this approach is contained in the observation that innovator drugs keep about half their market in units despite the fact that generics are roughly onet hird the price of pioneers innovator drugs measured two years after entry189 the 1984 act created mechanisms to address concerns that regulatory requirements for fda approval of drug prior to marketing often meant that the owner of patent associated with drug did not enjoy the fu ll benefit conferred by that patent provisions were included to extend the patent as compensation for some of the regulatory activities190 as result many expert s have

in addition to and separate from the rights conveyed by patent the fda can provide market exclusivity for an approve d drug two years of exclusivity are extended to drugs in clinical testing when the 1984 act was passed the fda also will not consider applications for generic version of new chemical entity for five years after approval of the original this applies even if there is patent on the drug according to cbo however this may in actuality add more than five years because abbreviated drug applications of ten take more than 30 months on average for approval added together this ma provide over seven years of market exclusivity the food and drug administra tion also is permitted to grant three year exclusivity period if new drug application or supplemental application necessitates additional clinical investigation these situations include new dosage forms for already approved drugs ne w use for drug or for overthecounter marketing of drug this market exclusiv ity

improved drug entitie s based on their original invention when approved by the fda the changes made permit three years of exclusivity on the marketing of the pharmaceutical if new patent is not forthcoming and an additional 20 years if patent issues if the original drug is removed from the market however generic for that pharmaceutical cannot be introduced196 allowing this removal to occur cbo argues can prevent generics from coming to market assessing the effect of such provisi ons the congressional budget offices 1998 study indicated that the 1984 act provided brand name drugs w ith an additional 28 years of market exclusivity prior to the entr of generics including drugs that did not obtain an extension under the terms of the 1984 act however grabowski and vernon found that the extent of overall market exclusivity for new drugs has actually decreased in contrast to the situati on prior to implement ation of the 1984 act197 for example according to phrma while i nderal introduced in 1965 experienced 10 years of market exclusivity and tagamet introduced in 1977 had six years of market exclusivity diflucan introduced in 1990 r eceived only two years of exclusivity and invirase introduced in 1995 had just three months on the market before generic was introduced198 despite the ability of the fda to offer market exclusivity some experts argue that the 1984 act has also signific antly curtailed the expected revenues to innovative firms from the latter phases of their drugs life cycle199 according to cbo despite this period of exclusivity most of the average cost of drug development cannot be recoupe d cbo found that the increase in generics has led to an average 27 million or 12 decrease in the total return to new drug not including antibiotics not covered by th 1984 act the average market price declines even though the cost of the innova tor drug increases because generics make up larger share of the market200 this has occurred at the same time that rd

thomasin order to compete with other comp anies brand name firms may bring out generic versions of their own drugs before th original patent expires the intent is to be the first to market and to establish market advantage with pharmacies which usually buy the first lowcost alternative then rarely switch to other brands once customers get used to it this occurs despite some evidence that the

expiration and initially captured threequarters of the gene ric market found it lost almost twothirds of this market when other generics were introduced204 research by kamien and zang publis hed in 1999 states that brand name company introduction of generic substitutes appears to benefit both them and the consumers profits increase for these fi rms above and beyond that which could be made solely with the original drug this action also allows the firm to raise prices on the innovator pharmaceutical accordin g to kamien and zang consumers are better off because brand name generics provide lower cost alternative before the original patent expires even though th is benefit only lasts for month or two however once the patent expires the br and name company obtains firstmover advantage on the marketplace at this point the average price of the brand name and generic drug is lower because of compe tition thus these two authors argue the producers of generic drugs are worse off in this situation than both the brand name firms and the public205 possible issues and potential concerns206 given the increasing investment in res earch and development and the gains in research intensity of the pharmaceutical i ndustry it appears that the 1984 act has not deterred the search for and development of ne w drugs in assessing the effects of the 1984 act the congressional budget office found that overall it appears that the incentives for drug companies to innovate have remained intact since the passage of the legislation while brand name companies have experienced some loss

been likely to lose over 40 percent of its market to generic competitors just after reaching its peak year in sales if the pre1984 level of rd investment was desirable then the patent extensi ons benefitted society by preserving most of the returns from marketing new drug on the other hand some experts argue th at the large and growing private and public investment in pharmaceutical research and development makes it clear that the patentrelated provisions of the 84 act are longer necessary to achieve the policy of fostering innova tion while insu ring public access to older drugs at competitive prices207 according to this view such provisions permit and encourage manipulation elimination of patent extension and market exclusivity such critics maintain would allow the market to operate at maximum efficiency208 t h congressional budget office points out that accelerating fda review process by one year would be more help ful to innovator drugs than providing patent extension their research indicates that the pate nt extensions availa ble under th 1984 act were not sufficient to fully preserve the returns from mark eting new brandname drugs shortening the process in fda by one year however would provide net benefit of appr oximately 22 million for one drug209 congressional interest in the 1984 act continues210 in further exploring the topic the congress is likely to consider various issues surrounding implementation of the legislation highlighted below ar possible areas for discussion among the concerns is whether or not the environm ent in which the original law was enacted still exists and if adjustments should be made to reflect any changes has the implementation of the 1984 act led to any new unanticipated benefits or consequences of fundamental interest is whether or not the goals and incentives contained in the law rema in valid after 18 years in assessing the current environment within which the provisions of the 1984 act are applied an important question is whether or not the state of the fda approval process remains the same as when the original legislation was passed at the time congress originally debated the law the average fda drug approval time was ove r 30 months in 1999 this period had dropped by more than half the food and drug administration maintains that the mean approval time in 1999 was 126 months211 concurrently the

application has increased at issue is whether or not the patent term exte nsion provisions and market exclusivity provisions contained in the 1984 act accura tely reflect the delays associated with the fda approval pro cess as it operates today in the first session the 106th congress enacted the american inventors protection act pl 106113 this legi slation requires that certain deadlines be met by the patent and trademark office in the issuance of patent among these deadlines are 14 months fo r the first office action four months for subsequent action and four months between payment of an issuance fee and the grant of patent the original patent application must be completed within three years of actual filing except if the delays resulted from continuing applications and appeals on behalf of the filing party if these time constraints are not adhered to the patent holder may receive dayforday extension of the patent term how might this new law affect the implementation and impact of the 1984 act since the passage of the 1984 act c ongress has created additional market exclusivity provisions for certain drug s the orphan drug act provides company the exclusive right to market drug that has been properly designated to address diseases that affect less than 2000 people annually for seven years from the date of fda approval in addition the 1997 fda modernization act as amended by the best pharmaceuticals for children act extends market exclusivity for six m onths if companies undertake studies on the use of drug in children do these laws affect the balance between encouraging innovation and encourag ing the introduction of generics promoted by the 1984 act the environment within which pharmaceutical research and development are performed has changed the costs

draw the most attention gi ven the current rd environment within which pharmaceutical companies operate do the provisions of the 1984 act provide the necessary incen tives for further innovation the biotechnology industry was in its infancy during the period that the 1984 act was debated and passed therefore some ex perts argue the provisions of the law are not relevant to biotec hnology products that are an increasing component of the drug i ndustry the ownership of intellectual property is particularly importa nt to biotechnology companies the us biotechnology industry is one of the most researchi ntensive sectors in the world as it committed 99 billion to rd in 1998 however these firms are typically small and do not yet have pr ofits to finance additional rd according to the biotechnology industry organization mo st of these companies finance research and development from equity capital not profits only 35 of biotech firms have sales therefor most depend on venture capital and ipos to support ongoing rd215 industry sources mainta in that patents are necessity for raising this equity capital216 biotechnology products involve the growth of biological component rather than the development of chemically synthesized component217 and some observers believe that the abbreviated bioequi valent determination estab lished under the 1984 act is not appropriate218 biotech drugs may be similar in their chemical or biological makeup but test differently in clinical trials219 based on these factors some in the industry maintain there is need to create regulations similar to those in the original act for biologics in orde r to develop generic sector such that exists in pharmaceuticals220 the 1984 act provides rewards for certain activities as disc ussed above this leads to concerns over whether or not such system while encouraging certain positive efforts also leads to less beneficial company policies and practices how do patent term extens ions and market exclusivity provisions encourage andor facilitate activities by firms that might not foster innovation for example the law provides the opport unity to extend market

firms to list patents fo r products that are not considered marketable222 others maintain that companies increase the number of patents associated with particular drug to prevent the introduction of generics the structure of the patent portfolio for new drug may reflect the provisions of the 1984 act how are the traditional pro cess of research development and commercialization affected by considerations of fu ture claims under the law other concerns have been expressed regarding allegations that brand name firms are paying companies not to bring generics to market originally the fda required that generic company that filed an bbreviated new drug application anda had to be sued for patent infringement and win in court before the agency would offer the 180 days of market exclusivity fda guidelines developed in 1998 eliminated the necessity for successful defense by generic manufacturer against claims of patent infringement prior to receiving the 180 day market excl usivity the intent of this provision had been to provide an incentive for marketing generic to recover litigation costs and make full use of the exclusivity provided223 however now the only criteria for market exclusivity is receivi ng the first to file position this has led it is argued to the filing of substandard or sham andas as generic companies race to establish themselves as being the first to file224 as the regulations now stand the 180 days is triggered by the co mmercial marketing of the generic some experts maintain that this change allows for activities that conflict with the intent of the law it has been alleged that certain brand name manufacturers have pa id the generic firms granted exclusivity not to begin selling their products so as not to open the market to other generics the federal trade commission brought suit against hoechst marion roussel and andrx pharmaceuticals and federal judge declared that the firms violated antitrust laws when hoechst paid andrx to delay marketing of their generic version of the brand name dr ug another similar case involves abbott laboratories and geneva pharmaceuticals the ftc takes casebycase approach to the antitrust issue the companies involved in these situations argue that the agreements are result of patent disputes not means to block market access225 addressing the above concerns may provide the context within which to assess the means by which the 1984 act has attemp ted to achieve congressional intent are patent extensions and ma rket exclusivity provisions the most effective andor efficient m eans to
