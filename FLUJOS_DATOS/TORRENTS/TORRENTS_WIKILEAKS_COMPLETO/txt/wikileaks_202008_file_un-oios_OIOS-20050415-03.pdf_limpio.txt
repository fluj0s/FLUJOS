relief and repatriation commissioner mfdmrrrc accounting and internal controls 10 mfdmrrrc operated manual accounting sys tem and maintained general ledger which in 2002 did not correspond to the unhcr budge t lines internal controls especially in 2002 needed improvement in such areas as checking transaction accuracy as well as approval of transactions in 2004 unhcr banglades h made considerable effort to review in detail the accuracy and completeness of the 2003 expenditures an attempt to perform reconciliation of the expenditures in the camps wh ich constitute an integral part of the final spmr failed as the 2002 ledger in nayapara camp wa s not properly kept due to missing data the verification of supporting documents coul d not be performed oios recommended that mfdmrrrc provide an explanation on the cause of the missing information in the ledger unhcr bangladesh replied that the programme officer and programme assistant would pursue this further in the field and would sh are information on the actions taken procurement 11 mfdmrrrc did not comply with the unhcr im plementing partner procurement guidelines mfdmrrrc disclosed the amount budgeted for the purchase to the contractors and then chose the contractor on an arbitrary basis this involved the risk of inflated prices and of favouritism in fact mfdmrrrc was procurin g goods and services at prices which 3 were much higher than the market prices conserva tive estimates suggests that with competitive bidding prices could be reduced by at least one third resulting in yearly savings of about us 30000 unhcr bangladesh raised the issue of noncompliance to the sub agreement during the meeting with the secretary an d finance officer in january 2005 they agreed to change the present procurement practices

its database b concern accounting system and internal controls 12 concern operated manual accounting syste m with the detailed general ledger maintained on excel spreadsheet for 2002 and 2003 verification problems persisted since concern used its own and not the unhcr budget codes to record expenditures it is only in 2004 that it switched to the unhcr budget struct ure the present system appeared generally satisfactory to report on unhcr funds procurement procedures 13 concern did not follow important procureme nt procedures there was approved list of purchasing committee members for major pur chases there was formal bidding and the quotations were solicited by telephone for the procurement of the compressed rice husk amounting to more than us 100000 concern split t he purchase between four suppliers since concern is longer unhcr partner in 2005 recommendation is raised b other programme issues project financial monitoring 14 oios could not evidence whether the repres entation carried out at least one indepth review and verification exercise in 2003 to review the spmrs for 2002 the auditor was informed that in 2003 the programme assistant trave lled to the camps to verify the documents and outputs of the programme however report of these visits was available there was also evidence that financial monitoring was link ed to performance monitoring oios recommended that the unhcr representation in bangla desh take more structured approach to the indepth review and verification ex ercise of spmr unhcr bangladesh replied that changes had been introduced since the arrival of the new representative and that structured verifications had started in july 2004 4 project staff salaries and allowances 15 the subproject implemented by the governm ent was employing total of 184 persons to work in the offices and in the camps on top of it 33 government officials who were receiving the salary from the government were also receiving from the project living support allowance in addition to daily allowance the project was also paying retrenchment and termination benefits neither the representation nor the suboffice in coxs bazar had official documents explaining the xact nature and modalities of these payments the so also stated that some staff were r eceiving the housing rent allowance from unhcr while they were entitled to receive the same allowance from the government oios recommended that the unhcr representation in b angladesh should request the mfdmrrrc to provide official government documents explaining the exact nature and modalities of allowances these documents should be analysed so that any duplicate or questionable payments by the project are avoided the unhcr representation stated that the national legal officer who has access to legal docu ments was looking into these two aspects any double payment of the same allowance be it fr om the government or from unhcr would be removed recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in bangladesh should revie w the various salaries and allowances paid to governm ent staff working for the project and determine their n ature and modalities to avoid those similar allowances ar paid to the same staff from different sources rec 02 pending the outcome of the review oios keeps this recommendation open in its database 16 total of 217 gob staff were receiving sa laries and allowances from the project this number appeared to be excessive and some posit ions appeared to be redundant or otherwise unnecessary for instance the project is funding eight posts of accountantsaccounting assistants in mfdmrrrc th documents provided to oios indicated that several staff cuts had already been made from 1998 to 2000 the issue was raised again only in october 2004 oios recommended that the unhcr representation in bangladesh review the staffing needs and identify u nnecessary and duplicative positions of gob staff working for the project it should also compare the staffing situation in gob with the one existing in other countries where projects employ an important number of government staff the representation replied that the reduction of st aff was being pursued actively review of the staff needs had been made based on t his ro had requested mfdm to reduce 46 staff the monthly allowance of 16 staff and dai ly allowances of 15 staff country indicators

administrative expe nditures versus total expenditures grew from 49 per cent in 2002 to 60 per cent in 200 3 and 67 per cent in 2004 oios recommended that the unhcr representation in bangla desh monitor the significant country indicators with view to keep the administrative xpenditures of the implementing partner under control the representation replied that the increase in the administrative expenditure in 2003 was due to the handing over of health secto r activities from concern and msf to 5 the gob the representation had informed the gover nment verbally and in writing that about 20 per cent of the administrative budget woul d be cut in 2005 use of vehicles provided by the project 18 the review of fuel expenditures in mfdm dh aka showed that fuel which had to be provided for the project cars was used for other g overnment vehicles oios had already made the same observation during the last audit in 1996 also the ministry was incurring expenditures for equipment which was above unhcr s tandards oios recommended that the unhcr representation monitor more closely these expenditures the representation should ensure that expenditures for refuelling vehi cles which do not belong to the project are not charged to the project the representation stated that it was tightening co ntrol on the use of vehicles and that it had sent verification rep ort to mfdm on this issue c supply management tax exemption of implementing partners 19 although unhcrs implementing partner conc ern was procuring goods for the project rp370 b for more than us 200000 per ye ar it had not established system to obtain refund of vat from the gob taking into acco unt the present rate of vat the average vat payments per year are estimated at us 20000 oios recommended that the unhcr representation in bangladesh address the mini stry of finance of the gob in order to officially establish the rights of the registere d ngos concerning tax exemption in case the tax exemption is not granted the representation sh ould consider the possibility to take over the purchasing function from an ngo in its reply unhcr stated that in order to avoid th losses on vat all items with vat would be procured by unhcr claiming tax exemption rights ngos do not have exemption rights oios maintains that the possibility of obtaining tax exemption for ngo implementing partners should be further explored before opting for selfimplementation recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in bangladesh should asses s together with host country authorities the grantin g of tax exemption for unhcr project purchases made by ngos implementing partners if such status can b granted major procurement should be undertaken dir ectly by unhcr in order to save tax payments of some us 20000 per year rec 03

december 2004 report showed the equipment includin g light duty vehicles with such custodians as msf holland msf france and oxfam though unhcr bangladesh stopped 6 the working arrangements with these implementing pa rtners in 2003 or even earlier further efforts were therefore required to adjust the incor rect entries and ensure that assettrak data is updated at regular intervals unhcr bangladesh
