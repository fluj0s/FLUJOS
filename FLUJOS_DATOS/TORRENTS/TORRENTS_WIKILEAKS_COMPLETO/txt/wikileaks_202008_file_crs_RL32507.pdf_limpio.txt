lifetime learning credit were introduced as new subsidies for higher education in 1997 and have cost on average 46 billion year in lost tax revenue since their enactment the introduction of the credits marked dramatic increase in education spending through tax expenditures prior to 1997 tax incentives for higher education expenses totaled less than 2 billion in estimated lost revenue the introduction of education tax credits expanded the number of federal agencies involved in education policy making and increased the complexity and cost of administering the income tax system this report provides analysis of the education tax credit program the report begins with review of the economic rationale for subsidizing education then describes federal subsidies for education in general and education tax credits in particular an analysis of the education credits follows and the report concludes with discussion of education tax credit policy options economists believe that education causes positive externalities since it generates both private benefits for individuals and social benefits for the public at large such social benefits may include better citizenship higher degrees of compliance with public laws increased productivity and intergenerational transfers of knowledge the individual does not capture these social benefits in decision making about his or her level of educational investment and thus underinvests in education government subsidies to finance education can stimulate private demand for education in order to attain more optimal levels of education production that achieve market equilibrium outcomes government subsidies for higher education include indirect spending through the tax code and direct program spending most programs grant aid to education institutions and provide assistance directly to students and their families as in the case of the education tax credits the higher education act hea which most recently was extended through march 2008 authorizes many student aid programs which provide gran ts loans and workstudy assistance tax credits for higher education one form of government education subsidy can be evaluated by looking at tax policy criteria of economic efficiency equity and simplicity tax credits are not proven to be efficient at increasing enrollment nd thus improving social welfare tax credits can however be beneficial in making college costs more affordable higher income households are more able and more likely to benefit from education credits which some view as detracting from equity in the tax code yet the credits provide needed relief for the middle class many of whom may not qualify for any other source of financial aid education credits add complexity and cost to the administration of income taxes both for individuals and the federal government but may offer lesscomplicated alternative to traditional financial aid this report will be updated as warranted by legislative events

through tax expenditures prior to 1997 tax incentives for education expenses totaled less than 2 billion annually in estimated lost revenue1 the education tax credit program expanded the number of federal agencies involved in education policy making and increased the complexity and cost of administering the income tax system there are many direct federal spending programs for higher education some programs grant aid to state and local governments and to education institutions while others provide assistance directly to students and their families as in the case of the education tax credits the higher education act hea most recently extended by pl 110109 which is scheduled to expire in the 110 th congress authorizes these student aid programs which provide grants loans and work study assistance congress is considering wide variety of issues as it faces the process of reauthorizing the programs of the higher education act the general higher education issues include the appropriate federal role in addressing both postsecondary access and affordability congress is also considering issues specific to individual he programs like shortfalls in pell grant funding which provides needbased aid for undergraduate students this report provides analysis of the education tax credit program in the context of the higher education issues facing congress this report begi ns with review of the economic rationale for subsidizing education then describes federal subsidies for education in general and the education tax credits in particular an analysis of the education credits follows

invest in sufficient levels of education this insufficient educational investment is due to market failures which exist when the price system is unable to generate an efficient allocation of resources the economic reasons most often cited for government involvement in education include the neighborhood or externality effect and the presence of capital market failure

of another and that effect is not incorporated in market prices economic theory suggests that education causes positive externalities since it generates both private benefits for individuals and social benefits for the public at large these social benefits may take on the form 1 us congress joint committee on taxation estimates of federal tax expenditures for fiscal years 19962000 104th cong

increased productivity and intergenerational transfers of knowledge the individual does not capture these social benefits in decision making about his or her level of ducational investment and thus under invests in education the private demand for education is less than social demand and too little investment in education occurs government subsidies to finance education can stimulate private demand for education in order to attain more optimal levels of education production that achieve market equilibrium outcomes 2 the positive externality produced as result of education investment is depicted in figure 1 an individual chooses an education investment level of q where marginal cost mc is equal to marginal private benefit mpb yet the educational investment made by an individual creates positive marginal external benefits meb these external benefits are not taken into account by the individual as the choice of educational attain ment q is made the marginal external benefit can be added to the marginal private benefit to arrive at the marginal social benefit msb of educational investment economic efficiency requires the equality of marginal cost and marginal social benefit which occurs at q since the optimal educational level is greater than the individuals choice introducing subsidy to increase education can help correct for the difference figur 1 illustration of p ositiv externality the magnitude of these external benefits is diffic ult to determine particularly with regard to higher education for example while literacy is desirable for civic participation and the ability to conform to laws this literacy is gained in elementary and secondary education yet the benefits of additional higher education are more complex if increases in productivity due to higher education are captured by the individual in the form of higher earnings there are spillover effects it is also sometimes the case that increases in education do not yield the increases in job 2

skill levels3 nevertheless many economists believe that greater amounts of human capital are an important driver of growth and it is true that discoveries and advances in knowledge by highly skilled individuals spill over to the economy as whole g11g150g153g142g155g143g142g140g157g561g5g138g153g146g157g138g149g561g15g138g155g148g142g157g156g561 the imperfection of capital markets arises as result of students being unable to obtain commercial loans to finance their higher education unlike the way loans for homes or automobiles are obtained commercial lenders cannot mortgage persons future income and in the event of default of the loan sell the students services to the highest bidder as result commercial lenders would be reluctant to float student loans without government guarantees 4 providing private loans guaranteed by the government is one solution to this failure as is providing student loans directly from the government

subsidize education to ensure that educational opportunities are widely available particularly to students from lower income households in this context educational investment can be significant factor in reducing poverty and income inequality zimmerman examined this issue and concluded that higher income students have higher marginal rates of return and lower marginal costs of financing 5 these factors led to higher net return and lifetime earnings for higher income students as compared to lower income students thus providing lower income students with larger subsidies would tend to equalize earnings differentials if the goal for education subsidies is to reduce income inequality the cost of subsidies should be measured in terms of the private benefits received by targeted groups rather than the social benefits that might be generated by positive externalities

to help families pay for higher education first there are direct appropriations from state and local governments to public postsecondary institutions majority of this funding is used to minimize

families this represents the largest share of student financial aid current education subsidies provided by the federal government include student loans grants and workstudy programs both of the major federal grant programs pell grants and federal supplemental educational opportunity grants fseog are needbased there are also many specialized federal grants and scholarship programs provided for students at the graduate level the federal work study program and the student educational employment programs allow students to earn money while in school according to fy2002 data 108 billion was spent by the federal government on education while the largest portion of spending occurred through the us department of education 463 billion or 43 large amounts of education spending also came from the department of health and human services 229 billion the depa rtment of agriculture 119 billion the department of labor 64 billion the department of defense 47 billion and the department of energy 36 billion 6 twentytwo billion eight hundred million dollars of the fy2002 spending on education was allocated to postsecondary education 21 while another 257 billion was allocated to research at universities and related institutions 24 fiftythree billion was allocated for elementary and secondary education 49 and 62 billion for other programs 67 in addition to direct spending programs administ ered by the us department of education and other executive branch agencies government subsidies for higher education are also made through the income tax system from 1954 to 1978 four tax benefits for education existed an exclusion for scholarship and fellowship income parental exemption for students age 19 to 23 who were enrolled in college business expense deduction for workrelated education and the deduction of student loan interest8 in 1978 an exclusion for employerprovided education assistance was enacted and 10 years later an exclusion for the interest earned on educational savings bonds was enacted in 1996 after the enactment of an exclusion for earnings from qualified tuition programs the number of tax benefits for higher education expenses rose to seven the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 introduced four new tax benefits that more than doubled the number of subsidies available through the tax system for higher education expenses they were two tax credits deduction for interest on student loans and an exclusion for earnings from coverdell savings accounts the provisions were estimated to cost 41 billion9 over five years beginning in 1998 and represented the largest increase in federal funding for higher education since the gi bill additionally in the fall of 2001 an abovetheline deduction for higher education expenses was authorized by

credits are available to taxpayers to offset the cost of higher education the hope credit and the lifetime learning credit unlike tax deductions which reduce the amount of income subject to tax credits reduce the tax liability itself the extent of the credits allowed depends on many factors including the amount of taxpayer income and the amount of tax liability g10g152g153g142g561g5g155g142g141g146g157g561 the hope credit is nonrefundable credit that may be claimed for the qualified tuition expenses of each eligible student in the taxpayers family the student must be enrolled at least halftime in one of the first two years of postsecondary education and must be enrolled in program leading to degree certificate or other recognized educational credential the amount of credit that may be claimed is generally equal to 100 of the first 1000 of the taxpayers outofpocket expenses for each students qualified tuition and related expenses plus 65 of the next 1000 of the taxpayers outofpocket expenses for each students qualified tuition and related expenses in order for the maximum amount of the hope credit to be received assuming there is

for each eligible student and taxpayers can claim more than one hope credit on tax return provided that more than one individual the taxpayer the spouse or dependent meets the qualifications in contrast the lifetime learning credit may be claimed only once on tax return for maximum of 2000 the lifetime learning credit can include all of the qualifying educational expenses pooled together from the taxpayer the spouse andor their dependents neither tax credit is refundable meaning that taxpayers would not receive tax refund if the amount of their allowable education credit exceeded their income tax liability the hope credit is indexed for inflation while the lifetime learning credit is not unlike the hope credit the lifetime learning credit can be used for graduate or undergraduate school does not require the student to be in the first two years of undergraduate schooling and only requires the student to be enrolled in one course at an eligible educational institution the hope credit requires that the student not have felony drug conviction which is not requirement of the lifetime learning credit both credits disallow double tax benefit for higher education expense some taxpayers can deduct the expenses of higher education from their income tax by claiming an abovetheline tuition and fees deduction or by claiming the expenses as business related in doing so the taxpayer cannot also claim an education credit for those same expenses taxpayers cannot claim an education credit on expenses paid with taxfree scholarship grant or employerprovided educational assistance pell grants veterans educational assistance and taxexempt scholarships are included in this category of taxfree educational assistance taxpayers must reduce qualified education expenses by the amount of any taxfree financial assistance before using the expenses to claim an education tax credit 11

the value of the credits are shown in table 1 after the 1997 enactment the credits became available in tax year 1998 significant increase in participation occurred between 1998 and 1999 presumably as taxpayers learned about the existence of the education credits and learned how to claim them after 1999 the rate of increase in participation decreased sharply as is shown in figure 1 data show rate of increase in participation up to 2002 with slight downturn that year and then plateau in participation through recent years the same is true for the amount of credits claimed the changes in 2002 may be due to the enactment of the economic growth and tax relief and reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 which reduced tax liabilities for all taxpayers in 2001 the tax relief provided by egtrra which was designed to stimulate the economy seems to have had the unintended consequence of reducing the number of taxpayers eligible to claim education tax credits as households experienced reductions in their income tax liability or longer owed any tax 11 additional information about the education credits is provided in crs report rl31129 higher education tax credits and deduction an

education expenses provide subsidies to encourage more investment in education than would otherwise be undertaken as discussed at the beginning of this report tax subsidies for education can enhance economic efficiency if they are successful in increasing investment in education however tax credits may not be effective if they subsidize activities that would have been undertaken in the absence of the tax incentive ie subsidize enrollment that would have occurred anyway or fail to increase enrollment at all to date only one empirical study has specifically examined the education tax credits and their impact on enrollment long found that what was intended to be transfer to the middle class did benefit families with incomes between 30000 and 75000 the most for the 2000 tax year nearly half of the credits claimed in 2000 were by returns with adjusted gross income between 30000 and 75000 although this group makes up only 35 of the eligible returns in similar manner although they make up only 13 of returns families with adjusted gross incomes between 50000 and 75000 claimed 22 of all education tax credits during tax year 2000 and realized the largest credit on average 15 an examination of the 2004 education tax credit data organized by adjusted gross income is consistent with longs findings that the middle class benefitted the most from education credits in total households with adjusted gross income agi of 30001 or more claimed 64 of the credits and 73 of the credit amount even though these households comprise only 49 of all taxpayers as shown in table 2 households with agi of 50001 to 100000 had the highest portion of returns claiming education credits 359 and the highest portion of the total amount of education credits claimed nearly 433 the agi category of 30000 to

the policy enactment general enrollment did not appear to increase nor did the proportion of students that attended fouryear institutions or were fulltime the lack of finding substantial response in student enrollment conforms to many forecasts by researchers and critics the principal benefactors sic of the tax credits are not likely to be marginal students and the disconnect between the aid and college attendance is likely to limit the effect of credits on enrollment 16 more generally studies of tuition price changes and enrollment response can provide some insight into expected changes in enrollment due to the price reduction that education tax credits provide if students are sensitive to tuition price changes the net reduction in price caused by tax credits would positively affect enrollment if students are relatively insensitive to price changes the net price reduction caused by tax credits would have little impact on enrollment typically students from higher income families have the resources to finance college enrollment without federal subsidies and are relatively insensitive to price changes the demandside response of students and families can be further stratified by distinguishing between the participation and margin effects of tuition price changes as depicted in table 3 overall investment in education would increase if students potential students were induced by the tax credits to increase begin enrollment in higher education the participation effect captures students or their families who would not invest in higher education without the tax credits the margin effect captures students who invest in higher education without the tax credits and who may increase their investment in response to the tax credits that increase in investment can occur in many ways including increases in the hours of participation eg moving from parttime to fulltime status increases in the longevity of participation pursuing bachelors degree rather than associates or increases in the quality of investment transferring to more expensive school ie from public to private institution or from twoyear to fouryear school 16 long pp 3031

tuition price and college enrollment the studies are diverse in both their methods and their results some studies estimated price elasticities of demand which reflected changes in education demand as proxied by changes in enrollment due to changes in tuition price other studies created studentpriceresponsecoefficients that were defined as the change in college participation rates in response to tuition price changes in 1987 leslie and brinkman provided comprehensive review of studies of the relationship between price and college enrollment 17 these studies which were published between 1967 and 1982 examined different types of institutions public and private twoyear and fouryear and found that for every 100 increase in tuition pricegiven 19821983 average weighted higher education prices of 3420 for tuition and room and boardit was expected that the national participation rate 33 would fall about threequarters of percentage point 18 this translated into price elasticity of demand of 078 which suggests that students were slightly unresponsive to tuition price changes19 the authors noted however that demand is known to be affected not only by price but by the money income of the buyer by tastes and preferences and by the value of the good from consumption or an investment perspective20 in 1997 another review of the literature on tuition and enrollment in higher education was published by heller who compared the results of 20 quantitative studies to the leslie and brinkman study21 heller confirmed that as the price of attending college increased the probability of enrollment decreased the consensus among the studies reviewed was consistent with leslie and brinkman though the response found was smaller in that every 100 increase in college costs caused enrollment decline of 05 to 10 across all types of institutions additionally decreases in financial aid led to declines in enrollment with the effect differing depending upon the type of aid awarded 22 the studies reviewed were consistent in their conclusions that lowerincome students were more sensitive to changes in tuition and aid than students from middle and upperincome families these results suggest that the benefits of the 17 larry l leslie and paul t brinkman student price response in higher education the student demand studies journal of higher education vol 58 2 marchapril

of 1250 an eligible student whose tuition and fee payments are equal to 5000 would experience net price of 3500 assumes the maximum hope credit amount can be taken an educational investment elasticity can be created by assuming both students increase investment by 1000 for the first student change in educational investment from 1500 to 2500 given the net price reduction of 1250 would yield an

price crs examined the possible consequences of enacting the education credits this empirical work distinguished the margin effect from the participation effect as it examined the possible responses to the education tax credits it found that the percentage of existing students who experience relative price effect from the credits would be 565 24 it also concluded that students who spend large amounts on education simply reap windfall gain of about 42 since the credits would cause price change for additional spending25 thus they would receive the tax benefit but would not alter their level of educational investment federal taxpayers would receive offsetting social benefits in the form of increased investment g3g143g143g152g155g141g138g139g146g149g146g157g162g561 while credits may not in

expenses incurred when student attends college or university or certain vocational schools26 2001 study examining the hope credit addressed the federal policy shift from providing access to college to making college affordable for the middle class27 the author found that tax credits had only small positive impact on the affordability of higher education for middle income families because middleincome students were not so sensitive to changes in the cost of education as lowincome students students from middle income families had not significantly changed their patterns of enrollment in higher education in response to price increases relative to income instead the greatest and most rapidly increasing burden of paying for college was on lowincome not middleincome families when the cost of education was compared to household income28 wolanin stated that in 1972 the burden of both the average price of fouryear public and private colleges and universities was about three times greater for lowincome than for middle income family by 2000 the burden on the lowincome family was about four times greater than the burden on the middleincome family 29 in 1998 study of the education tax credits and state higher education policy conklin showed that the burden of college expenses relative to taxpayer income could decrease moderately in response to the hope credit 30 those

amount of tuition and fees remaining after receiving the pell grant amount is 550 which can be used to claim the hope credit yet at the private institution with significantly higher tuition costs the amount of tuition and fees remaining after receiving the pell grant is 10550 and the maximum amount of hope credits of 1500 could be claimed if it is presumed that students at higher priced

the tax credits another challenge arises if their cash flow is constrained the benefits of tax incentives for education are realized at the time of income tax return filing which for most taxpayers typically occurs in the spring by the april 15th deadline this is in contrast to most academic tuition and fees payments that are made at the beginning of each academic year typically occurring in the prior months of august or september this lagged difference often up to 10 or more months in receiving the benefit of the tax credit cannot provide assistance to anyone trying to raise enough funds to pay initial college bills lower income students may not be able to expend the funds and wait for reimbursement however the issue of when the tax credit benefit is received may not be significant if taxpayers alter their behavior in anticipation of the benefit taxpayers could for instance reduce their income tax withholding such that their take home income is greater than it would be otherwise

time of the introduction of the education credits many economists theorized that colleges and universities would increase their tuition prices mcpherson and schapiro stated that for states with community college systems in which average tuition was below 1500 they would have incentives to raise tuition in response to the stud ent populations that qualify for the full credit31 kane concluded that with marginal tuition subsidy between 50 and 100 for institutions charging less than 2000 state governments might be tempted to capture share of the federal subsidies by tailoring their own tuition and financial aid policies 32 only one study has specifically examined the inst itutional response to the new education credits long 2003 found support for the hypothesis that colleges act strategically to capture benefits created by the federal tax credits the strongest incentives to increase price are for colleges that charge tuition at or below 1000 for example if school charges 750 in tuition its first and secondyear students could claim the full amount of tuition in tax credits and thus incur tuition cost the same scenario would also be true if the school raised tuition to 1000 and students would experience difference in particular long found that colleges that cost between 1000 and 2000 and that had many crediteligible students did experience 18 faster growth in tuition prices relative to schools with fewer potential recipients or more expensive price the same results were not found to be true for public fouryear colleges 33 another institutional response could be to alter the composition of costs students incur universities that charge 1000 for tuition and 3000 in room and board charges may be encouraged to increase tuition costs to 2000 and reduce room and board costs to 2000 the student would experience the same cost but could receive credit for larger portion of that cost since tuition and fees but not room and board are eligible expenses for the tax credits such increases in tuition price would constitute an adverse effect of the tax credits on lowincome students not only are they unable to participate in the tax benefit programs they may experience tuition price increases as result of institutional response to the tax credits to the extent this occurred lowincome students would be made worse off by the government subsidy for higher education 34 g8g146g151g138g151g140g146g138g149g561g3g146g141g561g20g142g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g156g561 the effects of tuition tax credits on financial aid choices available to students vary and

on the basis of financial need which means that lowincome students and families who have the least tax liability and therefore the least eligibility for tax credits also receive the largest amount of needbased grants which further reduces or eliminates their eligibility for tax credits35 lowincome students also tend to be more highly concentrated in lower priced public twoyear and fouryear colleges in 2003 73 of fulltime students were enrolled in public colleges and universities about 29 of fulltime undergraduate students were enrolled at institutions charging less than 4000 in tuition and fees 36 in 1998 students attending public twoyear colleges the lowest priced postsecondary institutions accounted for 32 of all firstyear students but 47 of the firstyear students from families with incomes of less than 2000037 these low income students pay lower amounts of tuition and related fees which are more likely to be offset by taxfree educational assistance such as pell grant thus rendering them more likely to be ineligible for tax credits g7g154g158g146g157g162g561g3g150g152g151g144g561g22g138g161g153g138g162g142g155g156g561 component of fairness in taxation is vertical equity concept which requires that tax burdens be distributed fairly among people with different abilities to pay tax credits benefit those who have sufficient income to pay tax those individuals without sufficient income to pay tax do not have the opportunity to benefit from education tax credits the disproportionate benefit of tax expenditures to individuals with higher incomes reduces the progressivity of the tax system which is often viewed as reduction in equity the tax credits are regressive in that the more income taxpayers have the more benefits they receive up to the maximum phase out limits of the tax provision as result of their nonrefundable nature and the fact that the tax credits are not based on need the tax credits move the distributional balance of federal aid away from lowincome students towards middleincome students according to wolanin in 1998 40 to 45 of first and second year lowincome students were dependents and about half of these students 1 million received benefit from the hope credit another one million students had incomes too low to be eligible to claim the full hope credit amount independent students those solely respon sible for their own higher education expenses make up most of the remaining percentage of low income first and secondyear students almost 1 million of these independent students nearly twothirds of whom have children

individuals with similar incomes paying differing amounts of tax conklin found that differences across states including average state tuition prices and the amount of state sponsored aid would result in an uneven distribution of tax credit use among taxpayers 40 this differential treatment is deviation from what has been described as standard of horizontal equity which states that people in equal positions should be treated equally the total amount of tax credits received by residents of particular state depends on the income levels of college students and families in that state and the number of college students or their families who file federal income taxes additionally the distribution of students among lower and higher priced institutions and the amount of state sponsored financial aid also affect the equitable distribution of tax credits across states states with high proportion of middle and highincome taxpayers may have more students claiming the maximum tax credit relative to states with high proportions of lowerincome taxpayers who may not be able to claim the credits states with relatively high priced public and private institutions of higher education are more likely to have more taxpayers claiming the education credits and receiving above average amounts states with large statebased student financial aid programs may find that fewer taxpayers are eligible to claim the credits this would be due to the statebased financial aid reducing the amount of qualified education expenses taxpayer could claim conklin cited examples of the interstate differences montana which had 38 of its college population made up of lower and lowermiddle income students in 1998 was projected to have 23 of its student population unable to participate in the education tax credit programs in contrast illinois was projected to have only 4 of its student population ineligible to claim the education tax credits this was due in part to illinois having one of the highest rates of

income tax filing and the financial aid application processes can be labor intensive complicated and require hours of attention by households for both the student financial aid process and the income tax filing process participants must first learn how and where to obtain the correct publications and forms they then must learn how to complete and file the appropriate materials with the relevant agencies the alternative available to households is to pay someone to assist in the process middle and upperincome taxpayers have both higher degree of interest and potential gain from acquiring the necessary knowledge and experience or even paying professional to do so for them the recordkeeping requirements for taxpayers increa significantly for those taxpayers claiming the education credits taxpayers must first determine what their education expenses were for the tax year then subtract ineligible expenditures and then reduce that amount by any taxfree assistance used to pay for those expenses to be eligible to claim the hope credit in addition to other requirements taxpayers must determine that they have not claimed expenses for the same student for more than two years and that the stude nt is still in his or her first two years of schooling the administrative complexity of this process is compounded if the student has not attended college on consistent basis and this or her status as first or second year student has to be verified for instance student may attend college take two classes year for three years and still be considered by the institution to be in the first year of college after ascertaining expenses and confirming eligibility for the tax credits taxpayers then have to complete the income tax forms with the addition of separate form form 8863 as part of the process to claim the credits this process must be followed for each student eligible for hope credit and for all of the education expenses used to determine the lifetime learning credit

federal policymaking in higher education expanded to include additional executive branch agencies and legislative committees the administration of the income tax system became more complex since the education tax credits were enacted the number of federal agencies involved in education policy increased prior to 1998 federal policy making for student aid was concentrated in four congressional committees and one executive branch agency the tax credits caused an increase in congressional committee involvement and executive branch agency involvement in congress nontax education policymaking occurs in the house education and workforce committee the senate health education labor and pensions committee the house appropriations committee and the senate appropriations committee while in the executive branch of government the department of education carries out education policy the introduction of education tax credits increased the roles of the senate finance committee the house ways and means committee and the treasury department the largest education grant program to serve middleincome students became the tax credit program while the largest program to serve lowincome students is the pell grant program these programs are not linked in the same legislation nor are they acted upon and implemented by the same institutions this complicates rather than simplifies financial aid systems and arguably hinders the integration of student aid policies

significant tax cuts have been enacted since the introduction of the education credits in 1997 all of which have affected the pool of potential beneficiaries of the education tax credits as mentioned previously the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 reduced marginal income tax rates for individuals causing lower tax burdens in providing tax relief that was designed to stimulate the economy an unintended consequence was to reduce the number of taxpayers eligible to claim education credits as result of the egtrra changes households more likely lower income households experienced reductions in their tax liability these reductions may have caused them to be unable to claim the education tax credits this may be at least in part an explanation for the reduction in credits claimed both the number and amount after tax year 2001 that is shown in table 1 additionally in response to continued sluggish economic performance another tax stimulus plan the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 jgtrra pl 108 27 was passed in may 2003 jgtrra accelerated many of the tax provisions of egtrra causing increased tax relief which was likely

requirements for higher education institutions colleges and universities must supply the irs with the names addresses and social security numbers of all students enrolled at the institution they must also indicate whether the student is enrolled fulltime or not at the time of the enactment of the credits higher education institutions were required to report even more detailed information to the irs for example the identity of the taxpayer claiming each student as tax dependent the national association of college and university business officers estimated that compliance with this full set of

liability directly and have become an increasingly popular method of providing tax relief and social benefits in general if education tax credits were made refundable taxpayers could receive payment from the government if the credit exceeded tax liability in the 109th congress s 3528 proposed making portion of the lifetime learning credit refundable and would have directed the secretary of the treasury to establish program for making advance payments of such credits to eligible institutions on behalf of certified individuals this kind of proposal would have provided cash assistance at the time of enrollment presumably september rather than after filing the tax return presumably april or later currently the only refundable tax credits are the earned income credit and the child tax credit only for families with three or more children in some circumstances if congress chose to make education tax credits refundable more lower income households would be able to claim the credits and participation rates in higher educ ation could increase refundable education tax credits would also insulate potential beneficiaries of the credits from the effects of other tax changes this in turn would increase the budgetary cost of the subsidy refundable education tax credits would be very likely to satisfy the economic criteria discussed previously in this report if refundable tax credits increased enrollment in higher education they likely would increase efficiency and improve social welfare the increased administration required to manage the refundable credits would add to the costs and complexity of the program but those costs would be offset by the increase in social welfare

allow for more equitable distribution among taxpayers who participate in the program however expanding eligible expenses to include living expenses would be complex to administer for students who do not purchase schoolprovided room and board some students might reside at home and incur implicit costs of room and board which would not be eligible to be claimed for the education tax credits other students may incur an explicit room and board cost in which case taxpayers would be responsible for providing receipts to document the expenses this could increase the possibility of fraudulent claims because it would be difficult for the irs to verify the expenses the increase in administrative costs associated with this proposal would likely be marginal though the information that higher education institutions would have to report would be increased g6g152g158g139g149g142g561g4g142g151g142g143g146g157g561g160g146g157g145g561g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g9g155g138g151g157g156g561 as mentioned previously in this report current law requires that expenses paid using pell grant funds cannot be used in claiming the education credits in past congresses legislation has been introduced that would exempt federal grants from reducing expenses that could be claimed for the education credits in the 108 th congress hr 442 and hr 3251 proposed to exempt pell grants and supplemental educational opportunity grants from reducing expenses claimed for the hope credit similar proposals were included in hr 625 hr 1380 and s 1697 in the 109th congress this kind of change to the current program could create double subsidy as an example student incurring 3000 in total tuition and fees could receive pell grant in the amount of 3000 to pay these expenses the student could then claim the hope credit assuming the student met all other eligibility criteria in the amount of 1500 100 of the first 1000 plus 50 of the second 1000 the student would have received both direct subsidy the grant and an indirect subsidy the credit for the same expenses this double subsidy benefit would not be true for students who incurred larger amounts of tuition and fees expense students with the least income the largest pell grants and the lowest price of attendance benefit the least from tax credits as they currently exist this proposal would allow lower income students to benefit from double subsidy only if they had sufficient tax liability against which to apply the education credits for those students who were able to participate their enrollment level at the margin may increase if students increased their education spending in response to the proposed benefit the proposal might allow students at twoyear colleges to enroll in programs at fouryear institutions or it might increase the number of credit hours per semester the student is able to take students with higher incomes who do not receive pell grants would not benefit from this opportunity though they may already have sufficient income tax liability and higher education expenses to benefit from the tax credits the program would not add significantly to the complexity of administering the program the proposal would require that universities change the information that is reported on the form 1098t that is sent to households taxpayers would incur time cost to learn about the program change but the administrative costs to file tax re turns would not likely be increased some would view this approach as potential windfall to students particularly if it did not lead to the increased educational outcome for which it was intended httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32507g10g146g144g145g142g155g561g7g141g158g140g138g157g146g152g151 g561g22g138

in the 108th congress several pieces of legislation proposed the enhancement of one or both of the tax credits in variety of ways hr 3251 and s 2087 proposed to increase the hope credit and to repeal the lifetime learning credit the proposed increase of 1000 would have increased the maximum allowable hope credit amount to 2500 s 174 proposed to increase the amount of the lifetime learning credit from 20 of 10000 in tuition and fees to 25 of 12000 in tuition and fees thus increasing the maximum possible credit amount from 2000 to 3000 this bill would have also increased the annual income limits for both credits to 55000 for single taxpayers up from 51000 and 110000 for married taxpayers filing jointly up from 103000 s 2360 proposed to increase the lifetime learning credit from 20 to 50 but would reduce the eligible expenses from 10000 to 4000 s 1793 proposed to make the hope credit available for all four years of college as opposed to the current provisions applying only to the first two years in each of these cases the eligible population of participants would have increased the modified tax credits would have contributed to making higher education affordable either for more individuals or at greater amounts the expansion proposals would not have changed the complexity of administering the current program though there would be costs incurred to publicize and learn about the changes in the program the expansion proposals were unlikely to improve the accessibility criteria of new students enrolling in college

by taxpayers after the income tax filing season in the spring of each year while educational expenditures are made several months earlier presumably in the early or late fall of the prior year proposals were made to allow taxpayers to apply for and receive shortterm loan using the anticipated tax credit benefit as collateral which would allow the proceeds to be used at the time tuition payments are required in the 108 th congress hr 2150 proposed to allow taxpayers to obtain shortterm student loans by using the future refund of the hope credit andor the lifetime learning credit as collateral for the loans similarly in the 109th congress s 3528 proposed such process this type of proposal would have added complexity and cost to administering the education tax credit program and essentially created new financial aid program to administer for higher education institutions andor financial institutions who would presumably be making the loans the proposal would have increased enrollment if the timing of the receipt of the tax benefit were significant factor as mentioned previously taxpayers may have already adjusted their behavior in response to the benefit such that this timing factor is not variable in the enrollment choice this kind of proposal also would have created potential difficulty if the taxpayer were unable to claim the tax credits at the end of the year and thus might not have had the proceeds to pay back the loan if congress intends that education tax credits provide relief for middle income households and the higher education costs they incur the tax credits may be ideal in this case enhancing or altering the credits may improve the relief they provide if on the other hand congress intends to increase access to higher education education tax
