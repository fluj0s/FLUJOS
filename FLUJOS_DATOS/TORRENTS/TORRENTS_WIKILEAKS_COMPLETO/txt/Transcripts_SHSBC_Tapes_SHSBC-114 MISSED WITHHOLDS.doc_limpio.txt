missed withholds lecture given on 7 february 1962 thank you thank you okay its the 7th of february ad 12 and here we have lecture youve just seen demonstration did you learn anything from the demonstration audience yes any question youd like to ask about the demonstration male voice yes should you always look for tone arm and needle action on the emeter needle action havingness is all with needle action of course needle action is compounded by the absence of tone arm action and you start running havingness on somebody without quiver on the needledoesnt work thats all it compounds the felony now you would have to look for tone arm action on somebody who had one of these flying needles that was hyperagitated needle youll see these needles once in awhile on manic depressives asylum cases people who are very agitated and so forth you dont ordinarily audit this type of person and you seldom audit one but that is you cut the sensitivity all the way down to nothing and the needles still flying all over the place then on havingness youd have to rely on tone arm motion that would be about the only exception there would be to the rule now i made couple of small errors one error is not advancing the sensitivity knob before i asked the first rudiment question both for beginning and end rudiments i did the same thing all brought about through the mechanics of the demonstration that is to say im trying to keep myself out of the road of the emeter while i audit and you notice that shadow that came across the corner of the emeter couple of times well thats my shoulder and the emeter has to be moved over just hair before i can be totally comfortable about it so i was sort of avoiding passing up the emeter and therefore didnt monkey with it but that is not standard review of the thirtysix havingness processes that is to say of how you get them or how you use them but would be review of trying to patch up somebodys havingness youre just trying to find something that works on the thing and very often if you know your businesswhich there is substitute for knowing your businessyou figure out well there is something going on here that were not quite sure whats going on so we try to find out whats going on quietly nothing very ecstatically or something just quietly try to find out whats going on with this pc see and were running havingness process and were getting needle action of any kind whatsoever you noticed that didnt you did you notice that before i did something about it audience yes all right well naturally i just started talking about the aspects of havingness you know is there anything around here you know that would keep you from having something and you know that sort of thing and finally got on the subject of nothing reaching her and we had drop see well that was enough then lets run reach reach would obviously produce some kind of reaction if not reach produced reaction of course if i had run not reach very long we would have had her on the floor it was good enough for test you know and sometimes you can spring something the pc is terribly allergic toyou know just bang you knowon some kind of havingness test in the room okay well that was successful havingness session in that we got the pc to get some havingness and repaired the pcs havingness and of course what youre watching here of course is little bit different than an auditing session in that you are not running pc who is in calm state of mind at all and pc is quite upset by an invisible audience and that sort of thing and before you get them settled down why you have to do little bit of work on it and they settle down they work all right but actually it takes considerable amount of auditor presence itd take more much more auditor presence to get anything done on session of that character than it would be in an ordinary session the difficulties of handling pc under demonstration with everybody present are just almost insurmountable and they are surmountable on this type of demonstration of course im used to this type of demonstration ive done it before many times produced some rather interesting results im against demonstration auditing by the way im dead against it i dont audit that way at all what i like to do is i like to get an auditing session going and do something for the pc and for the session is always for the pc and if i cant run session on the basis of getting something done for the pc well im ratheri get rather upset i did learn something in setting that up that you should know and that is all due respect to having meters around i was up at five oclock last night trying to figure out how in the name of common sense to hold session together you see underneath tv conditions and i found out something that i never audit with meter dial out of my line of sight with the pc thats got to be straight line the pc the dial the dial the pc and just by lifting my eyes why i can look at the pc and just by dropping my eyes i can see whats going on with the dial and i just found out i just never never audit successfully at all with the pc out of line of sight and because the pcs treated to this all the time you see your heads being kicked over and that is of course signal that i am not interested in your case so of course pc wouldnt stay insession worth nickel and possibly some of your session difficultiesi just discovered thissome of your session difficulties is having meter out of lineout of the line of sight of the pc theres the pc theres the meter theres you see and if you can rig it this way its fine actually we have such thing as an auditing chair an auditing chair as suzie was saying last night should have an arm that comes across and opening on theor closure on the left hand side so that you slide out of the chair you slide into the chair and you got bar or plate or something between you and the pc and then you got the meter on line of sight well i learned that and you put great deal of stress or pressure on an auditing session that you really have to observe what youre doing and analyze what its all about and youreundoubtedly will learn something about auditing and i just found out i never do otherwise i wouldnt know how to run session with my meter out of my line of sight see actually the meter is an extension of the pc to and if my head is pointed toward the pc all ive got to do is just drop my eyes slightly ill show you here see all i got to do isim looking at you and all i got to do is drop my eyes see see theres motion to distract the pc dont you see give you feeling like youre kind of insession all right end of session all right but an interesting little mechanic its one of these stupid things its like dick said one day you do something that auditors dont do you acknowledge the pc when he does something these littlelittle bugs come up every once in while and we find out theres variations of them all right here we are 7 feb ad 12 and id like to talk to you sqme more about missed withholds this is in vogue just now and the crash program which you when you get back to central organizations will havewill collide with and which you ought to pay some attention to because it sets up some new check spots in organizations you make sure that students dont sit around with missed withholds you make sure that hgc pcs at least once during twentyfivehour intensive but preferably toward its end are given check by uery good auditor separate from the auditor you see for missed withholds and all you do is turn the pc back to the auditor to be cleaned up and youve got to keep this checked up thats all i mean thats got to be straightened up and on theand on the auditing program of staff auditing youve got to keep missed withholds checked up on all of those cases going through the first step of the crash program is to pick up all missed withholds and thats being done in most central organizations at this very minute at high rate of speed and the other aspects of the crash program are not as important to you at the moment they exist however one is to get org rudiments in and but this business of missed withholds is susceptible to the greatest misinterpretation and if ive had trouble teaching people about missed withholds then youre going to have trouble teaching people about missed withholds i guarantee it because you say missed withhold and the auditor asks for withholds you say get the missed withholds on that case so the auditor says all right are you withholding anything and that is not the mechanism you say to somebody have you missed any withholds on the casehell go back in and ask for withholds and that is wrong wrrrrrrong wrong exclamation point underscore in gothic now missed withhold is this whole mechanism of what somebody should have found out and didnt and it is what somebody should have found out and didnt and that is the whole works it isnt withhold its shouldhavefoundout so you possibly will save yourself great deal of grief if you tell people to get the shouldhavefoundsouts off the case rather than the missed withholds now am i communicating shouldhavefoundouts you and was sitting here six months ago and we was doing process and should i have found out anything about you whether i asked for it or not thats aitd be almost legitimate to ask such blunt question you know you could ask such question like that you know you justit just falls out of the hamper you know i mean theres fireworks and small rockets go off in all directions and great deal of relief comes on the case well look at somebody now we could ask hershes nurse all right and you could ask her what should doctor have found out about you the knucklehead and you produce the most fantastic amount of case gain evidently its practically an affront not to be able to find out about something any time you want to go around wearing bath towel with woolworth diamond on it and be swami reading peoples minds also take out large insurance policy and get your burial arrangements straight its probably why they hung christ if they did thats right thats right if he was the of god he should have been able to find out about all the orthodox malpractices and he didnt and they hung him they didnt hung him they crucified him common practice of the day if he existed it isnt true that he led good life so they crucified him you see that wouldnt be the right story he should have found out about em and he didnt so you see they had to crucify him and thats just about the way it would be now if you go around telling everybody you can read their mindsi know this might get you lots of pcs for little whilebe sure at the same time that you go down to the bideawee cemetery and get yourself nice quiet lot becauseprobably you wont have time little while later its very hard to buy lot when you havent got body to pull money out of the pockets of but thats about how it is you see if you set yourself up on basis of being able to read minds and all that sort of thing it isnt going to be an everytime situation but it is going to be frequent enough that you will wish for gods sakes that youd asked for what you should have found out and didnt naturally if you can read minds or youre up in that plane or youre supposed to be observing things and you dont find out something about somebody hell hath snowball able to resist the fury its going to be mess now you sit down there as an auditor you dont know how many times you and i do mean you have done this with an hgc pc or pc from the fieldhow many times you have done this you have sat down in calm cool collected frame of mind and have started up an ordinary session and two sessions later have had godawful arc break with the pc that you couldnt spot what it was all about well now this would appear even more mysterious if you werent using anemeters and if emeters werent being used at that period of auditing you see this persons upset because you havent found out about him thats what that person is upset about youve been auditing there for two days and at any time he has expected you to suddenly come up and ask him well when did you rob the bank bud you know and you havent said word about it and he gets very upset well frnnkly we dont care about the theoretical mechanism this is not discovered from the field of theory this is totally empirical this is something that i have scouted down and have found to be true and it is becoming more and more alarmingly increasingly true and the further i look and the more arc breaks i check up on and the more dissatisfied pcs and the more arc broke field auditors and the more upset people who didnt go back to the pe course and all of that sort of thingit is just getting absolutely overwhelming and its empirical totally completely empirical it is gained from observation alone and i dont care whether thereany theory under the sun moon or stars fits this or not ive given you theory yesterday which accounts for it very well but i dont care whether that theory accounts for it or not and neither should you it just happens to be fact that all arc breaks dissatisfactions with scientology upsets in sessions blows from sessions failuretogain profiles are all traceable back not to withholds but to missed withholds you can straighten people out by straightening out pt problems you can straighten them out by straightening out arc breaks you can straighten them out in all these other things and that is all true and you can do it but you can reach beyond all this you can reach beyond this and straighten this pc out so fast he wont know whether hes riding streetcar or jet plane by just finding out what youwhat others should have found out and didnt or what you should have found out and didnt because pc has some very peculiar considerations with regard to this and these considerations are so peculiar that you would never never never be able to guess your way around them we dont care what the mechanism is or anything else we just wouldnt be able to guess your way around them so just stop trying to guess your way around these things and just overtly continue to ask for missed withholds ask for shouldhaveknowns use it routinely and regularly take one teaspoonful three times session sig 1 tad thats the way the pharmacist would state it now thats the way the cat jumps thats all pc comes in sits down in session you run off an almost letterperfect session halfway through the session pc blows up says when the hell did you learn how to audit what am i doing sitting here you havent done this you havent done that you just dropped the emeter on the floor and what was the idea of making the cans explode in my face youve just evaluated for and youve done this and youve done that now let melet make this very clear you might have done all those things but it would not be cause for an arc break unless you had missed withhold so you can miss withhold in the session just overtly you say to the pc you say all right are you withholding anything and it goes clang and youre using pembry meter or something of the sort or an old mathison or something and it doesnt go clang but it should have mark iv would have gone clang you see and you say thank you do you have present time problem the germs of war are sown the four horsemen of the apocalypse have begun to ride because anywhere within the next five minutes or the next half hour or the next hour and half youre going to make some little fumble of some kind or another or youre not going to make one or youre going to make large one or youre going to run perfect session but youre going to have godawil screaming arc break and the pc according to his modifier will behave and for some reason or other the missed withhold throws the pcs modifier of his main goal exactly and immediately into full cry you can always tell what pc will do when he has an arc break it will be the modifier of his main goal line now whether or not youve fished this out running 3d criss crossif youve gotten to the point where youre getting package and youre going in for the goal now to match up all the parts youve gotyou will find the modifier on top of it and it will explain all of his session behavior supposing the session behavior wasthis would be very mysterious to you and you wouldnt quite know what an arc break was if pc had and ill cry and cry and cry and then afterwards go away and never come back supposing that were the modifier the auditor would sit there and say i got some nice grief charges off the pc but he didnt turn up forthe next session you see you could be very baffled so you mustnt think that an arc break simply climbs up with the smoke of the volcano it doesnt it follows the exact modifier of the pc and of course as you know if you care to look over bunch of modifiers on assorted cases you could see how varied this might be how varied it would be and it is very variable but the pcs modifier goes into action and the pc starts to dramatize his modifier and of course from there on youre just in trouble all the way and what starts this chain of material what starts this one happening now you can prevent it from happening by cleaning up arc breaks as fast as they happen by getting withholds off as fast as they happen by making sure there is present time problem you get all these carefulnesses now you can make sure that that is held in check its held in abeyance you can also by the way stop it from being dramatized if you know the modifier by repeating the modifier at the pc this is rather poor show but its in extremis you can always get list to read again by chanting the modifier at the pc its secondary action its not anywhere near as good as actually auditing the pc but something is going to happen here which is going to interrupt the session and youre going to have to do something about it and as i say there are many things that you could do about it and of course you cant audit pc with present time problem and yes you shouldnt audit pc with an arc break and yes this is all true you see and you shouldnt audit pc with current withhold but if you really want to put all of these rudiments in clankwouldnt it be nice to have weapon which would just put all the rudiments in swish bang you know i mean you wouldnt have any more troubleyou just run should have known to death and youll have it all straight so in your beginning rudiments are you withholding anything should undoubtedly be followed with second line im not going to necessarily insert this into any routine patter itd be nice to do so but im going to say that it should be technology which goes above patter because you should be able to use it at any time and you should have it as weapon which you will use not park someplace back in ritual dont you see after youve said are you withholding anything say any version of and you see thereone of theone of the difficulties of putting pat patter there is there are so many ways it can be asked youd have to ask it differently for practically every pc lets see well you could work it this way you notice the pcs there and everything is fine and its going along but you know the pc is getting sec check session by another auditor now you want to set yourself straight so you say well havehas the other auditor missed withhold on you see youd use that wording are you withholding anything all right thats for you now thats routine but you understand its not even cousin to this other thing were doing you see theyre not even cousins lets just divorce them completely theyre in different families of action you can say are you withholding anything and youre right on the line but dont think you should drop out are you withholding anything because youre going to ask shouldhave know in other words justthese actually arent even cousins withholding anything is all new stuff kid see lets get the new stuff on the line lets open up the stock room and lets find out how many paper dollies and pornographic comic books that weve got on fhe here you see and were going to take new inventory and its new stock andget the idea thats all brand new but this otherthis otherthis goes back to what people should have found out and thats past thats old stuff so you say anything in after that are you withholding anything that might fit the circumstances of the case all right we know that we are auditingill give you an example we know we are auditing girl who has wandering eye and sheshe very possibly may have sinned against the twelfth or thirteenth commandment whatever it might be you see and she might not have but we know that we continue to get problems off of this girl with her boyfriend see we get problems all the time well were tired of these problems because they never lead to anything and they burn up about half the session we just dispense with the whole lot we get rid of this whole family of domestic internecine warfares by simply asking what should your boyfriend ralph have found out about you that he didnt well i was out with joe last night of course all right when was that all right good fine youre not now going to have present time problem to take care of but omitting that you see at that point the chronic favorite present time problem of the pc is going to pop up in the next rudiment youve just shortcircuited the whole thing by asking this you see why it cant be pat rudiment you note this girls also getting sec checking so you say all right did your sec check auditor miss withhold on you what should your sec check auditor have found out about you you know clearing all these points is there anything i should have found out about you in yesterdays session is there anything i should have found out about you when you sat down three minutes ago you know all right its all clean ill guarantee you that if you clean that across the boards you wont have an arc break or rudiment out for the remainder of the session you just sit there and audit like little soldier now theres one reservation i would make on this if youre all of sudden tearing up tons and tons of new material and youre knocking the bank appetite over tin cup and you all of sudden have large area of track on which the pc has recall you get right in there and ask it again you got it because the whole thing is reversed the condition of the case has changed now i know that an auditor whos being paid by the hour might occasionally unconsciously with his freudian subconscious not his scientological subconscioushe might possibly realize that if the pc got change he would go on being audited forever that would be very mean thing to even infer and the only reason i bring it upnot to be sarcastic because i seldom am what i wish to bring up is the fact that i sometimes am amazed by your lack of expectancy of change im amazed by the fact that you apparently dont make sufficient allowance for change in auditing case and ive actually had auditors auditing become very upset because my case was changing with too great rapidity well i was changing too fast an auditor shouldis auditing to produce change now of course change will give him consequences and the consequences are that the aspect of the case shifts and you get ayou get this case and youre swishing along with this case and youreand youllby the way this never becomes more apparent than in doing 3d criss cross its very apparent in sec checking too but in 3d criss cross this could get quite dizzying you start out auditing harlot in one session you see and you wind up auditing gleeful killer and the pc will follow that terminal track through and youre auditing different bank before you get through and if youve never noticed this you better pick your eye up because at first why the pc is sitting there you know and at the end of the session youve just shifted the bank well every one of those identities that youre going through has its own bank see you must realize that it has its own bank you are auditing different banks you know its packages its whole packages of engrams and you got new bank now when youre listing and if youre listing very effectively with the pc right practically coming straight through the emeter after you you know just right there you knowman that pc will be sitting awfully close to the terminal they announce and lets say youre listing at the rate of two new terminals minute that would be very slow listing two terminals minute all right youve got two cases minute if your pc is right insession now you talk about change man thats why im trying to boot you up the line and why im being so insulting and so mean and so viciouswhich im not being at all actually youd be surprised at the number of withholds you give in doing your pcs reports you know like i never remark on it oh my god not again for the second day you see i just withhold it and so forth and it all has to be run out im trying to raise your level of expectancy of what you should get out of this you see and if you do it even vaguely right youll find you think youve been running this oldthis old model t ford you see you think youve been running this old model t ford down this back country road you know and its going along at ten miles an hour and youre happy and so forth and all of sudden you slide into how to do it right and you find out that youre actually riding jet plane that is outward bound for arcturus you know and its quite shock when an auditor really starts grooving this thing you make 3d criss cross work for you and youre changing bank bank bank bank bank you see youre going through these lock valences lock valences and they arent very deep or they arent very penetrating but if the pcs getting any cognitions the pcs shifting the pcs just shifting all the time shifting all the time shifting all the time and youve got different bankevery time the pc goes through fifteen or twenty youve got totally different bank now dont you see but every time you get an item have you ever noticed the pc will dramatize the last item you found hm in the next session the pc dramatizes the last item you found itd drive you batty youre accustomed to this pc throwing the cans down in the middle of the room thats the custom he throws the cans down in the middle of the room and all of sudden with great shock the pc carefully unclips the electrodes off of the cans and puts them very carefully on the windowsill before she blows you know but youll see case changes if youre really pressing ahead on 3d criss cross and you get into one of these case changeswhich im trying to drive through in this lectureyou see if you get into one of these case changes theres whole bunch of shouldhaveknowns the whole aspect of shouldhaveknowns has all of sudden shifted and you handle these in the sort of the sloppy fashion of the middle rudiments you get the rudiments in you make sure the rudiments are in now dont distract the pc all over the place just notice just please please notice when pc goes tenth out of session dont wait till the pc goes half out of session or threequarters out of session or leaves the room you start tuning your observational powers up to knowing whether or not pc is insession or not and i just wont settle for anything less than that its human observation this pc has started to talk to you rather coolly distantly and so forth youre already too late you should have noticed it ahead of that and at the time you notice this the one you get in basically is should have known oddly enough for that valence the pc is now in there are some missed withholds that werent missed for the pc that you had minute ago you see how this could be so when pc starts to slide out of session that first tiny little slide out of session is the one i want you to get i tell you the quality of an auditor is observable at the stage of arc break that the auditor asks or acts you know its the stage of arc breaks which causes the auditor to act now an auditor who iswho is the rhinocerostype auditor you see handles the arc break as the pc is going down the stairs thats the time that auditor handles the arc break now an auditor whos little more alert considerably more alert handles the arc break at the moment the pc stands up to leave the room another auditor little bit better and little more alert handles the arc break at the moment the pc throws the cans down now little bit better auditor notices the upward flick of the wrist you see the gradient here and now were getting into pretty good auditor he knows that the pc has stopped talking he notices the pc has not answered any question for long time because itll be long time the pcs gone on for long time not really in communication you see before he starts throwing the cans down and then we get into the very very perceptive auditor who notices that the pc is really not speaking sooth he spake noteth sooth he did heyou ask himi dont care what youre running youre asking him for list and he says cotton picker cotton mouth and hes been going on cotton picker cotton mouth and now he isnt talking that way you see hes saying cotton picker cotton mouth mm i um along about that point it justit takes just that much change of pace on the part of the pc for to perceive hes gone out of session i mend the session then and oddly enough the pc doesnt ever recognize theres been an arc break i take little bit of pride in knowing theres an arc break before the pc finds it out and man can you patch up session in hurry if you patch up the arc break which has occurred but the pc has not found out about yet now you can be too anxious on this point and you can patch up nonextant arc breaks and cause one so you see its very very tight little dividing line which is very tiny and the dividing line i9 dont patch up nonextant arc breaks or youll cause one patch up extant arc breaks before the pc find8 it out and its right at that little barrier point that you should pick em up and that is really expert if you can do that you got it made now you start checking on this sort of thing youll find out that shouldhaveknown undoubtedly is the theory which lies behind what has happeneda shouldhaveknown lying in there someplace case has shifted and shouldhaveknown so you could say what should i have found out anything as blunt or stupid as this or what should people have found out you could say anything like this as question and itll knock the thing back in the session will go back in again go back in again right now clean it up for instance pc who is on an incipient arc break pc who has shouldhavefoundout is always on the verge of an arc break always right there on the verge of it if hes got continuous ishouldhavefoundout theyshouldhavefoundout youshouldhavefoundout somebodyshouldhave foundout and that is what you call the arc breaky pc he is riding on shouldhavefoundout and anytime you have called somebody an arc breaky pc just think of that person and then reclassify what was wrong with him on he was shouldhavefoundout person you see they should have found out about and they didnt find out about him and so therefore he continues to be an arc breaky person anybody who is going to blow who is going to give you any trouble who is going to give you bunch of upset who is going to vilify the organization who is going to all of sudden become disinterested in auditing who is going to be very upset by what you are doing to themall of these various categories crawl under the heading of shouldhavefound out and shouldhavefoundout in some category or another that may have relatively little to do with you but you happen to join the mob that should have found out you see you happen to be classified in that zone anybody youre going to have any trouble with now this one principle above and beyond all other principles lies behind your arc breaks and this one principle is that principle more responsible for loss of dissemination and loss of scientologists and public to scientology than any other single factor this means this observational fact coming up means considerable change of policy with regard to the functioning of pe foundations the functioning of coaudits the reason you lose people on coaudits the reason why youre having difficulty handling this zone and sphere why they dont move over from pe to coaudit has nothing to do with recognized truth the truth which you are trying to tell them is easily recognized but the truth which they are wearing that you should have found out about if you dont recognize that ahhhh so the way you could runthis is in extremisthe way you could run pe foundation would be simply on the basis that everybody in the pe foundation is professional finderoutabouter you know they dont tell anybody about the arc triangle and they dont tell anybody about auditing and they dont hardly mention the name scientology and youd have tremendously overwhelmingly successful pe foundation i think thats your bug on pe co audit now that still has to be tested and put in operation has not yet been squared up but i think you will find that it lies in that zone and field anybody who walks in for pe course should beuntil you find out otherwiseshould be classified as shouldhavefoundout case this is shouldhavefoundout person and the reason most of them come in is to find out if you can find out what you should find out and that is why people come in to pe foundations they dont come into pe foundations to learn about scientology or to be helped or any other of the reasons why we think they come into pe foundations the greatest bulk of them apparentlysubject to test and further figuresapparently appear to find out if you can find out about em and if you dont find out about them they arc break it is all the worse they go out and tell everybody that youre fakes and frauds and there youve had it so that if your pe foundation was totally composed of should haveof findingout personnelfinding out about people who should be found out and nothing else why youd be very successful about the thing now if you take profile if you have test department and you take somebodys profile and you take this profile and you draw it all up and you put him on the emeter and you ask them how they feel about two or three things and coordinate their profile and put this all on file and then you write them big long rundown on the subject of their profile and you get it into their hands you think youre performing considerable service quite few of those people will be with you but the largest lot of them are now missedwithhold cases how do you like that and you have just created an antiscientology public tests you shouldnt be doing tests on these people put an emeter crew on the job all right do you want to come down to this pe course well very good there are certain requisites to this pe course and we have little form we have to fill out here all right mrs zilch now sensitivity 16 just hold on to the electrodes there theres very small amount of current that goes through that wont shock you now all right now here we are now all right what should we find out about you thank you then clear it now what should the last group you joined have found out about you and didnt clear it you say all right thats fine all right now what should have been found out about you by your last group reaction good we got it off now all right what should we find out about you all right we got that fine all right heres your ticket to class youll never lose em that is what they mean by you are the people who know youre the people who know what do they mean by this what about what about what know yeah we know all about life we know all about the mind but the reason why we know is because we know about them thats what their idea of knowingness is what is knowingness that they robbed bank that is knowingness here are all the riddles of the human mind laid out here in string all you have to do is read on down the line that isnt knowingness to this person its whether or not you robbed bank whether or not you can find out he robbed bank if you can find out he robbed the bank then you know now you must be smart you must be clever and you must know your business and i dont think from that moment on you have to prove anything isnt that fascinating you go on and give them standard pe course that sort of thing afterwards coaudit unfortunately becomes almost impossible under this particular line unless its emetered then it would have to be mark iv metered then the people who were being run through coaudit would have to be checked out routinely on what should have been known about you you could possiblyyou can always dream up the answers to this sort of thing but i set up the impossibility that exists at the moment if you continue to run coaudit exactly as youre running coaudit youre going to lose more people off the coaudit than you keep on it and thats why coaudit doesnt build up coaudit builds up only if the should haveknows are to be pulled off the case if you were to pull all those off cases in coaudit then that coaudit would build up up up and you would get something done so that back of all rudiments lies the shouldhaveknown therefore we see the definition of knowledge to person is knowledge about themselves in terms of their overts thats hideous but to the bulk of the public the entirety of knowledge is just whether or not you know their particular overts and if you know their particular overts then you are very very clever person and you are true swami and thats it thats what knowingness is to them now weve been trying to climb this ladder backwards for long time trying to find out where bottom was and that is the bottom definition of knowing the bottom definition of knowledge knowledge is overts if he knows about my overts then he is wise man he is typically wise man he knows all the secrets of the universe because he knows that i routinely and customarily drink gordons gin at work its surprising you see youd never really look for such an anticlimax on the subject of knowledge but you see that is the beginning of the ladder and after that of course you have to know and the funny part of it is you would have to know all about life and so forth to keep the ladder going on up youd have to know the lot of it and actually apparently knowing the lot of it really brings about this other datum which im just giving you you know about these people in terms of their overts you know what their overts are then you are wise man an auditor is always blessed who has pulled the pcs overts properly he must be good auditor you ask auditors around you ask pcs who is really good auditor around here and they say soandso and this will be colored in professional group such as this one of course itll actually be whos good auditor but in ain an hcahpa trainee level or something like that youll get different aspect entirely and itd just be who was able to get the shouldhaveknowns off now get the withholds off doesnt qualify get the shouldhave knowns off that does qualify you get the difference between withhold and shouldhaveknown youre smart auditor you are clever auditor you are an expert beyond all experts because you got this one pcs should haveknowns off didnt get his withholds off you see that didnt count you put lot of time in on him you were very clever and these are really what were making the pc well and climbing uphill and changing his case and everything else never notice those you got off the should haveknowns boy are you good auditor youre smart bunny that fellow is real clever i dont know how he got that out of but hes certainly smart auditor hes really clever how did the auditor get it out of him the auditor said all right who are you having trouble with in life well i mostly have trouble with my family good well what should your family have found out about you that it didnt oh that oh really nothing yeah well well if you insist yeah well there are couple of little things i used to throw my shirt studsi used to throw them carelessly in the drawer you wontyou wont buy that all right lets see uhuh and all of sudden why you find out what his family should have found out about him now you know you know life you know life you know you know you know what life consists of i think thats the test that must be run on practically everybody as to whether or not they have intelligence or not i think this is the iq test administered by everybody on everybody its can they find out about if they can find out about man theyre clever person so therefore shouldhaveknown does not dispense with but outranks all rudiments does not dispense with withholds but is much deeper and more profound than mere withhold it is type of withhold in that its past withhold which has been restimulated youve restimulated something and havent pulled it well youre in trouble right now youve restimulated withhold and now the person halfway knows about it and then you dont know about it well now youre the most stupid person on earth and preclears will gratuitously tell you you are now lot of youa lot of you and lot of people who hear this tape will have at one time or another had their auditing mauled damaged pounded in the head theyve been scolded screamed at howled decried had their auditing confidence shaken and so forth by arc broken pcs this is the lot of an auditor to large degree i want to call something to your attention is your auditing was never that bad it was pretty bad but it was never that bad the thing that was out during every one of those arc break things and that caused this cascade of criticism of your auditing was shouldhaveknown that was what was out in that session where you got reamed out your auditing skill has not been at fault it was that little piece of technology that was sitting in there now knowing that you should be able to come forward and do much better job of auditing because you wont be going up against that unknown of when is this pc going to arc break and what is going to happen in this session or can i steer this session right or this person is pretty mean sort of pc to handle or anything else that comes in in that category you can just jump that over go ahead and improve your technology your presence and your ability to audit by all means you should but skill of auditing is basically speed of gain this is what you measure skill of auditing on the more pc can be held into session the more gain pc is going to make in that session the better you are as an auditor the more rapid your advance is going to be on the pc and the fewer things youll have to patch up and so forth and this can get down to point of where your auditing skill is so poor that your pc makes advance because of course the frog is climbing two inches up the well and falling back two inches or three inches sometimes you see and climbs up two inches and falls back two inches and climbs up two inches and falls back two inches you never make any case gain because the auditing skill is so monkeyed up and wooden headed and doublefisted you see its just poor were not talking about skill not what you run on the pc were talking about your use of model session your ability to hold the pc in session your ability to handle your tools your ability to get something done in session your ability to avoid corny mistakes of one kind or another see all of those just auditing ability now the better those things are the better you are you see at handling all these things why the more gain the pcs going to make now over and above this if you can hold cancelled and nullified all of your pcs jolts and progresses and rudiments and so forth and particularly this button which goes back of the rudiments what are you going to wind up with your pcs are going to fly thats all im still sitting here waiting for you to make your pcs fly you know i dont settle for anything less than sixtyfive foot wingspread on pc and thats what im trying to get you to do you see is audit with such smoothness such command of your tools and so forth that you just go right ahead and make progress along the line thats what im interested in your doing but now technically we suddenly turn up this other tool that inhibits doesnt wipe them out forever but it certainly inhibits arc breaks it keeps them from happening it keeps your sec check sessions from turning out totally sour youve got this kind of situation now in this particular class before anybody is on 3d criss cross there are certain basic preparatory things which should be done with the student this is not necessarily retroactive but well be working in this particular fashion we pick up all the missed withholds the shouldhaveknowns get those out of the road get the last two pages of the joburg and the shortened form 66a we square the person around on flows process get them flying in that particular line and then put them on to 3d criss cross and thats about the way cases are going to be graduated up here therell be some variation on whats done to them after their last two pages of the joburg and their form 6athe little period in there but this waswould be what is expected of case not necessarily the auditing skill or what were trying to train those things might be different but that would be expected of case we expect him to make that particular line of progress now you see thats enormously shortened the moment that you put the missed withhold ahead of the lot so you tack missed withholds on to your rudiments your beginning rudiments tack it on to the end rudiments in the form of ihave i missed withhold on you during this session you see now thats in addition to you know did you withhold anything or are you withholding anything or something like that and square up the whole of your middle difficulties with shouldhaveknowns of one character or another and get agile in the use of this understand what it is and what youre asking for and let assure you that you will have very smooth run of it with pcs i think all of you are getting some reality on this already those cases which have reputation for being rough to audit out of session disinterested or upset or anything else that you consider wrong with case the first thing you should try on such case is to find some area of shouldhaveknown i dont care whether its familial some other practice medicine we dont care what anyplace we could find shouldhaveknown well lets shoot it full of holes and then lets take scientology and lets shoot the shouldhaveknowns full of holes with regard to scientology and auditing sessions there and youll find this person will straighten out youll find out this is quite remarkable and its weapon which i hope we dont lose sight of we lose sight of even such things as havingness for two years at crack so i can expect in 1965 why were sitting here and weve got five six class members that are all arc breaky and theyre all upset we cant figure out whats wrong with them and somebodys combing back through the archives and they come up against this particular lecture and say well thats been dropped out since 1964 something else came up that was far more important lets hope that doesnt happen but if we do get this kind of condition rolling lets hope somebody does break out this lecture thank you very much
