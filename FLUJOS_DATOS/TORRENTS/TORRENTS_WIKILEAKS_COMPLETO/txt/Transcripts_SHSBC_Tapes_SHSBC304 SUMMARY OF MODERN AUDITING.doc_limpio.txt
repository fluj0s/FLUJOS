summary of modern auditing lecture given on 19 june 1963 all right this is what audience nineteenth of june nineteenth june 1963 thank you for putting on the time track id gotten off of it good thing too saint hill special briefing course i havent anything much to talk to you about except modern techniques and i think id better give you summary of modern auditing as it looks might be valuable to you there are innumerable processes there have been processes of all different shapes and kinds up and down the last twentyfive years and recorded during that period why is more or less the work of about fourteen of these years and these processes fall into very specific categories of which you have record in your state of case scale now the categories they fall into however are processes that handle certain conditions orof case and if we look this over very carefully well see that eases deteriorate as they go on down along the time track and they deteriorate against two factors and the primary factor that they deteriorate against is confront and the other factor is duplication as they become unwilling to confront they become less capable of duplication now you should look on confront as willingness and duplication as an ability now it doesnt matter that you run what are you willing to duplicate or unwilling to duplicateit doesnt matter that you use that in process too much but it is notits not exactly right its not quite right its something like the officer of the change of the guards at buckingham palace wearing his sword on the wrong side really if you were to ask somebody what are you able to duplicate and what do you feel you are unable to duplicate you would have very exact sort of process and remembering our process rules and the famous brackets and so forth to keep it from damming up flow why you have to get the other fellow in there at least you know what would anotherwhat wouldwhat would you be willingyou see there are lot of combinations to it what would you bewhat do you believe another is able to duplicate dont you see and is unable to duplicate thats your second leg you see of course you can add up these legs ad infinitum and the reason why these legs get added up ad infinitum is the degree of complexity necessary to undercut the case thats the purpose of legs some case could run practically all the wayhed have to be very highscale casehed practically run all the way on ajust one leg you see well that would be case not troubled too much by flows and another case well you run just what is he unable and what does he believe another is unable you see all right thats all right thats fine because youve got twoway flows with both viewed from the same viewpoint now what does another believe he is unable to duplicate now thats the other flow from another viewpoint you get the idea and the whole thing about flows is how much do you need them for this particular ease you see and flows are interesting at this point because you could always doctor up the flows of situation get ta action when you might not otherwise have it see thats quite important thereyou see ta action is not totally outside the auditors control if he remembers flows and brackets see all he has to do is study up on brackets and you add enough brackets to get ta action thats the way you handle brackets and it actuallyyou see there is perfect method of running brackets there is absolutely perfect method if you ran all of the available flows do you realize that any given instant on this planet alone there are twoandahalf billion or maybe its threeandahalf billion todayit was twoandahalf billion yesterday the population explosionthere are twoandahalf billion other viewpoints simultaneously operating at that exact instant so that would make something on the order of twoandahalf billion legs plus all the legs which take care of all the intermediate groups and dynamics present at that particular moment you see and it just becomes completely ridiculous im giving you an idea that you can become very ridiculous in the numbers of legs that you use in process now the idea of flows is something that monitors all case levels and for some peculiar reason breaks its back at about level 4 in other words you can get as complicated or as simple as you like above level 4 but below level 4 it goes in harmonicsso that you get down to the person who is almostalmost at the bottom and you only have one viewpoint which is self you see so it becomes impossible for this person who is well downscale to run more than one viewpoint you see even though its vitally necessary that he run two he can only run one now this is problem of the dynamics at work in actual fact its how many dynamics can person function on now that howeverand this im trying to give you look at here it sounds rather complicated to youthat there are many facets of processing wherein you could match up to an ideal you could match up to an ideal what is the ideal process or the perfect process you see the one that absolutely matches every single condition extant on case you see well im trying to make this point with these brackets and legs you see the absolute ideal totally perfect process from the standpoint ofsee i defined science today what was that science is amodern science is method of precisely determining overwhelming nonsense well the point im trying to make here is that you could go ahead mathematically you see and you could figure out some of the wildest combinations that would be absolutely vital to process and see theres twoandahalf billion people on earth so that in any given instant to run the pc why you have to have the viewpoint of each one of these people taken into account one way or the other and then there are various other factors such as their cases so their case viewpoints and modifications thereof would have to be taken into effect and what we are trying to do we completely lose sight of were trying to cure the pcs burned finger so you have this thing called the ideal and you have this other thing called the workable now the workability of process is what determines its complexity how complex or uncomplex does it have to be to be workable and thats how you determine what process to use thats how you determine how many legs there should be in running out brackets and so forth in other words how many do you have to have for it to work now that factor goes on in to the number of processes you have now there could probably be an infinite number of processes and sometimes i feel that i have developed an infinite number of processes and you in studying bulletins undoubtedly feel sometimes that youve had to study an infinite number well let assure you that many more types of processing have been dropped by factor of thousands times of oh thousands of times more processes have been dropped and discarded than have been retained why they are pretty but do they work you see thats the criterion theyre pretty but do they work all right so that limits then the number of processes which have survived and the number of processes which have survived are those processes which have not just workability but which have very broad workability and now we come up against this factor that there are types of cases cases arent gi issue x case see its not always an issue case so we have to determine the common denominators present in all cases see what are the common denominators present in all cases well they happen to be arc they oddly enough are the midrud buttons and certain types of incidents common to everyones time track which is to say the general history of all cases is quite similar the reaction of the case though to this history is quite different because the combinations of history make differences of cases and when we study differences of cases we again could get out into the most overpowering library of textbooks you ever heard of we could have kraepelins chart multiplied by five or six thousandyou know everybody thinks thats phoney gag of mine but you know it isnt you know that chart really exists and its really called that and but this vast number of cases he had vast number and they took it over to america and they added vaster number and this became one of theone of the finest lists of gobbledygook anybody ever had anything to do with its totally meaningless because they got upthey were getting up to two idiocies either there was one case that was supposed to represent aone case type that included all cases see thats one type of idiocy you know everybody is schizophrenic you see thats the way they establish cases these days is what institute he was sent to thats actually what they use for ease classification and if he went to walnut lodge and they treat schizophrenics then the guys schizophrenic you see simple thisso that everybody is schizophrenic or there is case type for every case see these are two idiocies one case type for every case theres five thousand patients so theres five thousand case types in one institution see well this type of approach to the problem is completely unreal because its not workableits not useful an auditor has use for it at all you might as well say my pcs name is betty so therefore i am auditing betty case type well funny part of it is it has some truth see there is other case that is exactly like this ease but there are other denominators there are other denominators which are similar this ease has in common certain things with every other case now you can divide case types up but again just for use you can divide case types up into few case types but what is the meaning of this it would simply be for the purpose of matching them up to processes that would be the only reason you would get different types of cases today so you can match them up to the processes well great deal more work could be done on this than has been done even but we would get again probably an excess of what we needed wed be getting too complex for what we were trying to do so you can go in two directions and err in two directions in trying to classify types of processes you can get so many ease types that nobody under the sun would ever be able to use that scale or chart in handling any ease and the other one is to have one case type without any variation whatsoever now the first way would lose quite few cases because you couldnt find their ease type on it or something you see it was not quite beta and was really not an alpha so its betasubalpha case type but there is process which has been aligned for this particular type because it doesnt belong on the chart or something and nobody would get processed you see and on the other side of the picture we just sit somebody down and we say thud this is what you are going to run and every so often the auditor has horrendous loss because hes got case type that just doesnt quite fit that process its little bit too grossly out we cant fit this case type into that exact process but we have to do something else so what we need is finite number of ease types based on behavior in an auditing session not behavior in life see make it quite real and then match up processes which do handle and raise the case up that scale and that is what is needful here for our purposes now you cant expect auditors to memorize and perform more than few auditing types perfectly if you expect them to you get slop over quite rapidly whereby they mix auditing types and styles and it gets to be pretty much hash so you try to keep these things separate not because of the limitations of the auditor but it takes quite little while to get experienced and grooved in on type of auditing takes quite little while to do this now probably repetitive command auditing is so familiar to you that you dont look on it as something that is very difficult to handle its pretty easy there it is and thats all there is to it ah do you remember the first day you ever started to do repetitive process on somebody well the reason why you look on that easy is youre so familiar with it for instance it bears great qualms to the vast majority of auditors to sit there and give the same auditing command over and over and over and simply acknowledge it on and on they look on that as very easy auditing thats long sleep and thats all there is to it is bang bang bang bang bang bang you see so this particular thing is that it is lesson in common to all types you have learned it so you dont regard it with any great horror now the cchsyou take somebody who has never done the cchs and you give him cch 1 2 3 4 and they can get further afield with this than you could easily imagine in fact the whole of auditors have gotten completely afield over period of years it had gradually drifted down to grind and there was such thing as flat point in the cch you see and regardless of whether the fellow was doing an auditing command or not you just kept on running the auditing command dont you see actually repetitive processes has slopped over into the cchs when did you end these cchs well its much more important to end the cch properly than repetitive command properly now the cchs have also the frailty of auditing people who are lower on the tone scale that is those who are really going to require nothing but cchs something like that these people are lower on the effect scale and therefore are much more easily boxed about thanyou know knocked about bad auditing has much worse effect on them than it has on somebody else who is upscale so therefore its type of process which at once looks brutal on cases that react brutally but is kidglove type of process well by the time youve absorbed all these factors and time youve gotten used to all this and time that you can successfully and adequately run the cchs why youve learned quite bit i remember i had to study very hard to learn how to run the cchs and i eventually got quite good at it and went ahead and became quite comfortable running the cchs and after period of about five yearsi hadnt done any cchsi uncorked the original cchs as they were done and as they were getting case results here at saint hill and put on television demonstration with regard to it and everybody thought that i was running something else and they had never heard of these cchs vast revelation to that they werent getting results with the cchs they were overlooking but these were the original cchs and they were quite calm and quite delicate and everybody had gone into the effort band you know boom you know and you grind it out you know and that sort of thing well these things can slip these things can slip well how manyhow many types of auditing do you care to keep in line lets say youre an instructor d of t or something like that in some district areahow manyhow many types of processing do you think you can keep in line keep policed and keep well done if principal types go out in other words its small number its small number and by the time you got one of these things all boxed up and written up and delivered and being done every now and then you have to unpeel the thing and get it reviewed because it shifted and is longer producing results its variation which knocks out process types we stopped accumulating process types when i learned that people shifting from the original type of process would then apparently bring about need for new process type and that has plagued you more than youd believe because all i would see that auditors were longer getting results with the cchs and i would tend to drop them but then i got very very eager beaver on this and i went into it because of this experience here at saint hill and i found out that process type shifts very badly and it shifts out of workability over period of years so it has to be put back in again and youll find out you dont need new process you need the original process type again refurbished polish up the old teapot and get cracking and youre making tea again see tends to go to pieces now that by the way is more of limiting factor than you would believe thehow to keep processes in line how to keep them working and so forth its an important factor you say well they used to say that they got results with this process but we dont see any results in it now its called duplication processing dont see any results with this processing these days well get clever and go dig up bulletin from the year zud see and youll find out that the auditing command is not as it is modernlyyoull find out the auditing command is modernlyis duplicate nothing thank you duplicate nothing thank you duplicate nothing youll find out that wasnt the original auditing command and as an auditing form you dont always interrupt the pc when the pc answers the question the thing is to get the pc to answer the question not to prevent the pc from answering the question these little variations will creep in you mark my words man now i dont mean to be sarcastic youd be surprised how technology can vary over period of years for instance we havent clue what buddhism was all about we really dont have clue there might have been some very good processing in there you know and just now im almost certain that the planet builders couple three hundred trillion years ago had some technology they must have had some mental technology of some kind or another see and one of these days when ive got some time casewise im going to get run over that area very carefully so i can winnow out any technology they might have had in its original state and it might have been the planet buildersif they had technologywent downhill only because the technology got varied out of existence so in other words process types are then also limited by how many you can keep in line see so therefore the simpler process types tend to survive better than the more complicated process types now but even the simpler ones will drift out of line so thats class of processesthe cchs the cchs are sufficiently marvelous that old 8c was elected as the best case booster by the field auditors in the united states on query by in 1958 it won hands down over anything under the sun i dont even know how they were doing it today but it must have been fairly correct because it was only about ait was only few years from its inception must have been fairly correctly run during those days well theres case type what is thiswhat is this case type well its this ease type where you get duplication going with another person and duplicative physical order followed by another person another person has great deal to do with this youre following the instructions from another person and youre directing your attention at the physical universe and so forth and this is all quite important to it funny part of it is that as you drop one level you tend to drop that out and you get the reach and withdraw processes now these are still duplicative processes these are still following the orders of person but you should look on those as limitation thats limitation of the process that is longer benefit of the process the process works on the lowestlevel cases in spite of these things now theres whole band of processes which are so simple and so idiotic that everybody would tend to overlook those processes entirely and heres another reason nobody could possibly see that the process would have very much use so the process dies and with it dies the lowestlevel cases that you attack and so you get loses you need that process so heres another way process can go outis because it is seldom used seldom used actually its the only known way to process cat or monkeyand youd be surprised what happened to don breedings dog one day when he started to run sort of reach and withdraw he was trying to run 8c which was too high upscale and the dog passed out thats right the dog passed out it was too high upscale what he needed was the reach and withdraw processes and you can do remarkable things with the reach and withdraw processes its probable that you would not really carry one forward far enough to flatten it because itsanother thing is the process works so slowly even though it works positively that it tends to be neglected now i think you could probably get eat to talk with the reach and withdraw band of processes i mean it i mean it i think you could get cat to talk but how would you go about processing cat you see well the same way you tend to process children sloppily hunt and punch regular sessions not treating it with the dignity that auditing demands dont you see you know lot of scientologists kids are going to be practically unprocessable in few more years if people keep hunting and punching processing on them you know grabbing them off as they pass by and running an assist dont you see and never flattening the auditing command and so forth im surprised every once in while one of my kids will yelp when i say im going to give them an assist you know they yelp theyre usually very pleased but once in while i will propose something like this and ill get protest and i dont know somethings going on has something to do with it and they just dont happen to want anything to do with this thing called processing just now well what is it its some hunt and punch processing theyve had without the dignity of an auditing session or anything like that and thats practically all they get well thats all cat would get either see you wouldnt say to the cat all right all right with you if i begin this session now any goals youd like to set for this session and yet in actual fact youd have to put the session in some kind of frame and youd be surprised after you gave the cat about four or five sessions that the cat would know the frame see start of session end of session you know they know during that period between those two commands they were supposed to stand there and do whatever you were saying another thing is the idea of power of choice overwhelming power of choice and that sort of thing probably be mishandled cat starts to walk off and you say to hell with that you know and you herd him back into session again but in actual fact if you observedif you observed these very straightforward rules of auditing that session had to have frame had to begin and had to end and if you werent trying to overwhelm the pc and so forth and if you were willing to give the cat as much time as you would give human beinggive the cat fiftyhour intensive dont you see its very hard to do because the attention span of the cats probably ten minutes have to be fifty hours worth of tenminute sessions dont you see wow and then remember that that cat as cat is going to come up tone scale thats another thing that auditors neglect oddly enough properly processed cat will not claw up his auditor he just starts clawing up everybody else so you getyou get situation here what will reach and withdraw processes do well actually you dont know and i dont know our experience with them is something like joe has been sick for long time so we take his hand and we say touch the pillow and touch the pillow and say thank you and we say touch the sheet and he touches the sheet and we say thank you you know we take his hand and make him touch the sheet and we do between two objects here back and forth and around make him touch various things more randomly than that probably that is to say touch your forehead touch the sheet touch the pillow touch the shoe that you put up on the edge of the bed or something and the end product of it is is his eyelids flutter and he comes to and then we decide wed better give him some processing so we have another source of the disappearance of processes which you can put under the head of disrespect we dont respect the process and so it tends to vanish from ken see its process which we use diffidently in certain ways actually old arc processing disappeared on that route nowso we really dont know what the reach and withdraw band amounts to because we have almost never carried through reach and withdraw process when you were doing book and bottlewhich is reach and withdraw process with duplication its band process it hangs right between reach and withdraw and the cchs when you were doing that did you ever flatten it i almost have scientologist ive ever run into has ever flattened this they say theyve done eight hours of it or ten hours of it or eighteen hours of it or twentyfive hours of it and ive heard thirty hours of it being done or something of this nature but i never heard of it being flattened and yet do you know that nearly everybody exteriorizes under that process when its run over about ten hours thats something to think about now have any of you ever had the sudden illusion that you forgot to raise your arm from the side in touching the book but put your theta beam arm up or wondered what was happening here you got confusion between your body and anyexcuse for using the wordastral body now whatwhats this all about looks to like thats neglected sphere of processingnot respected its to make an auditor capable of doing repetitive process and thats what we believe it is there are enormous numbers of processes in that particular band lots of them one of the most fruitful bands of processing there is is reach and withdraw practically unexplored and some respectable percentage of the cases which you try to push all the way up are not going to move until theyre run on reach and withdraw they wont move on the cchs isnt that an interesting datum now as ive been winnowing out processes then i have come to the conclusion that we have the processes which undercut all cases which you can lay your hands on but as we have moved down the lower lines because we are always pressuring at the top we kept forgetting the bloke who was at the bottom and through disrespect of the process because of its limited use had not much cared to develop it all of this is very vital in summary of modern processing is to realize why processes disappear and what processes are all about rather than process b and c have survived period youve got ahead of you times when you will practically be in tears over ease for some reason or other the case has done an off the top of the springboard down to the bottom of the state of case scale for some reason theyve had catastrophe or something occur in their lives the problems are too great for them or something has happened and you justtone arm action ceases case stops moving you say all right were going to get problems straight this ease obviously has got problems you knowthe ease has problems after all anybody who marries three wives and so forth and burgles the banks is liable to have problems so all right now lets just cut right into this and lets get rid of these problems well be able to get on with our engram running where we were beforecheerily cheerily ah youve overlooked something problems belong at repetitive processes and the bottom of repetitive processes are at case levelat case level 6 thats the absolute bottom of repetitive processes and this case of yours has done temporary surge you see that your auditing not your case but your auditing has done temporary surge or temporary collapse and is sitting squarely at 8 you cant run problems on the case yes its true that the case has problems but the case does not respond to running problems so our next division in processing is what the auditor knows is wrong with the case and what can be done with the case and these are entirely different things so your common denominator of all eases is very well to know in theory but paralleling this is what can be done with these cases what can be done with them yeah all right so you say we got thetan here and hes gothes in body and hes got time track which has got lots of engrams on it its got the helatrobus implants on it and goals of that particular character and its gotand hes got certain types of things that hes refusing to duplicate and weve got all these things his arc is low hes been arc broken we can say all these things yes thats whats wrong with the ease yeah absolutely right theres nothing wrong with anything we have said but lets get over to the other side of the thing what can we do about it so we get over into the category of what im referring to as modern processes modern processes have nothing to do with what is wrong with the case unlike therapeutic or curative procedures or something like that you have nothing to do with these things theyre sort of hand in glove ingrained because of the aesculapean school and other schools of medicine as they come up the line you see the case has lumbosis therefore we give him some trumbosis powder see see see that is level of thinking that is certain thinkingness and its very very easy method of thinking its very comfortable its very lazy and very ineffective were not in the business of curing things but we nevertheless tend to because thinkingness tends to go along the line of what is wrong with case has to be righted and thats not true in scientology you see how idiotic it isyou say this case keeps saying vomica nix vomica vomica nix vomica thats all the case says we say very good stuck in the helatrobus implants good hes got goal to vomica well now let assure you of something if this case is dramatizing something that something is not real to the case and you can put that down as one of the guiding rules of running processes yes sir if the case is dramatizing something its not real to the case and right away hes got lumbosis so we give him some antilumbosis powder instantly folds up youve got to bypass that type of thinkingness entirely the only observation you have to do of case is does it respond to the process which is being run on the case you can put that down thats the other guiding rule very simple does it respond to the process that is being run on the case that is everything there is to it does it respond to the process thats being run on the case what do we mean by respond well were getting tone arm action now there can be one thing wrong with this thing called tone arm action tone arm action can cease because session rudiments arent in very definitely tone arm action can cease because session rudiments are out so therefore we have to assume in auditing that something like session rudiments are in or that we run process which undercuts session rudiments such as the reach and withdraw or cchs and to some slight degree sec checking undercuts session rudiments and also are flows getting out of line now let give you an example the helatrobus implants and most of the engrams you dig up are motivators i dont care how else you look at it they are motivators there are some overts running down the line the nasty things you thunk or the pc thunks while hes running these motivators but they are motivators ta action will probably cease sooner or later on the case oh you run out six or eight goals and you run out fifteen twenty engrams and you all of sudden are looking at ta action wheres the ta action gone it was there the ease was getting ta action on this type of processing so this really applies to ceased ta actionthose processes on whom on which ta action had been observed this only then applies to processes on which ta action has been observed if ta action has been observed on process then ta action will cease only for three reasons the session rudiments are out the rule of flows under which we include the overtmotivator sequence and the situation is not in accord with the cases forward progress the case has not gothas not any ability to move on forward because the process is flat so theyre just your three conditions there session rudiments are out flows under which we include also overtmotivator has been upset or the process is flat and its for one of these reasons ta actions ceases but thats for ta action which has existedta action has existed now you can recover ta action on something that has had ta action one way or the other unlessby remedying one and two of what i just gave you or the third one is trueprocess is flat now all this is very well but when youre taking case apart putting it back together again if your goal is to cure maladyif youre idiotic enough to use scientology to cure somebody of somethingyou are going to have probably the easiest run of it you ever heard of modern processes result in dropping somatics and that sort of thing with great rapidity youre running fellow over his head hell have new sickness every day new set of somatics if they were to be medically adjudicated and diagnosed would wind up in some of the most horrendous latinizing you ever heard of teeth hurt one day and his skull hurts the next day and hes got spears in his stomach the day after and his bones feel like theyre falling apart and terrible exhaustion exceeds the next day well of course for each one of these thingsunder terrible exhaustion well hes obviously short of iron and you get more melodymaladies than you could easily keep catalog of just in the line of processing if you processed somebody very badly over his head these maladies would be quite acute this is not important then health has nothing to do with the situation if you mean by health care of the body care of the body and thats just bunch of balderdash the only thing were interested inthe only thing were interested in is the continuing forward progress of the case is the case more and more capable and if you want to look at the reduction and not worry about whatnot worry about the capabilities of ots or anything else but just look at itwell is he more and more capable of being audited thats the shortest look thats very unreal look but its you know more and more capable of being audited if you just count case advance on the fact the case is easier and easier to audit why youll have it because why well that means the case is more and more responsive to exterior orders which is one of the things hes most allergic to the case is more and more capable of viewing his track and pictures the case is getting into less and less trouble the ease is more and more capable of locating bypassed charge all of these various capabilities show up in auditing sessions so if you wanted good yardstick that didnt strain your brains any on case advance well its justis the case more capable of being audited i mean that is not your end view but its certainly good yardstick for the auditor because if the case became more and more capable of being audited and responded better and better and better to auditing and was easier and easier and easier to audit youd find out theyre making faster and faster changes per session and youre getting more and more and more done per session youre having less and less and less trouble and thats good index and one of the ways of looking at it on case thats on long haul auditors get very dull to the progress of the case by the way they do this is one of the shortsightedness of auditors and one of the things that monitors processes and so forth you cant ever believe an auditor that process isnt working its not that hes being villainous or anything of the sort but hes looking at slow gradient and its just hes there hes auditing and the gradient is slow gradient ill give you trick for this this isitstheres nothing wrong with an auditor im not being critical of auditors at all its just something ive noticed as frailty that auditors have they dont notice that case is winning and gaining and they sometimes get impatient and want to do something more heroic or something of the sort they get to pushing and shoving and the case is already going along just gorgeously i have basic rule by the way i never change anything on cases auditing unless the pc squawks i find out i always squawk before the pc does i always get more impatient than the pc does so ill just give youjust short one to counter this particular fault in other auditors or in yourself how was this case month ago see and you can just say that in snide tone of voice and if guy says well iwell you look at it like that he couldnt get up the front steps something like this they remember that this case used to have fifteen arc breaks per session now only has one or sometimes goes whole session with none see case gains thats case gains in the direction of auditing and by the way that shortcuts lot of very fancy mental tests and case tests and all that sort of thing it just puts complete shortcut on the lot case auditing better all right there it is so much so that regardless of any other rule of auditing if case is proceeding satisfactorily and is very interested in what hes doing i wont disturb the case i wont do anything else see case is happy so on and the only objection ill have to this is sometimes i see process particularly newly started process and it hasnt produced any result for whole session and so forth and the pc seems to be happy with it i come off of it or the pc got some tone arm action on process and ran it quite successfully for session that in the very next session in spite of session ruds nothingi cant get that process to produce tone arm action again the pc is fairly happy with the process but im not but that of course is actions that you take in establishing processes how long does it take to establish process well thats quite interesting thats an interesting question how long is piece of string sometimes you wont establish the pcs level of processes for several sessions you keep hunting and punching around on case and all of sudden why the ease starts winning you get ta action everything is running you sit down for the long haul and you wait for that condition to cease to be ideal before you do anything else just keep on with it actually dont even pay too much attention to tone arm action so itsso for series of five sessions the tone arm actions bean minimal it was good it was good for quite while and then now its minimal for that many sessions and so forth i wouldnt do anything desperate with the case i wouldnt start tearing the case to pieces because he wasnt getting tone arm action i wouldnt pull case off single engram for instance let show you the reductio ad absurdum pc doesnt get tone arm action in the last half of the engram well soyou better not let him run that chain any more see that would be the most absurd type of thing you see that you could do pc got two divisions of tone arm action during the first half of the engram but didnt get any tone arm action during the last half of the engram so it must be the wrong engram see it could become idiotic with this you seeta action how long should you sit around and suffer with ta action well its an interesting question depends on the level of pc depends on what youre auditing and everything of the sort but if the pc is happy and youre running fairly highlevel process on the pc and youre getting tone arm action the worst i would suspect that you probably werent clipping the overt side of it or your brackets were out in some particular way see id blame it on flows and if after while iseveral sessionsi just didntwasnt anyplace with this and there wasnt any tone arm action but there had been and there should be tone arm action on the processid start adding in the arc process for instance id start adding another leg see just to make sure the pc for instance is answering it you know as what communication has not been acknowledged or something like this see well he apparently is always auditing it as his own communication that hasnt been acknowledged and hes stuck himself with flow here somehow or another well id just open up thethis isthe auditors always at liberty to add legs on process you see so id just open up my kit and id figure out how to word this process so what communication of yours has not been acknowledged and what communication of anothers has not been acknowledged you see something of that sort id open it up id have six command process not three you see and you can make that by the way into fifteencommand process but this would be rather unusual and youre getting rather ornate by doing so but id blame that pc seems to be happy pc seems to be getting results pc seems to be cognitingjust we dont have tone arm action and running engrams i wouldnt bust the pc out of an engram because they werent getting tone arm action in an engram thats nonsense id start worrying if the pc didnt get any tone arm action for couple of sessions and then the way i would worry is to park the chain that i was running and id find the overt of the same chain you see because thats another way of introducing flows overts flow outward motivators flow inward so good well lets run up alets run up an overt chain on this we dont care if its in the same date periods you might have the overt chain might be back there myafsplaffsprillionmillionbrodquadrillion hywangvonzillionzeeumzeeumzzmm years see and the chain youve been running is when they were in kindergarten in this life see we dont care about the disparity of dates but whether we are running overts or motivators whether we are running overts or motivators we of course are running with the same severe system of blocking out the engrams by chains dont you start departing from that systemi had too much trouble getting that system together youve got notes on what that system is and i intend to give you demonstration on it but ive been working out the exact commands ive got it down to the exact commands how do you like that you know exact commands interesting youve got this thing worked out to point where the pc can predict what the auditors going to say he feels more comfortable too the only thing you can get in trouble with is youre finding minor incidents inside major incident thats what you normally run into when the pc cant see well theres set of commands go with that too pc doesnt arrive at the beginning of the incident when told to do so use commands b c you say is the incident we have small part of major incident you get read on the meter see date the major incident by saying and so forth its very precise operation this engram running today and is only effective if it is precise and im finding out the precision of the running engrams by chains is adding to the pcs recall and precision on the track its quite interesting so when you start to run overts you run them exactly the same way except you ask for overt incidents which are the same type of thing and your chain is always characterized and you have tendency to jump that characterization if you dont watch yourself youre running the chain of sticking to mest see thats the chain youre running thats good long hefty one somebody around here the other day was asking for the first electronic they were running the chain of electronic incidents oh blow your brains out man the first electronic incident i dont think you could express it on this wall up here with microscopic set of zeros following 1 following from the top of the wall straight across next line one millimeter down from the last line clear on down to the bottom thetan is an electronic incident you have to be fairly careful what you ask for pc says well i dont know i seem to go into apathy every time i try to do anything to these people well lets see now you go start running the chain doing things to peoplethere were people in this universe when you arrived at some vast date back the mest body the physical meat body is one of the standard phenomena of this universe and so there you are youre going to run down the first time they ever did that well thats too much of bite for the pc thats all lets be more finite lets be more finite about it what are these people doing to you well theyre shooting at all right test it on the meter lets run back chain of shooting at people see q and there are uses to q and and thats one of them he isnt going to go back very far shooting at people thetans dont shoot at people hell run along bunch of wars or something like that but you take something that hes worried about and can reach and sometimes your ta action on running engrams is suddenlyits youve just bitten off more than you can chew youre running chain on holding still or youre running chain on being held still that would be even worse see well of course youre asking for bunch of still incidents well that in itself will give you stuck ta thats rather elementary if you were very very clever you could make engram runningif the pc could run engramsproduce almost any ta action you wanted you run stills you get ta action you run masses you get rising tone arm you get how you could throw the question all right lets run back to the first time you were afraid of mass see youre going to get nice rising tone arm so forth i dont know quite what causes low tone arm to tell you the truth because ive scouted it over few times but its some kind of negative avoidance type of mechanism of some kind or another but its something peculiar that you probably could throw ta negative you could probably throw it positive and you could probably run chain of pleasure moments as all the times you were clear youd probably produce clear you see just by running incidents when they were clear get this validated what you validate you produceto very marked degree you see with this exception you get them to confront what they dont want to confront and therefore the production of that then ceases to go on automatic dont you see but if you were giving limited run and werent trying really to run anything out but just giving everything limited run you could throw the case anyway you wanted to throw the case you could run the type of incident that would throw the case that way dont you see i know it sounds weird but you could that would be an improper way to run engrams because youre trying to run the chain that will make the pc snap and pop and make him into good shape so therefore you run what he can confrontalmost youre runningyoure upgraded his confront its just not quite he doesnt know about this and you find it for him on the meter but its real to him because it reads on the meter your best test of is it real to the pc is does it read on the meter i mean thats elementary now the combination of all these processes are based on the factors which ive given you in this lecture i dont know whether or not this data has any vast value to you or not in putting together processes im trying to give you some kind of an idea of the woof and warp of what makes up chart or scale or recommendation of you run reach and withdraw on this pc see the various things that go into this and how much youre expected to vary from that or not vary from that or something of the sort all these things go into action so it boils down to the fact that modern processes are built against the degree of withdrawal of the individual into himself and what process will lead the pc out from himself so that he longer feels so restricted about the thingnow thats the most basic action and that of course is found in reach and withdraw and i told fred the other day id run some of you on reach and withdraw from bulletinsbeen about knocking some of your heads offnot from the significance of the bulletin just from the bulletin see reach and withdraw from the bulletin in one case why just wrote the word scientology on card reach and withdraw from the word scientology just about knocked the students head off now that of course is literal see reach and withdraw see from something like this well the pervasiveness of these lowerscale processes is something which you as an auditor should have cognizance of you shouldnt go on expecting somebody to keep putting your foot in footprints all the time see somebodys walked this way and there it is you could have some knowledge of what makes process process see and why we have these processes and which way they tend to go and so forth we have just few basic classes of processes theres very few of these but each one matches its own levels of case and the total criteria of it is the case will respond under auditing to the processand thats the only criteria now of course you can always undercut case too seriously you take some bird thats perfectly capable of running engrams and you run reach and withdraw see oh im sure you can run reach and withdraw for long time this character can run reach and withdraw hes perfectly capable along this line he might even get change he might even get tone arm action but that isnt good enough reason so the one other factor that enters into itand this is where the art of the auditor is involved and its an artis getting some estimation of where the case must lie and upgrading the ease from that point and that requires some skill because you could run case too low and give him lose see and the way to do that is to always run case little steep see always run the case just little steeper than the case thinks it should be run the reaction of the ease to auditing as to whether or not the case arc breaks or protests or something like that has practically nothing to do with what you run on the case youll find some casesnow heres where you make your mistake on thisthe case will go yow yow yow yow yow you see look amongst that yow yow yow and find out if the case is executing the auditing command thats whats important it isnt whether the case is going yow yow yow you told the case to go to streensskrillion trillionkajillion years see and the case said god damn it you bypassed about eighty thousand incidents all in one bunch and so forth thats all he said and you as ayou look at this protest and you say immediately well the case hasnt done it and youll be surprised if you carry out your routine on almost muzzled basis you say what are you looking at you acknowledge what he said yes and what are you looking at youll find out that hes at eighty squillionkrintrillion sprinion years looking at this confounded cottonpicking camel who wants anything to do with this camel see and you get theyou get the whole notion on it because protest is the common denominator of the whole track in this universe and your case goes through phases of protest protest is probably more vital to case than duplicate its how he makes his pictures in the first place and theres terrific amount of technology mixed up in this thing called protest now the only level of processing which remains as wideopen level of processing is level 2 and im working very industriously at level 2 and making very good progress at level 2 how you amputate total time track you know ive made some good progress ive already found theoretical methodhavent tested it outbut i found theoretical method where you locate one point at the beginning of the incidentthis is very theoretical seeif you locate one point at the beginning of the incident you have the pcyou pass the pc through the incident once or twice so he knows what it is and you locate one point at the beginning of the incident have him pick up one consideration toward the beginning of the incident and the engram vanishes isnt that interesting i found it so but thats the subject of another lecture benefit by this one thank you very much
