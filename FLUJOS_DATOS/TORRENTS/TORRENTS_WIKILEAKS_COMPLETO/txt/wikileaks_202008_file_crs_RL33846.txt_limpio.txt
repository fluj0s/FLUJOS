yacobucci and jonathan l ramseur resources science and industry division greenhouse gas reduction capandtrade bills in the 110th congress summary multiple proposals to advance programs that reduce greenhouse gases have been introduced in the 110th congress s 2191 was reported may 20 2008 from the senate committee on environment and public works an amended version of s2191 s 3036 was considered by the senate in june 2008 but vote to invoke cloture failed in general these proposals would create marketbased greenhouse gas reduction programs along the lines of the trading provisions of the current acid rain reduction program established by the 1990 clean air act amendments this report presents sidebyside comparison of the major provisions of those bills and includes glossary of common terms appendix c although the purpose of these bills is to reduce greenhouse gases ghgs the specifics of each differ greatly five bills s 280 s 309 s 485 hr 620 and hr 1590 cap greenhouse gas emissions from covered entities at 1990 levels in the year 2020 s 317 places its first emissions cap at 2001 levels in 2015 s 1766 targets reductions at 2006 levels in 2020 s 2191 as reported would cap ghgs at about 19 below 2005 levels in 2020 hr 4226 would limit 2020 emissions to 85 of their 2006 levels hr 6186 would reduce emissions to 20 below 2005 levels by 2020 and hr 6316 would reduce emission to 20 below 1990 levels by 2020 ten bills s 280 s 317 s 485 s 2191 s 3036 hr 620 hr 1590 hr 4226 hr 6186 and hr 6316 would establish capandtrade systems to implement their emission caps in contrast s 1766 provides for two compliance systems cap andtrade program and an alternative safety valve payment and allows the covered entities to choose one or employ combination of both finally s 309 provides discretionary authority to the environmental protection agency epa to establish capandtrade program to implement its emission cap the differences continue with respect to entities covered under the programs three bills s 309 s 485 hr 1590 provide discretionary authority to epa to determine covered entities by applying costeffective criteria to reduction options in contrast s 317s emission cap is imposed solely on the electric generating sector the other bills s 280 s 1766 s 2191 s 3036 hr 620 hr 4226 hr 6186 and hr 6316 cover most economic sectors but not all eg they exclude the agricultural sector thus the overall reductions achieved by the bills depend partly on the breadth of entities covered beyond the basics of these bills each contains other important provisions for example s 280 creates new innovation infrastructure while several s 1766 s 2191 s 3036 hr 4226 hr 6186 and hr 6316 encourage foreign countries to undertake comparable control actions and specify potential consequences for inaction other provisions include mandatory greenhouse gas standards for vehicles s 309 s 485 hr 1590 and renewable portfolio standard for the electric generating sector s 309 s 485 hr 1590 this comparison should be considered guide to the basic provisions contained in each bill it is not substitute for careful examination of each bills language and provisions contents

comparison of key provisions of house greenhouse gas reduction bills 16 appendix c common terms 24 greenhouse gas reduction capandtrade bills in the 110th congress introduction climate change is generally viewed as global issue but proposed responses generally require action at the national level in 1992 the united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc which called on industrialized countries to take the lead in reducing the six primary greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 20001 for more than decade variety of voluntary and regulatory actions have been proposed or undertaken in the united states including monitoring of power plant carbon dioxide emissions improved appliance efficiency and incentives for developing renewable energy sources however carbon dioxide emissions have continued to increase in 2001 president george w bush rejected the kyoto protocol which called for legally binding commitments by developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions2 he also rejected the concept of mandatory emissions reductions since then the administration has focused us climate change policy on voluntary initiatives to reduce the growth in greenhouse gas emissions in contrast in 2005 the senate passed sense of the senate resolution on climate change declaring that congress should enact legislation establishing mandatory marketbased program to slow stop and reverse the growth of greenhouse gases at rate and in manner that will not significantly harm the united states economy and will encourage comparable action by other nations3 number of congressional proposals to advance programs designed to reduce greenhouse gases have been introduced in the 110th congress these have generally followed one of three tracks the first is to improve the monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions to provide basis for research and development and for any potential future reduction scheme the second is to enact marketoriented greenhouse gas reduction program along the lines of the trading provisions of the current acid rain reduction program established by the 1990 clean air act amendments the third 1 under the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc those gases are carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o hydrofluorocarbons hfcs perfluorocarbons pfcs and sulfur hexafluoride sf6 some greenhouse gases are controlled under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer and are not covered under unfccc 2 for further information see crs report rl30692 global climate change the kyoto protocol by susan r fletcher 3 samdt 866 passed by voice vote after motion to table failed 4354 june 22 2005 crs2 is to enact energy and related programs that would have the added effect of reducing greenhouse gases4 an example would be requirement that electricity producers generate portion of their electricity from renewable resources renewable portfolio standard this report focuses on the second category of bills for review of additional climate change related bills see crs report rl34067 climate change legislation in the 110th congress by jonathan l ramseur and brent d yacobucci proposed legislation in 110th congress in the 110th congress members have introduced 12 bills that include provisions to impose or permit some form of marketbased controls on emissions of greenhouse gases general descriptions of those bills follow beginning with s 2191 which was reported with amendments on may 20 2008 by the senate committee on environment and public works5 the major provisions of the seven senate bills are compared in appendix the major provisions of the five house bills are compared in appendix b s 2191 as introduced october 18 2007 by senators lieberman and warner would cap greenhouse gas emissions from the electric generation industrial and transportation sectors for facilities that emit more than 10000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent mtco2e as introduced the cap is estimated by the sponsors to reduce emissions to 15 below 2005 levels in 2020 declining steadily to 63 below 2005 levels in 2050 the program would be implemented through an expansive allowance trading program to maximize opportunities for costeffective reductions credits obtained from increases in carbon sequestration and acquisition of allowances from foreign sources could be used to comply with 30 of allowance requirements the bill would also establish carbon market efficiency board to observe the allowance market and implement costrelief measures if necessary for recent action on s 2191 and for modifications to the provisions see the next section s 3036 introduced by senator boxer on may 20 2008 is identical to the reported version of s 2191 except that s 3036 contains budget amendment aimed at making the bill revenueneutral this would entail devoting percentage of auction revenues increasing from 61 in 2012 to 1599 in 2031 and thereafter to offset budget deficits that are projected to occur due to the capandtrade program6 this bill was considered by the senate the week of june 2 2008 4 for discussions of relevant energy legislation see crs report rl34294 energy independence and security act of 2007 summary of major provisions by fred sissine and crs report rl33831 energy efficiency and renewable energy legislation in the 110th congress by fred sissine et 5 the bill was ordered reported december 5 2007 by an 118 vote 6 see cbo s 2191 americas climate security act with an amendment april 10 2008 at httpwwwcbogovftpdocs91xxdoc9120s2191pdf crs3 s 280 introduced january 12 2007 by senator lieberman would cap emissions of the six greenhouse gases specified in the united nations framework convention on climate change at reduced levels from the electric generation transportation industrial and commercial sectors sectors that account for about 85 of us greenhouse gas emissions the reductions would be implemented in four phases with an emissions cap in 2012 based on the affected facilities 2004 emissions for an entity that has single unit that emits more than 10000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent the cap steadily declines until it is equal to onethird of the facilities 2004 levels the program would be implemented through an expansive allowance trading program to maximize opportunities for costeffective reductions and credits obtained from increases in carbon sequestration reductions from noncovered sources and acquisition of allowances from foreign sources could be used to comply with 30 of reduction requirements the bill also contains an extensive new infrastructure to encourage innovation and new technologies s 309 introduced january 16 2007 by senator sanders would cap greenhouse gas emissions on an economywide basis beginning in 2010 beginning in 2020 the countrys emissions would be capped at their 1990 levels and then proceed to decline steadily until they were reduced to 20 of their 1990 levels in the year 2050 epa has the discretion to employ marketbased allowance trading program or any combination of costeffective emission reduction strategies the bill also includes new mandatory greenhouse gas emission standards for vehicles and new powerplants along with new energy efficiency performance standard the bill would establish renewable portfolio standard rps and new lowcarbon generation requirement and trading program s 317 introduced january 17 2007 by senator feinstein would cap greenhouse gas emissions from electric generators over 25 megawatts beginning in 2011 affected generators would be capped at their 2006 levels declining to 2001 levels by 2015 after that the emission cap would decline 1 annually until 2020 when the rate of decline would increase to 15 the allowance trading program includes an allocation scheme that provides for an increasing percentage of all allowances to be auctioned with 100 auctioning in 2036 and thereafter the cap andtrade program allows some of an entitys reduction requirement to be meet with credits obtained from foreign sources and variety of other activities specified in the bill s 485 introduced february 1 2007 by senator kerry would cap greenhouse gas emissions on an economywide basis beginning in 2010 beginning in 2020 the countrys emissions would be capped at their 1990 levels after 2020 emissions economywide would be reduced 25 annually from their previous years level until 2031 when that percentage would increase to 35 through 2050 the allowance trading system includes an allocation scheme that requires an unspecified percentage of allowances to be auctioned the bill also includes new mandatory greenhouse gas emission standards for vehicles along with new energy efficiency performance standard the bill would establish renewable portfolio standard rps increase biofuel mandates under the renewable fuels standard and mandate new infrastructure for biofuels finally the bill expands and extends existing tax incentives for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles and establishes manufacturer tax credit for advanced technology vehicle investment crs4 s 1766 introduced july 11 2007 by senator bingaman would set emissions targets on most of the countrys greenhouse gas emissions greenhouse gas emitting activities such as methane emissions from landfills coal mines animal waste and municipal wastewater projects along with nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural soil management wastewater treatment and manure management are not included under the targets although credits for use by covered entities are available or may be generated by verified ghg reductions in these areas beginning in 2012 covered entities would have emissions targets set at their 2006 levels in 2020 the emissions targets would decline steadily until 2030 when the emission target would be set at the entities 1990 levels compliance can be secured either through an allowance trading program or by paying safety valve price called technology accelerator payment or tap under the trading program allowances are allocated according to various categories including covered entities eligible facilities such as coal mines and carbonintensive industries states and sequestration activities initially 24 of all allowances are auctioned percentage that increases over time the tap is set at 12 metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent it increases 5 annually above the rate of inflation the bill also requires countries that do not take comparable action to control emissions to submit special allowances or their foreign equivalent to accompany exports to the united states of any covered greenhouse intensive goods and primary products hr 620 introduced february 7 2007 by representative olver is substantially modified version of s 280 using the same basic structure as s 280 the emission caps under hr 620 are more stringent reductions from affected sectors electric generation transportation industrial and commercial would be set at 2004 levels in 2012 and then steadily decline until the cap is equal to about one fourth of facilities 2004 levels although hr 620 permits affected entities to comply with the reduction requirements with credits from foreign sources sequestration and reductions from noncovered entities these credits are limited to 15 of the sources reduction requirement hr 1590 introduced march 20 2007 by representative waxman is similar to s 485 hr 1590 would cap greenhouse gas emissions on an economywide basis beginning in 2010 beginning in 2020 the countrys emissions would be capped at their 1990 levels after 2020 emissions economywide would be reduced by roughly 5 annually from their previous years level through 2050 when emissions levels would be capped at 80 below 1990 levels the allowance trading system includes an allocation scheme that requires an unspecified percentage of allowances to be auctioned the bill also includes new mandatory greenhouse gas emission standards for vehicles along with new energy efficiency performance standard the bill would also establish renewable portfolio standard hr 4226 introduced november 15 2007 by representative gilchrest is modified version of hr 620 using the same basic structure as hr 620 emission limitations are based on percentages of 2006 emission levels reductions from affected sectors electric generation transportation industrial and commercial would be set at 2006 levels in 2012 and then steadily decline until the cap is equal to about onefourth of facilities 2006 levels in 2050 the bill provides that the president may establish program to require importers to pay the value of ghgs emitted during the production of goods or services imported into the united states crs5 from countries that have comparable emission restrictions to those of the united states the programs requirement may not be imposed on countries until negotiations to achieve agreement on such restrictions have been attempted in addition the bill also establishes carbon market efficiency board to observe the allowance market and implement costrelief measures if necessary hr 6186 introduced june 4 2008 by representative markey would cap emissions from covered sources at 930 million mtco2e in 2050 of the longterm reduction targets in the capandtrade bills this is among the most stringent hr 6186 would auction 94 of its emission allowances in 2012 increasing to 100 by fy2020 almost 60 of the auction revenues would be distributed via tax credits and rebates to low and middleincome households the bill would direct epa to develop emission performance standards for noncovered entities which may include coal mines landfills wastewater treatment operations and animal feeding operations in addition new as defined in the bill coalfired power plants would be required to capture and geologically sequester not less than 85 of their co2 emissions within specified time frame hr 6316 introduced june 19 2008 by representative doggett would cap emissions from covered sources at 348 million mtco2e in 2050 of the longterm reduction targets in the capandtrade bills this is the most stringent in addition the bill would direct epa to develop regulations that prevent growth in emissions from noncovered entities hr 6316 would auction 85 of its emission allowances in 2012 increasing to 100 by fy2020 approximately 54 of the auction revenues would be distributed for consumer assistance of this allotment 66 would fund healthcare coverage program established by subsequent legislation the remainder would provide rebates and tax relief to low and moderateincome households domestic offsets and international allowances could combine to contribute up to 25 of covered sources allowance requirements similar to other bills carbon market efficiency board would observe the allowance market and implement costrelief measures if necessary the bill would also require countries that do not take comparable action to control emissions to submit special allowances or their foreign equivalent to accompany exports to the united states of any covered primary product legislative action in the 110th congress on may 20 2008 the senate committee on environment and public works subcommittee on private sector and consumer solutions to global warming and wildlife protection reported out revised version of s 2191 as reported from subcommittee s 2191 is estimated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 19 below 2005 levels by 2020 up from 15 as introduced and 63 below 2005 levels by 2050 the increase in the estimated reductions in 2020 is the result of amended text that includes greenhouse gases from all natural gas uses under the overall emissions cap other amendments approved included modifications to eligibility requirements for the advanced technology vehicles manufacturing incentive program and the advanced coal generation technology demonstration program modifications were also made to the proposed allocation of allowances to help tribal communities crs6 respond to climate change and to encourage international forest carbon activities along with 1 of allowances reserved for rural cooperatives and corresponding reduction in allowances allocated to the rest of the electric power industry the revised bill also added two new recipients of auction revenues bureau of land management emergency firefighting fund 300 million and forest service emergency firefighting fund 800 million on december 5 2007 the full committee ordered reported out revised version of s 2191 by an 11 to 8 vote the bill was reported by the committee on may 20 2008 srept 110337 the revised bill expands the greenhouse gas reduction program coverage by replacing the previous definition of covered facility based on the electric power transportation and industrial sectors with comprehensive upstream definition for oil refineries natural gas processing plants and downstream definition for coal consumers among the amendments agreed to by the full committee were new low carbon fuel standard lcfs that would require the carbon intensity of transportation fuel to be frozen in 2011 and then reduced by 5 in 2015 and 10 in 2020 other amendments agreed to would increase incentives for states to modify their utility regulatory structures to encourage energy efficiency and would broaden the ability of states to use their allowance allocations to mitigate adverse economic impacts resulting from the bills implementation as ordered reported s 2191s emissions cap is estimated by its sponsors to require 71 reduction from 2005 levels by 2050 from covered entities estimated by the sponsors to account for 87 of total us greenhouse gas emissions overall the sponsors estimate that s 2191 would reduce total us greenhouse gas emissions by up to 66 from 2005 levels by 2050 in april 2008 proposed amendment to s 2191 was submitted by the committee to the congressional budget office cbo to be included in the scoring of the bill the amendment would provide for some of the auctioned revenues to be put aside for deficit reduction purposes senator boxer introduced s 3036 on may 20 2008 this proposal combined the reported version of s 2191 with the revenueneutral amendment the senate considered s 3036 the week of june

lcfs by 2011 the lcfs freezes the perunitenergy lifecycle ghg emissions from transportation fuels at baseline based on 2005 data by 2023 the lcfs requires 5 reduction in lifecycle emissions below the fuel emission baseline this requirement is separate from any requirements under the capandtrade program crs24 appendix c common terms allocation schemes upstream and downstream regulatory approaches to allocating allowances as opposed to auction schemes can choose different points and participants along the production process to assign allowances and the resulting compliance responsibility upstream allocation schemes establish emission caps and assign allowances at production importation or distribution point of products that will eventually produce greenhouse emissions further down the production process for example in the natural gas sector emission caps could be established and allowances assigned at processing facilities where facilities and participants shrink from about 400000 wells and 8000 companies to 500 facilities and 200 companies in contrast downstream allocation schemes establish emission caps and assign allowances at the point in the process where the emissions are emitted in the case of the natural gas industry to achieve the same coverage as the upstream scheme this would involve assigning allowances to natural gasfired electric generators industry and even residential users thus some downstream proposals choose either to exempt certain sectors such as residential use from capandtrade program or to employ hybrid allocation scheme where some of the allowances are allocated upstream and others downstream such as the electric generators allowance an allowance is generally defined as limited authorization by the government to emit 1 ton of pollutant in the case of greenhouse gases an allowance generally refers to metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent although used generically an allowance is technically different from credit credit represents ton of pollutant that an entity has reduced in excess of its legal requirement however the terms tend to be used interchangeably along with others such as permits auctions auctions can be used in marketbased pollution control schemes in several different ways for example title iv of the 1990 clean air act amendments uses an annual auction to ensure the liquidity of the credit trading program for this purpose small percentage of the credits permitted under the program are auctioned annually with the proceeds returned to the entities that would have otherwise received them private parties are also allowed to participate second possibility is to use an auction to raise revenues for related or unrelated program for example the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi is exploring an auction to implement its public benefit program to assist consumers or pursue strategic energy purposes third possibility is to use auctions as means of allocating some or all of the allowances established under ghg control program obviously the impact that an auction would have on cost would depend on how extensively it was used in any ghg control program and to what purpose the revenues were expended banking although allowances are generally allocated on an annual basis most capandtrade programs do not require participants to either use the allowance that year or else lose it under many proposals allowances can be banked by the receiving participant or traded to another participant who can use or bank it to be used or traded in future year banking reduces the absolute cost of compliance by making annual emission caps flexible over time the limited ability to shift the crs25 reduction requirement across time allows affected entities to better accommodate corporate planning for capital turnover allow for technological progress control equipment construction schedules and respond to transient events such as weather and economic shocks bubble bubble is regulatory device that permits two or more sources of pollutants to be treated as one for the purposes of emission compliance capandtrade program capandtrade program is based on two premises first set amount of pollutant emitted by human activities can be assimilated by the ecological system without undue harm thus the goal of the capandtrade program is to impose ceiling ie an emissions cap on the total emissions of that pollutant at level below the assimilative capacity second market in pollution licenses ie allowances between polluters is the most costeffective means of reducing emissions to the level of the cap this market in allowances is designed so that owners of allowances can trade those allowances with other emitters who need them or retain bank them for future use or sale in the case of the sulfur dioxide program contained in the 1990 clean air act amendments most allowances were allocated free by the federal government to utilities according to statutory formulas related to given facilitys historic fuel use and emissions other allowances have been reserved by the government for periodic auctions to ensure market liquidity carbon tax carbon tax is generally conceived as levy on natural gas petroleum and coal according to their carbon content in the approximate ratio of 06 to 08 to 1 respectively however proposals have been made to impose the tax downstream of the production process when the carbon dioxide is actually released to the atmosphere in contrast to capandtrade program in which the quantity of emissions is limited and the price is determined by an allowance marketplace with carbon tax the price is limited and the quantity of emissions is determined by the participants based on the cost of control versus the cost of the tax coverage coverage is the breadth of economic sectors covered by particular greenhouse gas reduction program as well as the breadth of covered entities within covered sector emissions cap mandated limit on how much pollutant or greenhouse gases an affected entity can release to the atmosphere caps can be either an absolute cap where the amount is specified in terms of tons of emissions on an annual basis or ratebased cap where the amount of emissions produced per unit of output such as electricity is specified but not the absolute amount released caps may be imposed on an entity sector or economywide basis generation performance standard gps also called an outputbased allocation allowances are allocated gratis to entities in proportion to their relative share of total electricity generation in recent year grandfathering grandfathering generally refers an allocation scheme in which allowances are distributed to affected entities on the basis of historic emissions these allowances are generally distributed freeofcharge by the government to the affected entities grandfathering can also refer to entities that crs26 because of age or because they have met an earlier standard or other factors are exempted from new regulatory requirement greenhouse gases the six gases recognized under the united nations framework convention on climate change are carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o sulfur hexafluoride sf6 hydrofluorocarbons hfc and perfluorocarbons pfc hybrid program generally greenhouse gas reduction program that allows emitters to choose between complying with the reduction requirement of capand trade program or paying set price safety valve price to the government in lieu of making reductions leakage decreases in greenhouse gasrelated reductions or benefits outside the boundaries set for defining projects or programs net greenhouse gas impact resulting from mitigation activities for example emissions could be reduced in an area with greenhouse gas controls by moving an emitting industry to an area without such controls regrets policy regrets policy is one of establishing programs for other purposes that would have concomitant greenhouse gas reductions therefore only those policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions at additional cost are considered offsets offsets generally refer to emission credits achieved by activities not directly related to the emissions of an affected source examples of offsets would include forestry and agricultural activities that absorb carbon dioxide and reduction achieved by entities that are not regulated by greenhouse gas reduction program revenue recycling some greenhouse gas reduction programs create revenues through auctions compliance penalties or imposition of carbon tax revenue recycling refers to how program disposes of those revenues how program handles revenues received can have significant effect on the overall cost of the program to the economy safety valve devices designed to prevent or to respond to unacceptably high compliance costs for greenhouse gas reductions generally triggered by prices in the allowance markets safety valve approaches can include 1 set price alternative to making reductions or buying allowances at the market price 2 slowdown in tightening the emissions cap and 3 lengthening of the time allowed for compliance depending on the interplay between the emissions cap and safety valve and actual compliance costs safety valve can affect the integrity of the emissions cap sequestration sequestration is the process of capturing carbon dioxide from emission streams or from the atmosphere and then storing it in such way as to prevent its release to the atmosphere for other versions of this document see
