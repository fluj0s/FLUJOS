the economic uses to which wetland can be put the government has taken permanently or temporarily th wetland under the fifth amendment takings clause as background for continuing congressional efforts to reauthorize the federa l wetlands permitting program this report reviews the takings cas involving wetlands regulation we include not only fede ral wetlands permitting program cases but state ones as well inclusion of the latter seems particularly appropriate in light of th debate as to whether states should be given larger role in implementing the federal permitting program with the specter of state liability for takings for at least the last five years t here have been final reported court decisions finding takings of wetlands in either federal or state courts notwithstanding th influence of takings law on how wetlands programs are i mplemented and its relevance to future legislative efforts commends attention to the issue taking claim cannot proceed unless it is ripe eg unless there has been final decision by the regulator mere assertion of jurisdiction over wetland is rarely deemed final action however the wetland owner n eed not pursue government approvals or variances if doing so would be futile state appellate courts generally are more willing to accommodate regulato r concerns than the us court of federa l claims cfc and federal circuit and often have required total or neartotal deprivation of economic impact as prerequisite to finding taking as result the several cfc decisions during the 1990s finding taking on the basis of federal wetlands permit denials were not matched by similar trend in the state appellate courts two issues in the wetlands takings cases have been especiall pivotal first how to define the physical extent of property to be used in the taking analysis to gauge the impact of the governments action most parcels contain intermixed wetlands and uplands so that bar on development of the wetland leaves the entire parcel wit h sufficient economic use to defeat taking claim second what role is to be played by the fact that the wetlands scheme predates plaintiffs acquisition of the property several recent decisions have spurned takings actions on the ground that th preexistence of such scheme defeats legitimate development expectations other issues arising in the wetlands takings cases include how to attribute taking liability when more than one level of government is involved at the same wetland and whether postpermitdenial offers to purchase from speculators conservation groups or government agencies are proper evidence of the

takings the reason is simple enough while the need fo r wetlands preservation is widely conceded many are privately owned in the case of the federal wetlands permitting program almost 75 of the covered acreage in the lower 48 when wet land owner is denied permit to develop property or offered permit with very burdensome conditions its value may drop substantially even when permit is granted permit processing time or agency errors may on occasion impose costly development delays accounts of land owners aggrieved by wetlands regulation have been widely circulated by the property rights movement an d challenged by environmentalists the conflict as viewed by some is straightforward the benefits of wetlands preservation they argue water filtration wildlife habitat protection agains t flooding and erosion inure to the public by contrast the burdens of wetland s preservation in terms of development denied fall on the w etland owner the burden is enhanced because coastal regions lak fronts and riversides are especially coveted areas in which to build th public receives the benefits of wetlands without having to compensate the wetland owner others however assert that not only the public but the restr icted wetland owner too receives benefit from the regulatory scheme eg prevention of flooding through the comparable res trictions placed on other wetland owners these benefits should be regarded as offsetting the burdens imposed moreover they contend wetlands regulation should not be viewed as creation of public benefit but rather as avoidance of societal harm from the loss of the above wetlands functions it is bad public policy they argue to compensate landowners for not inflicting injury1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30423crs2 there are more takings challenges to the

interpreting the takings clause of the us constitution and similar clauses in state constitutions while complex and often vague its precepts share simple goal to ascertain when government so severely interferes with private property rights that it shoul d compensate the property owner for the taken value before court can reach property owners taking claim however severa l threshold hurdles have to be surmounted has the statute of limitations expired is the taking claim ripe for example has the government agency rendered fina l decision should federal court facing challenge to state or local landus regulati on abstain deferring to state tribunal was the plaintiff the owner of th tract when the alleged taking occurred once these and other matters are resolved in plaintiffs favor and only then the court can proceed to the taking issue in the case there are at least two types of takings physical and regulatory physical takin gs may occur when the government effects physical invasion of private land as by backup waters from government dam regulatory takings may occur when government severely restricts the use to which property may be put many observers recog nizing the distinct body of law the supreme court has developed would define third type of taking when an exaction condition on issuance of development permit is unrelated in its goal or degree of burden imposed to the impact of the proposed development when government regulation of private wetlands raises taking issue i t almost always will be of the regulatory taking variet the supreme court canon for7 recognizing regulatory takings divides into two approaches first there are per s rules defining circumstances that constitute automatic takings if exceptions do not apply in the wetlands context the only important per rule has been the tota l taking rule of lucas v south carolina coastal council the lucas total takin g8 rule holds that go vernment action eliminating all economic use of land is necessarily taking if the barred use was not prohibitable under background principles ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30423crs4 another per rule of takings law has never been exclusively relied on to find a9 wetlands taking in the rare case where it has been invoked and found violated this is th dueprocesslike rule of agins v city of tiburon 447 us 255 260 1980 declaring that government action effects taking if among other things it fails to substantially advance legitimate government interest 447 us 255 260 1980 the court there stated that land use regulation effects10 taking if i t denies an owner economically viable use of his land explanation wa s provided by the court as to how this test related to the multifactor penn central test announced just two years before 438 us 104 197811 see text accompanying notes 818412law existing when the property was acquired an earlier formulation of lucas in9 agins v city of tiburon is often cited by state courts in lieu of lucas 10 the second approach applies wh the government action does not come under per rule for present purposes when its impact falls short of lucas total taking this approach consists of multifactor balancing test first announced by the court in penn central tr ansportation co v city of new york the factors in this11 test are the economic impact of the government action the extent to which i t interferes with reasonable investmentbacked expectations and its character application of these factors is factintensive and ad hoc critics say unprincipled by definition plaintiff able to fit the challenge d government action within per rule wins hisher case if exceptions apply and is genera lly compensated thus wetlands owners often assert lucas total taking as their opening salvo plaintiffs relegated to the penn central balancing test typically lose though recen t developments in prominent federal wetlandstaking case portend change here12 ii the historic pendulum in wetlandstakings case law comparin g the history of regulatory takings decisions involving state and local wetlands programs with that of case law on the federal program one discovers common feature each displays distinct point in time when the relevant court s shifted sharply in how they balanced the benefits and burdens of wetland s preservation as crude generalization not without exception stateprogram cases shifted toward greater defer ence toward government federalprogram cases toward less cases involving state and local wetlands programs 1960s and early 1970s this first generation of wetlands takings cases saw state courts respond sympathetically to the aggrieved wetlands owner probably because the public goals of the new wetlands statutes were contrary to prevailing attitude s about such ecosystems typical of

the question of whether the gover nment action is ultra vires typically the ultra vires or otherwise erroneous status of government act is seen by stat courts as irrelevant to whether taking occurred economic return source of confusion is whether projects economic return during the restricted period should play role in taking analysis the better view is that when restriction is plainly temporary at the time imposed the absence of any economi c use during the period of restriction reasonably limited is not material one reason is that supreme court takings cases rejecting the physical segmentation of property in takings analysis can be read to disfavor as well narrow focus on the restricte d segment of time another reason is that the strong likelihood of future economic126 use when the restriction is lifted supports present economic value where on the127 other hand the development restriction is of presumptively indefinite duration such as permit denial on the merits the

relevant parcel the parcel as whole conundrum is pervasive in the wetlands takings cases quite often for example tract consists of both restricted wetlands and unrestricted still developable uplands or the permit is denied fo r some but not all of the wetland on the parcel the relevant parcel issue requires court to ask whether th developable portion should be counted in the taking analysis the

nventory maps made available by the us fish and wildlife service but only as way to give quick estimate of whether lands will be regulated by contrast state programs that proactively off er wetlands

approach to minimize postpurchas surprise although there is obviously an added cost see generally association of stat continuedregulatory program be considere d with regard to longdelayed development efforts made by the property owner after such events162 another issue is whether the land owners sophistication about regulator restrictions on property should play role in noticerule cases in many of th wetlandstakings cases the cfcfederal circuit have buttressed the chronolog regulation preceded acquisition by stressing that plaintiff often developer wa s knowledgeable as to the possibility of future restrictions andor expressl acknowledged when buying the property that permits would be difficult to obtain163 at the ve ry least the existence of plaintiff sophisticated in matters of land us regulati on makes it easier for the court to charge plaintiff with constructiv knowledge of the relevant scheme advisability of an absolute rule some observers argue that an absolute rule disabling takings claims in ever instance where regulation predates purchase is unfair for one thing the regulatory landscape and the definition of wetland may evolve after the wetland is bought in ways unforeseeable at time of purchase this factor alone they argue makes i t inequita ble to reject takings claims as hardandfast rule where the wetland wa s bought after some sort of wetlands preservation program was on the books eve n when the definition of wetland has not changed over the relevant time span th judgmental leeway in applying the d efinition can leave buyers unclear as to

contingencies leading to restricted development of that land would in fac t occur some property rights partisans would go much further arguing that th concept of expectations should be dropped from takings jurisprudence entirely i n this view the buyer of property acquires all rights that the seller had regardless f changes in the legal landscape since the seller acquired the property the counterarguments supporting an absolute foreclosure of takings claim s based on preacquisition regime are not without force surely it might b contended the development expectations on given parcel have become mor qualified since the first settler took ownership perhaps centuries ago property rights evolve and change in regulatory demands over time are near certainty and does not any discount in the price paid for parcel due to the presence of wetlands reflect in an efficient market the purchasers gamble that wetlands regulations will impose roadblocks if so should the government have to rescue the purchaser through compensation when the wager turns out unfavorably possible developer responses to notice rule two ways have been suggested for wetlands buyers to bypass the notice rule one way is to have the seller submit the development applicat ion if the sellers title predates the wetlands regulatory reg ime after the permits are obtained the property is convey ed to the buyerdeveloper another way is to use contingency contracts under which the developer agrees to buy only if h eshe can obtain the needed permits x intergovernmental issues liability attribution and

attribution which government entity is responsible for taking when two or mor governmen ts play role in restricting the wetlands use for example who pay s when permission to fill the wetland is denied

part explain why few states have assumed responsibility for the federal section 404 program within thei r borders possible support for t his view is found in recent court decision in which165 delegated state michigan initially offered the 404 applicant very limited permit designed to satisfy federal epa concerns the applicant rejected most of the permit and filed taking action against the state the state then issued stateonly permit with relatively few limitations in effect notifying the wetland owner that any further quarrel it had was with the united states not the state166 the few cases to wrestle with liability attribution questions so far suggest that when the defendantgovernment s action is truly coerced absolution will be granted thus state court granted countys motion to be dismissed as party to taking case since the county had acted to restrict the wetland owner under the direction and control of the state that is had acted as the states agent by contrast where167 city prohibited deve lopment on beachfront lots under an ordinance that it had been authorized but not required by the state to adopt the city rather than the state was the proper defendant168 arguably the denial of federal wetlands permit based on prior state denials is an instance that falls in between the foregoing cas of direction and direction on the one hand the clean water act and
