developing countries point to the large number of chronically hungry people in the world as evidence of the need for food aid the united nations food and agricu lture organization fao estimates that there are more than 850 million people in the world who are chronically hungry2 these people lack the food that they woul d need to lead active and healthy lives fao points out however that the amount of food aid that has been provided an average of about 10 million metric tons pe r year from all donors would make barely dent in global hunger3 the average annual total vol ume of food aid is equivalent to about 2 of world grain trade and ss than 05 of world grain production if all the food aid in the world were di stributed evenly among the 850 million hungry people fao calculates it would provide onl about 12 kilograms of grain per person per year clearly fao concludes the amount of food aid that has been provided is not enough to make dent in chronic hunger there is broad agreement that food ai d provided for emergency relief is valuable tool for ensuring basic nutritional needs in times of humanitarian crisis earthquakes hurricanes droughts wars et c and is credited with saving millions of lives4 growing share of global food aid is provided as emergency aid which according to fao accounts for onethird to onehalf of total global food aid usaid reports that in fy2006 more than 70 of us food aid title ii was provided as emergency aid in addition fao says the timely delivery of food aid in emergency situations can relieve the pressure on poor people to sell s carce productive assets thus enabling them to resume normal live lihoods when the crisis passes but even in emergency situations other ways to able people to get the food they need such as providing cash vouchers for the poor to purchase food on local markets may be preferable to inkind food aid from overseas5 while food aid can contribute to reducing chronic food insecurity it alone is not

million per year combining food aid with other nonfood cash and inkind resources to ensure that it has an impact beyond just feeding people the united states is the only internati onal food aid donor that makes all of its food aid contributions in the form of commodities other major donors have different food aid policies most food aid provided by the european union the worlds second largest food aid provider is purchased in developing countries the eu has transformed its food aid policy into food security policy with food aid being restricted to humanitarian crises and longer used to support development activities7 canada the worlds third largest provider of food aid since 2005 allows up to 50 of its food aid to be purchased locally or regionally most other food aid donors make their contributions for food ai d in the form of cash donations for the purchase of commodities by the world food program which the wfp then distributes primarily as emergency food aid timeliness and cost of emergency food aid time delays in shipping commodities from the united states can prevent rapid response to emergencies and create problems later when commodities arrive estimates are that it can take from three to five months for commodities shipped from us ports to reach emergency destinations such delays make it difficult to get food to pe ople especially when there is ra pid onset of food n eed as in the 2004 asian tsunami or more recently in respon to food emergencies in east africa when commodities arrive late they may longer be needed or if distributed may disrupt local markets in an effort to expedite arrivals usaid has been pre positioning commodities in ports nearer to where the emergencies are occurring pl 480 legislation permits prepos itioning of commodities but the current legislation limits the amount of funds that can be spent on prepositioning8 the costefficiency of delivering food co mmodities is affected by transportation costs and by the requirement that some portion of us food aid be shipped on us flag vessels cargo preference transportation costs are high according to usaid and usda budget data in fy2006 55 of th funds allocated to pl 480 title ii 930 million out of 17 billion went to cove r transportation costs including both ocean freight and internal shipping handlin g and transportation ocean freight rates vary from year to year but paying such costs is one reason why the administration in its farm bill proposals and in recent budg et submissions has called for allocating some portion of funds available to p l 480 title ii to purchase commodities in locations closer to where they are neede d this proposal is discussed below httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34145crs7 9 see government accountability office cargo preference requirements

other concessional fi nancing arrangements be shipped on privately owned usregistered vessels maritime interests generally support cargo preference but opponents argue that it in creases the costs of shipping us commodities to poor countries and poten tially reduces the volume of food aid provided government accountability ffice gao report found that shipments of food aid on usflag vessels did little to meet the cargo preference laws objective of helping to maintain us merchant marine and that cargo preference requirements adversely affect operations of the food aid pr ograms chiefly by raising the cost of ocean transportation and reduc ing the volume of commodities that can be shipped9 the us department of transpor tation dot which reimburses food aid agencies for the costs of cargo preference maintains however that its reimbursements appr opriately and expeditiously compensate for the costs of using us vessels dot maintains that cargo preference has minimal if any impact on the amount of food aid available10 monetization and additional cash resources pl 480 provision section 203 first included in the food security act of 1985 pl 99198 allows pvos and coopera tives to sell percentage of donated pl 480 commodities in the recipient country or in countries in the same region the currency generated by these sales can then be used to finance internal transportation storage or distribution of commodities to implement development projects or to invest and with the interest earned to finance distribution costs or projects under section 203 pvos or cooperatives are pe rmitted to monetize ie sell for local currencies or dollars an amount of commod ities equal to not ss than 15 of the total amount of commodities distributed in any fiscal year in country many of the organizations that rely on sales of us food aid commodities to finance development projects support m onetization as their major source of development finance estimates are that almost 70 of pl 480 title ii development food aid commodities provi ded to pvos and cooperatives is monetized11 that such large proportion of us food aid commodities is monetized is cited as evidence of great need fo r cash to carry out development projects implemented by the p vos and cooperatives httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34145crs8 12 careusa white paper on food aid policy june 6 2006 available at

more than 10 shall be made available to eligible organizations in establishing new programs or meeting specific administrative management personnel and inte rnal transportation and distribution costs such funds may not be used for such ex penses as technical assistance training or projectre lated materials however some pvos have begun to question th use of monetization as source of funds care which has been supporter of monetization in the past has decided to transition out of monetization over the next two years according to care monetization is managementint ensive costly fraught with legal and financial risks and economically inefficient as care notes in its food aid policy paper purchasing food in the us shipping it overseas and then selling it to generate funds for food security programs is far less costeffective than the logical alternative simply providing cash to fund food security programs12 echoing criticisms of commodity food aid heard in wto doha round negotiations discussed below care notes that when monetization invol ves openmarket sale of commodities to generate cash which is almost always the case it inevitably causes commercial displacement as such it can be harmful to traders and local farmers and undermine the development of local markets and be detrimental to longerterm food security objectives catholic relief services crs has taken similar position with respect to monetization but has not announ ced phaseout of monetization13 monetization has its supporters among the pvos and cooperatives that implement development projects that us food aid supporters maintain that monetization can have multiple benefits particul arly in lowincome countries that depend on imports to meet food needs in such circumstances monetization supporters say can compensate for limite d liquidity or limited access to credit for international purchases of f ood other benefits of monetiz ation cited include its use to increase smallscale traders participation in local markets and financial systems and its use to control urban price spikes furthermore supporters say monetized commodities can be integrated into agricultural processing operations helping to establish feed mills fortifie d foods or other locally im portant products in all such cases proponents maintain m onetization programs should be subject to market analysis required in pl 480

aid has been considered under the rubric of export competition with some us tradin g partners alleging that the united states has used food aid to circumvent its export subsidy reduction commitments and that food aid displaces commercial sales the ited states has for the most part argued for continuation of commodity food ai d while the european union has proposed that food aid be subject to

united states will make parallel reductions in food aid and export credit guarantees us pvos who monetize inkind food aid commodities to fi nance projects in developing countries are concerned that new wto disciplines aimed at preventing commercial displacement could severely limit their ab ility to do development work other us pvos that have made extensive use of monetization however have indicated that they will begin to phase out monetiza tion as source of funding for their development projects some agreement was reached on how to curb the export subsidy aspects of food aid at doha round negotiating session in hong kong in december 200515 negotiators agreed to establish safe box for emergency food aid to ensure there would be impediment to dealing with em ergency situations without deciding on details negotiators agreed in principle th at disciplines would be established for inkind food aid and monetization so as to eliminate any displacement of commercial sales by food aid most recently the chairperson of the ag riculture negotiations in the doha round circulated draft of possible modalities for agriculture16 in the context of negotiations on food aid m odalities would include unde rstandings and rules or guidelines for how food aid programs would be carried out by wto member countries the wto stresses that the dr aft modalities are not proposals but rather are the negotiations chairpersons judgement of what wto members might be able to agree based on what they have pr oposed and debated in the seven years of negotiations17 the draft modalities for food aid include several general propositions these are that food aid should be provided on needsdriven basis and in fully grant form not tying food aid trans actions to commercial agricultural or other exports nor linking food aid to market development objectives of donor wto members and prohibiting the commercia l reexportation of food aid commoditieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34145crs10 18 the

subject to challenge if there has been declaration of emergency by the recipient country or the secr etarygeneral of the united na tions or if there has been an appeal for emergency ai d from country or from relevant agency such as the world food program and if needs assessment has been undertaken by relevant agency for nonemergency food aid the draft m odalities provide that such aid would be based on an assessment of need by an identified multilateral third party organization targeted to wellidentif ied vulnerable populati on group and provided to address specific developm ental objectives or nutritiona l requirements the draft modalities report says that monetization shall either be prohibited except or permissible where it is necessary to fund activities that are dir ectly related to the delivery of food aid to the recipient or for the procurement of agricultural inputs further such monetization would be carried out under the auspices of relevant agency and the recipient government food aid legislative proposals the administration and two groups of pvos and cooperativ that carry out food aid programs have made recommendations for legislative changes in farm

in the 110th congress hr 1616 mcgovern and s 946 durbin hr 1616 attr acted more than 100 cosponsors the administrations proposal for local or regional purchase for emergency food aid high transportation costs and lengthy delays before us commodities arrive at their destinations in emergency situati ons prompted the administration to propose that the administrator of usaid be given the authority to use up to 25 of the funds available for pl 480 title ii to purchase commodities in locations closer to where they are needed18 the rationale for this proposed new authority is that it would increase the timeliness and effectivene ss of the us response to food aid emergencies by eliminating the need to transport commodities by ocean carriers according to the administrations proposal savings achieved in transportation and distribution costs would be available for additional commodity purchases thus increasing the overall level of the us res ponse to emergencies local or regional purchases would also shorten the time it take s to get food supplies to where they are needed httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34145crs11 19 see for example us inte rnational food assistance programs issues

purchases of commodities in food crises the senate report srept 109266 accompanying the fy2007 agriculture appropriations bill explicitly rejected this proposal sta ting that the committee does not agree with the administrations proposal to shift up to 25 of the public law 480 title ii program level to usaid to be used for direct cash purchases of commodities and other purposes proponents of local or regional purchase argue that it would mean quicker and lowercost delivery of food nd be less likely to disrupt receiving country markets19 proponents admit that there would be some ri sks if local markets are unable to absorb large increases in food demand that local purchases could represent the quality of local food products and ability to transpor t food locally are also potential

affairs committee on may 24 2007 both statements are available on the alliance website less expensive than shipments directly from donor countries21 an estimated 60 of all food aid from all donors is cally or regionally procured22 proposals of the alliance for food aid the alliance for food aid an organiza tion that represents 15 pvos and cooperatives that operate food aid projects in developing and transition countries has made number of proposals for legislativ changes in us food aid programs23 alliance member organizations use us food aid commodities which they often monetize or sell primarily to carry out such nonemerge ncy or development projects as motherchild health clinics agricu ltural development projects food for work projects eg food as payment for work on community infrastructure projects and projects that target hivaids affected communities key recommendation of the alliance is the establishment of safe box for nonemergency food aid which would ensu re that 12 million metric tons of non emergency food aid commodities would be available to pvoscoops each year this volume of commodities would not be subject to waiver by the administrator of usaid as is provided under current law mandates such as this one especially without the possibility of waiver have ge nerally been resisted by usaid the title iiadministering agency usaids argument is that such mandates deny the agency flexibility especially in responding to em ergency food needs the administrations fy2007 budget request for pl 480 food aid included proposal to eliminate the requirement in current law that 75 of title ii comm odities be allocated to non emergency food aid programs the exis ting nonemergency comm odity mandate has not been met in recent years figure 2 this has been source of concern for pvoscooperatives who depend on food aid commodities to carry out nonemergency or development projects the alliance for food aid also recomm ends that cash now made available under section 202e of pl 107171 be ra ised to 10 and that pvoscooperatives be allowed to use such funds not only for operational and ad ministrative purposes provided in current law but also for the costs of development projects current law provides that between 5 nd 10 of title ii funds can be used for administrative and operational expense in c onnection with food aid progra ms also the alliance proposes that such funds be used by ligible organizations to improve needs assessments and monitoring and reporting on the effects of monetization and other aspects of food aid programs increasin g the cash available and broadening the purposes for which it can be used would the alliance maintains enable food aidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34145crs13 organizations to substitute cash for monetization in carrying out development projects where monetization is not appropriate despite calling for more cash to be made available for nonemergency programs the alliance stresses its continued support for monetization w here appropriate based on market analysis the alliance also calls for changes in current law regarding the emerson trust in order to make it more reliable tingency for food aid emergencies one rationale for making changes in the trust is to enable it to respond in more timely manner to emergencies in addition th alliance wants to make emerson trust commodities more available so that nonem ergency food aid would not be shifted to emergency relief to accomplish these ims the alliance suggests increasing the amount of pl 480 title ii funds that can be used for beht reimbursements from 20 million per year as provided in curre nt law to 60 million per year this funding would be made ava ilable annually until the trust reached its maximum level of 4 million metric tons or the dollar equivalent the alliance contends that the trust should be replenished with funds ra ther than commodities so that the most appropriate commodities can be procured when needed currently the trust holds only wheat which is not always the most needed commodity in emergency situations the alliance does not endorse the admin istrations proposal for local or regional purchase of commodities for emerge ncy food relief it does however call for pilot local purchase project to ssure that accepted practices of food aid program are followed and to identify futu re methodologies and best practices for future programs neither does the alliance endorse legislation introduced in the 110th congress to substantially increase f unding for the mcgoverndole program instead it calls for making available an appropriation of not less that 100 million annually so that funds would be av ailable for multiyear programs 0200400600800100012001400160018002000 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997

at httpwwwcrsorgnewsroomspeechestestimonyentrycfmid838proposals of catholic relief services care mercy corps and save the children group of four pvos joined together for the purpose of making common set of recommendations for legislative ch ange in us food aid programs24 these four organizations were formerly members along with current alliance members of group that called itself the coalition for food aid the four pvos differed with other coalition members over the role of monetization in nonemergency development food aid projects the group of four pvos has decided generally to phase out the use of monetization in thei r food aid projects while alliance members argue for the continued utility of monetization both as source of finance for projects and as tool to help build local food marketing capacity as an alternative to monetization the four pvos propose incr easing the amount of cash that would be available to pl 480 title ii programs the group of four pvos makes three main recommendations for legislative chan ges in us food aid programs first the group calls for changes in the emerson trust that would make it in its view more effective mechanism for re sponding to emergency food needs to accomplish this these pvos call for automatic first use of the beht when title ii emergency resources have been exhauste d in given year the group also proposes that the resources available for emergency food aid be increased to 50 of title ii one rationale for using the emerson trust in this way is to protect resources for non emergency development programs the gr oup of four pvos proposes the following changes in the beht 1 liquidate the current stocks in the trust so that it will hold only cash 2 allow the commodity credit corporation ccc to invest the cash in the trust in conservative shortterm instruments for an appropriate return 3 require the administration to use the emerson trust once title ii emergency funding allocati ons have been made to avoid the need to use development food aid to fund emergency responses and 4 provide authority to the ccc to automatically replenish the trust in fiscal year second the group of four pvos calls fo r establishing bridging mechanism to ensure that there are funding breaks in the food aid pipeline the bridging mechanism would consist of authority for the administrator of usaid to draw on ccc funds to contract for commodities and freight to meet programming needs in the next fiscal year prior to the actual enactment of an appropriation the ccc would be reimbursed promptly from the title ii appropriation when it becomes available the group argues that such bridging mechanism would avoid small scale commodity purchases and shipments that ccur early in the year which push up both commodity and freight costs and generally force pvos to scale back or stretch outhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34145crs15 program resources to try to minimize harm to participants enrolled in planned or approved programs the main issue raised by proposals such as these is cost using ccc funds to finance the operations of the beht or to establish bridging mechanism as described by the group of four pvos w ould be subject to payasyougo budget rules which means that any increase in mandatory spending that resulted from reforms of the beht would have to be offset by reduced mandatory spending elsewhere or with increased revenues the third proposal from the group of four pvos is to make more cash available to pvos through t itle ii this gr oup argues that cash would provide greater flexibility in carrying out programs to figh t world hunger it maintains that the real causes of food insecurity and hunger cannot be solved over the long term by the provision of food aid alone and that additi onal resources in the form of cash are essential to address the hunger problem like the alliance the group of four focuses on section 202e cash but unlike the alliance it calls for substantially increasing the funds available from 202e for both prog ram operations and program costs to not less than 25 of funds available to title ii the group of four also calls for using authorizing language patterned after that in the mcgoverndole food for education and child nutrition program the legislative authorization for mcgoverndole the group notes allows for mix of commoditie s cash and technical assistance to carry out its programs strength of such authorizing language according to the four pvos is that it discourages implementing organizations from monetizing commodities because it is much easier nd more cost effective to use cash congressional action title iii of the house and senatepassed versions of the farm b ill reauthorizes and amends us internationa l food aid programs title iii in both b ills extends these programs through 2012 the bills selectiv ely incorporate recommendations of the pvoscooperatives for food aid program chan ges the house bill disregards the one food aid

funds for pilot program for local or regional purchase of emerge ncy food aid commodities pl 480 the house bill extends the pl 480 food aid programs through 2012 and authorizes discretionary appropriations for pl 480 title ii humanitarian donations of 25 billion annually if appropriated that amount would represent very substantial increase over the 12 billion appr opriated annually in

food aid but considerably less than proposed by the group of four pvos that sought substantially increased cash resources for food aid development projects the senate version of title iii also reauthorizes pl 480 food aid programs and extends the minimum tonnage requirements fo r title ii through 2012 in contrast to hr 2419 the senate bill does not increase th appropriation for title ii the senate bill increases the share of title ii funds th at can be used to cover projectrelated expenses of pvos to not less than 75 nonemergency development food aid the housepassed bill stipulates that of the funds made ava ilable for title ii not less than 450 million annually be made availa ble for nonemergency development food aid this minimum level of nonemergenc assistance could not be waived unless requested by the administrator of usaid followe d by enactment of law approving the administrators request the senate bill establishes minimum of 600 million for development food aid that also would not be subject to waivers following passage of the housepassed bill the office of management and budget in its statement of administrative policy said that it strong ly opposed this provision because it would deprive the administration of the ability to quickly waive it in an emergency omb estimated that this house bill provisi on would result in 100 million decrease in emergency food aid local or regional purchase for emergency food aid the house passed farm bill disregarded the administrations sole fa rm bill food aid proposal for legislative authority to allocate up to 25 of title
