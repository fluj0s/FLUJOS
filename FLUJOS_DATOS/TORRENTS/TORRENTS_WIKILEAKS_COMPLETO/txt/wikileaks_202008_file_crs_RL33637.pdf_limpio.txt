current authorization while continuing congressional oversight of these issues this report summarizes the provisions of hr 5825 as passed by the house of representatives in the 109th congress6 and discusses the impact of its provisions were similar legislation to be enacted on current law the sections of the bill are addressed in the order in which they appear in the bill sec 2 fisa definitions sec 2 of the bill amends several of the current definitions in the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa agent of foreign power sec 2a amends defin ition of agent of foreign power in subsection 101b1 50 usc 1801b17 to add new category covering any person otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33637crs5 7 continued the conduct of such activities or knowingly conspires with any person to engage in such activities or c who engages in internationa l terrorism or activities in preparation for international terrorism 8 under section 101i of fisa 50 usc 1801 i united states person is defined to mean citizen of the united states an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence as defined in section 101a20 of the immigration and nationality act 8 usc 1101a20 an unincorporated association substantial number of members of which are citizens of the united states or aliens lawf ully admitted for permanent residence or corporation which is incorporated in the ited states but does not include corporation or an association which is foreign power as fined in subsection a1 2 or 3 of this section under the crossreferenced s ections foreign power means foreign government or any component thereof whether or not recognized by the united states faction of foreign nation or nations not subs tantially composed of united states persons or an entity that is openly acknowledged by foreign government or governments to be directed and controlled by such foreign gove rnment or governments it does not include international terrorist organizations 9 under current law subsection 101 l of fisa 50 usc 1801l defines wire communication to mean any communication while it is being carried by wire cable or other like connection furnished or operated by any person engaged as common carrier in continuedthan united states person8 who d is reasonably expected to possess control transmit or r eceive foreign intelligence informati on while such person is in the united states provided that the official ma king the certification required by section 104a7 deems such foreign intelligence info rmation to be significant unlike the definitions of agent of foreign power in subsections 101b1a and 101b1b of fisa but like the socalled lone wolf provision in subsection 101b1c of fisa the definition of an agent of foreign power under proposed subsection 101b1d does not require th at the nonus person covered by this new definition have any connection with foreign power however it differs from the latter provision in that under proposed subsection 101b1d reasonable expectation that nonus person will possess foreign intelligence information without more appears sufficient for that pe rson to be categorized as an agent of foreign power in additi on under the pr oposed new definition nonus person who is reasonably expected to control transmit or receive foreign intelligence information while in the united states would also be considered an agent of foreign power the proposed definition does not appear to require an action or intent to act for the benefit of foreign power or against the interests of the united states nor does it require any ill intent this would seem to significantly broaden the reach of the term so defined electronic surveillance sec 2b amends the definition of ectronic surveillance in subsection 101f of fisa 50 usc 1801f to mean 1 the installation or use of an electronic mechanical or other surveillance device as defined in subsection 2d of the bill new subsection 101 l of fisa 50 usc 1801 l9 for acquiring information by intentionally directinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33637crs6 9 continued providing or operating such facilities for th transmission of interstate or foreign communications under the new definition of surveillance device in sec 2d of hr 5825 the term would mean device that allows surveillance by the federal government but excludes any device that extracts or anal yzes information from data that has already been acquired by the federal government by lawful means while the term surveillance device is not currently defined in fisa it is used in the current definition of electronic surveillance under subsection 101f of fisa 50 usc 1801f 10 under current law electronic surveillance is defined under subsection 101f of fisa 50 usc 1801f to mean 1 the acquisition by an electronic mech anical or other surveillance device of the contents of any wire or radio co mmunication sent by or intended to be received by particular known united stat person who is in the united states if the contents are acquired by intentionally targeting that united states person under circumstances in which person s reasonable expectation of privacy and warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes 2 the acquisition by an electronic mech anical or other surveillance device of the contents of any wire communication to or from person in the united states without the consent of any party thereto if such acquisition occurs in the united states but does not include the acquisiti on of those communications of computer trespassers that would be permissi ble under section 25112i of title 18 3 the intentional acquisition by an elec tronic mechanical or other surveillance device of the contents of any radi communication under circumstances in which person has reasonable expecta tion of privacy and warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes and if both the sender and all intended recipients are located within the united states or 4 the installation or use of an electr onic mechanical or other surveillance device in the united states for monitoring to acquire information other than from wire or radio communication under circumstances in which person has reasonable expectation of privacy nd warrant would be required for law enforcement purposessurveillance at particular known person who is reasonably believed to be in the united states under circumstances in which that person has reasonable expectation of privacy and warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes or 2 the intentional acquisition of the contents of any communication under circumstances in which person has reasonable expectation of privacy and warrant would be required for law enfo rcement purposes if both the sender and all intended recipients are reasonably be lieved to be located within the united states10 although this is broader shorter and more general finition than that contained in current law there are some similarities in language proposed subsection 101f1 blends so of the elements of current subsections 101f1 and f4 with new ements while eliminating other aspects of those provisions current subsection 101 f1 deals with the use of surveillance device to intercept the contents of wire or radio communications sent by or intended to be received by particular known inte ntionally targeted us person who is inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33637crs7 11 see the discussion of current section 102 of fisa and proposed sections 102 102a and 102b of fisa under hr 5825 in the discussion of sec 3 of hr 5825 infra the united states under circumstances in which person has reasonable expectation of privacy and warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes current subsection 101f4 deal s with the installation or use of surveillance device in the united states for monitoring to acquire information other than from wire or radio communication under circumstances in which person has reasonable expectation of privacy nd warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes however like current subsection 101f1 the new definition does not explicitly distinguish between interception of the communications of us persons and those of nonus persons nor is it restricted to acquisition of the contents of communications the curre nt subsection 101f1 requires the person intentionally targeted to be in the united states while the proposed provision requires reasonable belief that the person at whom surveillance is intentionally directed be in the united states bo th proposed subsection 101f1 and current subsection 101f4 deal with the installation or use of an electr onic mechanical or other surveillance device to acquire in formation but unlike current subsection 101f4 the proposed definition contai ns express requirement that the surveillance device be installed or used in the united states and restriction on acquisition of that information from wi re or radio communications the proposed subsection 101 f1 explicitly i nvolves intentionally directing surveillance at particular known person while cu rrent subsection 101f4 does not proposed subsection 101f2 s significant parallels to current subsection 101f3 in that both deal with intenti onal acquisition of the contents of communication under circumstan ces in which person has reasonable expectation of privacy and warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes however the current provision is limited to intentional acquisition of radio communications by means of an electronic mechanical or other surveillance device the proposed provision is not so limited applying to the intentional acquisition of any communication wit hout limiting it to radio communications or expressly restricting the means by which the acquisition occurs the current provision requires that both the sender and all the intended recipients are located in the united states while the bills provision requires that both the sender and all intended recipients be reas onably believed to be located within the united states minimization procedures under current law minimization proce dures are defined in section 101h of fisa 50 usc 1801h14 sec 2 c3 of hr 5825 amends the definition of minimization procedures in secti on 101h 50 usc 1801h to delete subsection 4 current subsection 101 h4 of fisa 50 usc 1801h4 includes in the definition of minimization procedures with respect to any electronic surveillance approved pursuant to 50 usc 1802a11 procedures that require that contents of any communica tion to which united states person is party shall be disclosed disse

electroni c surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes sec 3 of hr 5825 amends section 102 of fisa 50 usc 1802 by striking the current language and replacing it with new section 102 of fisa which contains both similarities to and differences from current law under sec 3a of the bill new subsection 102a of fisa provides that th president acting through the attorney general may authorize elect ronic surveillance without court order under title i of fisa14 to acquire foreign intelligence information for periods of up to one year if the attorney general certifie s in writing under oath that

34 continued the sec 3 heading would lend support to an interpretation that acquisition here may be intended to cover both electronic surveillance under proposed section 102 of fisa and other acquisitions of foreign intelligence information under proposed section 102a of fisa on the other hand the earlier language of this subsection treats both electronic surveillance under section 102 and acquisition of foreign intelligence information under section 102a explicitly while the latter part of the subsection speaks only to acquisition this might tend to support an interpretation that the latter use of acquisition was advised and was intended to cover only acquisitions under section 102a some support for more inclusive interpretation of the term acquisition might also be drawn from proposed subsection 102bq which deals with consultation by federal officers who acquire foreign intelligence inform ation with federal law enforcement officers and state and local law enforcement personnel to coordinate efforts to investigate or protect against certain categories of actions proposed subsection 102bq1 permits such consultation proposed subsection 102bq2 pr ovides that coordination under subsection 102bq1 shall not preclude the certification required by proposed section 102a dealing with electronic surveillance or section 102aa dealing with acquisition of foreign intelligence information by certain mean s other than electronic surveillance 35 the phrasing of the italicized portion of pr oposed section 102bo is somewhat unclear subsection 102bo states if pursuant to subsection n united stat district court determines that the acquisition authorized under this section was not lawfully authorized or conducted it sh all in accordance with the requirements of law s uppress the evidence which was unlawfully obtained or derived or otherwise grant the motion of the aggrieved person if the court determines that such acquisition was lawfully authorized and conducted it shall deny the motion of the aggrieved person except to the extent that due pr ocess requires discovery or disclosure emphasis added this may be reference to sec 3a of hr 5825 although the context seems to suggest that the reference is to the ction of fisa in which it occurs that is new section 102b rather than to the bill ho wever it would appear that the acquisition referenced in new section 102b of fisa woul d not be authorized under section 102b which deals with directives but rather under new section 102a if the acquisition of foreign intelligence information does not constitute electronic surveillance and the acquisition requires the assistance of wire or electroni c communications provider custodian or other person who has access to wire or electronic communications either as transmitted or as stored or who has access to equipment that is being or may be used to transmit or store such communications as in subsection 102bn discussed in the pr evious footnote there appears to be some uncertainty whether acquisition as used in subsection 102bo is intended to refer only to an acquisition of foreign intelligence in formation from communications provider under subsection 102a or whether it is also intended to encompass the gath ering of information through an electronic surveillance under secti on 102 the broader interpretation might find

electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence informati on under this title while subsection 102bqapplies to federal officers who acquire foreign intelligence informa tion it might be argued that the latter has broader applicability covering both those w ho acquire foreign intelligence information through electronic surveillance and those who do so by certain other means this would seem to be consistent with the heading of sec 3 of hr 5825 it may also draw support from subsection 102bq2 which indicates th at coordination under paragraph 102bq1 does not preclude the certification required by section 102a which deals with electronic surveillance or 102aa which deals with acquisition of foreign intelligence information by certain other means alternatively it might be argued that since acquisition of foreign intelligence information appears to be used as term of art in proposed section 102a of fisa that this section applies only to the latter in support of this position one might contend that since the new provisions would be added to title i of fisa subsection 106k by its terms might be read to apply to coordination where the foreign intelligence information is gathered by electronic surveillance under proposed section 102 as well as current sections 104 and 105 of fisa proposed section 102bq differs from current section 106k in that section 102bq covers coordination

categories of investigative and protective efforts covered by both proposed sec tion 102bq and current section 106k 40 there appears to be some overlap of th first sentence of the proposed subsection
