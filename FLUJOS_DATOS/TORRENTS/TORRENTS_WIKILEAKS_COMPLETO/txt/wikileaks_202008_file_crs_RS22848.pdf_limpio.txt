stateadministered program that is jointly financed by states and the federal government the federal and state shares of program costs vary for each state based on formula that takes into consideration each states per capita income compared with the national per capita income the formula is designed so that states with per capita income that is relatively lower than other states will pay lower state share of medi caid program costs nonetheless many states have found raising their state share of medicaid program costs to be challenging particularly during economic downturns intergovernmental transfers igts are one of the methods used by some states to finance the non federal share of medicaid costs certain igts are specifically allowed for funding the state share of program costs for example units of government such as counties are able to contribute to the states share of medicaid at least three states currently require counties to fund some part of the state share congress specifically protects the ability of states to use funds derived from state or local taxes and transferred or certified by units of government within state 1 some states have instituted programs where all or portions of the medicaid state share is paid by hospitals or nursing homes that are public providers however not units of government or are units of government but the state share is returned to the provider sometimes through inflated medicaid payment rates2 the purpose of such financing arrangements is generally to draw additional federal funds for which state share may not otherwise be available while the funds often help to pay for medicaid or other health care services those arrangements effectively raise the federal share of medicaid program spending these intergovernmental transfers are often repaid through medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments or through inflated medicaid payment rates 3 for which federal matching amounts are claimed alternately states can make medicaid payments to the providers and the providers transfer portion or all of those payments back to the state through what is claimed as an igt either way the net impact is to effectively raise the federal matching rate in the state to levels beyond those specified in law in may of 2007 the department of health and human services issued regulation tightening the administrative procedures and clarifying the vague definitions that allow these types of financing mechanisms to operate4 the 1 42 usc 1396b w6a 2 us government accountability office medicaid states efforts to

government that may participate in the nonfederal share of medicaid payments state city county special purpose district or other governmental units within the state the rule would elaborate on those units of government in the foll owing ways it would include as state or local governmental entity including indian tribes unit of government that can demonstrate having generally applicable taxing authority or is stateoperated cityoperated countyoperated or tribally operated health care provider health care providers that assert to be special purpose district or other local governmental entity must demonstrate that they are operated by unit of government by showing that they have generally applicable taxing authority or that the health care provider is able to access funding as integral part of governmental unit with taxing authority and that contractual relationship with the state or local government is not the primary or sole basis for the health care provider to receive tax revenues the explanation of the regulation goes on to state if the unit of government merely uses its funds to reimburse the health care provider for the provision of medicaid or other services that alone is not sufficient to demonstrate that the entity is unit of government5

establish that funds transferred from other public agencies6 to the state or local agency and under the states administrative control can be used to fund the state share of medicaid the term public agency has been interpreted by some states to include health care providers that are not governmental in nature bu t have publicoriented mission such as notfor profit hospitals the rule would remove the term public agency from prior regulations and replace it with the phrase other units of government including indian tribes reflecting the statutory language of section 1903w7g of the ssa the rule also would require governmental entity using cpe to submit certification statement to the state medicaid agency and have additional documentation available it would require that cpe used to fund

medicaid financing practices in states in which supplemental payments to providers in excess of medicaid costs have been made8 prior regulations have placed limits on such practices which are referred to as upper payment limit upl financing arrangements under such upl ar rangements states make medicaid payments to public hospitals and other public longterm care institutional providers at inflated payment rates set at the statutory ceiling known as the medicare upper payment limit the payments generate federal matching the hospitals or other providers return some or all of the amounts in excess of the usual medicaid rate to the state through intergovernmental transfers the preamble to the proposed rule explains that the excess payments violate another statutory rule requiring medicaid payments to be consistent with economy and efficiency 42 usc 1396aa30a consequently the rule would limit reimbursements to governmentally operated providers to amounts that do not exceed cost this limit would not apply to indian health service facilities and tribal facilities nor to disproportionate share hospital payments the secretary would be required to determine reasonable met hod for identifying allowable medicaid costs it would also require that medicaid costs be supported by auditable documentation in form approved by the secretary that meets the same standards as for the cpe documentation see above if it is found that governmentally operated provider received an overpayment those amounts would be credited to the federal government under normal procedures 9 the regulation would also require governmental providers to submit an annual cost report to the medicaid agency that reflects their cost of services to medicaid recipients during the year finally the rule would make conforming changes including eliminating 42 cfr 447271b to conform with the limit on payments to governmental providers that do not exceed cost 7 provider taxes and donations like igts are two other approaches that states have used to raise the nonfederal share of medicaid in the past congress acted in 1991 to limit those financing mechanisms which had been used for similar purposes as igts are used today the 1991 legislation however did not address igts as one of the three questionable financing approaches 8 hhs office of the inspector general review of medicaid enhanced payments to local

through an igt or other mechanism some or all of those payments back to state medicaid agencies is included as well the rule would require that providers receive and retain the full amount of the medicaid payments provided to them for medicaid services the rule states that the secretary will determine compliance with this provision by examining any related transactions hhs estimated that the imposition of the rule would reduce federal medicaid outlays by 387 billion over fiveyear period starting in and assuming the rule went into effect 2007 the congressional budget office estimates the impact to be reduction in federal outlays of 9 billion over fiveyear period starting with fy2008 states however in responding to survey conducted by the staff of the house committee on oversight and government reform estimate their loss of federal medicaid funds to be over 21 billion for same fiveyear period beginning in 2008 an amount that is more than five times the hhs estimates 10

agree that the rule would significantly reduce medicaid payments in certain states and concerns are raised about whether those states would be able to fill the funding gap and if not what the implications would be for medicaid beneficiaries and providers aside from the concerns about the impact of the considerable loss of federal funds on medicaid providers and beneficiaries the rule has been viewed by some as cms overstepping its authority to limit intergovernmental transfers when congress explicitly allows such transfers governors concerns were expressed in letter from the national governors association to house and senate leadership dated february 25 2008 11 the letter calls on congress to take immediate action to delay implementation of the rules fearing that their implementation would inappropriately shift costs to states at time when some states are facing particularly difficult fiscal situations the governors point out that the new rules reflect departure from past practices and are based on new and unsupported interpretations of medicaid law finally the letter reminds members of the congress that some of the rule changes were considered and rejected when the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra was deliberated on march 11 2008 lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the district of columbia by coalition of provider groups led by the national association of public hospitals and health systems the american hospital association and the association of american medical colleges 12 the lawsuit asks the court to reject the rule on

providers and that cms improperly issued the rule from nahps website the litigants make three major claims 1 the rule defines units of government more narrowly than permitted under law and severely restricts options for states to fi nance the nonfederal share of their medicaid program expenditures the cms definition usurps states ability to determine the governmental status of entities within states severely limiting the type of governmental entities that can make intergovernmental transfers to fund the nonfederal share of the program 2 cms does not have the authority to limit medicaid payments to public providers to cost while continuing to allow private providers to be paid under different methodology congress rejected costbased reimbursement and payment limits in the early 1980s in favor of granting states flexibility to tailor medicaid reimbursement to their unique needs cost limit imposed solely on governmental hospitals is counter to clear congressional intent and is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the administrative procedure act it also upends decades of medicaid payment policies established by cms and relied on by states 3 the moratorium signed by the president on may 25 2007 effectively prevented cms from issuing final rule the same day 13 indeed ruling in this case filed on may 23 2008 found the latter claim compelling us district court judge james robertson has prohibited the implementation of the final rule14 the rule was vacated and the matter returned to the agency in response to the ruling spokesman for cms suggested that the judges finding is technical in nature only and that the substance of the rule will ultimately be upheld15 congress has taken action as well in may of 2007 congress enacted oneyear moratorium on the implementation of the rule16 that moratorium was extended until april 1 2009 as part of hr 2642 the supplemental appropriations act of 2008 the war supplemental signed by the president on june 30 2008
