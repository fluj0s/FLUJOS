designed to revitalize some of the nations more impoverished areas beginning with the housing act of 1949 which authorized loans and capital grants to help selected localities undertake socalled slum clearance and urban redevelopment through the model cities program 1966 which sought to improve urban congressional research service the library of congress crs2 renewal by making redevelopment citizendirected and by combining physical and social renewal the executive and legislative branches have tried to find the right mix of incentives to address the economic plight of inner cities and poor rural areas the enterprise zone concept originated in great britain in the mid1970s and emigrated to the united states few years later enterprise zone legislation was introduced in congress as early as 1980 but it was at the state level where experimentation with the concept flourished by the late 1980s over twothirds of the states had embraced the concept enacted legislation and started programs1 contemporaneous with program experimentation by the states congress continued working to develop comprehensive federal program of enterprise zones support for some type of federal government initiative increased but there was lack of agreement over whether the enterprise zone approach would produce the economic and social effects sought as well as over how such program should be designed throughout the period the fundamental concept of various enterprise zone legislation remained much the same provide tax incentives and regulatory relief to firms willing to locate in economically distressed communities so too did the goal to increase investment business formation and employment in depressed areas in order to generate broader economic and social revitalization what changed over time was the approach2 over the years republicans generally were the chief proponents of the enterprise zone concept they called for capital gains tax breaks and other tax and regulatory relief to spur investment in poor communities president clinton offered variation on the gop plan putting more emphasis on wage credits block grants and grassroots planning and staking out federal role in coordinating resources in the targeted neighborhoods3 ezec program round i the 103rd congress enacted the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 obra 1993 pl 10366 which established the empowerment

requiring each applicant to submit its nomination along with strategic plan developed with input from community stakeholders such as residents businesses financial institutions service providers and state and local governments these plans described the communities overall visions for revitalization linked these visions to the programs four key principles4 identified other governmental and private resources that would be committed to the program and described potential barriers to successful implementation in december 1994 having received more than 500 nominations the secretaries of hud and usda announced the designation of 104 ezs and ecs 6 urban ezs 3 rural ezs 65 urban ecs and 30 rural ecs5 all the designated communities are receiving federal assistance as established by obra 1993 and huds implementing regulation 24 cfr part 597 each urban ez was allocated 100 million and each rural ez was allocated 40 million in ssbg funds for use over the 10year life of the program all of the urban and rural ecs were allocated just under 3 million in ssbg funding6 key element of the program was federal funding for ezs and ecs made available through the title xx social service block grant ssbg program the act amended title xx of the social security act to authorize the special use of ssbg funds for the ezec program7 the use of ssbg funds was expanded to cover range of economic and social development activities as with other ssbg funds the funds allotted for the ezec program are granted by hhs to the states which are fiscally responsible for the funds of critical importance the act authorized onetime appropriation of 1 billion for hhs to be made available in ssbg funds over the 10year life of the ezec program thus ensuring that round i designated areas would not be dependent on annual appropriations as is typically the case businesses in the 11 round i ezs cleveland and angeles were added by the taxpayer relief act of 1997 qualified for the following tax incentives 1 20percent wage credit for the first 15000 of wages paid to zone resident who works in the 4 zones and communities were selected on the basis of their ability to spur economic opportunity by creating

as part of their application for round i to assure that their important work produced continuing benefits to these communities usda designated them as champion communities and provided assistance to them 7 the ssbg program typically funds state governments for social service activities the amount of each states grant from hhs is based on an allotment formula specified in title xx of the social security act crs4 empowerment zone 2 an additional 20000 of section 179 expensing for qualifying zone property8 and 3 taxexempt financing for certain qualifying zone facilities9 105th congress authorizes round ii the taxpayer relief act tra of 1997 pl 10534 authorized the designation of 20 additional ezs 15 urban and five rural businesses in the round ii ezs were not originally eligible for

in round i ezs10 the tax incentives with respect to the round ii ezs generally are available through 2008 also round ii offered additional potential to link communities to their broader regional economies round ii ezs were able to designate up to 2000 acres of underutilized developable property outside the formal zone area that can receive zone benefits and be used for job creation for zone residents in contrast with round i indian tribes with poverty areas also qualified to apply for and receive designation in the round ii competition 279 communities and groups of adjacent communities competed for the empowerment zone designation119 in urban areas and 160 in rural areas as was the case with round i in order to compete for ez status communities were required to submit strategic revitalization plans stating how they would transform their troubled communities11 as with the original ezec designations the selection of round ii ezs was based on scoring system that measured the quality of revitalization plans and private and public sector commitments made to implement the plans career civil servants made the selections in addition to the new ezs 20 additional communities were subsequently designated as rural enterprise communities12 8 that is ez businesses are permitted to deduct an additional 20000 in capital expenditures pl 106554 increases the expensing allowance to 35000 effective december 31 2001 9 the tax incentives with respect to the ezs designated by obra 1993 generally were available during the 10year period of 1995 through 2004 pl 106554 extends the designation of ez status for existing zones through december 31 2009 10 specifically the taxexempt financing benefits for the round ii ezs are not subject to the state private activity bond volume caps but are subject to separate perzone volume limitations and the perbusiness size limitations that apply to the round i ezs and ecs ie 3 million for each qualified ez business with maximum of 20 million for each principal user for all zones and communities do not apply to qualifying bonds issue for round ii ezs 11 in round ii 15 of the 25 newly designated rural ezs and ecs were champion communities from round i since 1999 usda has formalized the champion communities program by inviting all the communities who submitted strategic plans to continue implementing their plans by signing agreements with usda 12 authorization for new rural ecs was included in the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act for fy1999 hr 4328 pl 105277 crs5 funding for round ii the tra of 1997 did not appropriate ssbg funds as had been available to round i ezs and ecs although the clinton administration sought full funding for the round ii zones at the same level as round i it did not happen instead congress has appropriated discretionary funding for round ii ezs each year appropriations for urban ezs from 1999 through 2002 totaled 330 million or 22 million for each zone for fy2003 the presidents budget requested zero appropriations in the 107th congress two bills hr 2637 s 2692 would provide general funding authorization for the full funding of both round ii ezs and
