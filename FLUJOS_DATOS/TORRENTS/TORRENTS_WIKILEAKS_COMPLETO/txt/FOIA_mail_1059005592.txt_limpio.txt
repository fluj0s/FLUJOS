tosbornueaacuk kevin trenberth trenbertcgducaredu ben santer santer1llnlgov steve schneider shsstanfordedu xflowed folks here are some thoughts about the soon issue partly arising from talking to ben what is worrying is the way this bs paper has been hyped by various groups the publicity has meant that the work has entered the conciousness of people in congress and is given prominence in some publications emanating from that sector the work appears to have the imprimateur of harvard which gives it added credibility so what can we as community do about this my concerns are twofold and i think these echo all of our concerns the first is the fact that the papers are simply bad science and the conclusions are incorrect the second is that the work is being used quite openly for political purposes as scientists even though we are aware of the second issue we need to concentrate on exposing the scientific flaws we also need to do this in as authoritative way as possible i do not think it is enough to speak as individuals or even as group of recognized experts even as group we will not be seen as having the power of the harvard stamp of approval what i think is necessary is to have the expressed support of both agu and ams it would also be useful to have harvard disassociate themselves from the work most importantly however we need the nas to come into the picture with these 4 institutions together with us and others as experts pointing out clearly that the work is scientific rubbish we can certainly win this battle i suggest that we try to get nas to set up committee to best option assess the science in the two bs papers or less good but still potentially very useful assess the general issue of the paleo record for global or hemisphericscale temperature changes over the past 1000 years the second option seems more likely to be acceptable to nas this is arguably an issue of similar importance to the issue of climate sensitivity uncertainties which nas reviewed earlier this year report still in preparation i am not sure how to fold agu and ams into this ideas are welcome similarly perhaps some of you know some influential harvard types better than i do and can make some suggestions here the only way to counter this crap is to use the biggest guns we can muster the administration and congress still seem to respect the nas even above ipcc as final authority so i think we should actively pursue this path best wishes tom michael oppenheimer wrote dear all since several of you are uncomfortable it makes good sense to step back and think about more considered approach my view is that scientists are fully justified in taking the initiative to explain their own work and its relevance in the policy arena if they dont others with less scruples will be heard instead but each of us needs to decide his or her own comfort zone in this case the agu press release provides suitable context so it may be that neither separate letter nor another agu statement would add much at this time but this episode is unlikely to be the last case where clarity from individuals or groups of scientists will be important michael tom wigley wrote folks i am inclined to agree with peck perhaps little more thought and time could lead to something with much more impact tom _____________________________ jonathan overpeck wrote hi all im not too comfortable with this and would rather not sign at least not without some real time to think it through and debate the issue it is unprecedented and political and that worries my vote would be that we dont do this without careful discussion first i think it would be more appropriate for the agu or some other scientific org to do this eg in reaffirmation of the agu statement or whatever its called on global climate change think about the next step someone sends another letter to the senators then we respond then im not sure we want to go down this path it would be much better for the agu etc to do it what are the precedents and outcomes of similar actions i can imagine specialinterest org or group doing this like all sorts of other political actions but is it something for scientists to do as individuals just seems strange and for that reason id advise against doing anything with out real thought and certainly strong majority of coauthors in support cheers peck dear fellow eos coauthors given the continued assault on the science of climate change by some on capitol hill michael and i thought it would be worthwhile to send this letter to various members of the us senate accompanied by copy of our eos article can we ask you to consider signing on with michael and providing your preferred title and affiliation we would like to get this out asap thanks in advance michael m and michael
