changes to the child support enforcement cse program that will result in less federal financial support to state cse programs the cse program serves families that are recipients of the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program and nonrecipient families it provides seven major services parent location paternity establishment establishment of child support orders review and modification of support orders collection of ch ild support payments distribution of support payments and establishment and enforcement of medical child support orders in fy2004 the cse system handled 159 million cases of which almost 83 132 million were nontanf cases in fy2004 the cse program expenditures amounted to 53 billion and the program collected 438 in child support payments from noncustodial parents for every dollar spent on the program the federal government bears the majority of cse program expenditures and provides incentive payments to the states for success in meeting cse goals most child support collections for tanf families are kept by the federal government and states to reimburse families for their tanf costs collections for nontanf families generally are paid to the families some policymakers are concerned that the federal governments role in financing cse is too high and contend that the states should pay greater share of the programs costs comparing cse expenditures with the income generated by retained collections for tanf families the federal government has lost money each year since 1979 the fy2004 loss to the federal government was 24 billion although in the past the income generated by the cse program for states in the aggregate exceeded their expenses this longer holds true the fy2004 loss to states was 422 million the increasing federal losses on the cse program and the switch from gain to loss for the state governments is in part attributable to the decline in the tanf caseload an alternative analysis views retained child support collections as reimbursement for portion of cash welfare expenditures for families with children rather than as income to the state the share of tanf cash expenditures reimbursed by child support collections has consistently grown over time the reason for this is that cse collections for welfare families has remained relatively stable while cash welfare payments decreased dramatically from 228 billion in fy1994 to 104 billion in fy2004 in fy1994 retained child support collections for welfare families as percentage of total cash welfare expenditures was less than 9 by fy2004 it had increased to 20 the change in the composition of the cse caseload together with changes made pursuant to pl 109171 are expected to result in state cse programs having to compete with all other state interests in obtaining funds from the general treasury or county treasuries this is dramatic departure from the past when the cse program was unique among social welfare programs in that it added money to state treasuries this report will not be updated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33422g3g151g138g149g162g156g146g156g561g152g143g561g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g556g21g157g138g157g142g561g8g146 g151g138

some of which become effective in fy2007 together with congruence of several program factors and policies ie reduced percentage of cash welfare families on the cse rolls and commitment to allow former welfare families to keep greater portion of child support collected from noncustodial parents may mean that states will have to increase state funding in order for cse programs to continue to run

g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 the cse program was passed by congress in 1975 pl 93647 with two primary goals the first goal was to reduce public expenditures for actual and potential welfare recipients by obtaining ongoing support from noncustodial parent s the second goal was to establish paternity for children born outside marriage so that child support could be obtained the december 1974 finance committee report on the cse legislation stated the problem of welfare in the united states is to considerable extent problem of the nonsupport of children by their absent parents 3 it also stated that the result of new federalstate cse program would be to lower welfare costs to the taxpayer and to deter fathers from abandoning their families both welfare and nonwelfare families are eligible for cse services although federal matching funds for cse program expenditures on nonwelfare cases have been available to states since the programs enactment they were authorized only on temporary basis until 1980 pl 96272 enacted on june 17 1980 made federal matching funds for cse nonwelfare services available 1 this report was originally written on march 24 2000 by carmen

welfare families in the cse caseload states are responsible for administering the cs program but the federal government plays major role in dictating the major design features of state programs funding state and local programs monitoring and evaluating state programs providing technical assistance and giving direct assistance to states in locating absent parents and obtaining support payments all 50 states the district of columbia guam puerto rico and the virgin islands operate cse programs and are entitled to federal matching funds to qualify for federal matching funds each states cse plan must be approved by the office of child support enforcement ocse department of health and human services hhs the cse program provides seven major services on behalf of children parent location paternity establishment establishment of child support orders review and modification of support orders collection of support payments distribution of support payments and establishment and enforcement of medical child support orders collection methods include income withholding intercept of federal and state income tax refunds intercept of unemployment compensation liens against property providing child support debt information to credit bureaus withholding of drivers licenses and other professional licenses passport denial and seizure of funds in financial institutions pl 104193 the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 replaced the aid to families with dependent chil dren afdc entitlement program with tanf block grant and made major changes to the cse program pl 104193 allowed all states to link up to an array of databases and permitted the federal parent locator service fpls 5 to be used for the purpose of establishing parentage establishing setting the amount of modifying or enforcing child support obligations or enforcing child custody or visitation orders it required that designated state agency directly or by contract conduct automated comparisons of the social security numbers reported by employ ers to the state directory of new hires 6 and the social security numbers of cse cases that appear in the records of the state registry of child support orders the 1996 welfare reform law required the hhs secretary to conduct similar comparisons of the federal directories when match occurs the state directory of new hires is required to report to the state cse agency the name date of birth social security number of the employee and employers name address and identification number the cse agency then within two business days is required to instruct appropriate employers to withhold child support obligations 4 families who receive tanf cash benefits medicaid benefits or whose children receive title ive foster care payments automatically are enrolled free of charge in the cse program other families must apply for cse services and states must charge an application fee that cannot exceed 25 in addition states have the option of recovering costs in excess of the application fee such recovery may be from either the custodial parent or the noncustodial parent 5 the federal parent locator service fpls is service operated by ocse to help state cse agencies locate parents in order to obtain child support payments the fpls obtains address and employer information from federal agencies the fpls also includes the federal child support case registry and the national directory of new hires 6 pl 104193 the 1996 welfare reform law required states beginning october 1 1997 to establish an automated directory of new hires containing information from employ ers including federal state and local governments and labor organizations for each newly hired employee that includes the name address and social security number of the employee and the employers name address and tax identification number within three business days after receipt of new hire information from the employer the state directory of new hires is required to submit its new hire reports to the national directory of new hires contrary to its name the national directory of new hires includes more than just information on new employees it is database that includes information on 1 all newly hired employees compiled from state reports and reports from federal employers 2 the wage reports of existing employees and 3

subject to withholding7 pl 104193 required employers to remit to the state di sbursement unit income withheld within seven business days after the employees payday pl 104193 required states to operate centralized collection and disbursement unit to send child support payments to custodial parents within two business days pl 104193 also established what is often referred to as the family first policy wherein family that is longer receiv ing tanf benefits has first claim on all child support paid by the noncustodial parent this means that the states not only pay current child support that is collected to former tanf families but also pay higher proportion of arrearages ie collections on past due child support payments to former tanf families since the 1996 welfare reform changes the tanf rolls have decreased significantly currently there are about 2 million tanf families on the rolls per month and 40 of those families consist of childonly families in fy1994 there were about 5 million cash welfare families moreover annual federal and state tanf expenditures have decreased from almost 23 billion in fy1994 to 10 billion in fy2004 reduced cash welfare rolls have resulted in reduced share of welfare families in the cse caseload which means that the cse program has lesser amount of welfare costs to recover further pursuant to the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 federal financing of the cse program will be greatly reduced these two factors have tremendous implications with regard to the funding of the cse program g5g21g7g561g5g138g156g142g149g152g138g141g561 the cse program serves both tanf recipients8 and nontanf recipients in fy2004 the cse system handled 159 million cases of which 59 million were families who had never been on tanf 73 million were formertanf families and 26 million were families who were receiving tanf assistance 9 see figure 1 formertanf cases are families that are longer on tanf 7 there are three exceptions to the immediate income withholding rule 1 if one of the parties demonstrates and the court or administrative process finds that there is good cause not to require immediate withholding 2 if both parties agree in writing to an alternative arrangement or 3 at th hhs secretarys discretion if state can demonstrate that the rule will not increase the effectiveness or efficiency of the states cse program 8 in 1984 congress reinstated authority for the state cse agencies to take steps when appropriate to secure an assignment to the state for any rights to support on behalf of title ive foster care children and to collect child support on behalf of those children this authority had been inadvertently deleted in 1980 when the foster care program was transferred from title iva of the social security act to t itle ive of the social security act child support collected on behalf of such foster care children is retained by the state as reimbursement for foster care maintenance payments with appropriate reimbursement to the federal government the public agency responsible for supervising the placement of the child may use the collection in excess of th foster care payment in the manner it determines will best serve the interests of the child including setting such payments aside for the childs future needs or making all or part of the payments available to the person responsible for mee ting the childs daytoday n eeds child support paid in excess of amounts ordered to meet the childs need may be retained by the state to reimburse it and the federal government for any past foster care maintenance payments or afdctanf payments made with respect to the child the data in the tables and figures in this report generally include child support payments collected on behalf of foster care children unless otherwise noted likewise the caseload numbers also include title ive foster care children who are being served by the cse program in fy2003 cse collections made on behalf of foster care cases amounted to less than 04 of total cse collections ocse does not collect data specifically on foster care cases 9 as mentioned below mother with two children by different fathers would be considered two families or

support is still owed ie child support arrearages accrued while the family was still receiving tanf benefits ocse defines cse case as noncustodial parent mother father or putativealleged father who is now or eventually may be obligated under law for the support of child or children receiving services under the cse program if the noncustodial parent owes support for two children by different women that would be considered two cases if both children have the same mother that would be considered one case the cse program defines current assistance case as one in which the children are 1 recipients of cash aid under tanf title iva of the social security act or 2 entitled to foster care maintenance payments title ive of the social security act in addition the childrens support rights have been assigned by caretaker to the state and referral to the state cse agency has been made former assistance case is defined as case in which the children were formerly receiving tanf or foster care services never assistance case is defined as case in which the children are receiving services under the cse program but are not currently eligible for and have not previously received assistance under tanf or foster care in fy1978 tanf cases comprised 85 of the cse caseload but dropped to 17 of the caseload in fy2004 by the same token nontanf cases repr esented only about 15 of the cse caseload in fy1978 and increased to 83 of the caseload in fy2004 available data show that nontanf cases increasingly are families that formerly received tanf in fy1999 ocse started reporting data for the foll owing categories current assistance former assistance and never received assistance rather than by tanf and nontanf the data indicate that the number and percentage of cse families who currently receive tanf has decreased over time while the number and percentage of cse families who formerly received tanf has increased the data also show that the proportion of the cse caseload composed of families who had never received tanf has remained relatively stable for the period fy1999fy2004 the decline in tanf families since 1994 and the relative stability of the segment of the caseload that had never been on the tanf rolls resulted in smaller cse caseload in fy1999 the cse caseload was 173 million families by fy2004 it had dropped to 159 million families in fy2004 the largest group of families who were participating in the cse program were families who had left the tanf rolls ie former tanf families46 10 families who had never been on tanf represented 37 of the cse caseload and families who were currently receiving tanf benefits comprised 17 of the cse caseload see figure 1 11 thus although the majority of the cse caseload is composed of nontanf families 83 most of them at some point in their lives received tanfafdc 63 this is consistent with the expanded mission of the cse program the expectation is that as child support becomes more consistent and stable income sourcesupport these former tanf families will never have to return to the tanf rolls and families that never resorted to the tanf program will never have to do so 10 under the old jargon former tanf families would have been included among nontanf families 11 in fy2004 families currently receiving tanf comprised almost 17 of the cse caseload and received 5 of cse collections see table a7 in contrast former tanf families compri sed 46 of the cse caseload and received 43 of cse collections families that have never been on ta nf comprised 37 of the cs caseload and also received 43 of cse collections in fy2004 the state data reporting forms were revised to include information on child support collected for medicaid reimbursement on behalf of families that had never been on tanf these

money in order to receive federal funding for every dollar state spends on cse expenditures it generally receives 66 cents from the federal government states also receive cse incentive payments from the federal government 12 although the actual dollars contributed by the federal government are greater than those from state treasuries the level of funding allocated by the state or local government determines the total amount of resources available to the cse agency one of the original goals of the cse program was to reduce public expenditures on the afdc program by obtaining child support from noncustodial parents on an ongoing basis thus when the cse program was enacted in 1975 new requirement for afdc eligibility was added mandating custodial parents to assign to the state their rights to collect child support payments 12 local programs may receive additional funding from either the state or local government or both pursuant to the states cse plan

support and lasted as long as the family received afdc benefits when th family stopped receiving afdc the assignment ended the custodial parent regained her right to collect current support however if there were arrearages the state could claim those arrearages up to the amount paid out in afdc benefits readers should note that the child support payments made on behalf of tanf children are paid to the state for distribution rather than directly to the family if the child support collected is insufficient to lift the familys income above the states tanf eligibility limit the family receives its full tanf grant ie not reduced by the child support payment and the child support is collected by the state and distributed to the state treasury and the federal government in proportion to their assistance to the family if the familys income including the child support payments exceeds the states tanf limitations the familys tanf cash benefits are ended and all current child support payments are then sent directly to the family via the states child support disbursement unit as mentioned above when the cse program was first enacted in 1975 one of its primary goals was to recover the costs of providing cash welfare to families with children to accomplish this costrecovery goal child support collected on behalf of families receiving afdc directly offset afdc benefit costs and was shared between the federal and state governments in accordance with the matching formula used for the given st ates afdc program under old afdc law the rate at which states reimbursed the federal government for child support was the federal matching rate ie the federal medical assistance percentage or medicaid matching rate for the afdc program which varied inversely with state per capita income ie poor states have high federal matching rate wealthy states have lower federal matching rate in state that had 50 matching rate the federal government was reimbursed 50 for each 100 collected in child support on behalf of an afdc family while in state that had 70 federal matching rate the federal government was reimbursed 70 for each 100 collected in the first example the state kept 50 and in the second example the state kept 30 thus states with larger federal medical assistance matching rate kept smaller portion of the child support collections the match ranged from minimum of 50 to statutory maximum of 83 although afdc was replaced by the tanf block grant under the welfare reform law of 1996 the same matching rate procedure is still used in terms of cse collections this costrecovery procedure means that poorer states are rewarded less for their cse efforts than wealthier states in other words states that are entitled to relatively small proportion of child support collections because of paying smaller share of afdc benefit costs have to collect more child support payments per administrative dollar than other states to recover their costs other things being equal there has been movement away from the costrecovery goal in part because of the changing nature of the cse program as discussed earlier in the caseload section the component of the caseload that is composed of tanf families is shrinking even though overall child support collections increased by 27 over the sixyear period fy1999fy2004 see table a3 child support collections made on behalf of tanf families decreased by 11 see table a4 in fy2004 only 17 of the cse caseload was compos ed of tanf families thus the policy shiftfrom using the cse program to recover welfare costs to using it as mechanism to consistently and reliably get child support income to familiesis not surprising in fy2004 only 5 of cse collections 11 billion were made on behalf of tanf families see table a7 about 16 of that amount went to the families pursuant to state child support pass through provisions and the rest was divided between the state and federal governments to reimburse

their own money to operate cse program the level of funding allocated by the state andor localities determines the amount of resources available to cse agencies second the federal government generally reimburses each state 66 of all allowable expenditures on cse activities the federal government reimburses states at higher 90 matching rate for the laboratory costs associated with establishing paternity pursuant to pl 109 171 the higher federal matching rate for laboratory costs of paternity testing will be reduced to the general federal cse reimbursement rate of 66 beginning october 1 2006 the federal governments funding is openended in that it pays its percentage of expenditures by matching the amounts spent by state and local governments with upper limit or ceiling given that paternityrelated expenditures generally amount to significantly less than 1 of total cse expenditures the cse reimbursement formula resulted in the federal government paying 661 of total cse program expenditures in fy2004 third states collect child support on behalf of families receiving tanf to reimburse themselves and the federal government for the cost of tanf cash payments to the family federal law requires families who receive tanf cash assistance to assign their child support rights to the state in order to receive tanf in addition such families must cooperate with the state if necessary to establish paternity and secure child support collections on behalf of families receiving tanf cash benefits are used to reimburse state and federal governments for tanf payments made to the family ie child support payments go to the state instead of the family except for amounts that states choose to pass through to the family as additional income that does not affect tanf eligib ility or benefit amounts 13 the formula for distributing the child support payments collected by the states on behalf of tanf families between the state and the federal government is still based on the old afdc federalstate reimbursement rates described earlier even though the afdc entitlement program was replaced by the tanf block grant program under existing law states have the option of giving some all or none of their share of child support payments collected on behalf of tanf families to the family 14 pursuant to pl 13 the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 repealed previous requirement that 50 be passed through to the family and gave states the choice to decide how much if any of the state share some all none of child support payments collected on behalf of tanf families to send the family states also decide whether to treat child support payments as income to the family moreover pl 104193 required states to pay the federal government the federal governments share of tanf collections as of august 2004 21 states were on monthly basis providing pass through and disregard up to 50higher in couple of statesof child support collected on behalf of tanf families 14 under pre1996 law small percentage of afdc collections was paid to the family as result of the 50 pass through payment or in cases when the child support payment exceeded the afdc benefit under old law the

some of the collected child support to the tanf family do not have to pay the federal government its share of such collections if the amount passed through to the family and disregarded by the state does not exceed 100 per month 200 per month to family with two or more children in child support collected on behalf of tanf or foster care family fourth the federal government provides states with an incentive payment to encourage them to operate effective programs federal law requires states to reinvest cse incentive payments back into the cse program or related activities through fy2007 if incentive payments are reinvested in the cse program they are reimbursed at the appropriate cse federal matching rate ie 66 for general activities or through fy2006 90 for laboratory testing for paternity determination in fy2004 the statutorily set maximum incentive payment for all states was 454 million effective october 1 2007 pl 109171 enacted february 8 2006 prohibits federal matching of state expenditure of federal cse incentive payments this means that on the effective date cse incentive payments that are received by states and reinvested in the cse program will longer be eligible for federal reimbursement fifth application fees and costs recovered from nonwelfare families may help finance the cse program in the case of nonwelfare family the custodial parent can hire private attorney or apply for cse services as one might expect hiring private attorney is more expensive than applying for services under the federalstate cse program the cse agency must charge an application fee not to exceed 25 for families not on welfare the cse agency may charge this fee to the applicant or the noncustodial parent or pay the fee out of state funds in addition state may at its option recover costs in excess of the application fee such recovery may be either from the custodial parent or the noncustodial parent such fees and costs recovered from nonwelfare cases must be subtracted from the states total administrative costs before calculating the federal reimbursement amount ie the 66 matching rate 15 effective october 1 2006 pl 109171 requires families that have never been on tanf to pay 25 annual user fee when child support enforcement efforts on their behalf are successful ie at least 500 annually is collected on their behalf thus it is likely that the amount collected through fees from nontanf familiesespecially persons who have never been in the cash welfare caseloadwill increase significantly readers should note that the cse financing provisions included in pl 109171 which was enacted on february 8 2006 are estimated by the congressional budget office cbo to save the federal government about 18 billion over the fiveyear period fy2006fy2010 16 cbos estimates

health and h uma n services hh s the 1996 welfare reform law established family first policy that required states to give child support arrearage payments collected on behalf of former welfare families to the family first prior to any state or federal reimbursement17 before the enactment of pl 104193 these collections could either be sent on to the families or retained by the state and federal government as reimbursement for past public assistance this family first policy was intended to help 17 it was recognized that the family first policy also would reduce the amount of child support that states and the federal government would be able to keep to protect states from losses expected to result from this new family first policy congress included hold harmless provision in the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 ensuring that if states did not reach their fy1995 level of child support collections the federal government would make up the difference one result of the hold harmless provision is that it also helped states affected by declining welfare collections caused by drop in the tanf caseload the hold harmless grant came out of the federal share of cse collections attributable to that state ie the same source of funding as the incentive payment some observers argued successfully that the hold harmless provision was not sustainable they noted that at some point the federal share of child support collections would be depleted by the incentiv payments and the hold harmless awards they maintained that when this occurred money would have to be found sewhere to

with cse efforts the cse strategic plan for the period fy2005fy2009 states the following child support is longer primarily welfare reimbursement revenueproducing device for the federal and state governments it is familyfirst program intended to ensure families selfsufficiency by making child support more reliable source of income18 one of the goals of the 1996 welfare reform law with regard to cse distribution provisions was to create distribution priority that favored families once they leave the tanf rolls this family first policy has been further advanced by pl 109171 generally speaking under the new law child support that accrues before family receives tanf and after the family stops receiving tanf will go to the family whereas child support that accrues while the family is receiving tanf goes to the state and federal governments 19 this additional family income is expected to reduce dependence on public assistance by both promoting exit from tanf and preventing entry and reentry to tanf for more detailed information on the family first policy see appendix b concurrently the rules regarding the distribution of arrearage payments to former tanf families first rather than to the states or federal government may also result in reduced collections to be kept by the states and federal government 20 further the proportion of nonwelfare families receiving cse services continues to increase as mentioned earlier collections made on behalf of nonwelfare families go directly to the family usually through the disbursement unit thus while both the federal and state governments pay their share of the administrative costs for these families neither gets share of current collections made to these families 18 see httpwwwacfhhsgovprogramscsepubs2004strategic_plan_fy20052009pdf 19 with respect to the deficit reduction act pl 109171 the congressional budget office cbo estimated that the child support passthrough and disregard provision related to current tanf families would cost the federal government 140 million over the fiveyear period fy2006fy2010 cbo timated that the provision related to the passthrough of all arrearages to former tanf families would cost the federal government 283 million over the fiveyear period fy2006fy2010 20 pl 109171 gives states the option of distributing to former tanf families the full amount of child support collected on their behalf ie both current support and all child support arrearagesincluding arrearages collected through the federal income tax refund offset program thereby pl 109171 allows states to simplify the cse distribution process by eliminating the special treatment of child support arrearages collected through the federal income tax refund offset

some policymakers view the federal reimbursement of state cse expenditures as too high they contend that states should pay higher proportion of cse costs they assert that less generous federal matching rate would induce states to operate more efficiently others contend that states faced with enforcing an array of federal laws and caseloads composed of larger share of nonwelfare families should not be confronted with higher cse costs they also point out that the large interstate segment of the cse program demonstrates the need for relatively high federal funding they support continuation of the federal financial commitment to the cse program the national governors association has argued that any reduction in the federal governments financial commitment to the cse system could negatively affect states ability to serve families it contends that continued implementation of cs requirements without stable federal funding would result in significant cost shift to the states which could jeopardize the effectiveness of the cse program and thereby could have negative impact on the children and families the cse program is designed to serve 21

providing cash welfare to families with children but the child support enforcement amendments of 1984 pl 98378 broadened the mission to reflect service delivery in 1984 the criteria for making incentive payments to the states was broadened to include collections for nonwelfare families some commentators assert that the servicedelivery goal was reemphasized in the 1996 welfare reform legislation which established the family first policy to help assure that former welfare recipients stay off the tanf rolls the family first policy requires that such families are to receive any child support arrearage payments collected by the state before the state and federal governments retain their share of collections additionally the sharp decline in the tanf rolls and reduced expenditures on tanf have helped shift the program from recovering declining costs for smaller population to collecting and paying child support to nonwelfare families figure 3 and table 1 show the trend in child support collections for welfare and nonwelfare families from fy1979 through fy2004 in constant inflationadjusted dollars collections for nonwelfare families increased in every year over this period except for fy1982 collections for welfare families increased in all but one year fy1980 through fy1996 but have had several up and down fluctuations since fy1997 in real inflationadjusted terms nonwelfare collections increased tenfold over the fy1979fy2004 period while collections for welfare families increased by 57 it should be noted that the increase in nonwelfare collections is not merely the result of welfare families going off assistance and becoming nonwelfare families in the early years of the program many states failed to provide services to nonwelfare families this changed over time and for many years now the nonwelfare portion of the cse caseload has exceeded the welfare portion of the caseload 21 national governors association hr14 child support financing winter

outgo of the child support program can be examined from at least two different perspectives the first shows how the cse program by itself affects the cash flow of both federal and state budgets however collections retained to reimburse the federal government and the states for welfare and foster care costs represent some of the child support income for the states and all of the child support income for the federa l government another view of child support finances looks at collections as reimbursement for states welfare and foster care costs rather than as child support income

behalf of tanf and foster care families exceeded cse program costs in fy1999 federal child support enforcement outgo exceeded income by 1795 billion in that year state child support enforcement income exceeded outgo by 87 million see table 2 since fy2000 both the federal government and the states have lost money on the cse program table 2 and figure 4 show the trends in the difference between

dollars the increasing federal losses on the cse program and the switch from gain to loss for the state governments are in part attributable to the decline in the afdctanf caseload table 3 shows that when inflation is taken into acc ount the gain to the states dropped from 579 million in fy1997 to 334 million in fy1998 and to 99 million in fy1999 since fy2000 the states in aggregate have

million in other words beginning in fy2000 almost all of the states have had to pay out more to operate their cse programs than they received back in recovered welfare payments incentive payments and federal matching funds 23 the cash flow for child support programs at the state level has implications for funding of the program in some states some state administrators have sold their cse program to their state legislatures on the basis that the child support program has added money to the state treasury whereas most other social welfare programs reduce the state coffers this meant that some state legislatures did not have to appropriate funds to pay for their cse program 22 the federal loss was computed by summing the gross federal share of administration actual incentive payments and hold harmless payments and then subtracting the gross federal share of child support collections the financial gain to states was computed by subtracting from total administrative expenses the federal share of administrative expenses actual incentive payments hold harmless payments and the state share of child support collections differences in methodologies might yield different loss and gain

hampshire bore greater share of welfare expenditures than did mississippi when viewed from the perspective of child support collections as reimbursement for welfare costs highincome states retain more

activities ie national average in other words for every dollar that was spent by federal state and local governments 438 was collected by the states from noncustodial parents for the financial support of their children ie private funds the table shows that there were wide differences among states in how much child support was collected for each dollar spent on the cse program ranging from 187 in new mexico to 870 in hawaii it is interesting to note that the collectionstocosts ratio did not seem to affect whether state financially gained from operating cse program given that both maine state

with an incentive to spend money inefficiently others maintain that although state finances are generally on more stable footing than they were during the past couple of years state resources are still limited with respect to the many state programs and activities that need to be funded every year and thus the nature of state budgets in and of themselves provides the incentive for states to keep cse expenditures reasonable one explanation of why states have been consistently losing money on the cse program in recent years is that nonwelfare collections are growing at faster rate than welfare collections child support collections on behalf of nonwelfare families increased by 44 over the period fy1999fy2004 while child support collections on behalf of welfare families decreased by 18 over that period while the state and federal governments share in portion of welfare collections nonwelfare collections go exclusively to the custodial parent via the state disbursement unit

gains and losses of the cse program takes into account the consideration that child support collections retained by the federal government and states are offsets to expenditures on tanf cash benefits rather than offsets to cse programs that is it is possible to view retained child support collections as method of financing portion of states cash welfare expenditures rather than its child support expenditures in study for hhs researchers surveyed states in 1998 and found that 25 of the states used their share of cse collections to finance their tanf programs rather than their cse programs 26

determine the federal medical assistance percentage the same formula that was used under prior law as the matching rate for afdc and to divide child support enforcement collections figure 5 compares total federal and state cash assistance afdctanf payments with child support collections made on behalf of afdctanf families for fy1994fy2004 the share of afdc and tanf cash expenditures reimbursed by child support collections has grown consistently over time the reason for this is that cse collections for welfare families have remained relatively stable while cash welfare payments decreased

reliance on what used to be somewhat predictable source of income althoug h in the aggregate states receive higher incentive payments than under the earlier incentive payment system these totals are fixed amount 29 and individual states have to compete with each other for their share of the capped funds the cse incentive payment system was fully implemented in fy2002 it caps the federal incentive pool thereby forcing states for the fi rst time to compete against each other for these incentive dollars under the revised incentive system state may be eligible to receive an incentive payment for good performance the total amount of the incentive payment depends on four factors the total amount of money available in given fiscal year from which to make incentive payments the states success in making collections on behalf of its caseload the states performance in five areas mentioned earlier and the relative success or failure of other states in making collections and meeting these performance criteria 30 moreover unlike the old incentive system which allowed states and counties to spend incentive payments on whatever they chose the revised incentive system requires that the incentive payment be reinvested into either the cse prog ram or some other activity that might lead to improving the efficiency or effectiveness of the cse program eg mediation parenting classes efforts to improve the earning capacity of noncustodial parents etc 2003 report commissioned by hhs indicated that for the natio n as whole federal cse incentive payments to states represented 25 of

payments many program analysts argue that indirect savings occur when child support collections keep family off welfare and that these savings make the cse program worthwhile despite the apparent loss under the current accounting system some analysts assert that although it is difficult to determine how much money might have been spent on various public assistance programs had it not been for the collection of child support payments these indirect benefits of the cse program should not be dismissed or ignored 31 29 in fy1998 the incentive payment which at that point in time came out of the gross federal share of child support collected on behalf of tanf families was 395 million beginning in fy2002 child support incentive payments were longer paid out of the federal share of child support collections made on behalf of tanf families instead federal funds have been specifically appropriated out of the us treasury for cse incentive payments 30 under the old incentive payment system hhs made incentive payments to states for their child support enforcement systems based solely on one factor costeffectiveness 31 some observers also contend that there are intangible benefits such as personal responsibility and parental involvement associated with the collec tion of child support that should be take n into account in determining the merits of the cse program this discussion does not address the intangible benefit concept

noncustodial parents to fulfill their child support obligation because they fear the consequences of not doing so they contend that these child support payments reduce government spending by providing families with incomes sufficient enough to make them ineligible for programs such as tanf food stamps and medicaid the indirect effects of changes in the cse program on other programs are scored in cost estimates of legislation that is cbo estimates the impact of changes in the cse program on outlays for programs such as food stamps and medicaid some have argued that the budget itself ought to reflect welfare cost avoidance by crediting the cse budget account with these indirect savings from other programs the budget would then reflect the net cost of the program to the federal government after taking into account savings achieved in other programs this can be viewed as preferable to showing the gross cost of the program for purposes of helping congress and the president make decisions about the allocation of resources within the federal budget however there are both practical and conceptual issues about explicitly including welfare cost avoidance in federal budgeting on practical level it is difficult to reliably measure those who would be eligible for and are receiving tanf and other assistance programs in the absence of the cse program doing so requires esti mating what the world would look like under counterfactual ie what if the child support program did not exist which requires making numerous assumptions tanf welfare savings are generally redirected by states to other activities allowable under the block grant as opposed to reduced state spending conceptually the budget is meant to be document that helps make decisions about both resource allocation and the federal governments fiscal policy in terms of fiscal policy attributing welfare cost avoidance savings to the child support enforcement program is simply bookkeeping transaction it does nothing in and of itself to change the revenues to or the outlays from the federal government it could be argued that complicating the accounting of child support obfuscates its fiscal impact which is how much the program spends and how much it generates in collections its transactions with the public it could also be argued that policy makers routinely ignore such bookkeeping rules particularly when overall spending or deficitsurplus goals drive policy report contracted by the federal office of ch ild support enforcement ocse entitled child support cost avoidance in 1999 final report concludes by stating the following unlike cost recovery cost avoidance can only be estimated it cannot be directly measured but when even lowerbound estimate of cost avoidance exceeds the total amount of cost recovery it is clear that cost avoidance is an important part of the picture as the child support enforcement community calls attention to child pports ability to improve families financial stability and independence it is worth recognizing that this increased independence also implies financial benefits to government through cost avoidance 32 32 urban institute prepared for the department of hea lth

services programs ensures the transfer of privatenot publicfunds to nonwelfare families enrolled in the program thus as implied earlier the cse program imposes personal responsibility on noncustodial parents by requiring them to meet their financial obligations to their children thereby alleviating taxpayers of this responsibility

in march 2004 the cse program was cited by the office of management and budget omb as being the most costeffective program among all social services and block grantformula programs reviewed governmentwide 33 during the 27year period fy1978fy2004 child support payments collected by the cse agencies increased from 1 billion in fy1978 to 219 billion in fy2004 and the number of children whose paternity was established or voluntarily acknowledged increased from 111000 in fy1978 to 1606 million in fy2004 during that period the cse caseload expanded from 4146 million in fy1978 to 15854 million in fy2004 however the program still collects only 18 of child support obligations for which it has responsibility and collects payments for only 51 of its caseload in fy2004 1303 billion in child support obligations 280 billion in current support and 1024 billion in pastdue support was owed to families receiving cse services but only 232 billi on was paid 165 billion in current support and 67 billion in past due support during the period fy1978fy2004 total expenditures on cse activities increased from 312 million in fy1978 to 5322 billion in fy2004 see appendix for state information on cse collections and expenditures for fy1999fy2004 ocse data indicate that in fy2004 paternity had been established or acknowledged for about 80 of the 10 million children in the cse caseload without legally identified fathers in fy2004 the cse program collected 438 in child support payments from noncustodial parents for every dollar spent on the program many child support advocates are concerned that reductions in federal financing of the cse program will result in less costeffective program they argue that it does not make sense to hamper successful program the national child support enforcement association maintains that the enhanced federal matching rate and the ability to reinvest federal incentives and receive the federal match make child support worthwhile investment for state legislatures who often simply do not have the budgetary resources to otherwise adequately fund the program reducing federal funding at this critical juncture may mean that significant innovations will be scrapped midstream 34 some advocates of children maintain that cse funding cuts will erode the tremendous progress made by the states in making their cse programs more efficient and effective and that this could result in fewer noncustodial parents supporting their children and more families enrolling in welfare programs35 many advocates of children agree that as cse federal funding is reduced states will 33 us department of health and human services administration for children and families hhs news child support effectiveness cited by omb mar 31 2004 34 national child

reduced resources they argue that the likely result will be fewer enforcement actions directed toward the more difficult and costly cases and thus they contend that lowincome ch ildren could bear the

according to the final report on state financing of child support enforcement programs published in 2003 the state share of cse expenditures in aggregate comes from state general fund appropriations 42 federal incentive payments 25 the state share of retained child support payments collected on behalf of tanf families 15 county general fund appropriations 9 and fees and costrecovery efforts 2 37 as noted earlier enactment of pl 109171 february 8 2006 gave states the option of implementing familyfirst policy acceptance of familyfirst policy raises some concerns regarding the funding of the cse program under familyfirst policy more child support dollars would go to families both tanf families and nontanf families and thereby less money would go to the states and the federal government for reimbursement of cash welfare assistance to the family also pursuant to pl 109171 states will longer be entitled to receive federal matching funds for cse incentive payments that the state reinvests in the cse program thus one source of funding federal matching of incentive payments will be totally eliminated and another source of funding the state share of retained child support payments collected on behalf of tanf families probably will continue to decline the elimination of federal reimbursement of cse incentive payments will result in significant reduction in cse financing under previous law the federal match resulted in near tripling of state cse fundingexpenditures for example in fy2004 actual incentive payments to states amounted to 454 million the federal match at the 66 rate on the incentive payments amounted to almost twice that figure 881 million which translates into the state spending 1335 billion on cse activities 38 whereas cse used to be unique in that it was social welfare program that added money to state treasuries this is longer the case with the exce ption of handful of states after the provisions 36 center on budget and policy priorities u nshared

prepared by michael fishman kristin dybdal of the lewin group inc and john tapogna of econorthwest sept 3 2003 p iii 38 the general cse federal matching rate is 66 this means that for every dollar that state spends on its cse program the federal government will reimburse the state 66 cen ts so if the state spends 1 on its program the federal share of that expenditure is 66 cents and the state share of that expenditure is 34 cents the algebraic formula for this relationship is represented by 6634x1 thereby if the state share of the expenditure is 1 the federal share is 194 ie the federal share is 194 times the state share and the total expenditure by the state is 294 1194 similarly if the state share of expenditures amounted solely to the incentive payment of 454 million the federal share would amount to 194 times that amount or 881 million translating into 1335 billion in cse expendituresfunding

families or retained by governments as reimbursement for welfare costs nonwelfare collections go to families welfare collections can be split among the federal and state governments with some pa yments to families under pl 104193 the rules governing how child support collections are distributed among families the federal government and state governments changed substantially pursuant to pl 109171 effective october 1 2008 at state option the child support distribution rules will change again since the cse programs inception the rules determining who actually gets the child support arrearage payments have been complex it is helpfu l to think of the rules in two categories first there are rules in both federal and state law that stipulate who has legal claim on the payments owed by the noncustodial parent these are called assignment rules second there are rules that determine the order in which child support collections are paid in accord with the assignment rules these are called distribution rules according to the massachusetts associate deputy commissioner for cse marilyn ray smith the distribution rules that were enacted as part of the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 were difficult for states to follow for staff to explain for parents to understand and for computers to implement she says the rules create accounting nightmares for customers litigation from advocacy groups headaches for computer programmers and audit deficiencies for the states 39 according to marilyn ray smith child support distribution rules become extremely complex once family leaves welfare most of the problems stem from the requirements that preassistance arrears be assigned to the state and that certain arrearages otherwise owed to the former welfare family are deemed to be owed to the state when the collection is made by federal tax refund intercept when family leaves welfare states are required to keep track of six categories of arrearages permanently assigned temporarily assigned conditionally assigned never assigned unassigned during assistance and unassigned preassistance on the computer these different categories are called buckets the money shifts among the buckets according to the source of the co llection the familys status on or off assistance when the arrearage accrued the amount of the unreimbursed public assistance balance and the date of the assignment of support rights as well as the date the tanf case closed because of phasedin implementation dates moreover the distribution rules differ depending on whether the family went on welfare before or after october 1 1997 40 much of the complexity of the distribution rules stemmed from their gradual implementation and federalstate receipt of child support arrearage payments collected through the federal income tax refund offset program thus some of the complexity of the rules ended when the rules were completely implemented on october 1 2000 many observers contend that if states choose to 39 more money for former welfare moms simplify the distribution rules by marilyn ray smith presented at congressional seminar for the house committee on ways and means sponsored by

eligibility when family applies for tanf the custodial parent must assign to the state the right to collect both current child support payments and pastdue child support obligations that accrue while the family is on the tanf rolls these are called permanentlyassigned arrearages 41 the assignment requirement for tanf applicants also includes arrearage payments that accumulated before the family enrolled in tanf these are called preassistance arrearages while the family receives tanf benefits the stat is permitted to retain any current support and any assigned arrearages it collects up to the cumulative amount of tanf benefits that have been paid to the family pl 104193 repealed the 50 required pass through42 and gave states the choice to decide how much if any of the state share some all

under pl 104193 arrearages are to be paid to the family first unless they are collected from the federal income tax refund in which case reimbursing the federal and state governments is to be given

custodial parent assigns her or his child support rights to the state on or after october 1 2000 the parent has to assign all support rights that ac crue while the family is receiving tanf benefits in addition the tanf applicant must temporarily assign to the state all rights to support that accrued to the family before it began receiving tanf benefits this temporary assignment lasts until the family stops receiving tanf benefits this means that since october 1 2000 states have been required to distribute to former tanf families the following child support collections first before the state and the federal government are reimbursed 1 all current child support 2 any child support arrearages that accrue after the family leaves tanf these arrearages are called neverassigned arrearages plus any arrearages that accrued before the family began receiving tanf benefits as mentioned above these rules do not apply to child support collections obtained by intercepting federal income tax refunds if child support arrearages are collected via the federal income tax refund offset program the 1996 law stipulates that the state and federal government are to retain those collections the result of the 1996 welfare reform law distribution changes is that states are required to pay higher fraction of child support collections on arrearages to families that have left welfare by making these payments to families first before the state and the federal government if this change in policy resulted in states losing money relative to previous law as in effect in fy1995 the federal government was required to reimburse states for any losses ie the hold harmless provision this hold harmless provision included in pl 106169 was repealed effective october 1 2001 the hold harmless provision was
