several factors have led insurers to refuse payment of life insurance claims resulting from the holocaust factors cited by insurers have included the following 1 socializationnationalization of insurancecompany assets in central and eastern european countries after the war transfe rred to certain governments and successor entities the responsibilities for unpaid and unc laimed insurance polic ies 2 naziera regulations and decrees forced some insu rers to pay insurance proceeds and cash values of insurance policies to the na zi government and germanys postwar restitution program compensated some holocaust victims for specific claims arising from those transactions 3 ma ny named beneficiaries lack death certificates for the insureds 4 many policie s had lapsed for nonpayment of premiums and 5 many claims have been considered invalidated by the passage of time these and similar representations have not always been sympathetically received especially after the end of the co ld war the public disclosure of certain secret documents by the former soviet union revealed collusion between certain european insurance officials and nazi leaders further materials documented lack

european insurers to provide information about unpaid insurance policies and to attemp t to provide individual settlements to such claims 123 sct at 2396 subsequent negotiations between the united states and the german government resulted in the 2000 german foundation agreement under which terms the german government and certain german companies contributed to foundation established to oversee

123 sct 2374 2003while international bodies and individual governments attempted to resolve the holocaustera insurance claims8 several state legislatures passed laws to facilitate resolution9 the focus of the more comprehens ive legislation such as that enacted in florida and california was to restrict the ability of certain insurers to engage in business in those states if the insurer r related insurer frequently european affiliate did not provide policy information relating to or had not settled outstanding holocaustera insu rance claims generally state laws also contained policy

compensation from the government of the federal republic of germany10 litigation in the lower federal courts the focus of the florida litigation in the district court and the court of appeals was the allegation that the due process rights of the insurancecompany plaintiffs were unconstitutionally abridged by the challenged statutes the california litigation which eventually reached the supreme court as american insurance association v garamendi 11 addressed in the first instance the impact of that states insurance statute on the conduct of foreig n policy by the united states due process

raised but not addressed in the florida litigation17 first defendants argument that plainti ffs have not demonstrated that the holocaust statutes have an actual dire ct impact on foreign relations

instance however the presidents foreign affairs powers are evident in the extensive nationalgovernmentlevel negotiations concerning holocaust insurance payments and the existence of the international commission on holocaust era insurance cl aims icheic and underscore that the matter has been and is being addressed at the foreign relations level18 nor was the court persuaded by the commi ssioners argument that the state law could not be challenged as an abrogation of federal commerce power because the 1945 mccarranferguson act exempts state re gulation of insurance from the general ban on

supreme court american insurance association v garamendi as framed by the court the issue before it was whether hvira interferes with the national governments conduct of fore ign relations fivejustice majority concluded that it did so in terfere and the california statute was therefore preempted by the executives negotiated agreements with foreign governments the ruling of the ninth circuit was accordingly reversed26 after recounting the history behind most holocaustera insurance claims and the international negotiations directed at securing reparations based on those claims the court emphasized the negotiations be tween the united states and the german governments that resulted in inter alia the german foundation agreement agreement27 under its terms the german government and certain german companies contributed to foundation tablished to oversee and administer the compensation of victims with claims against german companies dating back to the nazi era pursuant to the agreement president clinton had committed to procedure that obligated the united states government when german company was sued in an american court over holocaustera claim to 1 submit statement indicating that it would be in the united states fore ign policy interests for the foundation established by the agreement to be the exclusive forum and source of remedy for such claims and 2 attempt to get state and local governments to respect the foundation as the exclusive reme dial mechanism for such cla ims in other words the agreement represented sort of quid pro quo pursuant to which the willingness of the germans to create voluntary compensation fund was conditioned on some expectation of s ecurity from lawsuits in united states courts 28 further germany and the united states ag reed that the foundation would work with the international commission on holocaust era insurance claims icheic whose mission is to negotiate with european in surers to provide in formation about unpaid

there the state law which restrict ed the ability of massachusetts and its agencies to purchase goods or services from companie s that did business with burma myanmar was unanimously held to violate the supremacy clause of the constitution and declared invalid 32 123 sct at 2394 legislation that would provide congressiona l authorization for the state statutes is summarized briefly in note 5 supra and more fully infra at pp 913 33 cf notes 19 20 and accompanying text 34 123 sct at 2394 35 id at 2395the court noted that the executive agreements at issue lacked express preemption clauses but emphasized that there was sufficiently clear conflict between the foreign policy embodied in the agreements and the california statute to require its finding of preemption the presidents policy as embodied in his executive agreements and government officials interpretation of them was to encourage european governments and companies to volunteer settlement funds in preference to litigation or coercive sanctions hvira imposed regulatory sanctions to compel disclosure and payment of claims and created new cause of action for holocaust survivors if th other sanctions failed30 the express federal policy and the clear conflict raised by the state statute are alone enough to require state law to yield if any doubt about the clarity of the conflict remained however it would ve to be resolved in the national governments favor given the weakness of the states interest against the backdrop of traditional state legislative subject matter 31 and although the president had acted wit hout express congressional authority on the subject the court found it noteworthy that congress neither disapproved of the presidents policy nor expressly authoriz ed state statutes of the hvira type32 californias commerce clause argume nt relying on the mccarranferguson act rejected in the district court33 was more successful in the supreme court federal statute directed to implied preemption by domestic commerce legislation cannot sensibly be construed to address preemption by executive conduct in foreign affairs34 the four dissenting justices were less willing than was the majority to find preemptioninducing conflict absent clear statement imed at disclosure requirements by one voice to which courts properly defer in matters of foreign affairs35 as does the majority the dissent acknowledges the us obligation under the german foundation agreement to advise litigation forums of the governments determination that the foreign policy interests of the united states would

valid legal ground which under the us system of jurisprudence will be for the us courts to determine37 but the dissent also notes that the agreement makes clear that the united states does not suggest that its policy interests concerning the foundation in themselves provide an independent legal basis for dismissal38 justice ginsburg reviewed prior supreme court case law in which certain state laws were found to impermissi bly conflict with either th express terms of executive agreements39 or required us courts to inqui re into the nature of foreign governments possibly criticizing those more authoritarian than our own40 based on that review the dissent concluded that hvira which addressed only public disclosure subject neither mentioned nor alluded to in the german foundation agreement or similar agreements concl uded with austria and france should be left in place because implementing hvira would not compromise the presidents ability to speak with one voice for the nation41 federal
