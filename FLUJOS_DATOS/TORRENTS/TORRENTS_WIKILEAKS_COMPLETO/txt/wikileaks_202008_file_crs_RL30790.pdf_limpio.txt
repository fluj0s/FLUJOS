affected andean exports on february 15 2002 the bush administration deferred collection of these tariffs for 90 days in expectation that the 107th congress would either reauthorize atpa or provide shor tterm extension of its trade preferences in part because the atpa legislation was eventually linked to the larger debate on trade promotion authority tpa congress was unable to complete work on the bill before the deferral expired the atpa was eventually reauthorized as the andean trade promotion and drug eradication ac t atpdea title xxxi of the trade act of 2002 hr 3009 which was signed into law by president bush on august 6 2002 pl 107210 all duty reductions th at were in place prior to atpas expiration were made retroactive to december 4 2001 and presumably all those duties collected are reimbursable in evaluating the atpa program its trade effects were shown to have been relatively small although th ere was some indication that the composition of trade changed and that with few products case could be made that atpa supported this change it is possible that the slightly altered composition of us imports from atpa countries reflected br oader change in what and ean countries were producing and that this in turn pointed to some i ndirect evidence that resources once used for drugrelated activity were being redirected toward atpaeligible products isolating atpas role from other counternarcotics and economic diversif ication programs however has been difficult challe nge producing imprecise estimates supporters of atpa argued that its eff ects were evident and proposed that it be reauthorized to reinforce the us commitment to the alternative development counternarcotics strate gy and that preferential treatme nt be extended to other andean exports to broaden the programs effects in general the 107th congress appeared to accept this position to enhance the effects of atpa the reauthorization legislation provides for an extension of trade pr eferences through december 31 2006 extending them to cover exports previously excluded including certain textile and apparel articles canned tuna watches and parts pe troleum footwear and selected leather bags and goods congress was also careful to consider and in many cases preserve the interests of domestic producers atpa may be only small part of large and longterm counternarcotics effort but congress reasoned that expanding dutyfree provisions of atpa to include more exports in growth industries may have positive effect on the regionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30790contents n v r v ie w

ecuador and peru see appendix 1 for program details to complement cr op eradication interdiction military training and other counternarcotics efforts in 1992 when the program was imp lemented supporters expected that atpainduced export divers ification and growth would encourage economic alternatives to coca production and other drug related activity with one estimate projecting as much as threefold increase in us imports from atpa countries over decade1 trade data alone however do not provide adequate measures of success which should link decline in drug activity with the expansion of atpa supported industries indeed there wa s some movement on the drug front for example total coca cultivation fell by 13 from 1992 to 2000 this represented significant declines in bolivia 68 and peru

difficult cha llenge because their effects must be isolated from other c ounternarcotics and ec onomic development efforts studies by the us international tr ade commission usitc of atpas trade effects suggest that overall the program had positive but small influence on the volume and composition of us imports from atpa countries for example although total us imports from atpa c ountries on dollarvalue basis grew 85 through the decade 199099 this was much less than some had hoped for and represented growth of atpa imports re lative to us import growth worldwide further the composition of us impor ts from andean countries changed only slightly in favor of products that were atpa eligible this suggests that there was major change in the production structure of atpa economies pa rticularly in the biggest atpa beneficiary colombia which actually experienced large increase in coca production in the 1990s one of the most telling indicators of atpas limited influence was that us imports given preferential treatment exclusively under atpa represented only 10 of total imports from the four eligible countries 3 this constituted small percentage of trade and did not grow through the life of the atpa program without legislative change to the atpa program larger re sponse was thought to be limited in the short run by the andean export sectors pendence on few naturalresource based products and simple manuf actures atpas program exclusion of many major andean products eg petrol eum products textiles certa in leather goods and the fact that many products were already eligible for duty free or preferential treatment under other trade arrangements in short as elaborated below alt hough there was positive response to the atpa preferential tariff provisions the ove rall impact was small and operated at the margin of andean trade similarly the tariff preferences had little effect on the united states economy suggesting the cost of these preferences was low usatpa country trade colombia and bolivia qualif ied as atpa first bene ficiaries in mid1992 with ecuador and peru following one year later despite atpa aggregate us trade with beneficiary countries remained

mid1990s us imports from atpa countries although rising by 105 in dollar terms from 1990 to 2000 also declined slightly on relative basis to less than 1 of total us imports from the world in addition to trade volume another i ndicator of atpas possible effects is change in the composition of atpa imports figure 1 contrasts the composition of us imports from atpa countries be tween 1994 and 2000 because 1994 was the first full year all four count ries participated it provides base for comparison since it is unlikely to reflect large changes in the trade composition due to atpa given that insufficient time had passed for i ndustries to have responded fully4 for 2000 the major us imports approx imately 80 of the atpa countries total by harmonized tariff schedule h ts chapter were hts 27

the international trade commission which has not been updated for 2000 7 estimates by usitc ibid p 34 it should be noted that the 10 figure was higher during the mid1990s when the gsp program lapsed on few occasions causing greater reliance on the atpa provisionsa comparison of the two years suggests that on broad product category basis the composition of us imports from elig ible countries changed only marginally during the time that the original atpa program operated most notable was the addition of perus refine d copper cat hode imports which began in 1995 and were atpa eligible petroleu m products which were not eligible for atpa tariff preferences remained large portion of imports but came predominantly from colombia there was contrasting rela tive decline in seafood and coffee imports in general the minimal change in us import composition during this time period reflected three factors first mo st us imports from atpa countries were naturalresource based products petroleum gold fish co ffee bananas cut flowers or simple manufactures kn it apparel sweaters shirts suits copper cathodes many of which were not atpa eligible this trend is likely to continue regardless of atpa reauthorization second the conti nuing large portion of oil imports on dollarvalue basis in 2000 continued to skew import figures reflecting in part the worldwide surge in oil prices third colombia stands out as the dominant atpa trade partner accounting for 62 of to tal us imports from the gr oup in 2000 followed by peru and ecuador both with 18 and bolivia trailing with only 25 given that the relative size and co mposition of atpa imports variables expected to reflect the programs effects did not change during the course of the program little trade effect seems attributab to the atpa provisions closer look at the trade data at the sectoral level supports this conclu sion until the data are further disaggregated by duty treatment and product type these trends are in keeping with economic reasoning that would suggest program such as atpa would not affect the overall structure of trade but might alter the composition of atpa imports at the margin and within very specific product categories imports from atpa countries by duty status6 to determine which produc ts were benefitting from atpa it was necessary to ascertain what portion woul d have entered dutyfree exclusively because of their atpa eligibility many im ports qualified uncond itionally as dutyfree under general tariff rates eg coffee or through other favorable tariff arrangements such as the generalized system of pref erences gsp and could ter under more than one of these arrangements for example some products eligible to enter under gsp came in under atpa as shown in table 1 when these products are subtracted it turns out that imports eligible exclusively for atpa preferences represented only 10 of total us imports from the atpa countries7 the table contrasts selected andean country import data in 1995 and 1999 to re flect changes that may have occurredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30790crs5 during time when the atpa program was in full force dutyfree imports rose from 59 of

was small portion of trade and second that over the life of the program atpaeligible imports as group did not grow any faster than us imports from the four andean countries as whole this was unlikely to change in the short run without legislative action given that many imports already entered the united stat duty free other big items such as petroleum and textile produc ts were not eligible for

25 of total atpa imports this trend reflected falling demand in the united states for cut flowers and growth in other atpa impor ts such as copper cathodes and pigments which represented new us imports ce the atpa the program began although there was large increase in zinc products coming in under atpa this growth was partially due to shift in duty treatment of zi nc products which pr eviously entered the united states dutyfree under the gsp provisions8 the benefits of atpa fell in line w ith the overall trade importance of the countries in 1999 colombia and peru bene fitted most and had 45 and 36 of the dollar value of atpa imports respectively colombias percentage fell slightly since 1995 reflecting decline in cut flower imports offset some by an increase in us pigment imports peru was the fast est growing exporter under atpa reflecting its new copper cathode manufacturing i ndustry ecuador accounted for 15 of atpa imports in 1999 followed by bolivia with only 4 ecuador accounted for most of the tuna imports and small porti on of cut flowers bolivia exported mostly gold jewelry items which is the only major atpa item it produces9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30790crs7 10 the usitc also points out that the benefits of atpa to eligible countries is declining as the margin of preference declines for various reasons such as the continuing phasein of other trade agreement tariff rate cuts from the uruguay round as well as sectoral and regional agreements for details see ibid pp 33 11 ibid pp 53 and 55overall the atpa trade effects appear to be relatively small nonetheless at the product level there was so indication of change in trade composition when new products came on line at least in part to take advantage of atpas dutyfree provisions this reflects so level of andean economic diversification but not net growth in the amount of andean expor ts eligible under atpa on relative basis given that total imports eligible exclusiv ely under atpa remained at 10 of total us imports from these countries it appears that gains in some industries or products offset declines in others atpa program effects andean and us responses an evaluation of atpa should indicat how any changes in trade patterns affect the economies of the andean count ries and the united states two studies required by the atpa legislation tackled these questions first the us international trade commission atpa repor t evaluated both the andean and us responses to atpa the us department of labor produced separate targeted evaluation of atpas effects on us workers both pointed to the marginal effects of atpa on the economies of participating countries and the united states atpas economic effects on the andean countries although the trade effects of atpa we re relatively small there was some indication that the composition of trade ch anged and that with few products case can be made that atpa contributed to this change it is possible that the altered composition of us imports from atpa c ountries reflects broa der change in what andean countries were producing and that this in turn points to some indirect evidence that atpaeligible produc ts were substituted for illicit coca10 it is difficult to gauge the effects of atpa on national economies because the program has small effect relative to other variables national macroeconomic policies particularly in countries underg oing longterm economic reform have much larger effect on economic trends domestic andean government policies also supported crop substitution the effects of wh ich were not easily distinguishable from those of atpa in effect they worked to gether external shocks to the regions economies such as repeated ninos nd other natural phenomen had devastating effects on the agricultural sector that easily overshadowed incremental policy shifts like atpa isolating the marginal effects of atpa therefore was an imprecise exercise11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30790crs8 12 ibid pp 55 and 62 13 us international trade commission andean trade preference act sixth report 1998 usitc publication 3234 september 1999 pp 106 11114

bolivia show ed some diversification in exports to the united states that coincided with at pa in the mid1990s there was marked expansion of jewelry and to lesser ex tent leather and wood product exports that may have been related to the atpa tariff reductions but other domestic policy changes eg the tax code also affected production incentives for these goods in any case after 1996 this export growth trend slowed in peru broader array of export growth was discernible over the past decade with noticeable increase in copper cathodes and agricultural products pecially asparagus all of which benefitted from atpa as paragus also stood out because it was grown near traditional coca cultivation areas and was presumed to be an alternative cash crop at least in part encouraged by atpa provisions12 colombia and ecuador in its 1999 report the usitc evaluated atpas impact on colombia and ecuador of th atpaeligible products from colombia over the past decade cut flowers increased the most as proportion of us imports but overall the composition of colombias exports to the united states did not change dramatically since atpa began in part because of the dominance of petroleum other nontrad itional products such as as paragus presented some potential for increased benefits from atpa but overall its benefits were considered small ecuador had similar profile with little change in the composition of exports to the united states but some credited sign ificant increases in the production of cut flowers and seafood both of which benef itted from atpa with encouraging export diversification the overall effect was still small given the myriad variables that affected production capabilities and decisions13 coca eradication and crop substitution alternative crop production is critical component of the coca eradication effort underway in the andes although there was some indirect eviden ce to suggest that crop substitution has occurring it was small overall and the effect of atpa on this process was marginal at best whereas larger substitution effect s may be linked to the cut flower industry in colombia there were many factors that allowed such alternatives to exist before atpa was even conceived all the evidence points to atpas supportive but relatively small effect particularly given the magnitude of the problem and the comprehensive effort needed to address the drug trade for example numerous obstacles impeded the alternative development strategy including the high profitability of coca production lack of phy sical infrastructure required to support alternative cash crops and overt often violent guerrilla pressure to reject the program14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30790crs9 15 us international trade commission andean trade preference act

requested analysis of how changes in trade patterns related to atpa might affect the united states th usitc looked at three basic issues 1 consumer welfare gains from lowerpriced imports 2 the offsetting tariff revenue losses and 3 producer welfare losse s production displacement the us department of labor produced separate report dealing only with atpas effects on the domestic labor force changes in trade composition given that only very small share of us imports were involved in the atpa program its effects on the aggregate us economy were negligible therefore m easuring the gains and losses to the us economy must be done at the productindustr level in 1999 copper cathodes cut flowers roses and chrysanthemums t and gold compounds together accounted for 83 of total imports that benefitte d exclusively from the atpa provisions copper cathodes and cut flowers each contribut ed to approximately onethird of the atpaexclusive imports hence an analysis of the benefits and displacement costs related to these products c overs most of the effects atpa had on the us economy15 consumer welfare and tariff effects usitc market share data showed that atpaimported copper cathodes although growing briskly still accounted for only 74 of the us market in 1999 nd imported gold compounds claimed only 67 cut flowers by contrast accounted fo r up to 75 of the us market based on an partial equilibrium analysis the usitc estimated that the consumer welfare effects in all three cases were nonetheless small in the first two market penetration was simply too small but even in the case of colombias dominance of the us cut flower market the usitc suggested that us consumers would have paid only 55 more for flowers than they would have in the absence of atpa in addition the consumer benefits were offs et in many cases by reduced tariff revenues the net welfare effects for the united states as whole therefore were considered small16 producer welfare effects of greater concern to many were atpas effects on us producers to the extent that atpa encouraged marginal increase in imports those industries in the unite d states that produced competing products were potentially displaced from the market given market share figures the usitc found that only cut flowers and as paragus caused displacement of over 5 of the market asparagus imports were small and entered during the late summer and fall months when domestic crop production was low and so had clear benefit to us consumers because they did not directly compete with the us growing season however they were not primary target for concern over displacement17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30790crs10 18 ibid p 43 19 us department of bor bureau of international labor affairs trade and employment effects of the andean trade preference act sixth annual report to congress by robert c shelburne 1999 p 14 20 ibid p 10 the dol report covers 1998 and so does not reflect the fact that in 1999 the cut flower industry representatives dropped in terest in antidumping and countervailing duty investigations suggesting doubt in their ability to make strong case that the industry is being materially harmed by atpaeligible imports 21 ibid pp 1114cut flower imports have been greater concern but as the usitc points out colombia the major flower exporter had established its market dominance before atpa and the us growers had already responded by differen tiating their products the overall impact of atpa flower im ports was deemed small given domestic industry adjustment one indication that u s flower growers are longer seriously concerned with competition from andean imports is their decision to discontinue pursuing antidumping and countervailing dut remedies as of may and october 1999 respectively in short should atpa tari ff preferences be eliminated it appears there would be little effect on the domestic cut flower industry18 the us department of labor dol report targeted atpas impact on the domestic work force it concluded that the overall effects of atpa in 1998 were negligible given the strong us economy nd employment picture and the fact that atpaeligible imports were so small that their effect on aggregate us employment was virtually unmeasurable19 based on an analysis of products that entered the united states duty free exclusively from at pa provisions the department of labor suggested that only the cut flower indus try was likely to have presented any adjustment problem us cut flower production had fallen by 11 in 1998 as atpa imports rose perhaps indicating that at pa may have had some effect on the industrys contraction but th department of labor re port was quick to note that other factors may have affected cost comp etitiveness of the us cut flower industry such as complying with worker protection standards and that in any case their estimates were not precise20 of the workers potentially affected by layoffs in the flower industry the dol noted that all were seasonal agricultura l workers who often experience periods of unemployment have very low wage vel and live predominantly in poverty some 43 were estimated to be of illegal temporar or unknown legal status dol did not estimate the degree of adjustment difficulty but noted that the strong us economy should have been able to minimize any employment dislocation that might have occurred adjustment costs faced by other industries from increased import competition from atpa were considered insignificant21 policy discussion atpa was only small part of the larger andean counternarcotics effort coca production was the primary target of these fforts and because it is highly profitablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30790crs11 22 us department of state 2001 international

supporters argued that reduced tariffs ceivably played part of the alternative development strategy by providing an additional financial incentive to substitute legal crops for coca cultivation the increas in nonagricultural exports eg copper cathodes it was argued may so have reflected in part atpas preferential tariff treatment testimony before congre ssional committees expressed the desire by groups in the united states and the andean countri to reauthorize atpa and consider expanding the tariff preferences to more products and countries these views were summarized before congress by representatives of the bush administration as well who stated that atpa was achieving its goal of promoting export diversification and broadbased ec onomic development that pr ovides sustainable economic alternatives to drugcrop pr oduction in the andean region23 in considering the merits of atpa it is important to understa nd that the benefits it provided were quantitatively small atpas influence should have been visible in the changing composition of us imports which was marginal because many imports were not eligible by law for atpa dutyfree treatment or entered the united states under other preferential trade rrangements only 10 of atpa country imports entered the united states exclusiv ely under the atpa provisions this did not change over time suggesting that atpas effect on trade was unlikely to increase unless the programs parameters were modified because the trade response has been sma ll so too have been atpas likely effects on the andean economies still indirect evidence suggests that it may have supported economic diversification into products such as copper cat hodes and asparagus asparagus for example has been cultivated in larger quantities near traditional coca producing regions althoug h an encouraging sign given the high profitability of coca and active resisten ce by both armed guerrilla groups and peasants there were limits to what atpa may have been expected to accomplish and it was not clear that there is strong direct link between increased atpaeligible exports and any verifiable diminished drugrelated activity in addition to the

administration deferred collection of these tariffs for 90 days in expectation that the 107th congress would either reauthorize atpa or provide shor tterm extension of its trade preferences in part
