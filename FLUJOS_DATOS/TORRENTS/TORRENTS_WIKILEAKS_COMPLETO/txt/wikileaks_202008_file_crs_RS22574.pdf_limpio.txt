foreignborn people residing in the united states 37 million is at the highest level in our history and has reached proportion of the us population 124 not seen since the early 20th century of the foreignborn residents in the united states approximately onethird are naturalized citizens onethird are legal permanent residents and onethird are unauthorized illegal residents1 there is broadbased consensus that the us immigration system based upon the immigration and nationality act ina is broken this consensus erodes however as soon as the options to reform the us immigration system are debated the 110th congress is faced with strategic question of whether to continue to build on incremental reforms of specific elements of immigration eg border security employment verification temporary workers or alien children or whether to comprehensively reform the ina while it appears that bipartisan as well as bicameral agreement on specific revisions to the ina may be achievable it is also clear that many think comprehensive overhaul of the ina is overdue and necessary president george w bush has stated that comprehensive immigration reform is top priority of his second term and his principles of reform include increased border security and enforcement of immigration laws within the interior of the united states as well as major overhaul of temporary worker visas expansion of permanent legal immigration and revisions to the process of determining whether foreign workers are needed some in the bush administration reportedly advocated to replace or supplement the current legal immigration preference system with point system that would assign prospective immigrants with credits if they have specified attributes eg educational attainment work experience language proficiency 2 the thorniest of these immigration issues remain s the treatment of unauthorized aliens in the united states future debates will reflect the divergent views on how to address the more than 12 million illegal alien population as well as what the level of future permanent immigration should be the policy issues for congress are twofold whether and how to reform the nations legal immigration system and whether border security and interior enforcement provisionsas well as the resources of the immigration agencies charged with the administration and enforcement of immigration lawsare sufficient to implement comprehensive immigration reform 3 g11g150g150g146g144g155g138g157g146g152g151g561g7g151g143g152g155g140g142g150g142g151g157g561 immigration enforcement encompasses an

g4g152g155g141g142g155g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561 border security involves securing the many means by which people and goods enter the country operationally this means controlling the official ports of entry through which legitimate travelers and commerce enter the country and patrolling the nations land and maritime borders to interdict illegal entries in recent years congress has passed series of provisions aimed at strengthening immigrationrelated border security whether additional changes are needed to further control the border remains question 5

an alien who is not auth orized to be so employed the large and growing number of unauthorized aliens in the united states the majority of whom are in the labor force have led many to criticize the adequacy of the current worksite enforcement measures efforts to strengthen worksite enforcement however are sometimes met by opposition of increased bureaucratic burdens for employers and fears that more stringent penalties may inadvertently foster discrimination against legal workers with foreign appearances6 g3g149g146g142g151g561g21g150g158g144g144g149g146g151g144g561 many contend that the smuggling of aliens into the united states constitutes significant risk to national security and public safety since smugglers facilitate the illegal entry of persons into the united states some maintain that terrorists may use existing smuggling routes methods and organizations to enter undetected in addition to generating billions of dollars in revenues for criminal enterprises alien smuggling can lead to collateral crimes including kidnaping homicide high speed flight identity theft and the manufacturing and distribution of fraudulent documents past efforts to tighten laws on alien smuggling however sparked opposition from religious and humanitarian groups who asserted that the forms of relief and assistance that they may provide to aliens might be deemed as the facilitation of alien smuggling 7 g7g151g143g152g155g140g142g150g142g151g157g561g8g158g151g141g146g151g144g561 there are ongoing questions about the adequacy of the resources given to the agencies

recent years while interior enforcement resources have not reached sufficient levels for example some contend that decisions on which aliens to release from detention and when to release the aliens may be based on availability of detention space not on the merits of individual cases and that dhs immigration and customs enforcement ice does not have enough detention space to house all those who should be detained the debate is also likely to continue over whether dhs has adequate resources to fulfill its border security mission 8

an increase in ice agents many ma intain that the number is still insufficient in the interior of the country as result some recommend that state and local law enforcement be more engaged in enforcing immigration laws others question whether state and local law enforcement officers possess adequate authority to enforce all immigration lawsthat is both civil violations eg lack of legal status which may lead to removal through an administrative system and criminal punishments eg alien smuggling which is prosecuted in the courts whether state and local law enforcement agencies have sufficient resources and immigration expertise as well as whether state and local funds should be used to enforce federal immigration law are also controversial 9

at 220 and refugeesasylees adjusting to lpr status at 127 variety of constituencies are advocating substantial increase in legal immigration and perhaps significant reallocation between these visa categories the desire for higher levels of employmentbased immigration is complicated by the significant backlogs in familybased immigration due to the sheer volume of aliens eligible to immigrate to the united states citizens and lprs often wait years for the relatives petitions to be processed and visa numbers to become available meanwhile others question whether the united states can accommodate higher levels of immigration and frequently cite the costs borne by local communities faced with increases in educational expenses emergency medical care human services and infrastructure

foreign nationals who are known as nonimmigrants nonimmigrants are admitted for temporary period of time and specific purpose they include wide range of visitors including tourists students and temporary workers among the temporary worker pr ovisions are the h1b visa for professional specialty workers the h2a visa for agricultural workers and the h2b visa for nonagricultural workers foreign nationals also may be temporarily admitted to the united states for employmentrelated purposes under other categories including the b1 visa for business visitors the visa for treaty traders and investors and the l1 visa for intracompany transfers 12 many business people express concern that scarcity of labor in certain sectors may curtail the pace of economic growth leading legislative response to skills mismatches and labor shortages is to increase the supply of temporary foreign workers while the demand for more skilled and highlytrained foreign workers garners much of the attention there is also pressure to increase unskilled temporary foreign workers commonly referred to as guest workers those opposing increases in temporary workers assert that there is compelling evidence of labor shortages opponents maintain that salaries and compensation would be rising if there is labor shortage and if employers wanted to attract qualified us workers some allege that employers prefer guest workers because they are less demanding in terms of wages and working conditions and that expanding guest worker visas would have deleterious effect on us workers 13
