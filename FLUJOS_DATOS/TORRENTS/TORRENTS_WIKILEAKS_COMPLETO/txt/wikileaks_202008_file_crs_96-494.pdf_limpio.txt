war powers resolution brief summary of pro and arguments richard f grimmett specialist in national defense foreign affairs and national defense division summary the war powers resolution public w 93148 was enacted by congress over the veto of president nixon on november 7 1973 through more than twentytwo years of experience the resolution has remained focus of controversy on the war powers of the president and congress under the constitution1 major areas of controversy include the constitutionality of some provisions the proper roles for the president and congress in entering armed conflicts the effect on us military operations and the effectiveness of the resolution in achieving its purpose of assuring that the collective judgment of the congress and the president apply to the introduction of us armed forces into hostilities in the postcold war era the relationship of the war powers resolution to us participation in militarypeacekeeping ac tivities under the auspices of the united nations as well as peacekeeping operations in general have become an issue this report lists major arguments for and agai nst the resolution this report will not be updated pro the war powers resolution seeks to carry out article i section 8 of the constitution which grants congress the power to declare war and to make all laws necessary for carrying into execution the powers vested by the constitution in the government the founding fathers gave congresscon the war powers resolution is unconstitutional because it impedes the ability of the president to carry out his function as commander in chief granted by article ii section 2 of the constitution the war powers resolution attempts to take away authorities that the president hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96494crs2 the power to declare war so that the president alone could not commit the nation to war the war powers resolution is necessary to reverse the trend since world war ii for presidents to send armed forces into conflicts abroad without congressiona l authorizationexercised for 200 years throughout american history presidents have used us forces abroad without declaration of war or other congressional authorization when necessary to protect american citizens or defend us interests the war powers resolution permits adequate flexibility by recognizing the presidents right to respond to national emergency created by attack upon the united states its territories or its armed forces the war powers resolution impedes the presidents flexibility to respond quickly and decisively to world events by providing for congressional consultation and authorization for sustained deployments into hostilities it encourages foreign adversaries to continue their activities until us mandatory withdrawal deadlines are reached the war powers resolution has been effective in encouraging presidents to consider the opinion of congress prior to engaging in conflict and in some instances in restraining the size or duration of military commitments presidents have reported consistent with the war powers resolution on more than sixty occasionsthe war powers resolution has been ineffective because it has not prevented presidents from undertaking military actions wit hout congressional approval and it has not brought about consultation prior to decisions except in the mayaguez incident presidents have never repor ted under section 4a1 that they have introduced forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities collective judgment and the support of congress and the president are essential to effective conduct of wars and the war powers resolution seeks to assure that both branches share in making the decision from the beginningthe war powers resolution hinders effectiv conduct of military operations abroad the resolution is not necessary because congress has ample opportunity through resolutions authorizing legislation and appropriations to shape decisions on the use of armed forces the war powers resolution provides framework of procedures to obtain congressional advice and authorization for military actions abroad in timely fashionthe war powers resolution diverts congressiona l debate from the merits of specific courses of action and focuses attention on prerogatives and procedures the power of the purse provideshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96494crs3 the war powers resolution provides method for congress to bring about the end of any commitment of forces into hostilities or imminent hostilitiescongress opportunity to halt any military action it disapproves so the war powers resolution is not necessary the war powers resolution provides time limit for using forces without first obtaining congressional authorization and this time limit provides important leverage for congress after the president reports under the war powers resolution or should have reported that he has introduced forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities the forces must be withdrawn within 60 to 90 days unless congress declares war or authorizes the forces to remain it is unconstitutional to require that forces be withdrawn within 60 to 90 days because of congressional inaction the time limit is arbitrary and inflexible and assures adversaries that if they wa it out th time limit us forces will be withdrawn some members object that the time limit has in practice given the president 60 free days in which he can use forces without congressiona l authorization section 5c of the war powers resolution provides that at any time congress by concurrent resolution can direct the president to withdraw forces from hostilities this is not legislative veto because there is delegation of authority as in other legislative vetoes rulemaking suspension of deportation etc where congress placed condition on delegated authority if members want to act by joint resolution that procedure already exists in section 1013 of pl 98164 signed november 22 1983 the war powers resolution is unconstitutional because section 5c is legislative veto providing for action to withdraw forces from hostilities by concurrent resolution of congress concurrent resolution does not require presentation to the president for signature and thus such measure does not go through the full legislative process in ins v chadha and related cases the supreme court declared legislative vetoes unconstitutional if the war powers resolution has been less effective than its supporters originally hoped it is b ecause presidents have not complied with all its provisions or because congress has not had the will to take the decisions necessary to enforce it if either the president or congress would observe the legislation the resolution could be effective in assuring that both branches supported military actionlaws such as the war powers resolution are attempts by congress to micromanage foreign policy and to force consultation and cooperation such cooperation ca nnot be mandated by legal linedrawing but must be based on recognition of shared responsibilities attitude s of trust and mutual goalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96494crs4 the war powers resolution is essentially sound and any necessary steps to adapt its functioning to the new postcold war world could be taken through minor amendments or without amending the resolution itself such measures might include establishing standing consultative group or specifying congressional procedures in the united nations participation actthe war powers resolution is vestige of the vietnam war era and not suited to the new world situation in which us involvement in hostilities may often be part of multilateral effort the postcold war era requires greater flexibility for the president to make rapid decisions that may entail the use of forces in new and varied ways
