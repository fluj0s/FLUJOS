founded in 1964 as an exclusively african institution most african countries had just become independent amid great optimism about the continents economic prospects however poor african economic performance during the banks early years soon made it clear that an exclusively african membership would be unable to achieve level of creditworthiness for afdb bonds sufficient to generate adequate resources consequently in 1973 the united states and other donor countries from outside africa were invited to join the banks concessional lending facility the afdf the nonconcessional lending facility the afdb was still restricted to african countries the united states declined to join the afdf until 1976 for several years canada was the largest donor country in 1980 the afdb opened itself to membership by countries outside africa today the bank has 53 african members including both the north af rican and the subsaharan countries and 24 nonregional members the latter include all of the major donors of development aid to africa the fund has 27 contributing members including 25 nonafrican countries and south africa g24g152g157g146g151g144g561 in the afdb group every member state is repres ented on the board of governors typically by the states finance minister the board of governors is the highest decisionmaking body dayto day management of the afdb group is handled by the boards of directors the board of directors also known as the executive board of the afdb is composed of 18 executive directors eds twelve members are elected by the governors of regional countries and six by the governors of nonregional member countries directors are elected for three years terms that are renewable once the board of directors of the afdf is compos ed of twelve eds nonregional donor nations select six eds thus while african eds hold ma jority of the votes on the afdb board 12 of 18 60 in the afdf voting is evenly split be tween the six african and six nonafrican eds

bank faced what has been called midlife crisis after nonregional members lost confidence in its lending policies and management practices many african countries had experienced severe economic and budgetary problems for years resulting in part from inappropriate economic po licies and also from external factors including high oil prices and low prices for their commodity exports african countries were becoming increasingly uncreditworthy yet the afdb had continued to extend nonconcessional loans to them by 1994 afdb arrears had reached 700 million twice their level in 1992 4 short of resources the afdb group made virtually loans in 1994 in april 1995 the us general accounting office issued report that called the bank solvent but vulnerable and criticized an afdb governance system that allowed borrowers to control decisionmaking5 from 1993 to1999 the united states made almost contributions to the afdb group in the mid1990s the united states led other nonregional members in decision to suspend negotiations on new afdf replenishment for the afdf until the bank agreed to sweeping institutional reforms congress rescin ded half of the fy1995 appropriation for the afdf in august 1995 after nine rounds of voting bank members elected omar kabbaj moroccan financial official who advocated management and fiscal reforms at the bank in may 2000 kabbaj was unanimously reelected for second fiveyear term during his tenure kabbaj won widespread praise from financial analysts and nonregional governments for his success in implementing promised reforms nonregional endorsement of kabbajs reform agenda came at the may 1998 annual meeting when the board of governors agreed to the fifth general capital increase gciv of the afdb representing 35 boost in the banks resources the increase will if fully funded increase the nonregional share in the banks capital from 33 to 40 thus 4 philip english and harris m mule the african development bank boulder colorado

governors6 moreover at the insistence of the nonregional members decisions on bank operations are to be taken by 66 majority while crucial decisions such as increasing the afdb quota would require the approval of 70 of shareholders7 thus there would have to be at least some nonregional support for major bank actions these modifications to the banks african character were initially opposed by some regional members but eventually won enough support from regional member nations to pass us contributions to the african development fund resumed in fy1998 and the funding levels in recent years have made the fund small but important component of the overall us economic assistance program for africa in 2003 the us office of management and budget omb completed program assessment rating tool part examination of the afdf 8 while omb gave the fund high scores in program management 100 and program purpos and design 80 lower scores were recorded for strategic planning 63 and program results 33 leading to total program score of 59 and an overall rating of results not demonstrated the us department of the treasury points out in its fy2008 budget request however that the part evaluation was

than the world bank and the major bilateral donors furthermore the bank has long been considered to be the least capable of the regional development banks the future effectiveness of the afdb largely rests on its ability to delineate its role in crowded aid field populated by larger multilateral donors the united nations and the world bank regional donors such as the european union and the bilateral programs of the major donors in order to define clearer afdb mission in october 2006 current afdb group president donald kabaruka appointed an eminent persons group to advise him on the banks future the group chaired by former mozambican president juaquim chissano and former canadian prime minister paul martin released its final report in fall 2007 the panel commends the bank for moving in this direction by increasing its work in recent years in areas where it has proven expertise primarily infrastructure construction including transportation water and energy services while leaving other issues such as hivaids policy to the world bank or single sector funds such as the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria key concern of president kaberuka and the chissanomartin report is that the afdb has excess capacity and the afdf has excess dema nd meaning that the rift between african 6 while most analysts agree that the reforms introduced by kabbaj were successful not all donors have completed their contributions to gciv as of the end of afdb group fy2006 arrears to the bank were around 4783680 7 africa research bulletin economic series mayjune 1998

thus the afdb is sitting on large underutilized reserves for the 15 countries that qualify for afdb financing at the same time there is insufficient funding for afdf borrower countries to address this kaberuka and the panel propose merging the regular and concessional lending facilities into single fund any attempt to merge the lending facilities would require the approval of the executive board further complication is the temporary status of the banks headquarters although legally based in abidjan côte divoire civil war in that country prompted the bank to temporarily move its headquarters to tunis tunisia in 2003 lack of final settlement of the ivorian political crisis has to date prevented the bank from returning to its permanent location at the same time while the tunisian government would reportedly be happy to have the bank permanently relocate to tunis the ivorian government has blocked the move until settlement is reached on the banks permanent home continued tension will likely make staff recruitment more challenging given the wealth of alternative opportunities for welltrained development economists lastly some observers question if there is need for regional development bank for africa or if the united states should contribute to such an institution in their view the united states might better focus its funding on bilateral assistance programs or perhaps the world banks concessional aid facility the international development agency ida where us influence as shareholder is greater than at the afdb in 2006 ida committed 35 billion in loans and 11 billion in grants to africa doubling of aid from 2000 levels at the same time the afdb group approved total of 14 billion in loans grants and investments advocates of continued role for the afdb group argue that even though it cannot match other donors in the sum of total loans provided the afdb africas bank with an af rican president has unique understanding of african needs they contend that african governments more readily accept the banks advice they also argue that it is useful for the united states to be seen in africa as supporter of homegrown african development institution others contend though that nonregional aid donors can be just as effective as local institution furthermore they may be less susceptible to corruption and nepotism charges that have plagued the afdb group in the past g5g145g146g151g138g561g138g151g141g561g3g143g155g146g140g138g561 many in the international aid community are concerned that new chinese assistance may undermine various ongoing western and

the 2007 afdb group meeting in shanghai this followed on the heels of the november 2006 china africa summit where china announced its intention to double aid to africa by 2009 and provide 2 billion in

for example policy experts at the mdbs argue that if new chinese assistance is nonconcessional shortterm and at rates that poor countries cannot afford over the longterm china may undermine recent decreases in african indebtedness produced by western donorfinanced debt relief agreements by contrast african policy makers have consistently expressed their appreciation for chinese assistance which they see as less conditional less onerous and at lower rates than mdb or western aid in many cases china can build roads and largescale infrastructure more cheaply than mdb or western donors and african policymakers appreciate the lack of political social or economic conditions attached to chinese loans some scholars argue that concerns raised by the mdbs and western donors represent primarily china bashing and fears that as china plays more prominent role in africa western influence will decrease 12 regardless of political intentions little is known about the structure and terms of new chinese lending and engagement and better cooperation with china will likely be challenge facing the afdb as it struggles to help overcome the larger structural and socioeconomic impediments to
