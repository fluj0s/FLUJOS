it wont be the end of the episode tim original message subject re data request to science for 1120514 from jesse smith hjsmithaaasorg date mon march 6 2006 803 pm to tosbornueaacuk dear dr osborn thank you for your clear and careful response to the requests made by dr mcintyre which we forwarded to you it was quite satisfactory we believe and will greatly help brooks hanson in crafting his reply to dr mcintyre i hope that this will be the end of this episode but if it is not we will be in touch again best regards jesse smith dr jesse smith senior editor science 1200 new york avenue nw washington dc 20005 usa 202 3266556 202 4081256 fax hjsmithaaasorg tim osborn tosbornueaacuk 332006 112217 am dear jesse smith and brooks hanson thank you for your patience while waiting for our reply before responding to the specific data requests we would like to say that it is our view that we should provide sufficient data to enable all the main elements of our analysis to be checked but that we are not obliged to provide the data that would enable the research reported in other papers to be checked even if we cite those other papers or use results reported in those other papers you will see how this view has determined our response to some of the requests now to the requests themselves numbered according to the numbering system of steve mcintyres email 1 as you know we provided in advance of publication the 14 smoothed and normalised proxy records to wdcpaleo that enable the main parts of our analysis to be replicated the only part of our analysis for which the unsmoothed data are required is to calculate the correlations against temperature that we reported for some of the series not those that had already been reported by mann and jones as indicated in our table s1 these unsmoothed data for all 14 series are now also archived at wdcpaleo which will enable those correlations that we reported in table s1 to be checked these unsmoothed data were archived on thursday 23rd february in response to request by different colleague this should cover this request in full 2 our table s1 provides the full citation to the source of our data funnily enough given in the column labelled data source some of these may or may not have publicly archived their data but our wdcpaleo entry now contains the series that we were originally provided with ie the unsmoothed data that we refer to in item 1 above the orig source column in our table was our effort to ensure that original work on collectingprocessing these data is acknowledged because it is important for us to acknowledge that work even when we obtained the data from secondary study we did not intend to imply that the data that we had used would match the data in these original sources because various different versions might exist due eg to different methods of processing the data or due to updated measurements etc that is why we made the source of our data clear ac we have not yet had time to double check the itrdb citations that we provided for these three records but we will do so as soon as we have time our data source was in fact esper et 2002 and this is correct so the concern over the accuracy of these itrdb citations does not limit the ability for others to check our work df the original studies that we cite are definitely correct for these two records we have provided sufficient data for our analysis of these records to be checked we have not provided extra data to enable other peoples studies to be checked nor do we feel obliged to do so g these series from esper et 2002 were considered by us and then rejected as we understand it esper et have made available their site rcs records and therefore these four records could be obtained from esper et if this is not the case we could provide these four rejected series 3 darrigo et 2006 do not report directly opposite findings in respect to the correlations we obtain for jaemtland and borealupperwright neither paper reports any correlations involving these series versus temperature both papers list more than one reason why series might be rejected for example our reasons were we removed series from s1 that did not correlate positively with their local annual or summer temperatures table s1 or which did not extend into the period with instrumental temperature to allow correlation to be calculated the latter is our reason for excluding jaemtland not the former the jaemtland series that we obtained from esper et 2002 has data after 1827 and so correlation was calculated the jaemtland series used by darrigo et continues through to 1978 due to the inclusion of additional data similarly darrigo et list number of reasons for excluding series but they do not state which ones were used to exclude boreal and upperwright though in fact none disagreed with our criteria anyway we have not separately stored the temperature time series used to obtain the correlations reported in our table s1 and to do so requires some changes to our program which we have not done because there does not appear to be need to do so given our explanation above of the situation regarding our paper versus darrigo et 2006 because steve mcintyre has explicitly stated that he is unable to verify our results for the borealupperwright case we have extracted the temperatures we used for that case only and attach them here as text file we hope that he can use them to reassure himself about the correlations that we obtained 4 we explicitly state that we did not use the esper et 2002 jasper series so there is expectation that they should be identical esper et 2002 have we believe made their version available and we have made available the series that we used via wdcpaleo b similarly we explicitly state that we did not used the esper et 2002 tornetrask series and data are available as for c we are not obliged to confirm anything that esper et 2002 did 5 this request is not relevant to our paper as discussed at the start of this email 6 same as 5 we hope that we have dealt with these requests to more than satisfactory extent but please let us know if you feel that we should do more best regards tim osborn and keith briffa at 1930 23022006 you wrote dear dr osborn we have just received an email from steve mcintyre pasted below with long and very specific list of alleged deficiencies in the availability of data by which to evaluate your recent paper the spatial extent of 20thcentury warmth in the context of the past 1200 years and others wishing to deal with this issue in conscientious and reasonable way we are passing the email along to you as request for data without taking position on the validity of any particular point we would like to have your confidential response to this request keeping in mind the stated policy of science that any reasonable request for materials methods or data necessary to verify the conclusions of the experiments reported must be honored please return your response by email directly to and cc brooks hanson our deputy editor mailtobhansonaaasorgbhansonaaasorg we appreciate your cooperation as well as the time and effort that reply may take feel free to contact if you have any questions about this issue sincerely jesse smith start of email from s mcintyre dear dr hanson thank you for your prompt response to my letter in respect to osborn and briffa 2006 esper et 2002 and thompson et 1989 1997 i appreciate your efforts in this and realize that you are frustrated at being criticized however if you reflect on the matter im sure that you will agree that the problem stems entirely from the original authors failing to comply with sciences data archiving policy it will come as surprise to you that i do not believe that the additional data useful as it is comes anywhere near discharging sciences obligations under its data policies for reasons that i will set out in detail below i will discuss the shortfalls in connection with what i understand to be one of sciences governing policies httpwwwsciencemagorgfeaturecontribinfoprepgen_infodtldatadephttpwwwsciencemagorgfeaturecontribinfoprepgen_infodtldatadep science supports the efforts of databases that aggregate published data for the use of the scientific community therefore before publication large data sets must be deposited in an approved database and an accession number provided for inclusion in the published paper since the issue pertains to how science discharges its policies it is my position that you rather than the original authors are the appropriate arbiter of that additionally the authors have refused all requests in the past and i see reason why their behavior would now differ status of each request 1 digital versions of all 14 series as used in their final compilations i have inspected the archive at ftpftpncdcnoaagovpubdatapaleocontributions_by_authorosborn2006osborn2006txtftpftpncdcnoaagovpubdatapaleocontributions_by_authorosborn2006osborn2006txt to which you directed this consists of smoothed and rescaled versions of the 14 series and is relevant to the request but does not satisfy it the authors specifically discuss correlations of these series to temperature which requires consideration of the presmoothed series accordingly i reiterate my original request for digital versions of the 14 series 2 for each of the tree ring sites analysed both the 11 retained and esper site not used including gotland jaemtland mackenzie mts and zhaschiviersk an exact data citation to public archive eg wdcp for the data set used or in the alternative an archive of the data set at the science website in cases where the publicly archive dataset for site is related to but different from the version used by osborn and briffa please archive the data set as used i was able to reasonably reconcile the smoothed series to original sources in public archives and accordingly have issue with data provenance for the following osborn and briffa series the mann pc1 1 5 chesapeake 6 fishers greenland o18 stack 7 netherlands documentary 14 yangs china composite although there are problems in the thompson series used in this composite for other users less familiar with nuances of series versions i recommend that the si be modified to provide accurate data citations for these 5 series the problems mostly pertain to tree ring data which make up the other 9 series in three cases osborn and briffa provided data citations for sites in public archives 4 quebec cana169 8 tirol germ21 11 mangazeja russ067 russ068 in each of these 3 cases the esper version reconciles to the osborn version up to rescaling however they do not reconcile to the original data sets the dataset germ21 cited by osbornbriffa for series 8 tirol has values from 1466 to 1837 while the archived version goes from 1324 to 1975 obviously the data set has not been cited accurately or is incomplete b the series cana169 goes from 1352 to 1989 while the osborn version 4 quebec goes from 1352 to 1947 again it appears that the data set has not been cited accurately or is incomplete additionally while i have been able to substantially replicate the features of other rcs chronologies my efforts to reproduce the archived result from cana169 lead to series with significantly different shape c one of the two cited data sets russ067 does not contain measurements at wdcp however the versions mangazla and mangazpc in the schweingruber section of wdcp appear to have the data for russ067 and russ068 however these data sets only yield values from 1246 to 1969 while the archived osborn version 11 mangazeja goes from 1246 to 1990 some additional data must exist somewhere but has not been archived at wdcp to date two sites 9 tornetrask 13 mongolia have wdcp measurement archives swed019 mong003 respectively but there are inconsistencies between the data as archived and the length of the osborn and briffa versions d the wdcp archive for tornetrask ends in 1990 which is inconsistent with the osborn version which ends in 1993 this indicates that the data sets are not the same similarly the wdcp archive for sol dav mongolia begins in 900 while the osborn version begins in 800 for the following 5 sites archive of the measurements exists at all direct breach of sciences archiving policy f jaspericefields boreal upper wright taimyr yamal accordingly i reiterate my request that the measurement data consistent with the archived site chronologies be archived for each of the above items 2a 2f as well as corresponding information for the following 4 sites considered in osborn and briffa g gotland jaemtland mackenzie zhaschiviersk 3 digital versions of the specific gridcell temperature series used in each of the reported temperature correlations together with version date as noted in my previous request darrigo et 2006 have reported directly opposite findings in respect to the correlation between their rcs chronology and gridcell temperature for jaemtland and the two foxtail series i have specifically been unable to verify their claim in respect to bristlecones accordingly i reiterate the request for the digital versions of the temperature data used in these calculations in connection with similar request nature required mann et to archive the exact temperature data used in mbh98 4 exact data citations to public archive for all datasets used or if such do not exist an archive of the data set at the science website while most osborn versions match esper versions up to rescaling they differ in three cases and separate esper version is required in two of them the esper version for the jasper data is different than the osborn and briffa version as noted in osborn and briffa and both data sets need to be made available b similarly there are differences between the version of the tornetrask series archived by esper and the one archived by osborn again requiring examination of both data sets c the polar urals version of esper differs from the yamal version of briffa it is possible that the esper version used combination of data sets russ021 and russ176 if so would you please confirm this 5 clear and operational definition distinguishing linear and nonlinear trees preferably with source code showing any differences in methodology while the provision of site chronologies for 13 esper sites is appreciated one site mongolia was unaccountably omitted the corresponding information is requested while the provision of the site chronologies was interesting and appreciated according to my reading of esper et 2002 these site chronologies were not used in the calculations in the article which distinguished between linear and nonlinear operational definition is provided combined with the unavailability of the bulk of the data the calculations of linear and nonlinear chronologies cannot be replicated even from the recent information regarding esper et 2002 and this remains unresolved 6 thompson provides complete archive of both dunde and guliya ice cores including both isotope and chemical data while i appreciate that thompson has provided sample information on only 2 kilimanjaro cores he did not provide the requested accompanying chemical information necessary for their interpretation the kilimanjaro data is obviously of little help with the dunde and guliya data the us global change research program required archiving of data commencing in 1991 and the world data center for paleoclimatology has been in existence since then and has been online since 1994 accordingly there was an adequate facility for the archiving of the guliya core when it was published in 1997 i realize that the dunde core was published in 1989 at time when your present archiving policies were not in effect however thompson has published versions of this series in other journals which are inconsistent with the version published in science i cannot imagine that you are content with such situation even if you did not have policies at the time i am sure that you can give very firm request to thompson and i find it difficult to believe that thompson would refuse direct request from science to provide this data if he has refused direct request then that too is relevant information upon which i would appreciate confirmation again i apologize for putting you in the middle of this and for the public nature of the exchange however some of this has been going on far too long with minimal results leaving alternative however i assure you that i will be equally public in commending you if and when you resolve matters in my opinion you should simply do the following 1 send copy of your data archiving policy to each of the authors osbornbriffa esper et and thompson 2 tell osbornbriffa and esper et that you expect them to comply with the policy which was in effect at the time of publication or else you will retract the article 3 tell thompson that if he wants to publish at science in the future he should immediately clean up his archive for the earlier articles obviously there has been some inadequate housekeeping in the past i can understand this and my concern is not with the past my concern is with the present you have an opportunity to remedy the situation now and one will criticize science for ensuring that paleoclimate authors meet sciences data archiving policies on the other hand you will be justly criticized both by and others if you dont do so regards stephen mcintyre end of email from s mcintyre dr jesse smith senior editor science 1200 new york avenue nw washington dc 20005 usa 202
