house shall constitute quorum to do business the senate presumes that it is complying with this requirement and that quorum always is present unless and until the absence of quorum is suggested or demonstrated this presumption allows the senate to conduct its business on the floor with fewer than 51 senators present until senator suggests the absence of quorum when the absence of quorum is suggested the presiding officer directs the clerk to call the roll except when the senate has invoked cloture the presiding officer may not count to determine if quorum is present the senate cannot resume its business until majority of senators respond to the quorum call or unless by unanimous consent further proceedings under the quorum call are dispensed with before the last senators name has been called if quorum fails to respond the senate may adjourn or take steps necessary to secure the attendance of enough senators to constitute quorum usually the senate will then have roll call vote on agreeing to motion that instructs the sergeant at arms to request the attendance of absent senators the results of that vote typically establish that quorum is present so the sergeant at arms rarely needs to go looking for absent senators typically quorum calls are not used to bring senators to the floor but rather as kind of time out while the senate is in session senators suggest the absence of quorum to suspend the senates formal floor proceedings temporarily there are many purposes for such quorum calls for example they can be used to permit informal discussions that are intended to resolve policy disagreement or procedural problem or to allow senator to reach the floor in order to make speech or begin consideration of bill when quorum call is used for such purpose it usually is ended by unanimous consent before the call of the roll has been completed the constitution also provides that the yeas and nays of the members of either house on any question shall at the desire of one fifth of those present be entered on the journal any senator who has been recognized may ask for the yeas and nays on whatever question the senate is considering if the yeas and nays are ordered at the request of at least 11 senators onefifth of the minimum quorum of 51 that determines the manner in which the vote will be conducted the timing of the vote is not determined by this request senator may offer an amendment and immediately ask for the yeas and nays even if the vote is not expected to take place until hours or days later if the yeas and nays are not ordered the senate votes on questions by voice vote alternatively if the presiding officer believes that the outcome is not in doubt he or she may say that without objection the amendment or motion etc is agreed to if any senator does object formal vote ensues httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96452g24g152g157g146g151g144g561g138 g151g141g561g19g158g152g155g158g150g561g18g155g152g140g142g141g158g155g142

practices of the senate governing quorums and voting are grounded in article i of the constitution1 regarding quorums clause 1 of section 5 states in part that majority of each house shall constitute quorum to do business but smaller number may adjourn from day to day and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members in such manner and under such penalties as each house may provide regarding voting clause 3 of the same section provides in part that the yeas and nays of th members of either house on any question shall at the desire of one fifth of those present be entered on the journal this report discusses how the senate now interprets and implements these two constitutional provisions 2 what follows focuses on the most important rules and the most common practices it does not attempt to cover all the precedents the senate has established or all the procedures that may be invoked 3 this report also assumes familiarity with some other aspects of the senates floor procedures g22g145g142g561g19g158g152g155g158g150g561g20g142g154g158g146g155g142g150g142g151g157g561g138g151g141g561g19g158g152g155g158g150g561g5g138g149g149g156g561 straightforward reading of the constitutions quorum requirement would seem to require simple majority of senators or minimum of 51 if there are vacancies in the body to be present on the floor whenever the senate conducts business as any observer of the senate soon notices typically only handful of senators are pr esent during floor debates it is unusual for as many as 51 senators to be present on the floor at the same time unless rollcall vote is in progress as regular practice however the senate presumes that it is complying with the constitution therefore it presumes that quorum always is present unless and until the absence of quorum is suggested or demonstrated the senate operates on the presumption that quorum is present at all times under all circumstances unless the question to the contrary is raised or the absence of quorum is officially shown or until point of quorum is made even though voice vote is taken and announced in the meantime 4 under the senates standing rules if other senator has the floor5

present unless the senate is operating under cloture7 at all other times when senator suggests the absence of quorum the presiding officer responds by directing the clerk to call the roll paragraph 3 of rule vi requires that if at any time during the daily sessions of the senate question shall be raised by any senator as to the presence of quorum the presiding officer shall forthwith direct the secretary to call the roll and shall announce the result and these proceedings shall be without debate quorum call formally begins when the clerk calls the first name once the quorum call has begun the senate may not resume the conduct of business until majority of senators respond to this call or unless the senate agrees by unanimous consent to dispense with further proceedings under the quorum call while the quorum call is in progress debate or motion is in order nor may the senate act on any unanimous consent request except request to dispense with the call g20g152g158g157g146g151g142g561g19g158g152g155g158g150g561g5g138g149g149g156g561 quorum calls in the senate usually are not intended to secure the presence of senators on the floor instead they are useful and essential device by which the senate can suspend its formal proceedings temporarily during the course of any session senators often suggest the absence of quorum later but before the clerk has completed the alphabetical call of the roll the senate agrees to unanimous consent request to rescind the quorum call quorum call of this kind may last for only moments or it may continue for an hour or more the clerk calls the names of senators very slowly because it is not really the intent of the senate to demonstrate quorum rather the goal is to get time out from the formal floor proceedings because most quorum calls are intended to suspend the senates floor proceedings senators feel under obligation to come to the floor to record their presence so long as the senate agrees by unanimous consent to dispense with the quorum call before the last senators name is called the senate can resume its business because the absence of quorum has not actually been demonstrated the presumption that majority of senators is present remains in force unless and until the call of the roll is completed and less than majority of senators have responded only then would it be demonstrated that the senator was correct when he or she suggested the absence of quorum there are many reasons why senators initiate quorum calls of this kind for example if senator completes statement and notices that one else is on the floor and seeking recognition the senator typically suggests the absence of quorum when another senator then does appear and wishes to speak he or she first asks unanimous consent to dispense with the quorum call that is in progress alternatively quorum call may take place while the senate awaits the arrival of senator who is expected on the floor to manage bill offer an amendment or make speech when that senator arrives the senate dispenses with the quorum call by unanimous consent and proceeds with its business as planned continued 6 for more

g345g561quorum calls also create valuable opportunity for informal discussions and negotiations among senators when the senate majority leader is trying to win the approval of his colleagues for unanimous consent agreement on particular bill and senator objects to the unanimous consent request the leader will frequently suggest the absence of quorum and allow quorum call to begin then he can speak directly with the senator who had objected and find out if they can reach an agreement on the issue so as to allow the unanimous consent agreement to proceed the senates rules and especially the opportunities they create for filibusters provide powerful incentives for senators to seek the widest possible agreement on the senates schedule as well as its policy decisions under most circumstances any senator can conduct filibuster against any measure or amendment or even against the motion that the senate begin floor consideration of particular bill or resolution this situation encourages senators to seek the most generally acceptable solutions to procedural problems and policy disagreements in seeking these solutions it often is more convenient for senators to engage in the necessary discussions and negotiations in an informal manner rather than under the rules of formal senate debate quorum calls allow for such informal consultations which may take place either on or off the senate floor when the senate finds itself confronted with procedural problem or policy disagreement senator often will respond by suggesting the absence of quorum in the hope that the matter can be resolved through informal conversations when the conversations end the senate agrees to unanimous consent request to terminate the quorum call the senates formal proceedings then resume if the discussions were successful senator may make motion or unanimous consent request that embodies whatever decision was reached during the quorum call if the discussions were inconclusive senator may report on the progress that was made and then again suggest the absence of quorum so that the negotiations can resume because of quorum calls the senates floor proceedings often have an unpredictable stopand go character its debates frequently are punctuated by quorum calls on occasion the senate even may spend much of the day in quorum calls this frequent apparent lack of action does not mean that senators are not considering legislation while the quorum calls are in progress it is quite likely that many senators are discussing the bill at issue or the procedures for considering it however they are doing so informally and off the public record whether on or off the senate floor in fact it sometimes seems that the more contentious the issue the senate is considering the more time is consumed by quorum calls there are two circumstances under which senator may not be able to initiate quorum call when one else has control of the floor first when the senate is operating under cloture senator may suggest the absence of quorum but the presiding officer is empowered to respond by counting to determine whether or not quorum actually is present only if he or she finds that quorum is not present does the presiding officer direct the clerk to call the roll also under cloture the presiding officer may decline to entertain quorum calls on the ground that they are suggested for dilatory purposes an authority that is likely to be exercised only under unusual circumstances second when the senate is operating under time agreement only senator who controls some of the time for debate may suggest the absence of quorum time agreement is unanimous consent agreement that limits and allocates control of the time for debating the pending question the time consumed by the quorum call is charged to the senator who suggested the absence of quorum unless the senate agrees otherwise by unanimous consent for this reason the senates precedents indicate that senator must control at least 10 minutes of remaining time in order to httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96452g24g152g157g146g151g144g561g138 g151g141g561g19g158g152g155g158g150g561g18g155g152g140g142g141g158g155g142

g346g561initiate quorum call this requirement evidently is intended to reflect some reckoning of how long quorum call is expected to last8

live quorum call in which senators actually are requested to come to the floor and record their presence there are three circumstances under which live quorum calls are most likely to occur first the senates rules provide for live quorum call immediately preceding any cloture vote and before the senate acts on unanimous consent request to set date for voting on whether to pass bill or joint resolution both these quorum calls may be dispensed with by unanimous consent which is frequently done when setting date for vote and sometimes done prior to cloture second the majority leader occasionally suggests the absence of quorum and announces that the quorum call is to be live because he wishes to bring senators to the floor for some reason third should the clerk complete calling the roll for routine quorum call without majority of senators having responded to their names the quorum call may become live one in the case of live quorum call the clerk calls senators names more quickly at the end of the call the senate resumes its business if majority of senators have responded however if the clerk finishes calling the roll and the presiding officer announces that majority of senators have failed to respond the senate cannot resume its business including debate nor can it dispense with the quorum call by unanimous consent because the absence of quorum has been established in that event the senate usually has only two options to adjourn or to take steps necessary to establish quorum 9 the usual recourse is for the majority leader to make motion directing the sergeant at arms to request the attendance of absent senators10 rollcall vote is ordered on this motion and almost invariably majority of senators do come to the floor to vote on the motion in the process they demonstrate the presence of quorum then further action on the quorum call is necessary quorum having been established11 8 but it has been equally well established by the precedents that any senator has right to call for quorum before vote begins even if that senator controlled time or even if there was an order that vote occur at time certain however certain unanimous consent agreements have been interpreted to preclude quorum calls riddicks senate procedure p 1038 for more on initiating quorum calls under time agreements and charging the time they consume see ibid pp 10661071 9 under paragraph 4 of rule vi the senate also may consider and agree to motion to recess pursuant to previous order entered by unanimous consent 10 it is the practice in the senate for the presiding officer to direct the clerk to call the names of the absent senators prior to the adoption of an order directing the sergeant at arms to request and when necessary to compel their attendance but such practice is based on custom and not on the requirement of any rule riddicks senate procedure p 216 11 riddicks senate procedure p 223

sergeant at arms to compel the attendance of absent senators or even to arrest absentees in order to establish quorum12 in modern practice however it rarely is necessary for the senate to resort to such motions generally once quorum is established as result of rollcall vote or live quorum call the senate must transact some business before another quorum call is in order13 however if the senate dispenses with quorum call by unanimous consent before it is completed senator again may suggest the absence of quorum without business having intervened

conduct votes on the floor by voice vote by division vote or by rollcall vote in practice contested questions usually are decided by rollcall votes many uncontested questions are decided without objection and without the formality of even voice vote g24g152g146g140g142g561g138g151g141g561g6g146g159g146g156g146g152g151g561g24g152g157g142g156g561 unless rollcall vote has been ordered in advance any question first is to be put to voice vote the presiding officer asks those in favor to respond aye and then those opposed to respond and then announces the result at that time any senator may request either division vote or rollcall vote in the case of division vote those in favor stand and are counted followed by those opposed the presiding officer then announces which side has prevailed but does not announce the number of senators voting for or against division votes are relatively unusual in current senate practice and are not formally authorized by the senates rules 14 voice or division vote is considered valid matter how many or how few senators participated unless senator takes the initiative to challenge the vote before the result is announced for violating the constitutional requirement that quorum must be present for the senate to do business until point of quorum has been raised the senate operates on the assumption that quorum is present and even if only few senators are present measure may be passed or nomination agreed to voice votes may be take n on the passage of bill and if question of quorum is raised that action is final even though majority of the senators did not participate the senate operates on the absolute assumption that quorum is always present until point of quorum is made 15 12 under the constitutional authority quoted at the beginning of this report quorum need not vote on any motion to secure the attendance of absent senators for more on securing the attendance of absent senators see riddicks senate procedure pp 214224

has been conducted but before the final result has been announced rollcall votes usually are ordered in advance at any time that bill amendment motion or other matter actually is the pending question before the senate senator who has the floor may ask for the yeas and nays on it16 as noted at the beginning of this report the constitution provides for the yeas and nays rollcall vote to be ordered at the request of onefifth of those present because of the other constitutional requirementthat quorum must be present to c onduct businessthe senate assumes that those present constitute quorum and so requires that the request for rollcall vote must be supported by at least onefifth of the smallest possible quorum 17 consequently at least 11 senatorsonefifth of the minimal quorum of 51 senatorsmust raise their hands to support request for rollcall vote18 if there is sufficient support the senate thereby determines that the question then pending before the senate will be decided by rollcall vote whenever the time for voting arrives ordering the yeas and nays on question does t bring about an immediate vote nor does it have any effect at all on when the vote will occur the motion only controls how the vote will be conducted when it does occur19 it is not at all unusual for example for senator to offer an amendment and then immediately ask for the yeas and nays on that amendment even before the debate on it has commenced 20 the actual vote may not take place until hours or even days later or it may not take place at all if for example the senate votes instead to lay the amendment on the table and thereby kill it in principle the support of more than 11 senators sometimes may be required to order roll call if previous rollcall vote had taken place recently21 there is precedent for assuming that all the senators who participated in that vote remained on the floor so onefifth of that number may be required to order the subsequent roll call this precedent is rarely invoked if the required number of senators fail to support request for rollcall vote any senator may renew the request as often as necessary at any time before the question is put to vote when 16 riddicks senate procedure p 1419 senator loses the floor when he or she asks for the yeas and nays 17 in the absence of quorum however onefifth of the senators present may demand the yeas and nays on any of the few motions that are in order such as the motion to adjourn 18 it is within the discretion of the chair to decide whether there is sufficient second to order rollcall vote and in practice votes are frequently ordered when there do not appear to be 11 senators on the floor to support such request but it is up to the chair to make that decision and it is not customary for the chair to announce the number of senators who held up their hands to order the yeas and nays riddicks senate procedure p 1418 19 ordering the yeas and nays on an amendment does not preclude senator from moving to table the amendment the yeas and nays have to be ordered separately on the tabling motion 20 before the senate orders the yeas and nays on an amendment the senator who offered it may modify or withdraw it as matter of right after the yeas and nays have been ordered the senator loses the right to modify or withdraw the amendment but gains the right to offer an amendment to his or her own amendment 21 the chair makes his calculations of onefifth of those present on the basis of the number who voted at the last rollcall if that occurred recently riddicks senate procedure p 1418 for example demand for the yeas and nays immediately following call of the senate is seconded by onefifth of those answering such call or immediately following yea and nay vote seconded by onefifth of those voting ibid p 1417 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96452g24g152g157g146g151g144g561g138 g151g141g561g19g158g152g155g158g150g561g18g155g152g140g142g141g158g155g142

yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk will call the roll the clerk proceeds to do so and the vote is deemed to have begun only after senator actually votes when his or her name is called at that time system of bells and lights is activated throughout the senate wing of the capitol building and the senate office buildings to inform senators that they have 15 minutes in which to come to the floor and vote the bells ring again as reminder when half of this time has expired the 15minute period for voting is set by unanimous consent agreement normally on the first day each congress meets during rollcall vote the clerk calls the names of all senators in alphabetical order and then reads the names of those voting in the affirmative followed by those voting in the negative thereafter when another senator wishes to vote he or she comes to the well the open area between the rostrum and senators desks the clerk calls the senators name and then repeats the senators vote senators coming to the well frequently consult tally sheets kept at the tables staffed by republican and democratic floor aides in order to observe how their colleagues are voting 22 every senator is expected to vote on each roll call unless under paragraph 3 of rule xii he believes that his voting on such matter would be conflict of interest if senator declines to vote for any other reason paragraph 2 of the same rule prescribes procedure for the senator to explain his or her reason and for the senate to decide if that reason is sufficient this procedure is very rarely invoked for rollcall vote to be constitutionally valid majority of senators must vote answer present or announce that they have live pairs and refrain from voting for that reason23 if less than majority is present on rollcall vote quorum call usually ensues once quorum is established new vote takes place on the question before the senate in other words the question is put novo 24 the presiding officer may announce the result of the vote at any time after the 15minute period and after inquiring whether there are other senators in the chamber wishing to vote alternatively any senator may demand the regular order which would be to announce the result of the vote 22 senators are required to vote from their desks but this requirement rarely is enforced on occasion when vote of special constitutional importance such as vote to convict in an impeachment trial is about to begin the majority leader will ask all senators to come to the floor before the vo begins and then to vote from their desks each senator rising and responding when his or her name is called see riddicks senate procedure pp 14031404 23 pairing is voluntary arrangement between individual senators to offset their votes on rollcall vote so that if one of the senators needs to be absent it is offset by another member who does not cast his vote when less than quorum votes but the addition of names of senators present and paired and announcing votes made quorum the vote is valid riddicks senate procedure p 1431 24 yea and nay vote by less than quorum is not valid unless sufficient number is present and paired to make quorum riddicks senate procedure p 1075 where less than quorum votes as disclosed by yea and nay vote the next business is for the presiding officer to direct call of the roll to

often is extended long enough to allow as many senators as possible to reach the floor and vote on occasion votes have been left open well beyond the prescribed 15minute period in order to accommodate senators who are hurrying to capitol hill from other locations senator may not have his or her vote recorded after the result of rollcall vote has been announced by unanimous consent however the senate may permit senator who has voted to change or withdraw that vote paragraph 1 of rule xii states in part that senator shall be permitted to vote after the decision shall have been announced by the presiding officer but may for sufficient reasons with unanimous consent change or withdraw his vote motion to suspend this rule shall be in order nor shall the presiding officer entertain any request to suspend it by unanimous consent if the yeas and nays are not ordered on the pending question that usually indicates that there is uncertainty among senators about what the outcome will be in that case when the time comes to act the presiding officer often states that without objection the amendment is agreed to or the bill is passed etc this is merely an abbreviated way of putting the question on voice vote and does not imply that the proposition can be defeated by one objection however any senator may object to putting the question in this manner 25 in which case the question is decided by voice division or rollcall vote immediately after the presiding officer announces the result of vote one senator often makes motion to reconsider another or even the same senator moves to lay that motion on the table and the presiding officer announces that without objection the motion to table is agreed to the senates rules allow it one opportunity to reconsider most of the votes it takes motion to reconsider may be made only by senator who voted on the prevailing side or senator who did not vote when such motion is made and the senate then agrees to table or kill it that consumes the one opportunity to reconsider and makes the result of the vote final in most cases motion to reconsider is made and tabled routinely in the case of very close and seriously contested rollcall vote however there may be another roll call in connection with reconsideration motion 26
