preventionpreparedness4 protecting the marine environment from accidental oil and che mical spills is an important mission of the coast guard along with representatives of 15 other federal depa rtments and agencies the coast guard and the environmental protection agency epa comprise the national response team5 and 13 regional response teams epa serves as the chair and the coast guard is the vicechair of these teams the national contingency plan6 ncp provides the organizational structure and pro cedures for preparing for and responding to discharges of oil and hazardous substances on both water and landhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22145crs3 7 the epa has response authority for inland oil spills the terms inland and coastal are defined in the ncp 40 cfr section 3005 the coastal zone covers all waters subject to the tide the great lakes and all seaward waters extending 200 nautical miles beyond shore the inland zone covers all other us waters 8 other federal agencies oversee other

as the london convention seven amendments from 1978 to 1996 addressed such things as incineration lowle vel radioactive wastes and industrial wastesuscg responsibilities can be divided into two categories 1 spill response and cleanup and 2 spill preventionpreparedness as the primary response authority in maritime waters7 the coast guard has the ultimate authority to ensure that spill is effectively removed and that actions are ta ken to prevent further discharge from the source during response operations the coas t guard coordinates th efforts of federal state and private parties preventing and preparing for spills is so coast guard responsibility and the coast guards jurisdiction covers vessels onshore transportationrelated facilities and deepwater ports8 the coast guards prevention preparedness duties are based on international agreements and federal standards nd regulations recent oil spills in san francisco bay november 2007 and the missi ssippi river july 2008 have generated further interest and debate c oncerning oil spill policy issues such as oil spill response and prevention the coast guard represents the united states at the international maritime organization imo which through treaties sets international environmental and safety standards for vessels important tr eaties cover the following topics accidental and operational oil and chemical pollution9 the right of coastal state to take measures on the high seas to prevent mitigate or eliminate danger to its coastline from pollution by oil10 global cooperative framework for co mbating major incidents or threats of marine pollution from oil and zardous and noxious substances11 and pollution from the dumping of wastes and other materials12 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22145crs4 13 in 2006 8178 individual vessels from 79 different flag states made 78668 port calls to the united states us coast guard 2007 port state control in the united states annual report 2006 p 2 14 cruise ships for example will have dry cleaning and photo processing wastesthe oil pollution act of 1990 opa and the international treaty marpol 7378 require the owners and operato rs of vessels that carry oil and designated hazardous substances to submit to the coast guard v essel response plans andor shipboard oil pollution emergency plans these vesselspecific plans address such matters as spill mitigation procedures training requirements for the crew and spill mitigation equipment required to be carried on board the uscg mu st approve the plans for ship to operate legally in us waters under these authorities vessel operators also must submit to regular inspections and the uscgs inspecti on program is key component of their oil spill prevention effort inspection of foreign ships p ort state control program the coast guard conducts certificate of complian ce examinations both on random and targeted basis on foreign vessels that make port calls in the united states13 the inspection program emphasizes compliance with environmental and sa fety standards and particularly since september 2001 is concerned with port security as well the inspecting officers verify that the vessels and their crews are in substantial compliance with international conventions and applicable us laws the pollution prevention examination covers the various waste stream s onboard and related record keeping which vary for different types of ship s and may include the following oil pollution prevention systems include the oily water separator and the sludge containment system the ily water separator is high maintenance device and ships sometimes alter their piping to bypass the system further pumping oily sludg ashore is expensive and ships have been known to take illegal steps to avoid it the black water system includes marine sanita tion devices and other systems to treat store and discharge sewage hazardous waste includes paints thinners and cleaning solutions that contain hazardous substances the ty pes and volumes of hazardous waste vary depending on the technolog and processes used aboard14 nonhazardous waste is shipboard garbage including food waste plastics and other synthetic materials as well as recyclables like glass and aluminum and steel cans the gray water system includes discharges from the galley sinks showers and baths in recent years cruise ships most of wh ich are registered in foreign countries have gained attention these very large vessels carry up to 5000 passeng ers who generate large amount of sewage and gray water for additional information see crs report rl32450 cruise ship pollution background laws and regulations and key issues by claudia copeland inspection of domestic ships the domestic inspection system is similar to the port state control program in assuring compliance with applicable laws and treatieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22145crs5 15 classification societies are orga nizations that establish and apply technical standards in relation to the design construction and survey of marine related facilities including ships and offshore structures for more information see international association of classification societies what are classification societies at httpwwweagleorgcompanyclassmonographpdf examples include the american bureau of shipping and lloyds register 16 for more discussion on issues regarding management of the trust fund see crs report rl33705 oil spills in us coastal waters background governance and issues for congress by jonathan l ramseur 17 other revenue sources for the fund include inte rest on the fund cost recovery from the parties responsible for the spills and any fines or civil penalties collected 18 national pollution funds center oil spill li ability trust fund osltf annual report fy 2002 fy 2006 fund estimate prepared june 27 2007rules vary according to size and type of ve ssel eg tanker passe nger cargo and mobile offshore drilling units and the number of pa ssengers carried in 1996 the coast guard initiated its alternate co mpliance program acp under which classification societies15 can perform inspections that satisfy certain periodic uscg test and inspection requirements the acp allows the service to shift its emphasis from providing quality control service inspections to evaluating the human factors in maritime operations which account for more than 80 of marine accidents and to port state enforcement national pollution funds center the coast guard created the national pollution funds center npfc in 1991 to carry out many of the re quirements of title i of the oil pollution act of 1990 opa16 the npfc manages the oil spill liability trust fund osltf as well as the coast gu ards use of the superfund trust fund the osltf is primarily used to finance prompt re sponses to oil spills nd to reimburse parties for applicable costs associated with oil spills eg cleanup costs natural resource damages economic losses initially the primary source of revenue fo r the fund was 5centsperbarrel fee on imported and domestic oil17 collection of this fee ceased on december 31 1994 because of sunset provision in the law howeve r in april 2006 the tax resumed as required by the energy policy act of 2005 pl 109 58 at the end of fy2006 the fund had approximately 604 million the npfc projects it to have more than 1 billion by the end of fy200818 to ensure that responsible parties can be held accountable for cleanup costs and damages in the event of an oil spill thereby preserving the oil spill fund opa requires that vessels show evidence of financial responsibility such as insurance the npfc carries out this mandate by issuing certificates of fina ncial responsibility cofrs to shipping vessel owners when owners demonstrate the ability to pay for oil spill cleanup and damages in general vessels over 300 gross tons are required to have valid cofr to operate in us waters the npfc also takes action to recover cl eanup costs from respons ible parties it documents ongoing costs and damages from the spill area and bills the responsible party about 40 of spills in us waters are m ystery spills and the costs go unrecoveredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22145crs6 19 formerly the center for marine conservationmarine debris marine debris eg discarded fishing lines or nets can endanger birds and marine animals and cause damage to coral reefs even less lethal trash from recreational fishing and boatin g such as beverage cans nd bottles food wrappers and foam plastic pieces degrades beaches coral reefs and the oceans the coast guards approach to debris is preventive prom oting compliance by boarding and inspecting vessels and working with local port agencies to ensure there are facilities to receive garbage from vessels the coast guard also coordinates with the environmental protection agency epa the national marine fisheries service the national park service and the ocean conservancy19 in monitoring and measuring amounts of marine debris this activity is authorized in th act to prevent pollution from ships 33 usc 1905 and 1915 as well as marpol annex v marine and environmental science the coast guard has history of scientific study of the oceans dating back to 1881 when it began arctic cruises along the alaska coast today the uscg role is that of facilitator supporting the scientific efforts of other groups moreover many of the ceanographic and other scientific activities conducted by federal agencies including the coast guard were consolidated in 1970 with the creation of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the coast guard operates three icebreakers in the arctic and an tarctic and provides supplies to remote stations the uscg also participates in the international ice patrol which monitors iceberg danger in the northwest atlantic particularly in the area of the grand banks of newfoundland the iceberg s eason is usually from february to july but the ice patrol is logistically flexible and can commence operations when iceberg conditions dictate the coast guard is responsible for forcing federal regulations governing commercial fisheries the uscg carries out some 40006500 boardings per year to ensure compliance with gear and harvest re gulations see crs repor ts referenced above environmental compliance and restoration this activity is concerned with coast guard compliance with environmental laws ongoing initiatives include meeting the more stringent emission requirements of the clean air act amendments of 1990 and developing strategies to minimize the genera tion of hazardous waste there also are continuing efforts to design pollution preven tion into shore facility improvement projects and to conduct environmenta l audits at facilities to find and correct potential environmental violations
