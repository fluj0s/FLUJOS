styles of auditing lecture given on 17 november 1964 thank you whats the date audience november the 17th november the 17th ad 14 saint hill special briefing course and we have lecture here today on the styles of auditing and this is something new that will make actually the training and doing of auditing enormously easier and although it would appear at first glance to be an unnecessary separation and something that is more precise than is needful you will find that any oldtime auditor at one time or another has passed through one of these phases because whatthis is one of those things that have been going on for many many years auditing styles have changed and shifted around and it must be very confusing for somebody to say well what is an auditing style so they think its some individualistic activity and they try to find out if they hold their little finger in the air you see as they present the emeter cans to the pcor something like this dont you see and they think it must be some individualized action well over the years there have been many auditing styles and the reason there have been auditing styles is because processes have changed there have been different processes and they require different styles and therefore at one period of two or three years youll see one auditing style was very much in vogue you know and at another period youll see another one for instance 195556 you saw repetitive command type auditing that was when the trs first came out and everybody was going by the trs at crash you see and so on and then in an acc up in london i found out that these trs were being broken down by auditor interruptions and evaluations and that sort of thing and there were about dozen students on that course thatthe biggest one taught up in londonthat were just not getting any result from the pc at all and i made study of this situation i found out the auditor was getting in the road to the result so we invented something called muzzled auditing and we muzzled them and in actual fact theive forgotten which way it wasi think the auditor who had awho had the right to not be muzzled and talk to the pc had red ribbon around his neck so the instructor wouldnt bawl him out but the others had to audit muzzled and we found out that that style brought about progress and their pcs would progress in other words the repetitive command and so forth all by itself not taking any care of origin and so on would in actual fact bring pc on up the line and this was quite remarkable dont you see so in those particular ease the auditor was preventing the case advance so we got an auditing style called muzzled auditing more recently we had ai did quite bit of work on the auditing comm cycle and looked it over and found out that what auditors werent doing at the lowerlevel processes was listening and we got what has been loosely called amongst auditors itsa an auditing of itsa its perfectly all right to go on calling it that but just recognize its slight misnomer that is just listenstyle and then we have another style that came up in sec checking and prepchecking whereby you steered the pc around and then you did something about what the pc landed in and we worked with this and we wouldhad great deal of trouble by the way because it hadnt been dignified as style so i hadnt actively planned to simply take these various styles and assign them but it couldnt have been done in any event until we had all of the processes and gains and we knew where these things were going well were at that point now so i formulated these auditing styles youll find out that youre repeating to some degree the various types of auditing which were in vogue at one time or another and theyre now fitted to the various levels only theyre fitted to the expected progress of an auditors skill its what can an auditor do at certain level and what new thing does he now have to learn how to do to go up to the next level and then youll find that this is fairly easy to do now for instance one of your confusions about auditing style is that i am sure somewhere or another some instructor has insisted that when you did listenstyle that you werereally did guidingstyle but you arent listeningyou arent doing itsa your itsa is bad because the pc isnt talking interestedly at that timei see im hitting blank spot with all of you see yes ityou got caught in that one youd say well now can this auditor pass itsa and this is probably true through every organization in the world as well as here you see can you pass itsa all right well check this person out on itsa well he flunked itsa well how did he flunk itsa well he flunked itsa because the pc was not talking interestedly so right away this put the poor studentand its probably one of the biggest bugs that auditors have right at this momentputs the student in this terrible thing if youre supposed to sit there and listen well then how in the name of common sense can you do anything you see about the pc being interested or disinterested but yet you couldnt pass itsa you see unless the pc was getting gains and tone arm action so what was this thing you see and whereas putting on the auditor the complete clamps of you see he must listen we then demand tone arm action we then demand an interested pc we then demand case advance we demand now arc breaks we demand the auditing comm cycle be perfect you see you even get repetitive auditing in there well what happened actually is you of course being instructedhowever not you particularlybut students out through organizations were being instructed very carefully byand with great sincerityby auditors who of course were quite experienced and what looked like auditing to them you see was far above the immediate ability of the student to execute so that you see they would start to pass somebody on itsa as they called it which is just whether or not the auditor was listening to the pc but in actual fact what they would collide with as an instructor is the fact that it didnt look like good auditing see so they start out on one thing you see start out on this lowlevel auditing which they all understood to be very lowlevel action dont you see and promptly check the fellow out for class iv and then of course wouldnt let the person pass at the low level until the person had moved into class iv classification but the person couldnt get to class iv style of auditing or address of course because the person could never get out of itsa do you see the conundrum which was posed here how is anybody going to find out how to do all these other things if he hasnt first learned to listen and nobody was letting him learn to listen everybody was insisting that he immediately get in this jet you seenot even the training version but the fighting version jet you seeand they were just sending him off down the runway and they were saying now all youre supposed to learn is to hold the wings in balance thats all youre supposed to learn and theyd fire him off down the runway you see and hed go through the sound barrier and then hed hear over his intercom i think your aerobatics are very poor and hed say but i they dont show any polish now lets repeat that immelmann you see and then they get back and then they turn in their report on theon the student and theyd say well he didnt pass well why didnt he pass well he couldnt keep his wings level see nobody could get through that sound barrier on the auditing progress so ive seen this and been working with it for some time and finally formulated this to gradient scale of auditing approaches that nobody could really skip very badly because of course at onceat once an instructor having guidingstyle auditing up the line you see at ii knowing its there would not then try to pass the student on guidingstyle auditing when he was in actual fact trying to do something at level 0 you see so this wouldis not something now that wed get involved so it was point that was very necessary to straighten out and it has that instructional value of gradient scale after youve learned how to do one thing you certainly can do the next thing you see and after youve learned how to do that then you can do the next thing well one of the things thats difficultlets go all the way to the top now from the bottomone of the things thats very difficult in teaching anybody r6 is something thats rather hidden there and that is the person has to be able to do many different auditing styles flicketyflicketyflickety bingitybingitybing one right after the other shifts from one to the other and back and forth again its the wildest thing you ever saw in your life because the session is going so rapidly that there is time to handle these things with base waybacktothebeginningtype auditing well ill give you an idea ill give you an idea were running this pc down the bank you see and the pc is in gpm and weve got an item all ready to go and we end the session and the next session the pc pops up with ptp well now if we dont handle that ptp that pcs going to make progress in that session at all so now what are we going to do in the first place the case is getting much better and is really flying and what are we going to do now are we going to handle his ptp with an hour and half of what part of that problem could you be responsible for on repetitive command see well were not going to do that well how do we explain to the auditor that were not going to do that he knows how to handle ptp hes been very carefully taught hes been very carefully taught that when the pc has ptp you locate and isolate what the ptp is and then you say what part of that problem can you be responsible for or something like that for half an hour or something like this and the problem tends to evaporate well the only trouble with this at r6 is the problem is undoubtedly closely associated with the item the pc is right now in it is the tiniest lock imaginable it has the same order of magnitude of gnat standing alongside of the alps and how are we going to handle this so we have to admit that the pc has ptp so we bring this upthe pc has ptp we isolate what the ptp iswe guide you seeand then we simply use itsa or something like this you see and the pc says well its so and so on and so and so on and soandso and soandso and you say well thats very good do you have ptpglance at the meter you seethats fine you havent got one all right now lets get on with the next item you seebang bang you know well you see that violatesif somebody has never been trained to handle ptp that waythat violates it and it makes him think that he now audits sloppily thats the immediate result he now gets the idea that the higher you go the sloppier you audit thats not true the higher you go the more precise you audit but the sloppier it may look see it may look awfully sloppy to an observer but its actually far more preciseratatattat youre choosing up the process and the auditing style to fit the process right therebing dont you see well what do you thinkin r6 you suddenly start in and you find out that some item wont read well what are you going to do at that particular point well were not going to now do tremendous case analysis or something like this were going to take this thing as we can dont you see and what does it indicate it indicates prepcheck well very good the auditors been taught how to do prepcheck he knows how to do prepcheck you assess the problem or item necessary to prepcheck and then you have eighteen buttons and you run each one of these flat wow if you did that to somebody while he was running down through gpm hed half kill you because some of those prepcheck buttons are very hot locks right on top of items and right on top of end words and they would ball that bank up like mad if youre running down the bank it wouldnt necessarily be true if you werent running down the bank you see at the lower levels but its now very true so we condense prepcheck into this sort of thing ah well we know whats been suppressed the item see so we say well on that item has anything been suppressed and the pc says oh yes soandso and so and so on and suppressed all right repeat the item again all right that reads fine we go on down to thats prepcheck you follow well thats actually abridgedstyle auditing its just abridged you just cut out all of the nonessentials out of the actual action that youre doing and reof course that has to be terribly precise because the auditor has to know whats essential about the action hes doing you see its actually more precise than complete fulldress parade type of auditing so at r6 we have allstyle and all fellow has to do at r6 is simply be able to do all the styles which are below level vi and he does them all consecutively and at variousin various orders hes liable to be shifting from one style to another style and you very often find yourself oddly enough doing level 0 auditing with r6 this pcs gone off on wild tear of itsa oh you knowthis sort of thinggee you know that was why i hated my grandmother and so forth and you know i got some kind of an idea that i had other grandmothers at one time or another yes im sure i had grandmothers and so forth and so on and ive hadalways have seemed to have had trouble with grandmothers you know grandmothers grandmothers grandmothers hes running some gpm that has to do with kill the old or something and tone arms going at some mad rate you see and hes itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa andwell let assure youyou as the auditoras long as that tone arm is moving youd just be fool to open your face and youve been going down the bank you seebrrrtbow put in the stepsbrrrowbow see bangbangbang you know thud thud crash crash all right now well check out the next gpmboom bang thud you see were going right just at terrific rate of speed and then all of sudden hey you know i think this is why i hated my grandmother and of course youre right there ready to commence again but that isnt the end of that cognition now if the auditor is unskilled in recognizing pc origins and unskilled in handling itsa he can lay terrible egg right at that point see he can try to force the pc on down the bank or force the pc into actions or shut him off or herd him up one way or the other or do something with him when thatsactually what he ought to do is just sit back and smile as his total auditing action ah but that requires judgment too because supposing the pc was cogniting on other end words in the bank and supposing he was traveling all over the bank with his itsa oh we dont want him traveling all over the bank with itsa he isnt cogniting you see hes just sitting there speculating well i wonder if this is so on an end word and i wonder if thats an end word and so on the next thing you know youre going to have the most frozen tone arm that you could find south of nome there itll be well so at this point youve got to know guidingstyle you got to be able to herd that pc you got to be able to shut him up without arc breaking him and of course thatsyouthe auditor thats learned that hes learned it see well good im glad you got lot of end words there well thats fine im glad youre cogniting on that fine fine well thank you very much now i got all that now what do you suppose this next item is and the pc says well the next item is well the next item is soandso and soandso and we go on down the bank dont you see but lets take an auditor who has been carefully trained to do repetitive command auditing and can assess if he holds his tongue between his teeth like that while he looks at the meter and now lets turn him loose in this lions cage you see called r6 where he himself is under heavy restimulation usually too and his last session hasnt gone and bunch of other things are terrific liabilities about his auditing and now without any basic training lets expect him to get some kind of result hes still trying to find out various things does r6 work are gpms there can anybody possibly ever get cleared well hes trying to get cleared on r6 he hasnt cognited yet that you dont get cleared on r6 that you get cleared back at iv you see and he hasnthe hasnt meshed all of this hes still got all these searching answers and then he has pattern of training on styles of auditing and of course hes just going to have an awful time because you see hell have hard enough time if he has the training on all the styles of auditing and he can do each one of these styles he will have hard enough time just grappling with the new strangeness and complexities of the whole reactive mind because youre just asking him nonchalantly all right go ahead and run the pc through his reactive mind because thats all there is to the pcs active mindreactive mind you see well all right just run him through his reactive mind and the guy says reactive mind whhooo you know well and so forth and lets see now what did it say what was the patter you know hes trying to remember the patter and he isnt skilled at this point and that and then we also hit him in the head with what style does he use see he wont make it because even given all of his information and so forth he actually should be at least twenty hours on solo audit after he goes into there so he gets reality on the bank and all of sudden hell coordinate the bank against the reads hell coordinate his auditing against how to handle this all of sudden it all falls together beautifully and its very smooth and he goes on from there if he doesnt go on from there somebody can get him by the scruff of the neck and take some of the charge and overburden off of the thing dont you see straighten him out and do bit of case analysis something like that but not run bank and put him back on running the bank and he eventually will find that he can grapple with his own bank which is tremendous piece of confidence then hes got good subjective reality on it but for him to do that without any background of auditing styles and so forth would again be almost incredible see its one thing to be pc and its one thing to be an auditor but to be an auditor and pc with all auditing styles demanded while running on through the reactive bank is quite trick and therefore i have some feeling that somebody should be prepared to do this so the auditing the auditing which youre doing at lower levels is of course very much gauged at these lower levels now somebody the other day was going to go back home and audit couple of pcs on gpmstheyre not even releases you see hes going to audit them on this well youll find everybody is tugging away at the idea of going to the top our society is gauged that in order to be successful you have to be at the top and there are very few ladders around and if youll notice why there are very few at the top and the reason there are very few at the top is that there are ladders provided there are great deal of booby traps provided there are lot of ropes that are half cut through provided but there are very few ladders provided now pc has to climb the same ladder and these are gauged against what auditing pc will respond to at what levelwhich isnt covered in the bulletin but is quite pertinent now look pc would have to be up to withstanding allstyle well do you realize that its the constancy of lowerlevel auditingshort sessions and constancy its the fact that the auditor is predictable the pc now knows and becomes certain because the pc can predict what the auditor is going to do well pc isnt going to predict anything in allstyle so he already has to have high level of confidence in auditors right well hows he going to gain that well hes going to gain that by going up through the levels also you could describe the reactive bank he becomes familiar in other words into reacting to these various styles of auditing and he finds none of them bite and hes now familiar and reacting to all these styles well so when theyre all thrown at him one after the other out of sequence and so forthas is necessary at r6why it all seems very usual to him whereas hed do his nutto use britishismif he possibly were subjected to this kind and type of auditing as his first debut into scientology what the hell is going on you see he had certainty on it at all and hed quickly foul up theres case fact that prevents you from grabbing somebody off of the street out here everybody wants to get to the top and they want their r6 auditing and theyre very important people and youll find out the lower they are the more important they are you see and the more exaggerated their ideas of their ability is and you get somebody up here and you just drag him off the street at random and you start to run him on r6 funny part of it is you might get away with it you might get away with it for several gpms or you might get away with it with this or that but remember that youre just playing your luck its something like running race with the saddle cinch of the horse cut threequarters of the way through dont you see and with only one nail holding the shoe on each hoof now the conditions there are so strained that i doubt you would be able to progress fifty hours of auditing into r6 without coming terrible croppera really terrible cropper and you havent got any background or backlog in the pc with which to salvage the pc the pc has confidence that scientology would rescue ptp the pc has confidence that this somatic which is now turning on would ever turn off again the pc is all leery the pc may think hes being psychoanalyzedhes never found out about it yet dont you see you never know what the devil this pc was all about he may be gauging all of r6 as to whether or not his ears sting his hidden standards are in his road you see r6 isnt working because his ears dont sting he knows when things workhis ears get warm and tingle you know when youve got all of those liabilities fighting against you youre just asking for it so if you take pc off the street and put them on to r6 dont write and say ron this person has spun in and thishes having terrible time what do i do now now im telling you what to do right here see and there isnt much of anything you can do if you havent done the other first so the nonsense of taking somebody and immediately putting them on r6 just because they wave lot of money in your face or some other insufficient inducement it isit is simply becoming the effect of somebodys bank and its nothing more than that youre just making yourself the effect of their bank and boy dont think you arent going to be the effect of their bank from there on even more so its going to get pretty grim so what you want to do in case like that is say fine fine oh wed be very happy to run you on r6very very happy to run you on r6 yes sir we will sign you up for r6 all right now tell about your life and pretty soon he says you know im not getting any of these goals and so forth well i think were clarifying your goals pretty good you see these session goals up here theyre pretty good are you making them well im not making that one i want to be ot by tuesday because then i get another promotion from the somethingorother well all right im sorry youre not making that particular goal and go right on auditing him with what youre auditing and all of sudden about tuesday three months later why this guyafter few sessions week or something like thatthis guy all of sudden says you know i donti think my anxiety about being ot is the fact that i thought i was going to get worse and you know ive just realized that im not going to get worse thats quite remarkable and youve hit the first thing that was really real to him you made release he isnt being audited in frame of mind of total desperation that if he doesnt get audited you see hes now going to go through the floor and disappear or something is going to cave in on him dont you see the most remarkable frame of mind because most people start in their auditingno matter how quiet they look to you on the surfacethey start in their auditing in total desperation oh they say well well go along with this and id be very happy to get better and yes i want to be able to play pingpong better and so forth and they go along with this and so forth but actually sitting back of that is ais total desperation they see themselves going on the same old treadmill dont you see down the same old chute into the same old bunch of mud and they know its very steep chute and they know that if they dont keep running like mad on that treadmill theyre going to go into that chute and uhhh and you build them up to point of where they have little more confidence in their own future see just that little point and all of sudden they come off this desperation kick and fine so move them on up the line and you would actually overestimate now the amount of time necessary to make somebody walk that ladder see youll probably assign him too much time to it in your own mind because youre assigning it out of your experience and theres been great deal of technical advance here rather dizzy amount of technical advance in the last eighteen months and itd be pretty hard to catch experience up to it see youd have to audit lot of different kinds of pcs and that sort of thing and apply the techniques exactly as they were supposed to be applied to gain experience so actually your prediction of how long somebody would be on one of these levelsfrom your own instincts and so forthwould probably be at fault you see you probably would overestimate the amount of time and youd probably tend to overrun the pc at any given level just to be sure which is fine go right ahead and do so but recognize that you have to adjust your reality and experience against whats actually happening with pcs and youll find that there is an acceleration of gain the gain accelerates that is itfor any given moment of time the gain increases per hour of auditing time better you get more gain per unit of auditing time you see and then you get more and more gain and then you get more and more and more gain per unit of auditing time dont you see and your slow freight on pc is 0 and i thats really slow freight because youve got guy who is crawling out of that well and he crawls up three inches in the auditing session and he falls back two and seveneighths inches in the intervening period see and his actual rate of advance is an eighth of an inch per session on well which is several thousand feet deep life to him looks terribly terribly forbidding now you actually are only dealing with that strata of the society who are voluntarily seeking auditing and this is new thing nobodys done that before theyve only really addressed treatmentthat is thea majority of treatment given in society was to those people who were lying across the track of society they were in the road of society from psychotherapy and treatment theof the aesculapians and other things was to get out of the road of the society or out of the road of family somebody who was in bad way and they considered these chaps were liability they kept running around the forum you know with toga on you know and interrupting the speeches being made you know this sort of thing you see so theydsomebody would say well there you are bill and get him out of the road well thats because the state could see this and therefore the state or the family head or something like that would then be quite willing to put out money in order to get this fellow straightened out so the psychotherapist or the aesculapian or the medical doctor or the witch doctor or any other of the more archaic forms would just follow the line of the least resistance you see well the states willing to get rid of the very sick and the very nutty and so theyll pay us to get rid of the very sick and the very nutty and of course we cant do it but we can certainly keep them out of their road now what we need is more institutions and more hospitals and more hospitals and more institutions and more appropriations and we need more appropriations and more institutions and more hospitals and what they needed of course was better understanding of man but they werent paid to have that see they were only paid numerically there were eight squillion nuts in the society and they were allocated as their pay so manyso many drachma or something per bed dont you see quantitative basis wrong method of appropriation you see so there was incentive now youre dealingand you get very easily confused with that other laughable nonsense because what youre doingwhat youre doing is handling level of society that yet has some inkling that they can do something about themselves now you remember that thats your basic entrance point now you can promote that entrance point and you can increase that tiny spark but if it isnt there at all and you cant communicate with it at all the guy isthe guy has went because he cant go up from there because the only person that can make thetan well is thetan and whats the point of return well the point of return is faintest idea at any time ever that self can do anything about anything when you hear somebody saying well theres reason to vote and so forth i couldnt do anything about it anyhow i dont care to talk about politics because there isnt anything you can do about it anyway you know well that person is gone on the third dynamic and these big supersocialist states that are supposed to take care of everybody inside the barbed wirethese states in actual fact only come into existence when the majority of its population is in that frame of mind it actually isnt the fault of the state the state comes into existence because bunch of blokes out through the society longer feel that anything can be done about anything and therefore they just go through the treadmill and theyre simply staying alive you know and you wonder why does one of these socialist or communist states fail to produce why do they always have production problems why is everybody in russia starving to death at such rate that they had to get rid of their premier or whatever he was and their boss over there was moved off moved off and it didnt have anything to do with really political issues people were hungry and people didnt have any shoes to wear and nobody could do anything about it anyway and that was the prevailing thought and he must have qandaed with all these people who couldnt do anything about it anyhow and he did have few leaders around who thought you could still do something about it and so they gave him the deep six and the population never said word because of course they couldnt do anything about it anyway it wasnt that they approved or disapproved of the removal of the head of state of russia last month do you see they just couldnt have done anything about it thats pretty wild thats pretty wild frame of mind well now lets add that up on the first dynamicthats the only reason im giving it to you on the third see ohhh i dont have anything to do about it the brain is all composed of cells i have to obey these synapses and neurons and they do it all and if you could do anything about it there isnt anyplace to do anything about it because who wants to make synapses well nobody can get any better i cant get any better there isnt anything there to get anything any better there isnt anything there that could get any better anyhoweven if you could get better and you get philosophy like wundtianism see man is an animal there aint nothing there he is bunch of mass brainwork that is very interesting under microscope you know i mean thats the philosophy which you would get at that point so that again is not premeditated but is itself only symptom of the individual attitude you actually then are appealing to person who has some tiny tiny dim spark that maybe he could do something about himself or maybe he could do something about the society see thats the person youre appealing to and so therefore youre appealing to minority the kickback of course that we get from thefrom the state and that sort of thing is they tell usthey tell us were bunch of fakes and bums you see and that we cant do anything and we cant do anything we promise so well thats because they know theres nothing can be done about it you see the medical profession spends i dont know how much money per annum in the united states listing and enforcing into legislation diseases that cant be cured and theyve got bills theres twentyfive diseases which you must not treat in california for instance because they cant be cured and their bulk of contribution to the better business bureau and so forth is to get literature released that demonstrates completely that people cant be cured well you say thats very funny thing for healing profession to be doing well of course theythe bug in that is because you call them healing profession thats verythats not very funny thing for bunch of guys who are getting their total appropriation in proportion to the number of sick people there are around so naturally theyll be trying to convince everybody something couldnt be cured because of course this puts more money in their pockets this puts more power in their hands you see the less that can be cured in the societyif you follow out the reasoningthe less that can be cured in the society the more tops they are and they themselves are incapable of thinking the thought through that that includes them and somehow or another these birds are never able to equate this last one theyre sort of mad and low toned anyway and theyyoull find some atomic physicist well it doesnt make any difference whether you kill one person with rifle or the whole population of earth i mean the same degree of morality has nothing to do with it you can kill city you kill one person i mean war is war that hasnt anything to do with anything you see and theres difference between these things and so forth so therefore its perfectly okay for to build atomic bombs and give them over to bunch of gibbering boobs that have elected themselves heads of states thats how hehow he justifies the whole action see theres difference between it and so forth and he goes on and he builds all these things you see and he hands them all out to the you know like some fiveyearold kid and twoyearold kid here johnny have cocked 45 yeah well he wants another cocked 45 all right well build him one you see and when he gets down to this point why he hasnt included himself in and just for fun one time as i think ive told you before i made an experiment i took salesman who wasnt interested in the atomic bomb and i carefully broke him down to points of his possessions that he was worried enough about to be worried about the bomb i was trying to explain to him what of his and what around him would disappear if he were in bombed area and i broke it down point by point dont you see well you know almost repetitive process well would he be upset if his wife and children got knocked off by bomb why hell he couldnt have eared less it didnt make any difference to him hed be all right and thats right and i just kept breaking this down and i finally got to his wallet and he started to get worried andbut it wasnt the money in his wallet oddly enough it was his social security card and when he finally realized that his social security card would be charred beyond recognition he started to worry about atomic bombings and he left the room nattering little bit about people making and using atomic bombs that it wasnt quite nice but i had of course had trailed it down to demonstration that it did have something to do with him see well similarly you on broad public front first by setting an example that people are getting better and next by showing them you see cutting it back to point where they might possibly themselves quite possibly be able to do about itin other words reawaken this sparkthen you would make progress through the society but that is the course which you will follow up through the coming years it will be that sort of aof an action youre doing fine and youre getting better and things in your vicinity are running all right dont you see and somebody says maybe it was luck maybe it was this maybe its that trying to explain this all the time its bug that has appeared in their immediate social environment which they cant appear youre sort of ayoure an oddity see you arent all falling to pieces like everybody else is see why and well theyre prepared then to have the question answered and its answered on the basis of could they do anything to help themselves and that would be your first edge in thered be some spark of something that they could either resent or resist or help or something you see there would be little scale running and when person hits that line hell eventually walk up the line to want some processing but youre doing something that has not occurred before on this planet see therefore its very easily confused and gotten upset about is because youre taking people who yet have some tiny inkling that they can get better but all through their auditing that must be improved and therefore this emphasis on wins thats how we must keep the pc winning keep the pc at cause and winning we mustnt ever knock them around into situation where they believe they cant better themselveshave them get tremendous auditing failures you see with tremendous crash and its that little point of self at cause which must be reached and of course your readiest people to reach are those people who do believe they can do something about themselves you see theyre very easy to handle but rekindled by various mechanisms such as example discussion and that sort of thing in others you see and youre working with that level of society and youre not following the route of there are eight million nuts and so therefore we have eight million people in our charge and therefore we get appropriations to take care of these eight million people dont you see thats the old approach and thats why nobody was really interested in doing anything about anybody theyre being paid for their disabilities well now youre going at it on reverse line and that reverse line isnt harder actually that reverse line is easier its always easier to indulge in successful activity than one which simply holds everybody in cages and they grunt and groan you see you follow that because its more rewarding the actual fact is its easier to make somebody better than it is to make them worse thetan resists getting worse hes resisted it for ages and hes so used to resisting getting worse dont you see that its brandnew vector its brandnew vector to say you could get better and ithe finds it very hard to resist this he has builtup resistance to this at all and you keep telling him he can get better and he keeps hearing he can get better and so forth and then all of sudden he begins to realize that he himself would have to do something about it in order to get better at that point why he moves up and he gets to the point finally of realizing hes not now going to get worse and he at that point is release and if youre not at least working with release on r6 why the guy is just sitting there going through some kind of motions and the environment around him is going to smash him in and his cognitions you see arent really very pertinent its rather ridiculous to listen to his cognitions hes running the actual basic points of the bank and youll find him cogniting on the fact of oh i see now maybe thats why i cut my finger yesterday and maybe thats whywhy i sometimes cut my finger yes weve solved my life you see hes running some engram to kill everybody in sight dont you see he doesnt cognite on any magnitude dont you see theres nothing going on really and youre just handling charge and theres pc there much to handle the charge and you can just assign it to the point that you as the auditor are running through now at r6 the same experience that dianetic auditors had perpetually they could always knock out somebodys arthritis and they would be very very happy as an auditor to have fixed up somebodys lumbosis or something of the sort and the only difficulty was the pc hadnt found out about it actually you could force somebody through an auditing session cure them up one way or the other straighten them up like mad fix them up so they never had any more domestic trouble you do the wildest things with these people you see and it was like repairing typewriter it was still typewriter and theone of the reasons we came off from dianetics is because selfdeterminism and other factors of that character had entered in and we ourselves in this study had found out that there was something there and there was something doing it there was something getting better and it wasnt all just negative gain there was also positive gain hence scientology now the auditing styles are all part and parcel of this so youve got these things plotted at the most win or the most likely win at that level where you find the pc now the pc originally will most likely win at level 0 it isnt that you need tremendous new sparking beautiful processes in order to push this pc up the line hes more likely to win with this very simple process of itsa see hes just talking he finds out he can talk to somebody big win man terrific it isnt what youre erasing it isnt what youre doing nothing like that so the auditing style then is adjusted to the most likely progress for the pc you possibly have never much thought of this subject of how does the pc receive auditing see how does the pc react to auditing we think inmore in terms of the pc has case and the case gets better dont you see or the case improves the pcs behavior improves or his environment improves or something like this and we probably dont too often equate that to just this thats the pcs reaction to the processing see the pc then responded to certain level of processing thats why the pc won he didnt necessarily respond to particular button that was pushed on his case you see weve always had with us this other factor that just auditingalmost gobbledygook auditingwas quite capable of improving somebodys case did you ever get puzzled about this did you ever see anybody in adoing trs get case win well why theres process and sometimes particularly back in 54 there were quite few auditors around who were absolutely mad on this subject of the process the process was everything and there was auditing connected with the process the process did it all and they didnt have to do anything and the pc didnt have to do anything you see they had it mixed up like it was pill or something i quickly broke them of this butas fast as found but the point im making here is actually yes the process is very valuable unless you knew what processes to run hed soon come to point of gain dont you see but the actual fact is the actual fact is that the actions of auditing all by themselves completely devoid of processes account for very respectable portion of the pcs gain it makes terrific mystery to some auditor who seesif he sees that joe always gets gains on the pc but the question hes liable to ask joe is what did you run on them the answer to the question was is how did joe run pcs its how he was audited see it wasnt what was audited on the pc and that is something that we have never paid very much attention to and havent covered it to any great degree but youll find it in auditing styles and its how you audit the pc to gain and frankly if you were simply to ask him about his old boots and hobbies at itsastyle dont you see itsee everybodys being very significant saying well what questions do you put on the blackboard well at that level it just doesnt matter what questions you put on the blackboard you shouldnt put too beefy one on the blackboard thats too significant because that isnt whats happening its the style youre conditioning somebody to speak to somebody else see thats what youre doing he finds out he can talk without getting his throat cut hey theres somebody i can communicate with is his most usual cognition whether he expresses it or articulates it or not thats usually his cognition well actually it doesnt do much good to run him beyond that cognition thats the ability regained but its regained by the style dont you see all right now lets take the very next style above this which is muzzled auditing boy thats quite jump thats fantastic discipline and unless you train your pc to some degree as to whats expected and show him what this auditing cycle is and what this muzzled auditing is all about he cant predict it and he doesnt know what to do and he tries to fall back into itsa well lets just graduate him upstairs at hurry because hes quite capable now you see of taking this step he has learned he can talk to somebody all right now lets teach him this other thing that he could enter into piece of this drill and that is when hes asked question to actually look it over and answer it and now thats something do you realize that that is sort of an 8c all by itself thats fabulous thing to and you know theres tons of pcs ive seen thatsomebodys trying to audit them on some upper level who have never gotten that skill they have never never been able to do that you ask them question you know do birds fly and they say birds birds i visited the smithsonian institute one time or another do you seelook on that as not something fundamentally wrong with the case so much as an inability which can be knocked out and the ability of it can be regained can you answer question when youre asked one and if you put muzzled auditing to the pc on that basis all right now were going to go through long series of processes and processing and so forth and the one thing which is at stake here is whether or not you can answer the question youve been asked thats quite process all by itself isnt it and therefore hed take very kindly to your saying im sorry but i dont think you answered the auditing question i guess i didnt well im not so good at it yet am i instead of arc breaking you see he had an understanding that thatscompletely aside from other things being run on himthat that basic fundamental is something he should learn how to do and you can pull him up short then cant you you can say hey hey hey now lets see if we cant get little bit better at this you know all right now in this next session here were just goingwere going to see if youre very good at this were running times youve communicated all right thats fine thats all were running but lets see if we cant really get the ball here well what in essence is the whole gain of 8c which is one of theone of the most fabulous processes you dont think patting the wall is going to do anything for anybody well it isnt going to do very much its reach and withdraw from mest and that sort of thing well thats fine yes we know theres gain involved with it but what is it essentially the guy finds out that he can execute an auditing command well thats pretty interesting after awhile he finds out you know when he says to walk over there you know i do and imhe says touch the wall i do and then the next thing that it picks up all in one fell swoop is duplication and boy the individual who has individuated from all of life on the basis of not being able to duplicate anything in life is mighty lonely joe hes way out man he cant be anything remember the old beingness processing he cant be anything because he cant duplicate anything well this is all part and parcel to orders too isnt it youll find out that this person when you give him an order you say put the cans down and so forth why hell put them in his pockets or something well unless youve gotten human being out of that wobble and scrabble and so forth you havent improved his ability to confront existence because of course he canthe cant see those things he cant be he cant duplicate in other words well duplication is simply repetitive action i may have skipped over that little fast for you some of you may remember the old beingness processes that was taught up in london about 1954 thetan can only be what he can see and what he cant see he cant be and he can only see something because he can duplicate it actually he cant see anythingyoull beyou know the remarkable stories and reports you get of an accident well its peculiarly an accident it isnt that peoples observation in general is bad theyre looking at something they jolly well dont want to be and so you get the most distorted stories of what happened at this accident cop is always up against this he always gets half dozen different stories and how court ever admits evidence of watching crime as reason enough to hang somebody i wouldnt know because its the most unreliable evidence in the world because of course the fellow couldnt see it cant be it he just knows very well that he wouldnt want to be hit by car so he actually doesnt see anybody hit by car well you have slight occupational liability as an auditor is that youre looking at pc all the time that you dont particularly want to be youre trying to improve him arent you well fortunately for us it isnt necessary for you to be willing to be aberrated to get well you follow that thought through it isnt necessary for you to be willing to be aberrated to get well see because we have the whole anatomy of the reactive bank theres sense in it see you see if thetan didnt have reactive bank and he hadnt made his gpms and he hasnt agreed on all of this and so forth he would probably be completely unaberrateable he couldnt be aberrated at all hethere would be dwindling spiral see theres basic things that you say could get wrong with him but in actual fact he wouldnt have any of those things wrong with him he would actually have to determine to have something real wrong with him and when he determined it as thoroughly as make complete reactive mind that would keep him crazy from there on out this was almost the accidental perfect trap the trap he ordinarily wouldnt fall into but there he was in it he did it you see he had to decide to be aberrated with exclamation points for some reason or other best known to him and then having decided so he was too stupid to get himself out of it its justityou see that that is whats wrong with everybody means in essence that the other things that were wrong with him actually have blown see theres just that one thing left there were lot of things that could have been wrong with thetan but that onehe had to decide to be aberrated he had to decide to make and create and put in place and continue to create reactive bank and the universe he had to decide this all off his own bat incredible as it may seem oh he could have agreed and he could have been persuaded and he could have talked to somebody but lets not miss the point he did do it and having done it why he was then in the soup and thats actually all were unwinding dont you see there isnt anything else there to unwind but because theres so many locks on the reactive bank and because it tends to group and bunch up and get into restimulation you have degree of aberration of cases and theres certain basic things that can go wrong with thetan which are above the level of the reactive bank and gpms and these certain basic things include duplication and communication they can be aberrated all by their little old lonesomes regardless of any end word yes theres some end words that have to do with these things but that really doesnt matter these are then not lowlevel ideas these are very highlevel ideas these would be native to any thetan anyway whether he had bank or didnt have bank and you can work on them and you can improve them because they have such strong influence you see these things he should be able to do pretty well he shouldnt be stumbling around on communication and duplication bank or bank end words or end words you see and actually they do improve rather remarkably and he comes up scale to point where he can confront bank and that sort of thing so what are you asking him to do youre asking him toat itsa your listenstyle auditingyoure asking him to communicate and find out hes doing it and he does and somebodys going to receive the communication so it musttherefore it must be communication it proves to him that he is communicating because somebodys receiving it dont you see and then we go up to the next stage here of muzzled auditing and now hes got to receive communication and he proves it by answering it do you follow that and then he proves it to himself that he has answered it and he proves it to himself he has received communication because the auditor is satisfied with the fact that hes answered the auditing question and of course any time the auditor lets pc receive communication or question that he doesnt answer then the pc is not then satisfied because he knows he didnt answer the auditing question and so therefore he begins to doubt his own ability to receive communication its as elementary as that it isnt hes doing you in as an auditor by not answering the auditing question it isnt that the process wouldnt work unless it were received or anything like that he now doubts that hes received the communication and he doubts hes received the communication because he didnt answer it and then the auditor the auditor didnt call him up on the fact that he didnt answer the incoming communication so therefore everything gets kind of unreal to him now hes proving it to himself continuously by answering the auditing question that he is capable of receiving communication because it proves itself hes answered the thing he received and not only that but he can do it repetitively he can do it again and again and again and again and again and when he first gets the idea of answering three questions in row man hes ready to go round the bend you may not realize it but you ask some people the same question just twice and they blow up in your face did you ever have that happen ask them the same question twice so therefore youve got to make point to the pc now were going to get you so that you can answer several questions in row all the same question and hell begin to see this is skill see all right so weve got muzzled auditing now the next level is mainly devoted to is there something there now were up to guidingstyle is there anything there you see the whole world to him is reasonless although hes being very reasonable about everything actually theres reason for anything hes on the lower harmonic of the truth all reasons have to be dreamed up but hes down to point where they reallythe average human beingtheres real reason for anything he doubts for instance that theres any real reason for him to be unhappy hes unhappy but there is reason for him to be unhappy theres nothing making him unhappy you get this expressed all the time as i feel nervous today somebody says i feel nervous today its an accepted fact theres nothing causing this nervousness hence you get people going off into numerology you know like on the 17th of the month i feel nervous and it has something to do with the number 17 and 1 and 7 added together make 8 eight is money so therefore it must be money but that person is still trying to find reason for his nervousness youll find the bulk of the society does not ever try to find any reason for their nervousness and you very often as an auditor are completely baffled you say all right lets find out why youve got the headache and you see the person says oh nuts youve just said something awfully silly theres reason to have headache one simply has headache of course now the doctor gets far too serious about this this person has headache every once in while so the doctor wants towants to remove the brain its like the american military with their overkill i think its fascinating fascinating wordoverkill theyve got thousand times overkill now in the arsenals in the united states theyve got enough atom bombs to kill every man woman and child on earth thousand times each i dont know how you compute that youd almost have to be scientologist to even approach it and by that i mean yes well you could figure out that every lifetime you could kill them and youd have enough to do that so we could stretch it out in scientology to make sense but it doesnt make any sense to them because they think you only live once anyway and youre just brain see so its completely senseless statementoverkill why should they have one see now you takeyou take reasons for headaches and things like thiscompletely beyond people theyve got headache theyve got stomachache now once in whileonce in while you get big cognition out of somebody you know you saythey say oh well ive got terrible stomachache today what youre missing you see is you yourself know that things cause things see youre not living in causeless world and environment you see so it doesnt make any sense to you to have somebody over there that youre talking to living in causeless world see the stomachache is fact nothing caused it it appears and disappears with complete mysteriousness see and you get big cognition out of them one day when you ask them well did you eat something that disagreed with you and every once in while if you ask somebody that under those circumstances they would say by george you knowyou know ii did you know i had twenty raw weenies last night you know ill bet thats what you know but you wonder whats the purand what you would become hung up with is why why the emphasis theyre putting on this see how come they seem to be so happy about this or they seem to be so relieved about this well that isnt what theyre cogniting on theyre cogniting on the fact that stomachaches could be caused by something that there is cause big idea big brandnew idea see and theyll be pleased as punch they havent really grappled with the idea itself you see but its just suddenly theyre very relieved about something then this goes hand in glove with it natively im just not stupid man theres something that causes my stupidity you see that gothat thought goes along with it then they get other thoughts that well my life doesnt have to be horrible mess all the time maybe something in my vicinity is causing this and they do terrific resurgence maybe something is causing the condition im in in existence maybe it isntjust isntit isnt just reasonable that husbands and wives fight all the time maybe something is causing this well of course its the wife naturally you know and then theyll hit the handiest target you see butin other words you now got the guy looking hes got new idea brandnew idea that things are caused thats terribly elementary isnt it it isnt something you ordinarily would even look at or even respect as source of aberration and yet its one of the primary ones your guidingstyle auditing gets him to look around in his life and find the causes of things now having found them of course you can do something about them and as you will get another bulletin on this itsjust covering here the bulletin of november 6 ad 14 but theres another bulletin just little more recent than this which talks about what styles you use with remedies its the beginning of the series of bulletins about how to adapt auditing style to the book of remedies just neating up level ii you see and theres guiding secondary style which is the most elementary thing in the world although youd use it in session although you would also use it in assists its peculiarly adapted to several remedies which is simply steer plus itsa steer plus itsa we used to have number for it steer plus itsa see and you guide the guy into talking about something till you get tone arm blowdown and then you make him talk about it you see to get the tone arm action out of it and then while hes talking about it he mentions several new things dont you see that give him tone arm action so you note those things down and you come back afterwards and talk about those things dont you see well thats the process that goes with it but this other is just pure style all by itself you get pc to look and then you steer him and his looking see and you herd him around and head him off here and head him in there dont you see and then you get him to talk about what you have found see while holding him on this subject you dont let him wander and he itsas on this subject well itsathis and itsathat and itsasomethingorother it makes marvelous assist remedies and b of course are the first two in the book of case remedies so the auditing style with which theyre handled should be quite considerably described because theyre the most flagrant ones they have to do with definitions anddefinitions in scientology or the present subject you mustnt miss that its present subjectimmediate subject its the immediate subject the guys trying to study you see its not just applicable to scientology this guys trying to study engineering and he hasnt understood term in engineering all right well you can handle that see with remedy remedy b is former subject thats what makes them different hes got the present immediate subject mixed up with some former subject so now youve got to find the former subject and find the word in it which hasnt been defined well anyway these have nothing to do with clay table you see they are processes all by themselves and they are guiding secondary style but the only difference between guiding secondary style and guiding primary styleor just call it guidingstyleis that guidingstyle runs in and does repetitive you guide and you do repetitive process on it you guide and you do repetitive process on it and we want that process to be the dominant process for level ii because it teaches the two things the fellow is now doing you see hes finding out that there is some cause and then he can answer questions about it and look at it see so youve still got repetitive action on the cause but this isthis is the style that is improving him see its quite important what you find but its only partially what you find hes got this new style things cause things wow see gee the world isnt all solid block with distance between anything theres causing b and theres d reacting to and golly this brandnew world out here there is some reason for things dont you see buildings dont just suddenly disappear in puff of smoke dont you know thered have to be an explosion big cognition see and then after the explosion why the bricks would be lying around on the ground and what causes bricks to lie around on the ground well there must have been an explosion to cause it and although the person realizes these things instinctively he never thinks them out or looks at them things cause things and life then islooks entirely different to him because hes longer just pawn if things cause things you might be able to predict if things caused things you might be able to do something about something if things cause something you might be able to do something yourself hey whoa what do you know geewhiz you know and thats the doors youre opening at that particular level youre guiding him and he finds causes and having found causes you can now do something about the thing too wow you find out hes been suffering from present time problem forsame problem all along the lineand now you say well what communications didnt you ever finish to that person oh soandso and soandso the problems gone youve asked the question repetitively what communication havent you finished to the person what communication havent you finished to the person what communication havent you finished to the person what communication havent you finished to the person maybe only ten minutes worth but the tone arm action disappears out of it wow i dont have any worry about aunt martha you know gosh whats unpinning him hes stuck all over the universe and by this causes of things and that he could locate it and then do something about the cause and straighten out that situationthats pretty fabulous and thats basically what he is finding out at level ii so its the style thats doing it see youre always beating yourself over the head about how clever you have to be actually be clever enough to realize that the style is doing it now by the time hes learned all that its perfectly safe to run him on an abridgedstyle at muzzled auditing the pc cognited or did something or other and didnt answer the auditing command of course because were teaching him what were teaching him at that level is that he can receive and answer an auditing command we must say always i will repeat the auditing command so forth so forth so forth always at level ii but not at level iii because our pc is now capable of doing that see why rub it in lot of people get irritated after theyve been through the basic of the thing at first it seems to be all right to them to have this happen and so forth but after while it isnt all right the auditors sitting there saying like woundup dolltheyve said oh ive just realized that solves whole problem of my life i will repeat the auditing command see well why why is the pc now reacting that way the pc might not have reacted that way earlier on the line you see the pc is now over this hump and youre auditing something that doesnt have to be audited so you have an abridgedstyle and itsof course abridged is termed to the lower styles it isnt an abridged upper style its only an abridged lower style so its the styles for 0 listen i muzzled and ii guiding and now we can abridge them and by abridge we mean we can look and see whats going on now the pc is getting pretty good because he thinks his life is more easy to handle and that sort of thing you find out his ptps are blowing quicker and various things are happening with the pc that wouldnt happen ordinarily and so forth and youre just slowing down the whole progress of the game by putting in the whole package do you see now we do present time problem the pc hassays he has present time problem we dont guide him into it we say what is it bang see and he says well this present time problem ive got an awful problem ive got to go to aunt marthas tea party and my god i almost die every time she feeds cup of tea she boils it for fifteen hours on the back of the stove you know you could float sounding lead in it well all right you say fine is it blown if its blown you dont do anything else in other words this is audit by pure result having brought our pc up and gotten him out of his nappies why we can now let him walk see he says its present time problem thats what it was we saw the reaction on the meter and it blew oh well an auditor would be very foolish to pursue this thing in fact hed get the pc all invalidated if he pursued it dont you see well thats the end of that present time problem but if itthe pc sort of looked googed on it and so forth youd say well give some communications that you havent given to aunt martha well he says soandso and soandso and soandso you get multiple answers and things of this character thats where that belongs well i didnt do that and didnt do that and you find pc eventually gets indoctrinated into multiple answer you ask him one question and he gives you the five answers necessary to flatten it and thats the end of the process along about the fifth question you get blowdown on your tone arm and thats it well by golly auditing can happen at an awful rate of speed and you watch some pc who iswho is well indoctrinated as pc whos you know had enough gains nowit isnt that theyve trained its that theyve had enough gains so theyre more selfdetermined theyre more present theyre more there and they can asis things now they dont just dodge you know and you ask this pcyoull see some auditor do this sometime in some session and im sure somebody at level i would say thats awfully sloppy auditing do you have present time problem the pc said yeah yeah i was afraid i was going to be late for the session i realize i havent and so forth and the auditor says all right thank you now what were going to do this session and the lowerscale person will say whatwhat went on you know that auditor didnt handle that pcs present time problem oh yes that auditor did that auditors good enough now to notice that meter moved if the meter didnt move why he would ask him another question in other words you audit against finite result and thats abridged auditing you just audit against what you want to have happen you audit enough to make that happen you dont audit another step beyond it you make sure youve got the tone arm action out of question you do not then run it for twenty minutes to find out if the tone arm action is out in other words youre good enough at this particular time to know when the tone arm action is out of something during the last ten minutes of the run or the last five minutes of the run dont you see well that tone arm is starting to climb and that tone arm is not now blowing down you must be into some other zone of action and the pc has been going on and youve been going on with your process dont you see and you see that this tone arm action is out and its gone youre going to give this thing twentyminute thing and stick that tone arm up good youre not in other words you dont now give it twentyminute test or something like that as you would you see at guidingstyle guidingstyle grind it through man dont take any chances see well at this level you see well it blew pc says i have pt problem well it blew all right you know youre not going to get anything out of that and besides you dont want to audit aunt martha anyway so you just sail on through pocketapocketapocketa see youre just auditing against the finite result you want that result you want that cognition you want that ability regained now of course whats the pc learning wow hes learning that he gets finite result when he gets audited something happens and he doesnt get beaten to pieces because something happened he justwhen he gets audited something happens bowbow you see hes taught against the finite result the auditor also at this point realizes you can obtain finite result from auditing hence abridged everything is out except the absolute essential action the whole works is out so the pcs auditedbeing audited now against direct result he doesnt say another word beyond what is necessary to obtain that result and he is upscale far enough now to know when hes gotten the result the pcs comm lags are all the same now the thing is regained the ability is regained the pcs had big cognition tone arm action seems to have damped on this particular thing well out man dont fool around now weve got directstyle auditing we wantweve got directstyle auditing now if youll notice an abridgedstyle is not necessarily direct its simply got things missing out of it and some of the things ive said about the auditing against the finite result apply to direct auditing style more than they do abridged that is to say youve got the exact result direct means straight concentrated intense applied in direct manner we do not mean the sense of direct somebody or to guide we mean it is directboom do you understand now were getting somebody up thatsuddenly the pc realizes that he can be given one godawful assignment hes supposed to just carry it out and thats it big look see all right well lets apply this to clay table clearing give something that you want to improve were not going to have pc sayinggiving goal or something like that because if hes been brought up properly why he of course wont tell us to be clear hell give you subject he wanted to improve to be clear you see doesnt answer the auditing question at all its goal and it isnt even gpm so then you try to audit that of course youve already flunked but you say to this fellow all right give agive subject you want to improve and he says ah golf all right tell something there that yousome term things like that in golf you never understood fore all right good represent it in clay you didnt label that i know thats golfer you didnt label it what do you mean i didnt label it i got sign on it golfer yeah i know youve got some pants on oh youre on course the club club club label it if thats what it is go ahead all right well im glad you realize the fellows in shooting jacket fine good all right is that it the pcs you know looking at it well go on all right give another term you didnt understand about that greens all right represent greens in clay now from the pc is coming total shower of action the pcs action is all direct back direct direct direct direct direct straight to the auditor straight to the auditor he doesnt expect anything he doesnt even expect any encouragement see hes just work work work work work work bzzzm you see and to somebody outside it looks like the auditor isnt doing any work and it looks like nobodys doing any work looks like the pc is running the whole session it looks like the pcs in total control of the whole session of course the pc would be in total control of the whole session right up to the moment when he failed to label that club you understand and then in r6 of course we combine all these styles the person does them one and another and the other one the pc by that time can stand up to it so its bringing pc up right it isnt just training the auditor you understand auditing styles little better all right thank you
