mallett resources science and industry division september 19 2008 abstract this report examines the federal and state roles in the maintenance inspection reconstruction and replacement of the nations highway bridge infrastructure as well as the emergency response and reconstruction role of the department of transportation dot the report ﬁrst describes what is known about the condition of the nations bridges and whether the problem of structural deﬁciency is improving or worsening it then brieﬂy describes the programmatic and budgetary context including federal eﬀorts to reduce the number of deﬁcient bridges and examines highway bridge spending the report discusses issues congress is facing face in light of the i35w bridge collapse and the emergence of questions about the appropriateness and eﬀectiveness of related federal infrastructure policies programs and spending finally the report describes number of legislative initiatives that have been proposedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34127 order code rl34127 highway bridges conditions and the federalstate role updated september 19 2008 robert s kirk specialist in transportation policy resources science and industry division william j mallett specialist in transportation policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34127highway bridges conditions and the federalstate role summary the sudden failure and collapse of the i35w interstate system bridge in minneapolis has raised policy concerns in congress regarding the condition of the nations transportation infrastructure in general and in particular the federal role in funding building maintaining and ensuri ng the safety of roads and especially bridges in the united states the national transportation safety board ntsb expects to determine probable cause of th collapse by the end of 2008 an interim ntsb finding implicated flaw in the original bridge design as contributing factor of the 600000 public road bridges listed in the national bridge inventory roughly 12 or 72000 were classified as stru cturally deficient as of 2007 this is however roughly half the number classifi ed as deficient in 1990 given the i35w collapse however even this lower number of deficient bridges leaves americans potentially exposed to what some might consider an unacceptable level of risk policy question is how quickly can and s hould the remaining deficient bridges be replaced or improved at current annual spending levels roughly 105 billion 2004 dollars at all levels of government the bridge investment backlog in dollar terms would be reduced by roughly half by 2024 reducing the backlog to near zero during the same period would requi re an estimated annual spe nding rate of roughly 124 billion in 2004 dollars the emergency relief program er administered by the federal highway administration fhwa provides funding fo r bridges damaged in natural disasters or by catastrophi c failures the program provides funds for emergency repairs immediately after the failure to restore essential traffic as well as for longerterm permanent repairs the funds for both the initial cleanup and for the replacement of the i35w bridge will come from this prog ram pl 11056 authorized er spending for the i35w bridge in the broader context most federa l funding for bridge reconstruction replacement or repair of structurally deficient or functionally obsolete bridges is provided through the fhwas highway brid ge program hbp many credit this program as an important reason for the cline in the number of deficient bridges over the last 15 or so years although er and hbp are federal pr ograms most of the money provided is under the control of the states the state departments of transportation let the contracts oversee the project developm ent and construction process and in partic ular provide for the inspection of bridges among the congressional issues rega rding the nations highway bridge infrastructure are whether to increase spending on deficient bridges and accordingly modify the federalaid highway programs whether to enlarge the federal role in bridge inspection and within the context of large projected deficits in highway trust fund revenues how to fund potential increas ed spending on highway bridges an act hr 3999 that has passed in the hous would address some of these issues in the senate hr 3999 was ordered reported without am endment favorably by the committee on environment and public works on september 17 2008httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34127contents background 1

raised policy concerns in congress re garding the condition of the nations transportation infrastructure in general and in particular the federal role in funding building maintaining and assuring the safety of roads and especially bridges in the united states highway bridges are of particular interest both because of the recent tragedy in minneapolis and the catastrophic re sults of major bridge failure in terms of loss of life and public inte rest impact both the fede ral governments response to catastrophic bridge failures and its role in he lping states address structurally deficient bridges have come under increased public scrutiny since the august 1 2007 bridge collapse the national tran sportation safety boards n tsb investigation of the i35w bridge collapse is ongoing probable cause of the collapse is expected to be determined when the final report is presented to the ntsb sometime before the end of 2008 the ntsb on january 15 2008 released an interim finding that an error in the original design appears to have contributed to the failure1 this report examines the federal and state roles in the maintenance inspection reconstruction and repl acement of the nations highway

these findings to the federal highway administration fhwa this information permits fhwa to character ize the existing condition of bridge compared with one newly built and to identify those that are deficient either structurally or functionally bridge is considered structurally deficient if significant loadcarrying elements ar found to be in poor or worse condition due to deterioration andor damage or the adequacy of the waterway opening provided by the bridge is determined to be extremely insufficient to the point of causing intolerable traffic interruptions5 bridge classified as structurally deficient is not necessarily unsafe but may require the posting of vehicle weight restriction functionally obsolete bridge on the other hand is one where its current geometric characteristics deck geometry such as the number and width of lanes roadway approach alignment and undercl earances are deficient compared with current design standards and traffic dema nds bridge can be both structurally deficient and functionally obsolete but structural deficiencies take precedence as result bridge that is structurally ficient and functionally obsolete is classified in the fhwa nbi as structurally deficient about half of structurally deficient bridges are also functionally obsolete6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34127crs3 7 department of transportation research and innovative technology administration bureau of transportation statistics national transportation statistics 2007 washington 2007 table 127 at httpwwwbtsgovpublica tionsnational_transportation_statisticsoverall in 2007 about 26 of bridges were classified as stru cturally deficient functionally obsolete or both about 12 of bridges in that year approximately 72000 were classified as struct urally deficient this is much lower than the number and share of bridges classified as structurally deficient in 1990 see figure 1 indeed over that period the number of stru cturally deficient bridges has been cut almost in half7 source us department of transportation research and innovative technology administration bureau of transportation statistics national transportation statistics washington dc table 127 bridges on the most heavily traveled roads such as interstates and other arterials are less likely to be classified as structurally deficient than bridges on more lightly traveled routes despite the fact that traffic has grown markedly on interstate and other arterials over the past decade structural deficiencies have declined the one exception to this trend is rural inte rstate bridges in 2004 fhwa classified about 5 of interstate bridges and 8 of bridges serving other arterials as structurally deficient compared with 12 serving collectors and 19 serving local roads between 1994 and 2004

from 127 to 868 for bridge deficiency and obsolescence rates by state see the table in appendix future bridge funding needs every two years the us department of transportation dot assesses the condition and performance of the nations hi ghways bridges and transit systems documents current spending by all vels of government and estimates future spending needs to either maintain or improve current conditions and performance9 as with any attempt to forecast future conditions there are host of simplifying assumptions omissions and data problems that influence the results of the estimates of future funding needs among other th ings the estimates of future needs rely on forecast of travel demands and assume s that the most economically productive projects ie projects with the highest bene fits relative to costs will be implemented first despite such uncertainties and assumptions these estimates provide way to assess the level of current spending compared with what will be needed in the future under different scenarios the most recent needs assessment shows that in 2004 703 billion was spent on capital improvements to the nations highways and bridges10 of that amount 583 billion was spent on roadways and 120 billion was spent on bridges the expenditures on bridges are composed of 105 billion on the rehabilitation of existing bridges and 16 billion on the buildin g of new bridges because of the modeling involved dots future needs timates for bridges are limited to fixing deficiencies in existing bridges thus are comparable with the 105 billion figure with that in mind dot estimates that it w ould cost total of 653 billion to fix all existing bridge deficiencies in 2004 dolla rs which is called the existing bridge investment backlog11 this figure includes dealing with bridges classified as structurally deficient and functionally obsolete as well as other deficiencies if the benefits outweigh the costs of course fixing all deficient bridge s overnight whatever the cost is not possible fhwa therefore estimates how this investment backlog will change at various levels of spending over the ne xt 20 years 2005 thr ough 2024 taki ng into account the deterioration of existing bridge s over that period the results of this analysis can be seen in table 1 all dollar figures are adjusted for inflation and expressed in 2004 dollars to maintain the existing level of bridge deficiencies over the next 20 years ie to keep the backlog at the current level in total dollar terms would require 87 billion annually less th an the level of spending in 2004 investment at the maximum economica lly justified leve l would be 124 b illion annually approximate ly 20 per year more than spendi ng in 2004 at this level the backlog of deficiencies would be

guard and the army corps of engineers may be involved in clearing and reopening the waterway number of characteristics of the fhwas federalaid highway program need to be kept in mind during discussion of the federal role in maintaining and improving the nations highway bridge infra structure to begin with although the federalaid highway program provides fe deral money to highways and highway bridges the money itself is normally under the control of the states the state departments of tran sportation state dots within the federal programmatic framework determine for the most part where and on what the money is spent but have to comply with detailed federal pla nning guidelines as part of the decision making process the state dots let the contracts oversee the project development and construction proce ss and provide for the inspection of bridges most of the federalaid highway progra m money provided to the st ate dots is apportioned to them through several large core formula driven programs including the interstate maintenance program im the nationa l highway system nhs the surface transportation program stp the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program cmaq and the hi ghway bridge program hbp these programs were designed to meet certain policy goals over time the state dots have been given increasing flexibility to shift funds from one pr ogram to another to help fulfill their state transportation plans the hbp is the primary source of federal funds for highway bridge replacement r econstruction and capita l maintenance not for new bridge or bridge capacity expansi on states can however if they wish transfer or flex up to 50 of their hbp apportioned funds to certain nonbridge programs theoretically states can also tr ansfer or flex funds from other federal aid highway programs to increase spending through the hbp however certain other formula program funds can be spent on bridge reconstruction and replacement without being flexed ie some hbptype projects are directly eligible under im nhs and stp also number of smaller discretionary programs nominally under the control of the fhwa were designed to provide f unds to projects chosen through competition with other projects in recent years with the exception of fy2007 however most of the discretionary program funding has been earmarked by congress14 the hbp includes 100 million annual setaside of bridge project funds that are designated in the safe accountable flex ible efficient transportation equity act legacy for users safetealu pl 109 59 the setaside has been criticized by supporters of the hbp both because all of the money was designated to projects set forth in the text of the act and because significant dollar amount of the setaside is for new bridge construction which woul d not be normally ligible under the hbphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34127crs7 15 pl 110318 enacted september 15 2008 prov ided transfer of 8017 billion from the treasurys general

account of the highway trust fund htf this highwa account is experiencing financial difficulties and may go into deficit prior to the fy2009 end date for safetealu consequently an increase in federal spe nding for highway bridge repair would require decrease in other highway spendi ng an increase in revenues to the trust fund tax or fee increases drawdown of the htf balances and possibly an earlier deficit condition for the trus t fund or appropriations from the treasurys general fund15 the highway bridge program hbp16 the main federal source of funding fo r highway bridges is the hbp also referred to as the highway bridge repl acement and rehabilitati on program hbrr the hbp is the primary federal program to fund the replacement or rehabilitation of structurally deficient or functionally obsolete bridges the programs base authorization for fy2007 was 43 billion in c ontract authority however additional apportionments to the pr ogram described in table 2 raised the programs gross apportionments to roughly 5 billion as mentioned earlier the plans for the spending of these funds are under the cont rol of the state dots these funds are usually not to be spent on new bridges but are available for the total replacement of structurally deficient or functionally obsolete highway bridge on any public road with new facility constructed in the same general traffic corridor rehabilitation to restore structural integrity of bridge on any public road or to correct major safety defects replacement of certain ferryboat operations and bridges destroyed before 1965

to repair or replace deficient highway bridges each state is guaranteed at least 14 of total program allocation and state may receive an allocation greater than 10 the fede ral share under hbp is 80 except that for interstate bridges the federal share rises to 90 to be eligible for funding under the hbp bridge must be considered deficient and have socalled sufficiency rating on scale of 0100 of 50 or less to be eligible for replacement and have rating of 50 to 80 to be eligible fo r rehabilitation ie bridges with sufficiency rating more than 80 are not eligible further the bridge must be at least 20 feet long nd may not have been constructed or have undergone major reconstructi on within the last 10 years18 the most recent authorization act safetealu provided base authorization of 4188 billion for fy2005 4254 billion for fy2006 4320 billion for fy2007 4388 billion for fy2008 and 4457 billion for fy2009 for hbp the program operates under kind of budget authority called contract au thority that permits the federal obligation ie federal obligation to reimburse the states of funds in advance of an appropriation the act ual apportionments to the hbp program were to be augmented by the equity bonus program nd in some years by the revenue aligned budget authority raba distributions over the life of the act the program was to receive roughly 11 of all the contract authority apportioned by formula over the last 20 years the percentage of actual annual hbp apportionments has varied roughly within the range of 11 to 14 of total nnual apportionments19 funding flexibility and hbp spending as with other federalaid highway programs the states have great deal of control over how where and on what the hbp funds allocated to their state transportation programs are spent in addition the states have the option of not spending all of hbp on bridge projects the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1991 istea pl 102 240 included provision to allow up to 40 of states bridge program apportionment the distribution of funds as prescribed by the bridge program formula to be transferred or flexed to the national highway system nhs or the surface transportation program stp this authority continues to exist the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 pl 105178 increased the allowable transfer percentage to 50 the amount of contract authority that has been transferred is significant since fy2000 20 states and the district of columbia have transferred 28 billion from the bridge pr ogram to other federalaid highway programs see table 5 in appendix b for the transferred amounts broken out by year and state20 it is however obligations rather than c ontract authority that best indicates the amount of money that will eventually be spent

within the national bridge inventory c onduct load capacity calculations to verify that the stress levels on all structural elements including gusset plates remain within applicable design requirements whenev er planned modifica tions or operational changes may significantly increase stresses the safety recommendation noted that the fhwa estimated that recommendation w ould apply to 465 bridges within the national bridge inventory during wreckage recovery investigator s found that gusset plates at eight locations were fractured s ubsequent review of the or iginal i35w bridge design indicated that the original design process of the bridge led to serious error in sizing some of the gusset plates in the main truss gusset plates are riveted or welded steel plates that connect the beams in steel truss bridges bridge gussets are normally expected to be stronger than the beams they connect according to the ntsb the design error that led to the use of undersiz ed gusset plates in the i35w bridge made these gusset plates the weakest rather than the strongest members of the bridge regarding the bridge inspection process the ntsb recommendation notes that bridge inspections under the national brid ge inspection standards would not have identified the gusset design error the standards do not address errors in original design but are directed toward detecting problems such as corrosion or cracking that may degrade the strength of the structure once it has been built the i35w bridge opened in 1967 and had undergone two major renovations in 1977 and in 1988 the renovations added c onsiderable weight to the bridge in addition on the day of the collapse the br idge was being repaved and an estimated 300 tons of construction equipment and materials were on the bridgehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34127crs16 33 for more broadly defined discussion of trends on infrastructure see congressional budget office trends in public spending on transportation and water

target those structurally deficient bridges most in need of attention hr 3999 summarized at the end of this report includes bridge inventory provisions that woul d require riskbased prioritization for the reconstruction of deficient bridgesalthough the investigation revealed design flaw that appears to have contributed to the failure what caused th bridge to fail on august 1 2007 is yet to be determined the investig ation is ongoing and the ntsb is expected to issue determination of probable cause of the bridge collapse by the end of 2008 issues for congress some see the i35w bridge collapse as an example not only of the problem of structurally deficient bridges but for purported infrastructure crisis in general ironically as is indicated by the conditions and performance report the typical and aggregate condition of bridges has actually improved since 1990 however the condition of roads has not experienced the same degree of improvement33 despite the ntsbs interim finding that design flaw in the i35w bridges original design likely contributed to the bridge collapse the issues that emerged following the incident continue to attract public scrutiny within the context of discussion of the upcoming reauthorization of federa l surface transportation programs condition of the nations bridges the number of deficient bridges in the united states has fallen to less than half the number identified in 1990 some would argue that this casts doubt on the need for major policy response to eliminate or more rapidly reduce the roughly 72000 remaining deficient bridges even that lower number of deficient bridges leaves americans exposed to what some might cons ider an unacceptable level of risk the policy question is how quickly can or should the remaining deficient bridges be replaced or repaired some would argue that congress should consider the spending levels described in table 1 that would more quickly reduce or even eliminate the nations deficient bridges by 2024 related issue is one of terminology the terms structurally deficient and functionally obsolete are not synonymous with unsafe the goal of eliminating all structurally deficient bridges quickly could l ead to inefficient spending if significant percentage of these bridges do not actually have significant safe ty issues congress might therefore consider challenging fhwa to come up with rating system and terminology more directly tied to risk34httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34127crs17 providing more money for bridges given that the highway trust fund h tf may go into deficit in fy2009 congress may consider number of financ ing options if it decides to increase spending on bridges provide special treasury general fund transfer to the htf dedicated to acceleration of the repair of the remaining structurally deficient bridges provide increased highway trust f und contract authority for the hbp this could accelerate the approachin g trust fund deficit but it could provide increased funding in the near term the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act pl 110161 provides an additional 1 billion for the hbp from the htf the fuel taxes that provide the vast majority of revenues to the htf were last raised in 1993 some ve proposed raising the fuel taxes to support the htf generally others have suggested an increase just for the bridge program some observers have suggested re directing earmarked funds to the bridge program some have mentioned using publicprivate partnerships ppps as mechanism to help reduce the number of structurally deficient bridges many are skeptical of the use of ppps b ecause they require funding stream such as tolls nd could lead to the conversion of free bridges to toll facilities one variant of the ppp alternative is the longterm leasing of toll facilities to private investors in return for large upfront payment to the state the state could if it wished use this leasederived m oney to supplement its normal state and federal spending on bridge re placement and repair or for other purposes the state of indiana s been using such funding for its 10year infrastructure improvement program this arrangement has been criticized on number of gr ounds including that toll payers continue to pay long after the up front money is spent also some critics argue that it could create an incentive for states that are dealing with constrained budgetar outlook to substitute the lease revenues for their state transporta tion tax revenues nd redirect some of these revenues to pay for nontr ansportation needs another ppp variant that has attracted attention is the missouri plan which is discussed later in this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34127crs18 35 government accountab ility office federalaid highways tr ends effect on state spending and

report on the highway bridge program on september 10 2008 the gao released report examining how the hbp is carried out at the federal state and local level and made suggestions for executive action36 gao found that the program lacks focus performance measures and sustainability for example the programs statutory goals are not focused on clearly identified federal or national interest but rather have expanded from improving deficient bridges to supporting seismic retrofitting preventive maintenance and many other projects thus expanding the federa l interest to potentially include almost any bridge in the country in addition the program lacks measures linking funding to performance and is not sustaina ble given the anticipated deterioration of the nations bridges and the declinin g purchasing power of funding currently available for bridge maintenance rehabilitation and replacement once the federal interest in bridges is clearly defined policymakers can clarify the goals for federal involvement and align the program to achieve those goals hbp sustainability may also be improved by identifying and developing permormance measures and reexamining funding mechanisms missouris

the bridges up to good condition and then maintain them in good condition for 25 years the financing of the missouri plan is seen by many in the transportation community as especially innovative u nder this financing model the state of missouri makes payments for the initial construction which could be completed as early as december 31 2011 after c onstruction the state makes equal annual payments for minimum of 25 years the money for these payments is to come from anticipated federalaid highwa program funds and state f unds to finance the repair and replacement stage of the plan the us dot has approved an allocation of up to 600 million of private activity bonds pab s with the missouri development finance board serving as the conduit issuer for the bonds these pabs provided for under the auspices of provision in safetea lu are allowed to retain their tax exempt status despite greater level of pr ivate involvement than is normally allowed under the us internal revenue code this provides the contractors with access to taxexempt interest rates and will lower their finance costs according to modot by about 70 million the contractors pay off the bonds from the proceeds of their annual payments from modot while the missouri plan as model for other public private partnerships has attractive attributes it may also have some longterm characteristics that states may want to consider prior to adopting similar strategy perhaps the most attractive attribute is that the missouri plan quickly eliminates large number of deficient bridges in the state without starving the other highway projects of funding during the three to fouryear construction stage of th plan the plan also through the use of bonds that are exempt from federal taxes sh ifts portion of the financing cost from the private participants to the federal treasury the plan is designed to maintain the bridges in good condition perhaps freeing state maintenance resources for use on other bridges and highways over the 25year life of the contract the main drawbacks tend to be voiced by those who view th plan from longterm or federal budget perspective in the longrun the use of taxexempt bonds can be costly in terms of lost federal revenue cbo nd others have in the past raised concerns about the longterm costs to the us treasury of dependence on taxexempt financing in comparison to appr opriated spending38 in addition committing significant portion of states federal and state highway re sources to 25year pay out period could become problematic also because state using this mechanism would have to make annual payments without fail an unexpected decline in federal or state highway budgets could cause the cancellation or delay of the funding of other projects in the states transportation

bridge program contract authority has been overblown and with the exception of few states has only been done intermittently to synchronize the funding for brid ge reconstruction and replacement with project timing or to avoid having the contract authority lapse hr 3999 the national highway bridge reconstruction and inspection act summarized later in this report includes provision regarding flexible funding the provision as passed by the house of repr esentatives appears to allow state to transfer any of its hbp apportionments to other federalaid hi ghway programs only if the state demonstrates to the satisfaction of the secretary of dot that the state has structurally deficient bridges on the states national highway system roads that are eligible for replacement this is major narrowing of the scope of the original provision which as introduced would have included all structurally deficient bridges on the entire federalaid highway system the american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto released letter the day after the bill was ordered reported by the house transportation and infrastructure committee that argued that states have wisely used the flexibility provided by the congress under the federal highway bridge program and have invested double the am ount of federal f unds in the preservation and renovation of the nation s bridges because federal statistics fail to track this investment aashto has conducted survey to verify this fact reports alleging diversion of federa l bridge funding are misleading because they fail to look at the total picture of all the resources states commit to bridge improvements in 2004 the federal highway bridge program hbp provided some 51 billion to the states that year states actually spent 66 billion in federalaid for bridge rehabilitation on top of that state and local funding added another 39 billion for bridge repairs so even after acc ounting for the transfers between the fhp to other categories total of 105 billion was invested in bridge repair and rehabilitati on that year transfers between federal programs are simply project manageme nt tool and data on such transfers do not reflect actual levels of state bridge spending41 supporters of limiting the flexing of hb p funds have asserted number of arguments42 given the additional fe deral bridge spending proposed under hr 3999 if the transfer of hbp funding by the states to other federal transportation programs is not re stricted it would create perverse incentive for states to substitute the additional funding

be flexed the states do not really need the hbp contract authority for overall funding management as the states assert if the states are still spending mo re than the apportioned hbr levels on bridges as is argued by flexibility supporters then it is doubtful that states really need hbp transferability in broader sense some also argue that the overall transferability issue is connected to the states lagging maintenance of effort in regard to spending on highways historically fede ral funding was provided to supplement state spending on highways not to substitute for it gao study found that si nce mid1998 states as whole have failed to ma intain financia l level of effort proportional to federal spending increases43 some critics of flexibility would argue that it is not coincidental that the weakened maintenance of effort by the states occurred after flexibility was expanded including the ability to move obligations among programs under the two major surface transportation authoriza tion bills passed during the 1990s44 to mitigate the possible impact of the loss of hbp transferability on state project and state transportation planning ll hbp funds could be made available until expended thereby eliminating the states concern that left over hbp contract authority might lapse if not transferre d the 1 billion in additional hbp funding proposed in hr 3999 is available until ex pended but the funding authorized under safetealu is available for four years only the hbp apportionment formula disincentive to the elimination of ficient bridges the formula for apportionment of hbp f unds to the states is the calculated relative share of total cost to repair or replace deficient highway bridges based on deficient bridge deck area for each state this formula means that states that replace or reconstruct deficient br idges could become eligible for less hbp funding some fear this could create disincentive to re duce the number of deficient bridges in state45 one option would be to reward states that reduce their inve ntory of deficient bridges with funding for bridge mainte nance that would make up for any loss of hbp funding however because of the dist ribution of equity b onus funds relativelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34127crs23 46 federal highway administration obligati on of federal funds for bridge projects underway by improvement type highway statistics washington fhwa various yearsfew states could experience decline in total federal aid highway funding because they have fewer deficient bridges spending of hbp funding on offfederalaid system bridges since 1978 minimum of each states apportionment was to be spent on bridges that were off the federalaid high way system ie bridges on local roads and rural minor collectors until th enactment of safetealu in 2005 there was also maximum 35 that could be spent off system safetealu eliminated the 35 ceiling opening up the entire state allocation under the hbp to spending on nonsystem bridges some have argued th at the ceiling should be reestablished if new source of funding for bridge replacem ent on the major arterials such as the interstate system and the national highway system be established the absence of ceiling on hbp offsystem bridge spending could create an incentive to use the new funding program for the major roads and increase the amount of hbp spending on offsystem roads maintenance vs replacem ent and reconstruction historically one of the questions that has arisen from time to time is whether some federalaid highway pr ograms and the hbp in par ticular have too strong an orientation toward facility replacement or reconstruction and have too little focus on preventive maintenance within the context of the hbp the question is whether the program structure and sufficiency ratings encourage states to substitute bridge replacement for maintenancetype proj ects during fy2002fy2005 of the total obligation of federal funds from all fhwa sources on average 8 was obligated for new bridges 605 was obligated for bridge replacement 5 was for major rehabilitation and 265 was fo r minor bridge work although these figures indicate that the lions share of bridge funding has been obligated for new and replacement bridges these percentages are less than th ey were in the late 1990s the percentage for minor bridge work has increased significantly recently during the fy1997 to fy2001 period minor bridge work averaged only 946 still the case can be made that as the number of deficient bridges decreases rather than reducing the bridge program size it might make sense to shift the focus on the spending over time toward preventive maintenance as was mentioned earlie r eligibility of hbp funding for preventive maintenance is broader than is often pres umed at the state level in addition safetealu clarified that sy stematic preventive maintena nce is an eligible hbp cost whether to spend states hb p funds on preventive maintenance versus reconstruction or

insp ection standards incl uding onsite audits of state inspections however to have an impact fhwa would have to be provided with sufficient funding to hire additi onal engineers and s upport personnel at fhwa division offices and dicate these resources to oversig ht of the inspection program the dot inspector general found that time constraints restricted bridge engineers reviews to only small percentage of the total number of bridges in the state for exam ple one fhwa engineer in large state informed us that he spent only about 15 percent of his time on oversight of the bridge inspection program the major ity of his time was spent providing technical assistance construction insp ection and in committee meetings among other tasks49 inspector training and personnel

longterm sustainability gao07245 at httpwwwgaogovnewitemsd07245pdfand certification programs some believe training of front line inspectors should be both comprehensive and mandatory51 some states certify highway maintenance and other highway department sta ff to perform inspection duties others argue that this kind of multitasking makes insp ection staff subject to frequent use for noninspection duties also since onthejob inspection experience is critical to the development of inspection expertise multitasking can delay the process of building the inspectors knowledge level however some defend multitasking arguing that the practice enhances productivity and allows state dots to train more inspectors than they need on average so that they have the extra inspection personnel to rapidly expand bridge inspections in response to unforseen events such as the collapse of the i35w bridge the american society of civil engineers asce believes that most inspection activities should be performed by licensed professional engineers with nonlicensed inspectors and technicians being used onl for routine inspection procedures and records52 their recommendation could require states and inspection consulting firms to hire significant number of civil engineers hr 3999 includes more limited provision than discussed above that would require that an individual serving as an inspection team leader for the inspection of complex bridges or followup inspections of bridges for which there has been critical finding be licensed professiona l engineer team leaders for all other bridges must either be pr ofessional engineer licensed under the laws of the state or have at least 10 years of bridge insp ection experience th provision would apply only to personnel selected as team leaders after the date of issuance of the regulations implementing this provision emergency relief issues for some disasters congre ss has legislatively raised the federal share for er projects to 100 this has also happened in regard to the i35 bridge in minneapolis which as mentioned earlier was made eligible for 100 federal funding in pl 110 56 the government accountab ility office has called for reexamination of this increasingly common occurrence53 when federal er fundi ng is provided to cover all of failed bridges replacement costs there is less of an incentive for state dot to restrain project costs others argue that because the maintenance and inspection of the bridge was the responsibility of the st ate the state should shoulder some of the cost of failed

2632caveats on spending statistics statistics on bridge spending in the united states are compiled and set forth in different ways and with differing content most observers consider obligations to be the most meaningful indicator of the amount of federal monies being committed each year through the program federal obliga tions for bridge projects occur when the fhwa approves individual project grant agreements these obligations are tracked in fhwas federal management informa tion system fmis which generated the totals set forth in table 6 in appendix c fmis cannot however distinguish between spending on deficien t and nondeficient bridges54 the available statistics on transfers of hbp resources are contract authority statistics programmatic analysis using obligational authority as opposed to cont ract authority can lead to very different representations of spending trends because of the reimbursable nature of the federalaid highway programs the states pay project costs and then submit vouchers for the work done and the treasury reimburses the states throug h electronic funds transfers to the states bank accounts once the outlays are made to the states the money is fungible also there is direct connection between the outlay and the projects other than the previously submitted vouchers as mentioned earlier bridge spending includes significant amounts of state monies which are used bot h to fund the state matching share for federallyfunded projects and also state spe nding in addition to their required share or for 100 statefunded bridge projects different states have somewhat different statistical systems and may classify the ty pe of work done and paid for in different ways in additi on complica ting classification many bridge projects have components that alone would be considered road project and some road projects include bridge components transfers of contract authority or obligational authority can also complicate the tracking of spending this adds difficulty to the development of useful statistics in regard to spending trends and leads to variety of aggregate estimates of total spending on bridges in general and deficient bridges in particular and can complicate policy decision making55 in its recent report on the hbp gao found that it is difficult to determine the impact of hbp due to lack of comprehensive information on state and local spending expansion of bridge project eligibility and limitations in nbi data56httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34127crs27 57 us congress house committee on transportation and infrastructure structurally

considered legislative proposal put forward by committee chairman oberstar that would have created special multielement initiative to repair structurally deficient bridges on the national highway system nhs of which the interstate highways are part58 chairman oberstars proposal would have created separate trust f und for this effort funded by an increase in the federal motor fuels tax 5 cents per gallon andor tax on each barrel 1 barrel of im ported oil refined into motor fuels these taxes which could have raised approxima tely 25 billion over three years were viewed as temporary as was the initiative the new prog ram would have focu sed only on national highway system bridges including interstate bridges and earmarking of the programs funds would not have been allowed the proposal which would have distributed funding to the states on need s basis was withdraw n in favor of hr 3999 which is discussed below president bush reacted to the proposal by stating that he opposed any increase in the fuels tax at this time and suggested instead that congress revisit the funding priorities in existing transpor tation legislation especially as regards to earmarking59 the ranking member of the committee representative mica also suggested that congress needed to revisit its transportation spending priorities stating that the existing program lacked true comp rehensive transpor tation strategy60 in her written testimony before the committ ee secretary of transportation mary peters set forth the bush administration view arguing that increases in federal taxes and spending would likely do little if anything because tax revenues are deposited into centralized federal trust fund and re allocated on the basis of political compromise major decisions on how to prioritize investments and thus spend money are made without consideration of underlying economic or safety meritshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34127crs28 61 bridge collapse continues to spur gislative proposals
