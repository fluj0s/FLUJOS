top sec retco m intorc onn ofornm r point paper 22 feb 06 subject crisscrossproton purpose provide dirnsa information on subject background u history of crisscrossproton how did it come about when and by whom soc nf project crisscross began in the early 1990s when cia and dea collaborated on database and analytical tool suite to perforin link analysis and crossreference lookups against dea and cia collected telephone billing records and phone directories soc nf nsa office of crime and narcotics requested the software and database capabilities of crisscross to enhance sigint data crisscross proved extremely successful at identifying new phone numbers associated with lost drug targets and locating additional targets of interest expanding the coverage from latin america to worldwide then enhanced target development efforts across all nsa product lines u current crisscrossproton agreements soc nf all crisscrossproton agreements are via bilateral memoranda of understanding mou and exist between cia dea nsa dia and fbi dea and fbi do not currently share data with each other soc nf dia provides support to various dod elements eg jicsjacs and other service intelligence structures as specified in mou addendums u how current data in crisscrossproton is minimized and by what standards soc nf from its inception nsa has only provided telephony data to crosscrossproton which constitutes date time duration called number and calling number nsa minimizes this metadata prior to its transmission of data to cia snf nsa data is pulled from the fascia and homebase systems and transmitted to nsa terminal in cias proton project office ssi for us and 2nd party numbers minimization is achieved by replacing the rightmost 4 digits with four xs derived from nsacssm 152 dated 20041123 declassify on 20290325 top sec retco m intorc onn ofornm r top sec retco m intorc onn ofornm r ssi the classification of the nsa callevent records is confidential noforn soc nf nsa office of general counsel ruled that the data contiibuted by cia dia dea and fbi does not need to be minimized by nsa before being incorporated into the nsa proton system as each moa signatory must minimize according to their own authoiities u how crisscrossproton operates today data flowstape cornier tools etc snf proton is proprietary system architecturally inconsistent with dod and nsa development guidelines and environment it requires specific licensing and maintenance expenses and currently cannot be integrated with other tools soc nf data is transferred from nsa dia and fbi to cia electronically or by cornier delivery of magnetic tapes u current proposals to modify pending crisscrossproton with the addition of other data elementscontentprocedures soc nf new communications technologies necessitated evolution of the crisscross software the crisscross system only handled five callrecord fields date time duration called number and calling number proton goes further and analyzes additional data fields that are specific to cell and satellite phones such as imeis and imsis latlong coordinates proton also analyzes email headers not content sms text messages sim cards travel records passport flight description visa application data and excerpts from cia intelligence reports soc nf cia dia and fbi have added these additional data types to proton and share this data with nsa however nsa has never agreed to expand its contiibutions to proton top sec retc m in torc onn ofornm r top sec retco m intorc onn ofornm r soc nf proton perforins entity analysiscontact chaining across data types users may search on target entitys phone number and proton will return the associated email cell phone call records street address and cia intelligence report excerpts soc nf proton tools find other entities that behave in similar manner to specific target it also identifies correspondents in common with two or more targets identifies potential new phone numbers when target switches phones and identifies networks of organizations based on communications within the group soc nf proton provides search capabilities for exploiting commercial phone books and data that do not conform to particular type such as excerpts from cia intelligence reports u current nsa contribution to crisscrossproton data elementsnumber of records to daterecords per weekmonth etc soc nf cia dia fbi and dea contributions over threemonth peiiod totaled 117 billion records which includes many records that are not communicationsmetadata contact records ssinf nsa contiibutions over the same threemonth peiiod totaled 42 billion records again only limited to telephony contact data note under the nsa proposal to create an icwide communications metadata repository nsas contribution would be in the 100s of billions of contact records telephony and dni contact records u how nsa currently uses crisscrossproton in conjunction with other nsa metadata repositories and tools soc nf nsa analysts use proton to perform analysis against data from cia nsa dea fbi and dia in single common interface results provide additional targets of interest for all product lines merging the data produces more complete picture of the targets communications and activity tssinf nsa users reported the following regarding the importance of proton s sigint analysts in iraq attributed proton for successes at locating and apprehending high value individuals hvis proton had the information they needed to get us troops in the right location s proton was critical in capturing hvi who was wanted by the fbi and afosi for terrorist related activity in denver ssi proton provided the location information of money exchange house that was connected to pakistani militant group top sec retc m in torc onn ofornm r top sec retco m intorc onn ofornm r s proton allows single stop to find registration information for phones that are not being used by the person to whom they are registered this is particularly important for front companies where tying multiple phones to the same registration can provide critical information s sid is recommending that dni icwide central communications metadata repository be established and reside at nsa and that dirnsachcss be made executive agent for this ic repository nsa and its foreign sigint partners stand alone in conducting metadata analysis on such large scale and as result our tools and methodologies as well as the infrastructure employed are well tested and have been proven efficient and effective we already extensively share metadata internally within the nsacss enterprise and having recently reached agreement with our second party partners are ready to begin implementing that agreement to share second party metadata writ large snf rather than continuing to push communications metadata out to the proton repository we propose using the existing ic shared information space ics is intelligence community system for information sharing on intelink and have ic users come in through an existing tool to pull data from metadata repositories resident at nsa we would implement ic access to our globalreach federated query service via accounts and access verified by pki certificates this service will provide the access requested and permit the auditing of such repository users we believe we can have globalreach capability ready for the ic within approximately one to two months of decision to proceed with this proposal ufouo originators for the icmetadata proposal for crisscrossproton 22 feb 06 top sec retc m in torc onn
