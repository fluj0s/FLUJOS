arrive march 5 to provide additional assistance tobias said the usg is glad to have the opportunity to help bolivia in its time of need morales thanked tobias for two additional plane loads of assistance and said food rations and donations will be needed for approximately six months in some areas until bolivians can begin to recover from the disasters bilateral relationship 3 c on the bilateral relationship in general morales said he wants an excellent relationship with the united states he explained that bolivia has culture of dialogue and that debate is welcome morales said that while sometimes the press wants to generate conflict between us he wants the maximum level of cooperation with the usg he acknowledged that the united states is the most developed country in the world but noted that the united states faces environmental challenges implying that the united states could learn from the bolivians about how to live at peace with nature ambassadors tobias and shapiro offered support for bolivias goal of more inclusive society but tobias noted that the goal should be placed in the context of democracy that includes all bolivians ambassador tobias emphasized the long relationship between bolivia and the united states which he said the united states values and wants to continue tobias told morales that the united states and bolivia have many things in common

account mca particularly for highway from paz to pando via beni and in an additional atpdea extension morales thanked tobias for congress extension of atpdea benefits and said bolivia wants commerce with the united states so it can export goods to the us market he noted that as developed and developing countries the united states and bolivia complement each other well morales also acknowledged the united states prominent role in international institutions including the world bank and the idb and said he was grateful for that assistance morales said bolivias macroeconomic stability has improved overall largely due to increased hydrocarbons revenues but not enough to create sufficient jobs he also pointed out that his governments hydrocarbons nationalization did not include expropriation of property or assets ambassador tobias responded by saying that the usg is working hard to improve lives create jobs and increase investment in bolivia we recognize that stable economy is key to those goals he said tobias also encouraged morales to aggressively pursue mcc proprosal he emphasized that his visit should be read as strong signal that the united states wants to work with bolivia toward these goals social unrest 5 c morales described bolivias many marches and blockades as largely local problems and accused opposition party podemos of organizing them and plotting against his government he said that in contrast to protests over the past year the marches he led prior to becoming president were apolitical in support of human rights coca and other causes he said the bolivian people received his marches warmly by supporting the marchers and providing them with food morales lamented the most violent conflict in his administration to date the october 2006 conflict between miners in huanuni before the conflict morales said he personally met with miners more than 15 times he said he told both sides that he would work to help them but that they would have to work together morales regretted that they couldnt calling the violence the worst moment in his administration usaid support 6 c morales thanked ambassador tobias for usaid assistance highlighting alternative development programs in particular he noted the current high prices for chapareproduced palm hearts as well as the gobs desire to export more bananas morales said bolivia wants to export alternative development products as successes in alternative development reduce coca cultivation he mentioned the importance of good infrastructure for alternative development projects and thanked tobias for usaid assistance in constructing road in the chapare while stating that the gob wants to maximize us cooperation morales suggested that usaid assistance could be more efficient he said that for the cost of one usaidconstructed soccer field the gob could have built three note morales made this argument previously and ambassador goldberg responded via letter to explain that our numbers indicated otherwise morales also mentioned health and education as critical areas for international cooperation in bolivia 7 c after expressing gratitude for usaid assistance morales indicated that he would prefer that international assistance be donated to the central government not bolivias prefects or mayors he said he would like to establish type of open registry to monitor aid not for purposes of controlling it but for the benefit of bolivias development process he said it would be useful to know the amount of usaid assistance in bolivia and what the money is spent on coca more is less 8 c ambassador tobias highlighted both countries interest in close counternarcotics cooperation and acknowledged the gobs interdiction efforts he said that while the united states remains concerned that any increase in coca cultivation will go to the illegal drug trade he looked forward to continuing to work through those issues with the gob morales responded by saying his government is serious about fighting narcotics trafficking he said that although he has been accused of being narcotrafficker the gob policy is zero cocaine zero drugs he said in bolivia one cant talk about zero coca at the same time he said his governments respect for the traditional use of coca does not imply unrestricted growth morales also explained that cocaine is not part of bolivias indigenous culture 9 c in giving ambassador tobias some of his personal history morales said he was not born cocalero but moved to chapare in 197980 after completing his mandatory military service his family he said focused on rice production but also grew few catos of coca on the side because of globalization and increased international trade in the 1980s brazilian rice became cheaper than bolivian rice thus damaging his familys business he recounted that in those years of hyperinflation people had to sell large bundles of bananas to buy coke or beer morales said eradication with government compensation failed because people became accustomed to being paid large sums of money like by bank in morales opinion militarization also failed as it led to permanent confrontation without results these failures morales said led him to suggest one cato of coca per affiliate to limit production of coca and to prevent conflict he said that when he speaks to the six federations the main coca labor organization in the chapare he tells them if they fail to respect the cato of coca the gob will have to return to militarization he said this serves as strong deterrent 10 c regarding the gobs future plans morales spoke in terms of net reduction of coca and said his government plans to work harder in the yungas particularly in asunta and in caranavi he also stressed the gobs desire for closer counternarcotics cooperation with the united states morales lamented lack of progress in the yungas but said he hoped the situation would improve he thanked the usg for its help eradicating in bolivias national parks calling counternarcotics shared responsibility morales however also defended the gobs proposal to raise the legal limits of coca production to 20000 hectares saying it is impossible to guarantee 10000 12000 hectares of coca but that 20000 hectares is more realistic goal likewise he defended the gobs human rightsconscious policy of rationalization or voluntary eradication stating that statistics show that the process is more effective if it is voluntary while morales admitted increased coca cultivation in some areas he maintained those cases are the exception and not the rule morales said he knows if he fails the united nations and united states will be watching in response to ambassador tobias inquiry about how much coca should be approved for traditional uses under ideal circumstances morales replied less than 20000 hectares he admitted however that the european unions legal demand study was stuck overall morales said he is optimistic about the gobs ability to fight narcotics trafficking having met its obligations in 2006 first joint press conference with morales 10 sbu in an unprecedented move morales joined tobias for joint press conference following the meeting morales stated publicly that he was very happy with the meeting and publicly thanked the usg for disaster assistance noting that more would arrive next week and general cooperation morales said the gobs dialogue with the united states was important to bolivia and that it would continue morales emphasized the gobs culture of dialogue and its respect for differences with other countries additionally in response to questions about the release of the incsr report march 1 morales said that he respected the report as an internal evaluation of our government but that gob statistics on counternarcotics progress were very different comment 11 c in perhaps the embassys most positive meeting with morales to date the president repeatedly thanked tobias privately and publicly for us assistance morales seemed to appreciate the finer points of usaid operations in bolivia and to have superficial understanding of us concerns on counternarcotics as reflected by his discussion of net reduction of coca on trade morales clearly wants an atpdea extension as further evidenced by foreign minister choquehuancas late february trip to washington but again made mention of concrete free trade proposal while it seems that morales may be warming to the benefits of good bilateral relationship his willingness to cooperate on the more difficult issues and to deliver solid political economic and counternarcotics policies may still be another matter end comment this cable has been cleared by ambassadors tobias and shapiro goldberg
