liberties and the sovereignty retained by the several states but also cognizant of the need to provide for the defense of the nation against foreign and domestic threats the framers of the constitution incorporated system of checks and balances to divide the control of the military between the president and congress and to share the control of the militia with the states this report summarizes the constitutional and statutory authorities and limitations relevant to the employment of the armed forces to provide disaster relief and law enforcement assistance congress has the constitutional power to raise support organize and regulate the armed forces art i 8 cls 1114 these clauses do not expressly limit congress as to how when or where it might employ the armed forces although presumably such use must be in furtherance of other constitutional powers congress is also empowered to provide for calling forth the m ilitia to execute federal law and to suppress insurrections 8 cl 15 and to provide for organizing arming and disciplining the militia and to govern them when they are employed in the service of the united states 8 cl 16 once the army is raised or the militia called forth the president serves as their commanderinchief art ii 2 cl 1 and of course the president is vested with the responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed art ii 2 cl 3 congress has delegated to the president the authority to use the armed forces to respond to variety of domestic crises and presidents have asserted some inherent authority to use the military even without express statutory authorization under the constitution states retain the primary re sponsibility and authority to provide for civil order and the protection of their citizens lives and property however the constitution provides that the federal government is responsible for protecting the states against invasion and insurrection and if the state legislature or the governor if the legislature cannot be convened requests it protection against domestic violence art iv 4 states may not keep their own standing armies art i 10 cl 3 but they retain the authority to call forth their militias to suppress insurrections or quell civil disturbances subject to any restraints imposed by the constitution or by congress in the exercise of its constitutional powers congress has complete authority over federal lands military installations and similar areas art i 8 cl 17 g22g145g142g561g18g152g156g156g142g561g5g152g150g146g157g138g157g158g156g561g3g140g157g561 the constitution

any part of the army or the air force as posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws 1 the act does not apply to the navy or marines2 and does not prohibit activities conducted for military purpose base security or enforcement of military discipline that incidentally benefit civilian law enforcement bodies the act does not apply to the national guard unless it is employed in federal

congress has delegated authority to the president to call forth the military during an insurrection or civil disturbance 10 usc 3313354 section 331 authorizes the president to use the military to suppress an insurrection at the request of state government which is meant to fulfill the federal governments responsibility to protect states against domestic violence although the term insurrection is arguably much narrower than the phrase domestic violence section 332 delegates congresss power under the constitution ar t i 8 cl 14 to the president authorizing him to determine that unlawful obstructions combinations or assemblages or rebellion against the authority of the united states make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the united states and to use the armed forces as he considers necessary to enforce the law or to suppress the rebellion section 333 permits the president to use the armed forces to suppress any insurrection domestic violence unlawful combination or conspiracy if law enforcement is hindered within state and local law enforcement is unable to protect individuals or if the unlawful action obstructs the execution of the laws of the united states or impedes the course of justice under those laws this section was enacted to implement the fourteenth amendment and does not require the request or even the permission of the governor of the affected state the insurrection act has been used been used to send the armed forces to quell civil disturbances number of times during us history most recently during the 1992 angeles riots and during
