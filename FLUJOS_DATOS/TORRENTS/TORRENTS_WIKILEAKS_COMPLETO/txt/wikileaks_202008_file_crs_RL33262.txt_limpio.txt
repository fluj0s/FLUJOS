summary there have been sharp debates over the past three decades concerning the appropriate level of funding for us foreign policy programs and it is likely that these debates will continue as congress reviews the presidents fy2007 budget proposal the past 30 years have witnessed wide swings in the amounts of us resources committed to advancing foreign policy and national security interests reflecting changes in global challenges faced by the united states efforts to promote peace in the middle east to confront soviet influence to support new democracies in the postcold war era to fight poverty and disease affecting poor nations to combat global terrorism and to stabilize fragile or failed states have had substantial impact on levels of foreign policy resources key highlights of international affairs spending trends include after substantial decline during the mid1990s total foreign policy spending has grown significantly since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 not only has the united states allocated large amounts of resources for fighting the global war on terror the bush administration has launched two major new foreign aid initiatives the millennium challenge account and the presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar the 538 billion constant fy2006 dollars budget for fy2004 which included iraq reconstruction funds represented by far the highest level of spending during the past three decades although the amount of spending for international activities has grown significantly since september 11 compared to changes in the overall size of the federal budget the share allocated for foreign policy programs has declined with the exception of fy2004 due to increases in defense homeland security and in fy2005 and fy2006 hurricane katrina relief core bilateral development assistance funding accounts those focusing on longterm poverty reduction and economic growth have more than tripled since fy2000 the 59 billion in us aid to africa estimated for fy2006 is the largest level in three decades and totals over two and half times the 22 billion annual average since fy1977 president bush pledged to double us assistance to africa between 2004 and 2010 funding for state department personnel embassy security public diplomacy and dues for international organizations has increased steadily over the past three decades peaking in

legislative branches on the appropriate level of funding for us foreign policy programs these debates are continuing in 2006 as congress reviews the presidents fy2007 budget proposal the past 30 years have witnessed wide swings in the amounts of resources the united states has committed to advancing foreign policy and national security interests reflecting changes in global challenges faced by the united states efforts to promote peace in the middle east to confront soviet influence especially in the developing world to support new democracies in the postcold war era to fight poverty and disease affecting poor nations to combat global terrorism and to stabilize fragile or failed states have had substantial impact on levels of foreign policy resources international affairs funding decisions however are influenced not only by overseas requirements but also by the overall us budget environment and constraints that exist particularly during periods of deficits or when unforseen events demand reallocation of spending priorities congress and the executive branch have reduced foreign policy resources occasionally to greater extent than other sectors of the budget when fiscal austerity or domestic requirements were deemed to be of greater importance likewise during times of international crisis and especially since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 international affairs spending has been one of the most rapidly increasing areas of the us budget foreign policy spending supports variety of us government programs and activities including foreign economic and military assistance contributions to international organizations and multilateral financial institutions diplomatic operations public diplomacy counterterrorism and narcotics initiatives and export promotion this report serves as resource for the annual congressional debate on foreign policy spending providing context and trend analysis of the past 30 years it considers the full scope of the international affairs budget or budget function 150 as foreign policy spending is designated within the context of the congressional budget resolution it also illustrates spending trends of the major components that make up budget function 150 other relevant snapshots of international spending are also examined including how foreign aid resources have been allocated across crs2 several subcategories and trends that are especially applicable to current funding priorities such as confronting global health problems and increasing aid to africa data scope and sources unless otherwise noted dollar figures are expressed as discretionary budget authority representing the amount of funds congress maintains direct control over through enactment of annual appropriation bills data trends begin with fy1977 due to the consistency and availability of figures while some data on federal spending regarding outlays and mandatory programs are available prior to fy1977 omb publishes discretionary budget authority figures only beginning with fy1976 because fy1976 was 15 month transition year in which the beginning date of the fiscal year changed from july 1 to october 1 this analysis starts with fy1977 so that each year covers the same period of time in addition beginning in fy1996 the data include foreign policy resources available for the state department derived from fees collected through the machine readable visa enhanced border securityvisa fraud expedited passport commercial service visa fingerprint affidavit of support diversity lottery defense trade control and international and educational exchange programs excluded are amounts for mandatory foreign service retirement programs as well as resource flows of the foreign military sales trust fund and other mandatory accounts that are not regulated through the appropriations process data also exclude funding for international monetary fund quota increases and for other imf facilities amounts that congress has approved on five occasions in the past 30 years1 each figure illustrates major events influencing sharp changes in foreign policy spending levels and identifies few key budget trends over the past three decades the discussion also references baseline representing the 30year annual average of spending that can be compared with actual amounts for any specific year thereby providing degree of context for assessing the current budget request for the most part and unless otherwise noted data are expressed in constant fy2006 dollars taking into account the effects of inflation over time tables attached to the report as an appendix provide specific numbers used in the analysis expressed in both current and constant terms much of the data are drawn from the office of management and budgets omb annual historical tables volume that accompanies each new budget request made by the administration other sources where appropriate include the 1 the united states participates in the expansion of imf resources or the creation of new imf facility at irregular intervals although congress provides new budget authority through appropriations for the full amount of us participation the transaction is considered as an exchange of assets between the united states and the imf and results in outlays from the us treasury in short the appropriations are offset by the creation of us counterpart claim on the imf that is liquid and interest bearing including budget authority figures for the imf creates spikes in selected years and tends to blur continuing trends in funding levels because of this and the fact that imf budget authority does not result in an outlay or have any impact on the federal deficit or surplus amounts are excluded from this report crs3 department of state the us agency for international development usaid the congressional budget office cbo and house and senate appropriations committees constant dollar calculations are made by crs budget scorekeeping changes and problems with precise analysis of spending trends following enactment of the budget enforcement act of 1990 the united states began applying in fy1992 different procedures for appropriating funds for credit programs prior to fy1992 congress would appropriate the full value of direct loans issued by the us government for commercial loans guaranteed by the united states congress placed annual limitations on the total amount of these guarantees but was not required to appropriate any funds under the terms of credit reform congress began in fy1992 to appropriate the subsidy value of both direct loans issued and loan guarantees backed by the government in simple terms the subsidy value as determined by omb is an amount that represents the risk to the us government in issuing or backing the loan plus the extent to which if any the loan carries concessional interest rate below market value accordingly there are inherent problems with comparing trends before and after fy1992 for any element of discretionary spending that includes credit programs several credit programs operate within budget function 150 direct loans under foreign military financing fmf and prior to fy1999 pl 480 food programs loan guarantees issued by usaid and direct loans and loan guarantees managed by the exportimport bank and the overseas private investment corporation two examples illustrate the mixed impact on appropriation requirements of the credit reform policy changes that took effect for fy1992 in fy1997 congress enacted 60 million subsidy appropriation for fmf direct loans an amount that allowed the defense department to issue military aid loans with total face value of 540 million prior to fy1992 congress would have had to appropriate the full 540 million instead of the 60 million subsidy that backed the loans on the other hand in the case of loan guarantee congress approved in fy1997 35 million subsidy appropriation permitting usaids urban and environmental credit program to guarantee 294 million in loans these represent loans issued by commercial lenders for which the united states government guarantees repayment before fy1992 appropriation would have been required thus congress appropriated in fy1997 635 million in support of these two programs whereas budget rules that existed prior to the 1992 credit reform would have required an appropriation of 540 million to implement these same two activities because omb has not adjusted its figures for prefy1992 credit programs comparisons between the two time periods cannot be totally precise nevertheless an assessment of funding trends before and after fy1992 is still useful in identifying an illustrative pattern of spending decisions while the application of postcredit reform procedures on balance probably tends to overstate somewhat the degree of reductions in function 150 spending during the mid1990s the extent of this overstatement does not appear to be sufficient to override the general conclusion that cuts in the international affairs budget were substantial during that period comparison of the increases in fy1999 fy2006 for function 150 resources with crs4 pre1992 levels face the same methodological problems for selected subcategories of the international affairs budget however where credit programs exist such as for state department and public diplomacy programs the credit reform changes have effect on measuring and comparing discretionary spending international affairs discretionary budget authority international affairs discretionary budget authority measured in real terms has experienced several cycles over the past three decades there were periods of rapid growth followed immediately by sharp declines during the mid1980s after several years in the late 1980s and early 1990s of relative stable budget levels amounts fell at first gradually and then sharply through fy1997 the foreign policy budget rose slightly in fy1998 but significantly in fy1999 and fy2000 compared to amounts during the mid1990s growth in the function 150 budget continued following the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 reaching by fy2004 the highest level of foreign affairs spending in three decades the earlytomid 1980s were marked by steady increase in foreign policy spending largely the result of rising amounts of security aid allocated for strategic purposes in central america pakistan and military base rights countries such as the philippines at the same time that growth in security aid peaked in fy1985 congress approved two major supplementals 225 billion economic aid package for israel egypt and jordan and about 1 billion in famine relief for africa all of these factors combined to set foreign affairs discretionary budget authority at 3896 billion in fy2006 dollars level about 5 higher than the fy2006 amount absent the unique combination of these international demands that spiked aid spending in fy1985 and with intensifying pressure in washington to reduce the federal deficit function 150 discretionary spending like other federal spending fell abruptly in fy1986 and declined further in the next two years to point more than 25 less than where the foreign policy budget had stood just three years earlier the following period fy1988 through fy1993 marked relatively stable level of foreign affairs budget authority ranging in most years roughly between 28 and 29 billion annually as calculated in fy2006 dollars to considerable extent this steady period can be attributed to annually negotiated budget agreements between the administration and congress for major discretionary spending categories one of which was international affairs small temporary upsurge occurred in fy19901991 primarily the result of supplemental appropriation for aid to panama and nicaragua additional costs associated with the persian gulf war including supplemental assistance for israel and turkey and added expenses for us agencies operating in the gulf region although the foreign affairs budget had been on long downward trend since fy1985 the drop in fy1994 was the first significant annual decrease in real terms since fy1988 the 38 real cut for fy1994 was followed by two years of increasingly larger reductions for foreign policy programs fy1995 discretionary crs5 budget authority dropped 55 below fy1994 followed by an 113 cut in fy1996 reductions continued for fy1997 although at more modest 13 level this downward cycle reversed in fy1998 with international affairs budget authority rising by 4 in real terms over fy1997 followed by far more significant rise 214 in foreign policy spending for fy1999 in addition to approving modest increases for programs throughout the function 150 account congress further agreed to nearly 1 billion for us arrearage payments to various international organizations and multilateral development banks about 15 billion for security upgrades at american embassies and missions around the world following the embassy bombings in kenya and tanzania and large supplementals for central american victims of hurricane mitch 1 billion and for kosovo humanitarian aid relief 11 billion similarly large supplemental in fy2000 supporting 18 billion onetime aid package in support of the wye rivermiddle east peace accord and about 1 billion for colombian counternarcotics program plus rising budgets for number of regular and continuing foreign affairs programs in fy2001 kept foreign policy spending at around 274 billion during the fy1999 2001 period onequarter higher than the low point of fy1997 the most defining change in us foreign policy spending however came following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states since 911 american foreign aid and diplomatic efforts have taken on more strategic sense of importance and have been cast frequently in terms of contributing to the global war on terrorism including assistance to about 30 frontline states in the terrorism war countries that cooperate with the united states in the war on terrorism or face terrorist threats themselves2 through series of emergency supplemental appropriations by fy2003 congress had boosted the international affairs budget following the 911 attacks to 374 billion in real terms at roughly the same time that fighting terrorism became the leading concern of us foreign policy the bush administration announced other significant initiatives that have added to growing foreign affairs budget the millennium challenge account mca is new aid delivery concept authorized by congress and established in early 2004 that is intended to concentrate significantly higher amounts of us resources in few low and lowermiddle income countries that have demonstrated strong commitment to political economic and social reforms mca funding had been expected to grow to 5 billion annually by fy2006 although actual appropriations 177 billion in fy2006 have been far more modest addressing global health problems has further become core us aid objective in recent years congress created separate appropriation account for child survival and health activities in the mid1990s and increased funding for international hivaids and other infectious disease programs president bushs announcement at his 2003 state of the union message of fiveyear 15 billion effort to combat 2 according to the state department these frontline states include afghanistan algeria armenia azerbaijan bangladesh colombia djibouti egypt ethiopia georgia hungary india indonesia jordan kazakhstan kenya oman pakistan philippines poland russia saudi arabia tajikistan tunisia turkey turkmenistan uzbekistan and yemen crs6 aids malaria and tuberculosis presidential emergency plan for aids relief pepfar has added greater emphasis to this primary foreign assistance objective and contributed to higher international affairs spending resources committed to fighting terrorism and rebuilding afghanistan and iraq plus the launch of the mca and pepfar initiatives pushed us foreign policy spending in fy2004 to 538 billion in real terms the highest level in over three decades even excluding the 1845 billion for iraq reconstruction from the total fy2004 remains one of the largest international affairs budgets during this period without the significant iraq reconstruction appropriation of fy2004 the fy2005 foreign affairs budget dropped back to 368 billion although it represented an 11 increase for international activities other than iraq another large emergency supplemental for fy2005 dealing with other foreign crises tsunami disaster relief palestinian aid package conflict in the darfur region of sudan and accelerated afghan reconstruction efforts pushed budget function 150 to its highest level excluding iraq since fy1985 as overall budget pressures increased in the 109th congress and the unanticipated emergency to address the victims and destruction of hurricane katrina for the first time during the bush administration congress reduced by 21 billion or 64 the presidents regular foreign policy request subsequently however congress approved emergency supplemental spending of 425 billion for iraq afghanistan and various humanitarian crises around the world at 3696 billion the international affairs budget for fy2006 is one of the highest in three decades and is 21 higher than the annual average over the past 30 years crs7 key trends note unless otherwise stated figures are expressed in constant fy2006 dollars the 3696 billion fy2006 foreign policy budget is the largest for all but four years during the past three decades spending in fy2006 is 21 higher than the 3048 billion figure 1 international affairs spending annual average level since 1977 international affairs spending for fy2006 is nearly two thirds higher than in fy1997 when the budget reached its lowest point in 30 years the five foreign policy budgets since 911 represent the largest sum total of any period since 1977 fy2004 which includes 184 billion for iraq reconstruction was by far the largest budget in 30 years due to embassy security and central american disaster aid supplementals spending surged by 21 in fy1999 from the previous year the largest increase in decade foreign policy resources declined steadily for six years following the end of the cold war budget reduction pressures pushed foreign policy and most federal resources down sharply during the late 1980s large middle east and africa aid supplementals coupled with continued growth of security assistance pushed the fy1985 foreign policy budget to the highest level except for fy2004 over the 30 year period spending grew during the early 1980s largely due to increasing security aid for central america and countries that granted the us military base access crs8 international affairs budget as percent of total us discretionary funds another way of analyzing trends in international affairs resources is to draw relationships between foreign policy spending and overall funding for total federal discretionary programs this is relevant especially for the present debate over budgetary prioritysetting decisions since it is within the roughly 840 billion non emergency discretionary budget for fy2006 that international affairs requirements must compete one of the most striking differences between measuring the international affairs budget as percent of total federal discretionary spending shown in figure 2 or as the level of total dollars appropriated figure 1 is the trend for each in recent years although the amount of spending for international activities has grown significantly since september 11 compared to changes in the overall size of the federal budget the share allocated for foreign policy programs has declined with the exception of fy2004 and the 1845 billion supplemental for iraq the estimated level for fy2006 is 341 the lowest level for any year in the last three decades and about oneeighth less than the 396 annual average since fy1977 if however the surge in spending for iraq in fy2004 is folded into the entire post911 period the annual average of the past four years equals the historic 396 average for the international affairs account this recent trend which is somewhat counterintuitive results from even larger increases in us government spending in noninternational sectors especially for defense homeland security and domestic disaster relief defense spending which accounted for roughly half the discretionary budget authority prior to 911 grew to more than 54 by fy2004 what the united states now defines as homeland security spending category that did not exist prior to 911 has risen by about one third series of emergency supplementals totaling about 821 billion for relief of hurricane katrina victims pushed shares for other budget activities including function 150 down for fy2005 and fy2006 for the period prior to the terrorist attacks of september 11 the patterns in figures 1 and 2 for foreign policy spending are similar although the degree of sharp growth and decline are muted somewhat when measuring discretionary ba as of total budget authority one of the most notable trends is the substantial continuity in the amount of the budget authority devoted to international affairs during an eight year period fy1988 to fy1995 although dollar amounts for foreign affairs may have risen somewhat in fy1991 due to the gulf war and fallen through the next four years function 150s proportion of total discretionary budget authority deviated only slightly from sustained level of 4 annually in short even though the foreign policy budget fell steadily in the early to mid1990s it declined at roughly the same pace as the total for all other programs funded through discretionary spending but in fy1996 this 4 share that had been sustained for eight years ended and function 150s proportion fell to 363 in fy1997 and fy1998 it fell further to about 36 of discretionary ba thus at time when congress and the president had reduced total discretionary budget authority resources for foreign policy programs declined faster than other federal programs crs9 note unless otherwise stated figures are expressed key trends in constant fy2006 dollars the fy2006 foreign policy budgets share of total federal discretionary budget authority is 341 substantially figure 2 international affairs budget as of total us smaller than the 30 year annual average of 396 budget authority including the iraq reconstruction supplemental the fy2004 554 share of total spending was the largest for budget function 150 in three decades despite the significant increases in foreign policy resources since september 11 except for fy2004 the share of function 150 of total us discretionary spending has declined this is largely due to more rapid rise in defense and homeland security appropriations and in fy2005 and fy2006 relief for victims of hurricane katrina with the exception of the years following two large spikes associated with the camp davidmiddle east peace accord fy1979 and iraq reconstruction fy2004 the singleyear cut for foreign policy spending of 113 in fy1996 was the largest in three decades and nearly six times larger than cuts for the rest of the budget crs10 foreign assistance component of the international affairs budget the largest single element of the foreign policy budget supports broad range of development humanitarian securityeconomic and military assistance programs in most years foreign aid makes up about twothirds of budget function 1503 with such large portion of the international affairs budget supporting foreign assistance the patterns and trends for foreign aid are quite similar to the entire function 150 following the september 11 terrorist attacks reconstruction initiatives in afghanistan and iraq plus more general assistance to countries supporting us efforts in the global war on terror have pushed foreign aid spending levels up significantly during this same period president bush launched two major aid initiatives the presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar five year 15 billion activity and the millennium challenge account anticipated to grow to 5 billion annual program concentrating on countries that have performed well on governance economic and social measures combined with responses to unanticipated international emergencies in recent years including the indian ocean tsunami and conflict in the darfur region of sudan the foreign aid budget has grown from 184 billion just prior to 911 to 252 in fy2006 constant dollars more than onethird increase in only four years fy2004 was the largest year post911 at 433 billion although this included an unusually large 1845 billion supplemental for iraq prior to 911 foreign aid spending had already been growing since fy1997 when funding hit its lowest point over the past 30 years while resources for continuing foreign aid programs rose modestly during the period levels were pushed higher nearly 21 between fy1997 and fy2001 by series of new initiatives and humanitarian crises considerable amounts were programmed for the wye river middle east peace effort the united states cleared most of its accumulated arrears owed to the and world bank the clinton administration joined other donors in expanding debt relief for the worlds poorest nations and the bush administration launched major counternarcotics effort in colombia that later evolved into program for the entire region the andean counterdrug initiative aci the united states also responded to several humanitarian emergencies including those for the victims of hurricane mitch in central america and the violence in kosovo the low point in foreign aid spending fy1997 came following steady decline over decadelong period that began with passage in 1985 of the gramm rudmanhollings deficit reduction act the foreign aid budget fell by nearly 24 real terms between fy1985 and fy1986 and continued to decline in subsequent years as congress and the president worked towards reducing discretionary spending with the fall of the berlin wall the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war much of the rationale used for supporting us foreign assistance during 3 budget function 150 is divided into several subfunctions foreign aid corresponds to subfunction 151 or international development and humanitarian assistance and to subfunction 152 or international security assistance crs11 the previous four decades disappeared with the exception of fy1991 when congress approved additional resources for countries affected by the persian gulf war the foreign aid budget continued its steady decline through fy1997 by that point foreign assistance resources in real terms stood 54 below levels of decade earlier the first term of the reagan administration saw steady large increase in foreign aid spending culminating in fy1985 when resources reached 33 billion the third highest single year level in the past three decades growth occurred not because of policy consensus over the importance of foreign assistance but rather because of significant policy differences between the executive and legislative branches early in the reagan administration officials attempted to reduce multilateral development contributions while at the same time increasing strategic types of foreign assistance congress blocked efforts to cut multilateral and other economic aid but also approved much of the funds sought by the executive for security assistance programs in central america and aid to countries that provided us access to military bases the peak year of fy1985 included large supplemental package for israel egypt and jordan payment of arrears owed to the world bank and humanitarian relief for victims of severe famine in africa crs12 key trends note unless otherwise stated figures are expressed foreign aid spending the combined resources for in constant fy2006 dollars development humanitarian security economic and military assistance has grown significantly since 911 augmented by the launch of two major aid initiatives for hivaids and the millennium challenge account figure 3 foreign aid discretionary budget authority the 252 billion total for fy2006 is about 9 higher than the 231 billion annual average since fy1977 fy2004 including iraq reconstruction was the highest foreign aid budget in 30 years foreign aid spending declined substantially following the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war between fy1990 and fy1997 funding for foreign assistance fell by 31 to 30year low of 152 billion during the first term of the reagan administration foreign aid grew at steady pace larger contributions to the world bank increased assistance to central america and countries providing the us with military base access famine relief in africa and an economic stabilization package for israel culminated in fy1985 with the third largest foreign aid budget in 30 years the following year congress enacted the grammrudman hollings deficit reduction act and foreign assistance like most other federal spending programs fell sharply the oneyear costs of security assistance in support of the camp david accord pushed foreign aid in fy1979 to the highest point other than fy2004 crs13 breaking down bilateral foreign aid spending patterns as noted above foreign assistance includes widebreadth of programmatic tools utilized in support of various and in some cases divergent us foreign policy objectives spending patterns for different components of foreign aid have varied considerably over the past three decades as illustrated in the charts that follow although there is precise definition of major bilateral foreign aid categories this discussion divides programs into four clusters 1 core development assistance that generally employs longterm poverty reduction and economic growth strategies 2 humanitarian relief activities that aim to save lives and provide basic services immediately following natural or manmade disaster or support the needs of refugee populations over an extended length of time 3 politicalsecurity economic aid intended to help bolster the economies of countries of special strategic interest to the united states or nations undergoing transitions to democratic and market economic systems such as the states of the former soviet union and 4 military assistance that helps american friends and allies strengthen their defense capabilities core bilateral development assistance the growth in spending since fy2000 on core bilateral development assistance programs represents perhaps the most dramatic increase of any component of the international affairs budget4 the 69 billion total for fy2006 is the largest in 30 years and more than three times larger in real terms than the 213 billion budget for fy2000 current spending is also well more than double the annual average funding level over the past three decades the most important components of for this sizable increase have been the launching of two new bilateral development aid initiatives by the bush administration the millennium challenge account mca promising to eventually total 5 billion annually and the presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar adding 10 billion in new assistance over five years each began in fy2004 and has grown in subsequent years annual increases over the previous year level of spending on bilateral development aid have risen in real terms by 44 in fy2004 21 in fy2005 and 135 in fy2006 while the mca and pepfar contributed significantly to core bilateral development assistance spending funds were rising prior to fy2004 congress 4 core bilateral development assistance is defined as funds provided currently through four appropriation accounts development assistance fund child survival and health global aids initiative and the millennium challenge account previously core accounts also included the development fund for africa fy1988fy1994 population assistance fy1977fy1994 sahel development program fy1977fy1979 and the so called functional development accounts that congress created in the new directions legislation of 1973 providing bilateral development aid for agriculture health population education and technical assistance fy1977fy1992 these latter accounts were replaced with the current account configuration crs14 began increasing the presidents request for both the development assistance fund and the child survival and health account in fy2001 adding resources for such programs supporting basic education hivaids malaria and tuberculosis following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the administration added development along with defense and diplomacy as the three pillars of us national security which also assigned greater importance to bilateral development assistance and its role in the global war on terrorism annual increases over the previous year fy2001fy2003 totaled 19 9 and 24 respectively prior to the most recent surge in bilateral development aid spending levels for much of the period beginning in fy1977 remained relatively stable in real terms development assistance resources experienced small increases in the late 1970s when the carter administration made africa an aid priority and during the early 1980s when all components of us foreign aid rose during the first term of the reagan administration after falling to 26 billion in fy1986 development aid budgets remained steady growing somewhat to 3 billion by fy1991as congress sought to double us development assistance to africa over period of years with the end of the cold war and shifting congressional budget priorities in the mid1990s however development aid like most other categories of american foreign aid declined sharply dropping to 203 billion fy2006 dollars by fy1997 the lowest point during the past 30 years crs15 note unless otherwise stated figures are expressed key trends in constant fy2006 dollars core bilateral development assistance funding accounts currently consisting of the development assistance fund child survivalhealth global aids initiative and figure 4 core bilateral development assistance the millennium challenge account have increased by spending more than 3 times since fy2000 the fy2006 level of 69 billion is the largest during the past 30 years and is well more than twice the size of the annual average over this three decade period development aid spending fell sharply following the end of the cold war reaching 30year low point in fy1997 at 203 billion for 13 year period beginning in fy1977 development assistance resources remained relatively stable ranging in several of these years between 27 billion and 28 billion crs16 humanitarian assistance5 the united states consistently large contributor to international disaster and humanitarian relief operations has spent unprecedented amounts on global humanitarian emergencies in recent years the confluence of several natural disasters hurricane mitch which struck central america in late 1998 drought in ethiopia and elsewhere in africa since 2002 the indian ocean tsunami which struck in december 2004 and the october 2005 earthquake in pakistan plus continuing conflicts around the world kosovo 1999 liberia until 2003 afghanistan 2002 preiraq war 2003 haiti 2004 and darfur since 2003 combined to push foreign aid spending on humanitarian crises to their highest levels in three decades6 the 383 billion humanitarian aid budget for fy2003 was the largest since fy1977 and slightly higher than the 373 billion funding level for fy2005 resources for fy2006 3 billion are lower than the recent peak years although they remain one of the largest totals over the past 30 years in only two years prior to fy1999 have humanitarian aid funding levels come close to recent totals for fy1980fy1981 large supplementals for indochina and sovieteast european refugee resettlements brought amounts to around 28 billion in fy1985 humanitarian relief spending exceeded 275 billion largely due to substantial us response to major famine in africa assistance to populations affected by the gulf war in 1991 and to victims of conflict in bosnia haiti and rwanda in 1994 represented other surge years for humanitarian aid budgets 5 while there is official definition of what constitutes us humanitarian assistance this discussion is based on spending appropriated in the current foreign operations and agriculture accounts for international disaster and famine assistance transition initiatives migration and refugee assistance emergency migration and refugee assistance fund and title ii of pl 480 food assistance in addition in selected years congress has created special accounts for specific relief efforts such as the tsunami recovery and reconstruction fund 2005 and central america and the caribbean emergency 1999 figures do not include amounts funded outside budget function 150 such as the defense departments overseas humanitarian disaster and civic action account provided in annual dod appropriations for more information regarding us international humanitarian aid see crs report rl32714 international disasters and humanitarian assistance us government response by rhoda margesson 6 because many humanitarian emergencies continue well beyond the year in which they first arise aid programs may be ongoing for several of these cases crs17 note unless otherwise stated figures are expressed key trends in constant fy2006 dollars due to the unforeseen and unpredictable nature of events requiring humanitarian relief spending figure 5 humanitarian assistance spending patterns have been highly erratic over the past 30 years in general however resources committed for food disaster and refugee support have been growing for the past two decades amounts have been especially large in several years since fy1999 fy2006 appropriations for humanitarian aid programs at 3 billion fall below recent years fy1999 fy2003 and fy2005 for the entire 30year period fy2006 spending on humanitarian relief operations is nearly 30 higher than the 232 billion annual average but only slightly larger than the annual average since fy1999 crs18 politicalsecurity economic assistance7 the united states utilizes several types of economic assistance in pursuit of strategic objectives that do not have as their primary goal longterm economic growth poverty reduction or humanitarian relief these latter purposes may be of secondary importance in providing strategic assistance but nevertheless the ways in which either type of aid is delivered may be the same in general the specific rationale of why the assistance is provided determines whether it falls into primarily developmenthumanitarian aid accounts or into another set of politicalsecurity related assistance programs the primary channel for transferring politicalsecurity economic assistance is through the economic support fund esf an account previously referred to as security supporting assistance and defense support esf resources have been used in support of middle east peace efforts since camp david in fy1979 for helping the us gain access to military bases in the philippines and elsewhere during the 1980s for backing central american governments during conflicts in the mid1980s assisting panama and nicaragua stabilize following government changes in 1990 and most recently supporting group of about 30 nations regarded as the frontline states in the global war on terror gwot other types of politicalsecurity economic programs include those authorized in the early 1990s for helping the countries of eastern europe and the former soviet union transition to democratic and market economic states counternarcotics efforts which became major initiative in colombia and elsewhere in the andean region nonproliferation programs and antiterrorism activities are other types of politicalsecurity economic assistance the large amount of reconstruction assistance provided to iraq in fy2003 fy2004 and fy2006 also falls within this category budget spikes for politicalsecurity economic assistance tend to occur following major new international events including peace agreements and the termination of hostilities in conflictstricken areas several of which are noted above and illustrated in figure 6 below continuing yeartoyear politicalsecurity economic aid on the other hand has remained more steady than other types of us foreign aid ranging in nonpeak years between 4 billion and 6 billion in real terms the current fy2006 69 billion politicalsecurity assistance budget is not large compared with levels approved in fy2003 and fy2004 but is the sixth highest amount during the past 30 years fy2006 levels are 45 larger than the 30year annual average although if iraq reconstruction funds are excluded fy2006 is nearly 10 below the three decade annual average 7 foreign operations appropriation accounts that make up politicalsecurity economic assistance include the economic support fund international fund for ireland assistance for eastern europe and the baltic states seed assistance for the independent states of the former soviet union fsa democracy fund international narcotics control and law enforcement incle andean counterdrug initiative aci and the nonproliferation antiterrorism demining and related programs nadr crs19 key trends note unless otherwise stated figures are expressed politicalsecurityrelated economic programs generally in constant fy2006 dollars focus on countries or initiatives of strategic importance to the united states and funding levels tend to spike due to new circumstances including peace agreements or post figure 6 politicalsecurity economic aid spending conflict aid fy2006 spending on politicalsecurity economic aid at 69 billion is lower than fy2003 and fy2004 but 45 larger than the 30year annual average peak years for politicalsecurity economic aid spending coincide with specific events iraq reconstruction fy2004 and fy2006 preiraq war aid for frontline states in the global war on terror fy2003 the wye rivermiddle east peace accord fy2000 large supplemental for russia and other states of the former soviet union fy1993 government changes in panama and nicaragua fy1990 large supplemental for israel egypt and jordan fy1985 and the camp david peace accord fy1979 other than these peak years politicalsecurity economic aid resources have remained relatively stable at between 4 billion and 6 billion per year crs20 military assistance8 through its military assistance programs the united states provides friends and allies with defense equipment and training as well as contributing to nonun peacekeeping operations although low by historical trends military aid budgets during the postseptember 11 period have been higher than at any time since the end of the cold war nevertheless amounts for fy2006 49 billion are nearly 30 less than the annual average since fy1977 military assistance spending in fy2005 and fy2006 would have been significantly higher if not for an administration decision backed by congress to fund with defense department resources 11 billion in programs to train and equip afghan and iraqi security forces in the previous three fiscal years such activities had been financed through the foreign military financing fmf program and the iraq relief and reconstruction fund irrf both of which fall within the international affairs budget function although this represents substantial shift from traditional state department policy and budgetary authority over military assistance the administration says that it intends to continue this financing structure in future years levels of military assistance declined steadily in the period following the end of the cold war as the united states ended most defense support to countries other than israel egypt and few east europeanformer soviet states this reduction however had actually begun in fy1987 when countries such as spain and south korea graduated as military aid recipients the early part of the 1980s witnessed steady increase in military assistance which became primary tool for advancing the reagan doctrine policy of supporting anticommunist insurgents around the world this included sharp rise in military support to salvador and honduras in central america to the philippines and other nations providing the united states access to overseas military bases and to pakistan frontline state on the border with sovietoccupied afghanistan 8 accounting for military assistance uses different methodology than found elsewhere in this report while other budget trends are expressed in terms of discretionary budget authority military aid figures are expressed as total program size this is because at times during the past 30 years and especially in the 1970s and 1980s the united states provided large amounts of military support in the forms of marketrate loans rather than as grants or subsidized loans budgeting methods for military loans have changed several times in the past three decades at times requiring appropriations to equal the total face value of the loans yet in other years only requiring congress to provide as little as 10 of the face value of the loans by using figures for the total volume of military aid provided regardless of the budget rules that may have applied at the time allows for more consistent trend analysis current military assistance programs include foreign military financing fmf international military education and training imet and peacekeeping operations each managed by the state department for the most part the state department controls the funds and sets program policy while the defense department implements the activities crs21 since the signing of the camp david peace accord in 1978 promoting middle east peace has been cornerstone of us military assistance in fy1979 military aid reached its 30 year peak of 152 billion in real terms largely because of substantial military support package offered to israel and egypt as part of the negotiations from that point these two countries have accounted for roughly two thirds of total us military assistance crs22 key trends even more so than politicalsecurityrelated economic assistance military aid focuses on countries and international initiatives of strategic importance to the united states the military aid budget for fy2006 at 49 billion is the sixth lowest spending level in the figure 7 military aid spending past three decades it falls nearly 30 below the annual average for this period significant factor as to why military assistance has not been higher in the post911 period and especially for fy2005 and fy2006 is the administrations decision to shift funds to train and equip security forces in iraq and afghanistan from the international affairs budget to the defense budget in these two years congress appropriated 11 billion for such purposes managed by the defense department which in previous years had been funded under state department accounts military assistance spending in fy2003 and fy2004 was the highest since the end of the cold war during the first term of the reagan administration military aid resources more than doubled with significant increases for friends in central america countries that provided military base access to the united states israel and egypt greece and turkey pakistan and other strategic partners under the reagan doctrine fy1979 the year following the signing of the camp david peace accord represented the highest level of military aid funding during the past 30 years crs23 foreign assistance to africa over the past three decades countries in subsaharan africa have received 722 billion constant fy2006 dollars in economic and military assistance from the united states while aid to the continent is sizable africa has never been the primary target of american resources especially compared with the middle east throughout the entire period and asia and latin america during the 1980s in 2005 however considerable international attention focused on african development issues leading to appeals to sharply increase assistance for poverty reduction postconflict stabilization health needs and other challenges facing the continent at the g8 summit in july 2005 the bush administration announced pledge to double us bilateral assistance to africa from 43 billion in 2004 to 86 billion by 20109 if achieved this would accelerate what has already been an increasing emphasis and priority of american foreign aid resources to the region in recent years already us assistance to africa has more than doubled since fy2001 rising from 24 billion to 59 billion in fy2006 and more than tripled since 16 billion total in fy1997 the sizable increase in us assistance to africa since the late 1990s has been the result of three factors first subsaharan africa has been principal beneficiary of several new american foreign aid initiatives in recent years series of relatively modest but targeted aid activities launched during the bush administration have included the africa education initiative 200 million over five years beginning in fy200110 the congo basin forest partnership 53 million fy2002fy2005 the initiative to end hunger in africa 2002 trade for african development and enterprise initiative 2001 womens justice and empowerment in africa among others selected african nations will also benefit from the millennium challenge account mca which began operations in fy2004 madagascar benin and cape verde are among the eight countries selected thus far to receive multiyear grants in recognition of sound economic and governance performance 12 billion five year antimalaria program launched in fy2006 is also expected to provide substantial amounts of additional assistance to the region through fy2010 the presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar however has been the most expansive of the bush administration foreign aid policies benefitting africa begun in fy2004 much of the fiveyear 15 billion program will assist 15 focus countries that face the most serious threats from hivaids twelve of the focus nations are in subsaharan africa receiving over 22 billion in the first three years of the initiative for the prevention and treatment of the aids pandemic like 9 the 2004 estimate is based on data compiled by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and does not match exactly the methodology used in this report to total aid levels most importantly the oecd figures are based on disbursements of resources while this report uses budget authority or appropriated amounts 10 the white house announced in june 2005 that this program will continue providing 400 million fy2006fy2010 crs24 the mca and malaria programs pepfar resources are expected to rise in the near term providing additional amounts of aid to the region second factor in the growing volume of us assistance to africa has been the response to number of humanitarian crises including food shortages in ethiopia and elsewhere and conflict in liberia and sudan food aid to countries in africa grew from an average of about 400 million annually in the late 1990s through fy2002 to an annual average of about 11 billion fy2003fy2005 third reason for the rising level of assistance to africa in recent years has been the growing size of contributions to various peacekeeping operations in the region funding for activities in sierra leone the democratic republic of congo liberia sudandarfur and cote divoire and efforts to better train and equip peacekeeping forces of the african union have been especially large us costs in support of these missions have averaged about 835 million annually beginning in fy2002 or about five times the annual average of the four previous years us assistance to africa fell sharply in the mid1990s following the end of support for peacekeeping operation in somalia cuts in bilateral development assistance and temporary suspension of contributions to the african development bank and african development fund due to concerns over management issues at the institutions the 16 billion total us aid package to africa in each of fy1996 and fy1997 was the lowest amount in real terms since fy1979 during the 1980s us assistance to subsaharan africa peaked in fy1985 at 29 billion largely due to sizable food assistance supplemental responding to major famine in the region plus higher levels of securityrelated economic assistance esf being programmed in african countries assistance however fell sharply the next two years as esf transfers declined or were redirected to other more strategic areas of the world reflecting concern over the transfer of economic aid from africa to other regions in fy1988 congress created separate appropriation account for the region the development fund for africa dfa so that aid levels for africa would be more clearly designated in spending bills dfa resources grew from about 500 million to nearly 800 million by fy1993 before beginning to slide downward the next several years congress ended the separate dfa appropriation account in fy1996 crs25 key trends note unless otherwise stated figures are expressed the bush administration announced in july 2005 that the in constant fy2006 dollars united states would double bilateral aid to africa increasing it from 43 billion in fy2004 to 86 billion by fy2010 figure 8 africa assistance the 59 billion in us aid to africa estimated for fy2006 is the largest level in three decades and totals nearly three times the 22 billion annual average since fy1977 humanitarian crises in ethiopia liberia sudan and elsewhere large contributions to peacekeeping operations in sierra leone democratic republic of congo liberia and sudandarfur and the launch of the presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar resulted in significant increases in us assistance to africa since fy2002 reductions in development and food aid coupled with suspension of contributions to the african development bank and fund afdb pushed us assistance to africa in fy199697 to near threedecade low following twoyear sharp reduction in us aid to africa in the mid1980s congress created in fy1988 separate appropriation account the development fund for africa to bring more clarity to funding decisions for the region increasing demands for food due to famine conditions in africa plus the growing use of the securityrelated economic support fund esf pushed us aid higher during the early 1980s crs26 state department and public diplomacy besides foreign aid the other major component of the international affairs budget supports diplomacy and american engagement in the international community roughly onethird of the function 150 budget targets salaries and expenses of the us diplomatic corps the construction maintenance and security of american embassies around the world educational and cultural exchanges international broadcasting and other aspects of public diplomacy the costs of us membership in the united nations and other international organizations and assessed contributions to peacekeeping operations11 in addition to appropriated funds this category also includes beginning in fy1996 fees that the state department collects for visa processing and other services over time these have become source of sizable amounts of resources for the department growing to an estimated level of nearly 12 billion in fy2006 over the past three decades the funding level for the state department and public diplomacy has reflected generally an upward trend although there have been few brief periods of declining resources appropriations continually climbed to their highest level in fy2006 of 122 billion even without the 13 billion supplemental for us embassy operations in bagdad fy2006 represents the second largest spending amount behind fy2005 for the state department and public diplomacy in 30 years the fy2006 total is more than 75 higher than the thirty year annual average of 69 billion from the outset of the george w bush administration thensecretary of state colin powell argued strongly within the executive branch and before congress that state department resource needs had been neglected during the previous decade and that significant increases were needed to improve technology and staffing challenges the bush administrations first budget saw jump from 87 billion in fy2001 to 99 billion for fy2002 in state department and public diplomacy spending by fy2004 the 103 billion excluding iraq was 18 higher in real terms than at the beginning of the bush administration many of the spikes in funding for the state department and public diplomacy over the past 30 years have been related to overseas security issues since the vietnam war american embassies have increasingly been the targets of hostile action terrorist attacks grew in number in the 1970s the decade ending with the taking of american hostages in tehran in 1979 similarly in the early 1980s the 11 this category of the international affairs budget is technically divided into two parts conduct of foreign affairs largely state department operations and international organization contributions and foreign information and exchanges assessing these two parts separately over the past 30 years however became problematic when the us information agency usia the lead agency for public diplomacy was merged into the state department in fy1999 prior to that point usia operating expenses had been part of the foreign information and exchanges category but since the consolidation these resources are included in state department salaries and expenses thus because it is not possible to present consistent data set for the entire 30 year period these two categories are combined in this analysis crs27 state department recognized greater need to tighten security after the 1983 bombing of the us marine barracks in beirut lebanon and the bombing of the embassy annex in beirut in 1984 in 1985 report by the advisory panel on overseas security headed by admiral bobby inman set new standards for security measures at us facilities around the world in 1986 congress provided an embassy supplemental appropriation to meet those standards and state departmentpublic diplomacy resources grew to 67 billion in real terms again in august 1998 another major attack occurred on us embassies in kenya and tanzania later that year congress passed an emergency supplemental that sharply increased total state department spending to 894 billion the clinton administration generally believed in multilateral approach to handling international problems and sought an expansion of involvement in international peacekeeping in 1994 the administration requested supplemental funding for peacekeeping to provide more help with cyprus and african regional efforts as well as angola iraq yugoslavia somalia haiti and mozambique congress appropriated 670 million for the peacekeeping supplemental in 1994 more than doubling the international peacekeeping account that year overall this raised the state department and public diplomacy budget to 79 billion fy2006 dollars during this same period in the 1990s both congress and the administration struggled to reduce the federal deficit some members contended that with the end of the cold war peace dividend could be derived and believed that foreign policy agency funding could be trimmed to help meet growing budget pressures reorganization of the international broadcasting entities beginning in 1994 and later the consolidation of the foreign policy agencies into the department of state in fy1999 reflected the mood in congress to streamline these foreign policy agencies thereby realizing some degree of budgetary savings reductions in broadcasting and educational and cultural exchange programs were especially large during the mid 1990s when funding for these programs fell by more than 30 bringing the 63 billion state departmentpublic diplomacy budget in fy1996 to sixyear low crs28 key trends note unless otherwise stated figures are expressed in constant fy2006 dollars funding for state department personnel embassy security public diplomacy and dues for international organizations has increased steadily over the past three decades peaking figure 9 state department public diplomacy spending in fy2006 at 122 billion constant dollars including costs for us embassy operations in iraq emphasis on state department staffing and technology upgrades during the early bush administration pushed spending upward from 78 billion in fy2000 to 95 billion by fy2003 the bombings of us embassies in kenya and tanzania 1998 and the inman report on embassy security standards 1985 led to sizable supplemental spending during the mid1990 decline in overall us foreign policy spending resources for international exchange programs and broadcasting fell by over 30 significant contributions to peacekeeping operations including somalia pushed funding for state department and public diplomacy to 79 billion in fy1994 the highest level in 18 years crs29 budget data appendix table 1
