shsbc 48 auditing basics lecture given on 23 august 1961 how you doing how you doing audience okay fine you all dead today i mean all alive today twentythird huh 23 aug ad 11 well im glad you made it i didnt think youd ever get to august the 23rd back there in the roman empire i was damn sure you wouldnt get here and i remember one spaceopera society when i didnt think it was very probable that youd make it i remember standing there at the edge of the spaceport as the battle planes took off and i said well they wont make it i knew you see i knew the high command hadnt given you any ammunition well anyhow anyhow youre in the midst of clearing and your first takeoff on this subject has already occurred and ive been talking about it for years talking about it for long time everybody coming along and saying wheres the clears wheres the clears wheres the clears very embarrassing you see central organization pcs flying over banisters you know and hung up by their heels you know and being sup people pouring cornstarch into them so they looked like they were standing up stiff you know and where are the clears where are the clears where are the clears where are the clears i never got so tired of sentence in my life now ill tell you my withhold well instead of sitting standing there asking silly questions why the hell dont you find out you know i mean kind of forthright but thats kind of the way it was because its very mysterious over long period of time as to what were the elements missing what were the missing elements what brought about this condition where people didnt get cleared and now i realize that we might have had well have had dozens and dozens of clearing processes thats why ive been studying you see for some years auditing been studying auditing theres been parallel study the theory and practice of scientology has included of course theory experimental results and that sort of thing but this other study big broad one is auditing just as such and i just sort of relaxed few years ago and just started watching looking it over and seeing what this was all about and looking at it from all sides and what were people doing with people you see it isnt good enough that i can take somebody and audit them and get some horrendous result and so forth and everything is fine because you run out of rather rapidly in the first place it interrupts my photography and you know frankly you can only put in so many hours day figure out the number of human beings on earth and it gets to be some very disproportionate figure doesnt it group auditing well matter of fact that comes close to blowing lot of cases apart with group auditing you know but it still didnt make any total grade and there still werent any clears on group auditing basis so it had to fall back on individual auditing well what happens in individual auditing that makes it fail to result in clearing and our biggest single breakthrough on this of course aside from all the technology we have on how to audit the biggest single breakthrough on this is simply that the goal disappears and the terminal disappears if the rudiments are out and that is becomes one of these crusher things like when you pull the trigger on guillotine why the blade falls you know and its one of these facts that stand up there and twice as big as the empire state buildingg with three washington monuments on top of it you know i mean its fact with an exclamation point and capital f you cant do it now if that is the case why do pcs get audited with the rudiments out lets take look at that lets be very dispassionate about all this why these four little simple rudiments how come and we find something very interesting when we look there we find something very very interesting they arent considered to be important see the level of importance of getting those rudiments in is slight now the auditors our first clear here and one of her first clear observations is the fact that auditors thought of security checks as something you got through with luckily because nothing dropped duuhh see so security check isnt looked at as something that will advance case it is looked at as something that has to be gotten through with and the faster we get through security check of course the more time we can put on auditing and i think rudiments fall into the same category the same identical category rudiments are necessary evil and if we can just get through the rudiments without anything dropping why wham whiz everything is fine now because of course if we spent any time on the rudiments why itd just be time lost from auditing interesting but i think that is the basic consideration do you agree that its just kind of itd be too bad if you had to take up lot of pt problems and arc breaks and things of this character because you wouldnt get any auditing done in the session see its an unlucky thing its just an auditor sits down in the beginning of the session and he puts the cans in the pcs hands and sometimes he has lucky days sometimes the pc has ptps arc breaks withholds or anything of the sort and he can get on to auditing and sometimes he has unlucky days and the pc has present time problems and so forth and he has to take these things up isnt that kind of the way its looked at well i think thats about the first consideration we have to shift now it looks like the rudiment is out mostly on the evaluation of importance of the rudiment now i gave you series of rules that if the rudiment didnt fall with the meter set at thirdof adial drop why then you could neglect it well that was in sort of desperation because everything was going awry and so forth and im going to exercise my privilege of having created it to asis it and lets go to the other extreme aristotelian he had pendulum you know and the world was all described as swinging on pendulum and it went between the two extremes before it settled at the mean so we might as well go over to the far side of the pendulum and run the whole thing at sensitivity 16 just for kicks try it because the rules i just gave you yesterday basically take care of these rudiments being wildly out the materials i gave you on the 22nd which just simply consisted of what you did if you consistently had too many present time problems you did 1a if present time problems is the trouble and if you were getting lots of arc breaks same remedy lets get 1a flat on this case got the idea so that gave you good way to approach the whole situation and didnt leave you messed up with doing nothing but rudiments now i think that this is one of the difficulties with rudiments that the rudiments processes dont work well i think that is one of the basics difficulties with rudiments is the processes which are given in model session are tailormade as highly generalized shot at an awful lot of cases and i think they miss cases often enough so that auditors become impatient with these particular processes and there are pcs who cannot run responsibility so running responsibility on present time problem is waste of time and it just takes you forever to clean up the present time problem running responsibility on it so you say oh my god hes got present time problem ill be sitting here running this responsibility and the pc cant run responsibility so theres hell of present time problem arises around the present time problem you see and that makes rough show so it must be certain dissatisfaction must exist around the processes which are given in model session and which weve had for some time must be dissatisfaction with those otherwise you wouldnt feel such strain on the subject of handling rudiments now there are several constants in auditing sessions and these constants are this are these and youve got an awful lot of rules and you could be terribly rulehappy you know you could just be ritualhappy until you cant see where youre going but there are few out of all of these rules and there could be said to be hundreds of them out of all of these there are very few of them which have any real bearing on the subject of auditing and i can give you those very very rapidly run them straight off i already gave them to you i think yesterday i can give you possibly slightly varied version of it but just because i play it off the cuff and that is youve got to start session and get the pc insession and youve got to get all your rudiments in and youve got to flatten all the processes you start and youve got to end the session and thats just about the lot and the errors you can make with this are most flagrantly failing to get the rudiments in running too many processes without flattening them and failing to end session smoothly and those are the failures that go along with this and if you dont manage that little small basketful of tricks of course youre going to have an awful time of it now you can get particularized and say well youve got to have your trs well thats for sure thats for sure but that almost goes without saying that fellow who is an auditor would have his trs in some kind of shape dont you see now to this we can add this interesting observation just to show you how particularized we can get for pc to be in communication with the auditor it is necessary for the auditor to be in communication with the pc there is some added factor here and that is added into insessionness you see the pc has to feel he is in communication or able to talk to the auditor well lets broaden this able to talk to the auditor able to be in communication with the auditor lets spread it little bit further and an auditor who would give invalidative comments or who would fail to articulate an auditing command so that he couldnt be understood and so forth is knocking the pc out of session get the idea because the pcs understanding of what the auditor is saying drops therefore the pcs understanding of what the auditor is doing drops so therefore the arc drops and the auditor finds pc going out of session on what on himself not being in session you see so the auditors got to be there giving an auditing session before you can expect the pc to be insession and that sums it up part of insessionness for the pc is for the auditor to be giving session so we can add in masterfully way here one third line to the pc being insession one hes got to the pc has to be interested in his own case and he has to be willing to talk to the auditor we can still say it the same way but the auditor has to be giving session and that is insession now what is what consists of an auditor giving session actually its an auditor sitting down to run the session the auditor sits down and runs session now he can run an awfully haphazardsounding session and thered be doubt in the pcs mind whatsoever about who was running the session and youd get an awful lot of auditing done wouldnt you thered be an awful lot of auditing occur on that there might be lot of rules violated one way or the other but the rules ive just given you cant be violated the second you violate those youve got auditing session whatsoever so it isnt how you hold your pinky its how you hold your pc insession and of course the best way to hold pc insession is by giving one that sounds like one of these horrible horrible simplicities theres whole tribe of indians that ive commented often and their wisdom their wisdom read off their actually out of the books of the missionaries who were so interested in them way up the hudson someplace or the saint lawrence or somewhere you know the way to cross the river is to cross the river the way to eat duck is to eat duck you see and their wisdom just ran on like this and it actually filled up numerous pictographs on numerous wigwams and has come down to us in the numerous pages of numerous longsincemurdered missionaries bunch of it up here in the hudson bay company archives the way to cross river is to cross the river the way to eat duck is to eat duck or the way to shoot somebody is to shoot somebody this was very qanda sort of wisdom but in this particular case it sure fits the way to run session is run the session rather thing now to tell somebody how to run session has its limitations and the limitations are these how much disagreement is there on the part of the auditor with the forms and actions he is using to run the session and that should be subject taken up in hpa course and that should be one of the subjects and we will institute it in hpa courses after the fellow you know its hca but its hpa never heard it called anything else in the early days in england always has stuck with as being its rather nostalgic to as matter of fact we had quite few in the old days we had quite few cockneys and so forth around the organization it was marvelous to hear them you know you could remember some of them anyway it would be simply this well probably write up some sort of drill or some sort of test ive got couple of them to get together and this would be the second one the other one is straight security check that outrates this 7a 7b i havent written them finally yet ive got the notes on them is all and that is simply this is after the fellow is all set up and knows has been jumped through the trs and has been given rudiments and model session and that sort of thing and hes supposed to sit in there and pitch and deliver this you see now were going to take an emeter and were going to find out what disagreements he has with these elements good idea isnt it he must have some disagreements with them he wont do them or he must have some basic arc breaks with some part of the modus operandi and of course ive enumerated couple of practical aspects of this some days you can get some auditing in and some days you run rudiments the lucky and unlucky aspects of it but the dissatisfaction must stem from the fact that rudiments processes do not easily handle the situation which you find in the rudiments so that would make it kind of tough to handle rudiments so there must be some kind of disagreement with handling rudiments but there might be some more fundamental disagreement than this such as well he shouldnt have to be audited that would be an awfully sweeping disagreement with the whole thing you see this expresses itself in numerous ways such as pc shouldnt act that way in upper indoc drills we have had the remark made in an upper indoc i was running one acc when the remark was made pcs never act this way little did she know she by the way ran slambang into pc abruptly and immediately afterwards who did act that way and was she surprised she thought that we were running upper indoc much too rough dont you see so she was in basic disagreement with this much roughness in an upper indoc because pcs didnt act that way now thats very fundamental disagreement and yet it works this way that you using the elements of auditing could take anybody and i do mean anybody and by running them with the rudiments out produce confused arc breaky pc you could make anybody into an arc breaky pc that im very sure of just by running with rudiments out now if you dont run an arc breaky pc youre liable to run down into propitiative pc so dont look for just violence how about propitiation you run with rudiments out you get propitiation now im about to send cable after the lecture here to itll be very historically noteworthy cable im about to send it to certain area and say soandso is expected at saint hill for training this will be vast shock to one and all because everybody insists that this soandso is very fine auditor and hes not hes not because ive had the unfortunate experience of meeting some of his pcs and theyve just been beaten with outrudiments into heavy propitiation with regard to this particular chap and they all look caved in hes not making any clears and hes having heck of time with auditing but everybody says hes marvelous auditor you got the idea were getting lot of advertisement going on here so im going to send cable and say send him in here and well get him over this trick and hell be good auditor but there will be some wild impatience with rudiments or the mechanics of auditing and i know already that this particular auditor never flattens process never i mean its almost modus operandi never flattens process never and this leaves everybody stuck on the track you see so thats bum show and just for the good of the game why ill send cable now im not bringing that up for any other reason but to show you heres somebody who never has an arc breaky pc because dead men cant protest this guy you see the fellow says i have present time problem and the auditor just comes down on him with horrible crush and crash and so forth and bowls it through and the pc says well i dont really like being bowled through and the auditor knocks that out of the road you see and then he says i have pc says well i do have little bit of withhold and the auditor says well thats not important to the session and if he runs any rudiments at all thats about the net result of it you see and the end product is not an arc breaky pc but highly propitiative pc you see so you see you could go in the other direction too and of course the guy has to come up through all that auditing thats easy to do too but in order to go anyplace you see how it could work so the rudiments could be out and you could produce several different phenomena which i wont bother to list by having the rudiments out during session so disagreement with the rudiments or difficulty in handling rudiments or an actual technical lack in the field of rudiments then could produce considerable bit of randomity it could prevent clearing it could upset things it could prevent case advances and make scientology fail in all directions see how that could be so well shape this up now weve already had breakthrough and the key rudiment is the present time problem that is the key rudiment this is sneaky one because it very often doesnt fall on first inspection you say do you have problem fellow has very immediate present time problem you get your instant fall but you ask him if he has present time problem and classification and dispersal and it must be something else and that sort of thing enters into it you see and it isnt even reactively in view he has reality on his migraine headaches being present time problem to him you audit him little bit and so forth and you suddenly are facing long duration present time problem that wasnt really there before and on little inspection of present time problems as you go along you suddenly start finding out why this case hasnt been snapping and popping its because hes just getting reality on the fact that he does have problem and this other factor enters in and this is an interesting factor this is probably sneak limiting factor on all cases the pc goes into action by reason of auditing and being now in motion on this planet accumulates problems and is now being audited with present time problems do you get the idea audience mmhm all right sitting there quietly in the corner like mushroom he didnt accumulate any present time problems you audit him he gets up little bit he goes into motion in the society and you have universe absolutely triggered up to furnish more problems than you can easily count he gets whole bunch of problems and then his continued auditing then is auditing against these new present time problems and so he doesnt continue to make case gain and you get into grind in other words all the auditing benefit he got was enough auditing benefit to pull him up into action and ive noticed it now for about thirteen fourteen years that one of the primary characteristics of case gain is the person going into action see ive tried this business of just sitting in an ivory tower and processing people endlessly didnt work well because i kept losing everybody see they didnt think there was any game and there was nothing doing and it was just ron he was supposed to do these things and he did them and then they went out and they got into action and theyd go over the hills and far away and id very often run into case that i couldnt complete fellow was now too interested in life and he was getting going in all directions and so forth well its just as well that i didnt continue to pressure auditing as far as that particular person was concerned because i would have been auditing uphill against all these brandnew accumulated present time problems dont you see but where you continue to audit somebody who has gone into motion in life you are probably auditing up against new present time problems so the cycle that you could expect on present time problems is as the case went along he would get more not less you could expect as auditing continued if it were being successful to run into not just more and more withholds which you know he comes up to the responsibility of knowing hes withholding but this other thing he accumulates and has in session more and more present time problems to handle so youre liable to get some cyclic aspect youre liable to get cyclic aspect of pc who is relatively arc breaky and it would look like this you audit him up the line and then he goes into action and he gets lot of new problems see and then we have some arc breaks of some kind or another and his auditing ceases and then these settle out dont you see and he gets and then we audit him again and at the time we pick him up for auditing why he doesnt have many problems because hes not doing much you see and then he moves up into bunch of present time problems and then he arc breaks and then we get all arc busted in the sessions and then he knocks off auditing dont you see only hes not crawling up three inches and falling back one hes crawling up two inches and falling back two inches and crawling up two inches and falling back two inches just endlessly you see this would be the way it would be so that is probably the sneak limiting factor on cases thats sneaker it is your very auditing gain which brings the pc new present time problems because going into motion of course in this universe he accumulates more present time problems if he is in motion he was all right as vegetable he didnt have any its true too he didnt have one weve run into somebody who was on pension or who was getting disability payment and if wed cured the disability payment he would have had problems you see so we cured the disability payment and then all of sudden we had an arc breaky pc and wed lose him as pc you see it looked like because wed gotten rid of his pension you know he was upset with us or that he wouldnt give up his bad heart or something because thisd mean hed give up his pension or something so auditing sort of stalled there someplace well actually he had everything taped heres what really happened he had everything taped life was absolutely by the square diagonal and perfect circle you see at the first of every month he drew check and he went home and read the comic books or whatever he did you see and this was all that ever happened all that ever happened he just went through this cycle and now all of sudden why we move him up the line he goes into little more action and as he goes by the comic bookstand he makes triangle is put into his life you see he walks by some girls house and sees her thats guaranteed to give him problems and then because weve been running quiet preclear who didnt have any problems we then of course dont expect to have pc who does have any problems so we are little bit taken by surprise so therefore we are lulled into not looking for them so little datum for you as you go by probably you not surgingly important datum but one thats well worth noting is as auditing progresses there are two tests of progress independent of all other tests which an auditor can note does the pc have an increasing number of withholds does he have new withholds on the security check thats very good test if you give your pc security check and you went through it all very very nicely even though it took quite time and there were oh seventyfive percent of the questions had fall on them and then you gave him another security check and seventyfive percent of the questions had fall on them and you gave him another security check and he had withholds of any kind watch it because this boy is not getting better betterment is represented by increased responsibility which brings about new withholds and what you should finally work up to on form 3 really is every question live particularly the way youre running them now you see they go on the whole track you mean to tell do you mean to tell are you actually willing to sit there and tell that in the last two hundred trillion years you have never committed any single one or is there one of the crimes see that you havent committed that is listed on the security check you see well i doubt it i doubt it ill go into doubt for you about that and the other one is an increasing number of present time problems which have to be handled at the beginning of session those are the two increasing liveness of response to security check and increasing liveness of response to the question do you have present time problem now there is another factor which mitigates the horrors of that exact situation and that is as the pc increases his ability he blows these things faster so although you have more by maybe triple you have less time being occupied because it only takes quarter as long to clear them you see so if hes making progress at all they clear faster so that would be another little crosscheck he has more present time problems he has more withholds and they clear up faster and if that isnt happening to your pc as you audit him then youre probably auditing pc with the rudiments really wildly out there is something wildly wrong in this auditing session and the most wildly wrong thing there can be is just wildly outrudiments simple rudiments arent in pc isnt making progress rudiments arent in youre dealing with processes today which can only be stopped by the rudiments and the only thing that could happen is that the rudiments arent in thats all or the pc didnt report for the session or the auditor isnt giving one now on the general subject of auditing an auditor who expects the pc to be doing something besides being pc of course is inevitably in trouble if you expect something else of the pc besides pcing you of course are in trouble its like auditing somebody who is supposed to be doing the cooking at the same time you see and you have to this is an odd beingness to grant and it sounds very difficult it sounds very doesnt sound difficult it sounds simple simon to say that this is beingness that has to be granted but an auditor in running session has as one of its essential parts granting pc beingness to the pc you know the auditor is not willing to have pc so much as the auditor is willing for pc to be sitting there you see willing to make demand on the person sitting opposite him beyond that of being pc and if you check it over you find out some auditing difficulties youve had in the past very possibly may trace to an expectancy of the pc being something else beside pc now all pc is supposed to do there isnt any such thing as laying down code for pc because hes just pc but actually what does pc do well pc does the session which the auditor is auditing you see he does the session he does what the auditor says and he answers what the auditor says and so forth this is what the auditor expects of him were not laying restrictions on the pc but this is what you as an auditor expect of the pc that he follow your auditing commands that he do the things which you said that he furnish the information which is required of him thats what youre demanding of him now if you grant this beingness of being pc to the pc and that is all you expect him to do why you will find out that your auditing enormously simplifies because you then dont expect him to volunteer information or be walking encyclopedia of something or other or tell you if something is going wrong or something this is nothing this is part of his bargain its not up to him to tell you this thing is going wrong you see thats up to you its up to you to find it out youve got meter and youve got your pair of eyes and your observation and the pc types of answers youve got innumerable ways to find out but it isnt up to him and there is rule anyplace that says he has to tell you what to do nor is there any rule of telling you what is happening unless you ask for it in other words its just grant the beingness of being pc to the pc and hes sitting there being pc and thats it you dont expect anything else of this pc but to answer your questions and to furnish information that is answer the questions and follow the auditing commands and stay there insession and do what you say thats all you expect of the pc now if thats all the beingness which youre granting and thats all you expect of the pc you see at once that it is necessary for you to find out whats going on because theres responsibility on the pcs part to tell you whats going on got the idea i notice youre looking at little puzzled but i think thats because youre not puzzled youre just digesting fact i wonder if youve ever expected pc to be something else beside pc at any time have you looked to pc to be anything else but pc while being pc from the beginning to the end of the session because if you have i will guarantee that at that point your session broke down in some mysterious way it would break down now scientologists are very prone understandably and nothing wrong with this at all too prone to run big oughttobe well run an oughttobe on anything under the sun moon or stars run it on the revolutions of planets the evolutions socalled of governments or anything else run any kind of an oughttobe you want to except in an auditing session see just delete that oughttobe out of the auditing session and youll be much happier i know because i know this personally you see because you run horrendous big oughttobe on im the most oughttobed character its marvelous its absolutely marvelous and ill tell you if i was saint youre going to make into one anyway an oughttobe actually doesnt belong in any part of the auditing session its like the upper indoc student who was saying well pcs dont act like that so therefore i shouldnt be doing this wrastling around the floor dont you see well certain feeling like that could get into session you know there are your horrified aspects sometime some pc comes up with string of withholds that would lift the hair of priest you know with all they listen to and coo you know you say well youre actually running an oughttobe you say this person ought to be welldisciplined wellbehaved person and should have been well disciplined and well behaved for the last two hundred trillion years well if thats the case how the hell did they get in the pcs chair and this oughttobe is joined up with probablyis its not only an oughttobe but theres also probablyis you have supposition about this pc and then you operate on that supposition and this supposition of course is liable to find you way out in left field or its liable to find you sailing without sails in the middle of the antarctic youre not quite sure what happened to you or how you got there give you an example perhaps two weeks of auditing were wasted on course once on dear lady who was the most disarminglooking probablyis you ever saw she was real probablyis you know because she looked like dear sweet unassuming lady just the very kind that you would cast for aunt mary in some supersaccharin play of 1900 you know just marvelous the most marvelous casting you ever saw in your life you know and everybody for two weeks audited her that way and it just never occurred to ask her for any blood and guts most marvelous thing you ever saw and when the curtains finally fell on this particular case an auditor had just simply become sharp enough to go past the probablyis you see and instead of buying this mockup complete as package noticed that all of the efforts to get this person to improve in any way shape or form were all failing so there must be something else there and began to really sweat over this case i think mary sue was behind this push get some of the withholds off and of course this dear sweet perfect casting for aunt mary had made specialty for the last fifty years of stealing everyones husband that could possibly be stolen and engaging in nothing per but flatout adultery in all directions and there are probably something on the order of four hundred different incidents of this particular character on this case its marvelous when they finally got that security check going man it went like prairie fire this read like something bouncing betty the gun moll you know and i remember another one in an hgc one time and they had looked in vain this was when we were doing dynamic assesssments and theyd looked in vain for any kind of terminal on this lady and she was dear and she was sweet and she was everything but she was rough tough space commander and that was her valence and for some reason or other when people get into the position of the loneliness of space they tend to keep the valences because of the coldness of space and that sort of thing but how about the loneliness of space and then the isolation of command added in on top of this you see and that really makes honey but everything about this case belied this valence there couldnt possibly have been any such valence of any character whatsoever so nobody looked for it and im sure she must have said it im sure that meters must have said it but nobody could believe it dont you see this was rough tough bloodandguts bucko master you know why she probably made captain bligh look like patsy but the only role any auditor could see her in would be making cookies for the kiddies in the neighborhood you know so they just bought the mockup and never asked for anything else well ill tell you if the mockup is factual and the case isnt advancing dont blame scientology just blame the estimate of the situation this quote factual presentation must have some fantastic unknowns concerning it which must be in wild disagreement now for instance ill give you an idea here in technology how wild wild disagreement can fail to resolve things jealousy immediately and at once must have to do with the terminals of men and women because men and women are jealous obviously so if we run men and women we solve jealousy thats for sure only it wont so it must be something else cases resolve on the isness of the case matter how hidden it is its still the isness of the case not the mightbes oughttobes or probablyiss see its the isness of the case and the isness of the case must be totally unknown to one and all if it fails to resolve at once it must be just totally unknown it is not what the pc is telling you if the pc is making progress if the pc is sitting there saying complain complain complain complain about this that or the other thing his lumbosis is just killing him and you handle his lumbosis and his lumbosis is just killing him and you handle his lumbosis and his lumbosis is just killing him and you handle his lumbosis well now youve bought one of these probablyiss you see you said its probably his lumbosis but obviously if you havent cured his lumbosis dont blame your auditing skill just blame this one fact alone you havent gotten down to the isness of the situation thats for sure lets begin very tight series of questions that isolate what this is is it lumbosis or what this person says to you all the time my feet are cold my feet are cold so you audit him for cold feet my feet are cold so you audit him for cold feet he comes up with this problem cold feet cold feet cold feet and you keep auditing cold feet and i can tell you by actual test that you could do that for seven years i know such case you could do it for seven years without ever making happy pc or getting much of gain and we must assume after while that it isnt even cold feet we have to assume after while it just isnt cold feet because were not auditing the isness see we must be auditing something else we must be auditing some kind of an alteris of some kind if auditing cold feet then doesnt resolve the pcs cold feet that hes complaining about then the pc doesnt have cold feet what does the pc have for pity sakes so your line of questioning should go in on the line not what makes cold feet cold feet cold feet cold feet your line of questioning should go in on the basis just exactly what are you complaining about what is the isness of it and you generally find out well it wasnt cold feet anyhow the person just said cold feet and really it isnt cold feet its because they burn all the time and it isnt his feet its his ears but hes afraid itll go into his feet and so forth but that isnt whats really wrong its because of the disconnections of the spine that theyre liable to cause cold feet because you cant get circulation in the feet you see if you have difficulties with the spine and that sort of thing and you get right down to it and you find out its theyre afraid they have disease and thats the isness of the situation how fascinating yet they were complaining about cold feet you get how far afield this thing finally went so your test is simply this if something isnt resolving you havent got the isness of it its just if case isnt going clear the first isness of it that you would test is the session you wouldnt be worried so much about the valence before you had the session straight got the idea you got to have the session thats the first isness and the next isness are the rudiments and the next isness after that would be what youre addressing in the case and those would be the isnesses in more or less order of importance now if youve got in the isness of the session and youve got in the isness of the rudiments and the person continues to complain and you continue to try to help them with certain quote isness its just probably it is never it if it isnt responding rapidly it is some other isness because youre looking at an alterisness of some kind so if the valence is wrong well its wrong thats all find the right one the most problem youre going to have with case is going to be in the realm of the longduration present time problem and that is going to be the most suspect as far as its isness is concerned is that the problem and the best test is if it doesnt surrender rather rapidly as problem then you havent gotten the pc to state the problem that isnt what the problem is in other words it isnt necessarily true that you are handling it all badly it just might be true that you are actually handling something which isnt there and that something else is there to be handled and you just dont happen to be handling that but this isnt good enough reason to change processes we now have test that tells us whether or not process is working anything aside from twoway comm which is totally limited to just asking this is the three things i gave you yesterday its just you say to the fellow how are you doing and tell and what is it and thats the end you see there isnt any more to that you can ask those many times repetitively in numerous ways and so forth but thats the end youre not running anything anything else is process so dont try to say youre twowaycomming somebodys problems out while youre asking them to describe the problem because youre running process called describe that problem to please thank you got it you say describe the problem you would say you can ask pc well what is the problem there that youre worried about and the pc says its soandso and soandso and you say all right i will take that up or something of the sort youre right on the border between twoway comm and youre still safely inside twoway comm and running process and thats where the border crosses right at that point because if you once more say tell the problem youre in process and youre committed to flattening what youve started and the moment you leave twoway communication you are committed to flattening what you begin whether you began it in process form model session or not if what you began produces tone arm motion youre going to have to run the tone arm motion out of it whether it is rudiment or anything else you got it and therefore you should not be very adventurous about what you begin you better get good grip on what youre going to start before you start it because the careless woo fitybap launching madly into well the guy says well im stuck in im stuck in uh im in stuck in this see mother its all about mother and im stuck in this about mother and you say well is there something unknown about that eh yes as matter of fact yeah i never knew my mother and needle moves and you say good is it all right if we go on boy have you goofed oh god that is goof you know something on the order of the biggest british dreadnought firing on windsor castle you know that is goof man thats shame blame regret i used to know this that you could run three commands of process without getting into serious trouble but that was yesterdays processes todays processes commit you right now with the first command because they are hot they are hot youre auditing with sabers and its hot you start something finish it dont go shifting it off and if you find yourself in the unlucky position of three days later still running which side of girl is up thank you just look back at that moment when you unluckily started it thats your only choice your only choice is to complete what you begin otherwise you leave pc with unfinished cycles and these begin to hang up and make auditing itself problem now when theres too many unfinished cycles on case youve got the remedy of prehav 13 you can take auditors and that sort of thing some such generalized term do terminal assessment of some kind run them on the prehav scale thats got liability too supposing you only had four levels live on the prehav scale and you decided you know and you were assessing auditorss you only had four levels live and then you run fail to abandon the auditor failed to abandon the case what auditor didnt abandon your case what auditor did you know what auditor did you fail to abandon you know and back and forth and we got it all set and we run that kind of flat and theres more needle action because you run those out on needle action and then you assess again and you have seven levels live where do you go now what do you do now well this is the one exception which i will give you you get off of that train even though its going 125 miles an hour you hear you just get right off of that train you go down to the bottom step and throw yourself into the brambles because thats the time to get off because obviously you are running terminal which is in wild disagreement with the pcs case and you are living up the whole prehav scale and if you continue to do that on your next assessment having run faith in auditors on your next assessment youve got twelve live twelve live and if you ran it again now this is just funny peculiarity you see and you ran serene what auditor was serene and what were you serene about auditors and so forth youre going to have twenty live twenty live levels well dont get the whole prehav primary and all the secondaries live before you find out that it didnt pay you get it because the difficulty with running rudiments and running random processes of any kind whatsoever the difficulty of it sums up only and totally to this if they are in opposition to the pcs goal and terminal setup the case will not progress at all now thats very interesting isnt it so that any process that you adventured upon in the rudiments any process that you adventured upon to straighten out the pc so he could be audited any process that you adventured on if it happened to be counter to the goal and the terminal of the pc of course was something that is better deserted fast you got the idea so it does have that reserve on it in the first place youre trying to set up somebody to be run on routine 3 there is other clearing process you might as well make up your mind to it that is broadly working i can think of several processes that would undoubtedly clear people and all that sort of thing but these are not on the assembly line and remember these processes in the hands of other auditors have not cleared people so you are left with routine 3 so the job in running anything and getting the pc into session is just getting the pc up to the point of where he can be assessed and run on routine 3 see thats all youre trying to do so all other actions are preparatory to this action because thats whats going to clear people and as long as that one is followed out and as long as you eventually get up to routine 3 and as long as you get routine 3 well done youre going to clear people and anything else is dross it could be thousands of hours of dross and it could all be entertaining but it would not resolve the case or produce clear it could cure psychosomatics and itd make bank managers into bank clerks and you could do almost anything make janitors into presidents you could do all kinds of things with these things you understand and have rather spottily and sporadically because sitting there all the time is the goal and valence and its the valence situation so get good reality on this routine 3 and get good reality on where it goes and what happens and what stops it from running and of course what stops it from running is basically the pc before hes audited is not insession so youve got to get him into session youve got to have session youve got to have pc youve got to have your rudiments in and the thing well straightened out and then youve got to do goals assessment and then youve got to do terminals assessment and then youve got to get over there to the prehav scale and youve got to run it and doing anything else skip it anything which you do i can tell you bluntly now anything which you do which is not contributory to completing routine 3 is waste of time now there is only one process type and class which does not violate the goal and terminal and routine 3 theres only one that does not violate it and that is routine 1a which is very very contributory to it now there is another one which probably wont and which runs on very lowscale cases and that is routine 1 and theres another one which wont get you into too much trouble and that is routine 2 and that gives you your total bag of tricks and theres the total bag of tricks and beyond that there is none so you got routine 1 runs very low and probably doesnt mess up somebody too badly as far as their goals and terminals are concerned and certainly progresses them and is very slow and its the only thing that you could run on an unconscious person and lot of other stuff the pc wont talk to you and the pc cant be put insession at all well you got routine 1 and its long and its arduous and its hard for auditors to do but it is successful and it shouldnt be thrown out of the bag of tricks its too good it probably wont interfere with the goal and terminal routine 2 well you can normally get away with that you can do various broad general runs on the case and youre normally running against the terminal think this is quite amusing and youre sort of running the terminal blind you dont know what the terminal is and yet youre running the case anyway and thats very functional theres nothing wrong with doing that but it certainly is substitute for finding the goal and running and the terminal and running them see thats substitute theres comparison it improves your eventual run but not to the degree that you might think it might you dont lose you dont lose on it thats about all you can say about that then youve got routine 1a and routine 1a is the one thing that will not interfere with the goal and the terminal assessment but will improve it enormously routine 1a this also improves the living daylights out of your rudiments situation and if your rudiments keep going out why you had really havent got much of choice except routine 1a thats all routine 1a processes could be entered in upon the first time that the pc is found to have present time problem that didnt clear with the three types questions of twoway comm you know all right routine 1a thats it well youd never get in any trouble if you did that its rather arduous look at the situation then you bring up routine 1a to flat point and twentyfive hours later continue on to the point of asking well do you have an arc break how do you feel about my auditing you see twentyfive hours later we get to that rudiment level you get the different look at this situation never did run session on the fellow youre still there on the brink well that would certainly be safe way to go about it and i can tell you if you did this youd almost never have an arc broke pc it would be thing that would become very foreign to you somebody doesnt have any arc breaks auditor well obviously if this auditor never had an arc break with the pc the pc never arc broke on the auditor youd have to assume about the auditor that the auditor took care of every problem that came up see so therefore the pc was very solidly and always insession you see how this fits together as pattern well fortunately it does fit together which is quite remarkable in itself thats interesting isnt it that there is road out thats whats interesting that there are some blazes on the trees and of course these blazes now theres getting to be pretty welltrodden path past them and it leads straight out into the clear and has been doing so consistently and picking up all of the elements of the oh god hundreds of thousands of elements and millions of them perhaps that ive reviewed in the past thirteen years that just about sums it up and as far as processing is concerned those are the safe things to do and those are the various things which are reliable and those are the things which get you there and those are the things that produce results so this leaves you with what this leaves you with the fact that on anybody anyplace at any time you could run and flatten any problems process great security never had any difficulty holding them insession or anything else flatten the problems process just flatten it and run it out unless you do something really wild like run two commands of it and skip it or something like that you know but you run just run it and start your session do you have present time problem what was that fellow says well you say all right good were going to run little process now and you just pick up one of the processes from routine 1a all right your dissatisfaction with trying to clear rudiments would evaporate if you laid down this particular rule that there were rudiments processes thats fantastic isnt it if you just said well there were rudiments processes when you got the fellow up to rudiment and so forth then you audited the case toward clear and that wouldnt be waste of time at all would it well how to do that how to do that well that would be the way to do it youd start the session youd say you have present time problem youd find the guy has got present time problem well youve had it now lets just go on with routine 1a eventually it flattens twentyfive fifty hours later it flattens and thats out thats gone now youre not going to have too much trouble with problems now you say is it all right if i audit you it sounds kind of odd to introduce it at that particular stage of the game but thats actually where youve arrived to guy looks up for the first time you know and he says all right to be audited well what do you know i thought itd be problem you auditing and it isnt and thats that so that clears that rudiment got the idea all the time youre doing this however you could be clearing security checks takes care of lot of arc breaks and withholds so security check could be done at any time and routine 1a could be done at any time and how to keep out of trouble well do 1a and security checks see and pretty soon you cant even squeeze anything out of the emeter on the subject of problems in all of its various ramifications and unknowns and everything else that goes with it you cant squeeze yip out of the emeter the guy is consistently sitting at the clear read and the needle isnt clear it isnt swinging dont expect that it will either but itll be fairly loose there it is you say well its time we took up as an auditor might be adventurous up to that time mightnt it sort of non sequitur the fellows sitting there in this little cage of problems you know with all the demons of existence poking despatches and sabers and small atom bombs in through the bars and this disrelated item suddenly emerges is it all right if i audit you who you where who what huh audit audit who audit you what whats this and this just looks like another despatch or another saber or another small atom bomb which is shoved in the cage dont you see so if rudiments are that important if youre having trouble handling rudiments which is obvious all right just take broad long look at the rudiments and say well the rudiments arent three seconds long at the beginning of session the rudiments are fifty hours long at the beginning of session and youd certainly have it and your dissatisfaction with bad rudiments process such as responsibility and so forth would vanish of course because youre going to run the best processes that can possibly be run on problems in general and youve had it there it is youre not going to have any trouble with that rudiment afterwards ill guarantee youre not going to have any trouble at all with that rudiment this fellows up to point where he can confront unknowns and wrap problems around his heads and give people problems and take problems and hes longer sitting in this cage dont you see hes longer in totally interiorized state even though this has been run against his valence well you see the valence the trick behind this is the valence was adopted to solve problem and therefore any valences the person is sitting in tend to resolve when you lessen his concern about problems and you lessen the tension of the valence you dont even have to know the valence to do this see all you have to do is lessen these things its very funny i wrote over to washington from london i think in 1956 and told them to lock it up in the safe that the road out certainly contained problems and that was the most reliable road out on the subject of it and thats just valuable piece of technology probably still in the safe in washington but anyhow i just didnt want to lose sight of that one because this obviously measured up to the various things that person had and which way they were going all right it is very true that it is very difficult very very difficult to handle problems at the beginning of session and then go on to something else this is true unless you can say to the pc if you cant say to the pc well tell about it what is it and how you doing with it now you know that sort of thing and you ask him do you have present time problem and look at the meter and theres response on the meter whatsoever unless that condition could occur then if this can stop the whole parade and if this can submerge the goal and if this can submerge the terminal and if this can make assessments impossible and if you can waste weeks on doing goals assessment and all this thing why then we have to come to the inevitable conclusion if it was that important well wed better roll up all of our very best guns and just take care of it right there you know just the whole thing and therefore if the pc begins to have large spate of problems or pc apparently has problems or theres bunches of problems around or if pc after being audited for while all of sudden starts to run into lots of present time problems you know he goes out and gets busier well you go back and flatten 1a how long does it take to flatten 1a oh its not its been taking about seventyfive hours fifty hours thirtyfive hours time periods of that character yeah but look all that time is saved off the assessment and if youre going to waste hundred hours on assessment you certainly better spend fifty hours on 1a thats all that amounts to and then you know where youre going and you have certainty on it and youre not fumbling with the dissatisfaction of running an inadequate process on present time problems look good audience yes yeah all right that would be way to approach this situation now we get up to the auditor as the second rudiment and of course if the fellow can have problems and he isnt going to have lot of trouble with problems certainly ninety percent of what would be charged up on this particular auditor would have vanished by that time certainly even though the auditors been auditing him itd just be vanishing all the time but there might be little bit left so you would take up the subject after 1a you could take it up and hit your next rudiment do you see and youve already been hitting withholds and so forth consistently and continually and in that you should be running the havingness and confront process of the pc you have been remedying the fourth rudiment all the time oh i havent necessarily got the sequence straight im talking about end rudiments but youve been handling this so thats out so you havent got worry about that so it looks like these things could be handled rather easily just on their own ground but given an importance if these things are that important to case then they are all of them worth handling if you find fellow who is flat on problems he isnt going to have much trouble with the auditor and also an auditor whos been sitting there pulling withholds off of him hes certainly going to be willing to talk to the auditor so thats solving that too so you could go at it in these various ways and you would wind up at the other end with your rudiments in and i would say only after youve beaten them totally to death since weve been having trouble with this i havent been but you have and lets look at it on the reality of the situation and not curse and scream in our beards and break the china and so forth and say you arent doing your jobs lets get practical about the thing and lets just take up rudiments as preliminary to clearing and say that rudiments are not preliminary to the session but preliminary to clearing and just upgrade them until such time as all rudiments are in and will stay in and so forth why bother to assess now as far as somebody staying interested in his own case is concerned you can be absolutely certain he will be on problems because thats whats got him mainly interiorized so thatll answer up as well as assessment this is way of approach isnt it audience yes all right these things the whole subject of auditing is subject of practicality it is not subject of theory it is what works the philosophers of the ages had been trying to drive shiny coaches down nonexistent boulevards and the screams of the dying multitude were dinning in their ears because their philosophies didnt work but they were pretty theres doubt about it doubt about it we should take our hats off to nietzsche its certainly pretty until you go over to germany and france and start looking at all the graveyards and things like that youd say well that isnt quite so pretty you know looks messy and you start looking at the pillboxes that still are extant around nantes nancy and so forth and you say well i dont know theyre not good architecture theres something missing there are subtle curves but it was awful pretty thus spake zarathustra but he didnt give damn whether it worked or not you see never entered his mind for split second workability pooh the gorgeous example of the nonexistence of the eighth planet for years for years and years and years and years the eighth planet did not exist it had been observed in telescope itd been plotted people in astronomy knew its name rank serial number mass density course and spin but hegel had said that there were only seven because seven was perfect number beautiful coach lovely had big springs so forth only the road it was traveling on was built on nowhere and the end of the road went off to ignorance there was workability with regard to this whenever you look at auditing whenever you look at scientology you should just look at that one fact does it work we have actually been condemned because were interested in whether or not something works and current extant philosophy knows this has bearing on the situation whatsoever it is crude attitude it is absolutely crude ive had person object to dianetics simply because they said well there was more to life than survival well nobody said there wasnt i certainly said it was common denominator of existence yes but they couldnt take dianetics because there was more to life than survival they liked to think that they liked to think that and they didnt like to think of this other and also it was obvious that man was not good and so of course that washed up the whole subject and you say well how did you come to these conclusions the fellow says well i just thought it over he didnt bother to look at anything you know he didnt bother to go outside open the door and take look at the world it was perfectly adequate utterly adequate to sit there you see and have couple of errant thoughts be distracted by the ticking of the clock and say well well id like to think of higher things well man has been very interested in thinking about higher things until he began to suffer from anoxemia hes up there in the rarefied air but it certainly has nothing to do with well actually it doesnt even have anything to do with man i think it would be sad day i think its been sad day every time theyve tried to connect ancient philosophies with man they have nothing to do with man they have nothing to do with life theyre just pretty the greek of course in his terrific worship of the integrity or the thinkingness of man himself went into terrific figurefigure and his various schools and so forth that he formed were all more figurefigure and more figurefigurefigure and greece lost her empire lost this lost that everything was caving in in all directions and coming down the greek race was becoming less and less effective things were going to pieces the turks finally came in took over the whole lot burned practically everything destroyed the greek language knocked everything all out and greeks still figurefigure 1961 he still will figurefigure quite interesting nevertheless he did have an idea that man was subject of study and to that we owe him some hattipping but im afraid i dont owe very much hattipping to lot of these philosophers because they would say that it was total betrayal of philosophy to alter anything in it that had been laid down and ill tell you of course that youre perfectly all youve got to do all youve got to do is make clear by some other route which is workable and practical and other people can do and that follows up to all the tests of clears of course and wed abandon every trail weve got you see if that was much easier and faster but it hasnt happened hasnt happened thirteen years everybodys had large wide opportunity the last ten eleven certainly theyve had wonderful opportunity to figure out brandnew routes ways and so forth and ive had them mailed to and telegraphed to and cabled to in far parts of the world and ive seen them on boards and fixed up and theyve been applied this way and that but they didnt clear people all right right now were clearing people so my whole attention is upon the workability of this one fact because i am man of ambition i am man of very very vast ambitions and the vastest of my ambitions right now have this particular zone and area is every time somebody walks in the front door of the central organization or up an auditors front steps that at the end of the auditing he will turn around and walk out clear that is considerable ambition and we are right there on the threshold of achieving that ambition as matter of fact were more than on the threshold of it were actually taking the practical steps to effect that very thing when we whistle up somebody from central organization and say come on in here were not kidding and when i send cable to somebody in some far place and say soandso is expected at saint hill were not kidding see its not nonsense that were talking because thats what we want to have happen i think thatd be very interesting thing to have happen and when you see these clears and they start into their immediate areas and they start polishing everything up and everything goes into action and everythings very busy and so forth the horrors of the ancient philosopher i imagine the man could have nightmares over this he knows what clear is supposed to do hes supposed to sit on mountaintop and regard his navel but anyway were interested therefore and thereby and only in the practical steps necessary to it and my conclusion as of right this minute is that if you are having trouble keeping rudiments in in order to do goals assessments and if you were totally capable of actually using up two or three months in trying to find somebodys goal well itd be simpler to get the rudiments in first and it would be simpler and timesaving if each rudiment required something on the order of fifty hours and was simply taken separately one after the other and fifty hours were devoted to each one it would still be time economy because naturally at the other end of it youd wind up with his goal bang right now you see youd wind up with his terminal bang right now youd do his assessment bang and you wouldnt lose single minute of his run and probably if you took two hundred hours to get in the rudiments youd probably clear fellow in five you got the idea i mean its that ridiculous and as i look at it that is the practical way of approaching the thing so watch those rudiments and turn up that sensitivity and if your pc has got one consistently out go back and flatten 1a okay audience mmhm thank you xmpbodyhtml
