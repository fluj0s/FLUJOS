section 2ac requires representatives to be elected at large if state fails to create new districts after the reapportionment of seats following decennial census these apparently contradictory provisions raise questions about whether and under what circumstances federal law permits atlarge representation in the house of representatives the legislative history of 2 usc 2c is sparse because it was adopted as senate floor amendment to housepassed private b ill in 1967 the same year that section 2c was adopted congress had contemplated but faile d to pass more comprehensive bill that would have repealed section 2ac the reby removing the apparent statutory inconsistencies addressing the tension between section 2ac and section 2c as applied to mississippi redistri cting plan the supreme court in b r n c hv s m i t h1held that federal district court was required to c raft singlemember districts although the issue remains unsettled it appears that section 2ac could provide options to the house of representatives to seat an atlarge delegation hr 415 108thcong would establish commission to make recommendations on the method by which members of the house are elected including examinin g alternatives to the current method such recommendations if ultimatelyenacted could affect current federal statutoryprovisions governing singlemember and atlarge representation in the house

and the representatives were sworn in after the delegations were seated the house directed the committee of elections to examine and report upon the certificates of elections or the credentials of the members returned to serve in this house the committees report found the 1842 law not law made in pursuance of the constitution of the united states and valid operative and therefore not binding on the states later the house adopted res olution declaring the representatives of the four states duly elected but omitted any mention of the apportionment law see asher c hinds hinds precedents of the

nearly as practic able an equal numbe r of inhabitants 26 stat 736 although these standards were never enfor ced if the states failed to meet them this language was repeated in the 1911 apportionment act and remained in effect until 1929 with the adoption of the permanent apportionment act which did not include any districting standards 46 stat 21 afte r 1929 there were congressionally imposed standards governing congre ssional districting in 1941 however congress enacted law providing for various districting contingencies if states failed to redistrict after census including atlarge

not amend 2ac thus public w 90196 was codified in separate part of the us code 2 usc 2c rather than as replacement language for 2 usc 2ac these apparently contradictory provisions raise questions about how section 2ac which provides for atlarge house elec tions under certain circumstances can be reconciled with section 2c which prohibits them section 2ac of title 2 could be invoked if state that had gained or lost repres entatives after census failed to complete the redistricting process before the first ection following the reapportionment of seats among the states one could argue contrarily that since section 2ac was enacted in 1941 and section 2c was enacted in 1967 the prohibition of atlarge and multimember districts in section 2c implicitly repeals the c ontingencies for running at large provided in 2ac thus making section 2ac dead letter further buttressing the dead letter theory is the 40year history of active court involve ment in redistricting when section 2ac was enacted in 1941 courts were constraine d by years of precedent limiting their entrance into the political thicket of redistricting after the supreme court established the one person one vote principle beginning with its 1962 landmark decision in baker v carr 10 and congress passed the voting rights act of 196511courts have intervened numerous times in the state redistricting process supreme court

department di d not preclear the state court plan by the deadline the district court plan was used for the 2002 elections after finding that the federal district cour t had properly enjoined the enforcement of the state court plan14the supreme court turned to the issue of whether section 2ac requires courts to order atlarge elections if state redistricting plan is not in place prior to court action the original state plaintiffs and the united states as amicus curiae had argued that the district court was required to draw singlemember districts in crafting congressional plan while the original federal plaintiffs had contended that the district court was required to order atlarge elections rejecting the original federal plaintiffs argument majority of the supreme court h eld that the lower court was required to fashion plan with singlemember districts however writing two separate concurring opinions majority of the court did not reach consensus as to the rationale behind its holding thereby leaving the reconciliation of sections 2ac and 2c unsettled in the first concurrence written by justice scalia joined by the chief justice justices kennedy and ginsburg plurality of the court interpreted the atlarge option in section 2ac5 as merely lastresort remedy being applicable only in those cases where time constraints prevent singlemember plan from being drawn in time for an election15 according to the scalia concurrence 2ac is inapplicable unless the state legislature and state and federal courts have all failed to redistrict pursuant to 2c how long is court to await that redistricting before determining that 2ac governs forthcoming election until we think the election is so imminent that entity competen t to complete redistricting pursuant to state law including the mandate of 2c is able to do so without disrupting the election process only then may 2acs stopgap provisions be invoked thus 2ac cannot be properly appliedneither by legislature nor courtas long as it is feasible for federal courts to effect the red istricting mandated by 2c so interpreted 2ac continues to function as it always has as lastresort remedy to be applied when on the eve of congressional election constitutional redistricting plan exists and there is time for either the states legislature or the courts to develop one16 on the other hand in second concurrence written by justice stevens joined by justices souter and breyer separate plurality of the court while agreeing that the district court properly enjoined enforcement of the state courts plan and drew its own single member plan under 2 usc 2c concluded t hat section 2c impliedly repealed section 2ac17in dissent justice oc onnor joined by ju stice thomas found that when federal courts are asked to redistrict states that have lost representation after reapportionment and the existing plan has mo re districts than the new allocation permitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21585crs6 18id at 1461 oconnor j dissentingand new plan has been promulgated with the c orrect number of districts the courts are required to order atlarge elections in accordance with 2 usc 2ac18 seating an atlarge delegation elected in contravention of section 2c it could be argued that atlarge elections will not be needed in the post1960s era because the courts now intervene when the states reach impasse and fail to redistrict following the decennial census nevertheless since the i ssue of whether federal law permits atlarge congressional representation appears unsettled if house delegation were elected at large it appears that their seating could be c hallenged in the house of representatives on the grounds that their election violates sectio n 2c which prohibits atlarge elections challenged delegation might raise the defense that since congress did not expressly repeal the contingencies enumerated in section 2ac when it enacted section 2c it has therefore recognized the possib ility of an atlarge delegation which should be seated despite having been elected in violation of section 2c perhaps the best argument that the singlemember district requirement might be ignored by the house in certain circumstances stems from 19thcentury house precedent as noted in footnote 2 supra atlarge delegations were seated after t hey were prohibited in 1842 moreover challenged delegation could argue that refusing to seat them would deprive an entire state of representation in the house thus one would expect that the 19thcentury precedent would be followed today although such p recedent might be less compelling if the organization of the house were at stake one could also argue that the contingencies set forth in 2 usc 2ac still serve as useful insurance policy to provide repres entation for state that cannot following the release of census numbers complete the postcensus redistricting process in time for the first congressional election in 1967 congre ss could have repealed section 2ac as provided in the more farreaching redistric ting standards bill hr 2508 instead congress adopted pl 90196 codified at 2 u sc 2c which prohibits multimember districts leaving section 2a c in place which permits them legislation on january 28 2003 representative hastings introduced hr 415 108thcong bill to establish commission to make recommendations on the appropriate size of membersh ip of the house of representatives and the method by which members are elected section 32 of hr 415 requires the commission to examine alternatives to the current method by which representatives are elected including cumulative voting and proportional represent ation to determine i f such alternatives would make the house of representativ more representative body such recommendations if ultimately enacted could affect current federal statutory provisions governing singlemember and atlarge representation in the house of representatives hr 415 was referred to the house committee on the judiciary and further
