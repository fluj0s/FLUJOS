9 million is for the rural domestic preparedness consortium issues for congress two issues appear to have dominated congressional debate on the fy2008 request for homeland security grant funds the method by which funds are allocated among the states and the proposed reduction in assistance to firefighters grant program fire appropriations these issues are discussed below distribution methods for state and local programs for years since publication of the final report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states often referred to as the 911 commission members of congress have debated the formula or process to be used in distributing federal homeland security grant funds the 911 commission recommended that funds should be distributed based on threat and risk assessments while debate has ensued on this recommendation certain crs5 program funds have been distributed pursuant to the formula set out in section 1014 of the usa patriot act pl 10756 this statute guaranteed each state minimum of 075 of total appropriations for domestic preparedness programs the administration requested that fy2008 funds for only the emergency management performance grants empg and citizen corps programs ccp be distributed pursuant to the section 1014 formula additionally the administration proposed that shsgp be discretionary program but guaranteed each state minimum of 025 of total appropriations certain members of congress did not agree with this proposal neither the housepassed nor senatepassed versions of hr 2638 included provisions to alter the funding distribution method because the issue was included in debate on other legislation hr 1 and s 4 with enactment of this legislation pl 110 53 implementing the 911 commission recommendations act of 2007 fy2008 funding allocations will be based upon different formula the minimum allocation for each state for shsgp grants will be 0375 of total shsgp and uasi appropriations in fy2008 with the floor eventually reduced to 035 of the total shsgp and uasi appropriations in fy20125 while some may contend that this agreement resolves the debate that has been the focus of congressional attention for years others might argue that shsgp would httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22596 not be discretionary program if there is guaranteed minimum amount for states each fiscal year reduction in funding for the assistance to firefighters program administration budget proposals have typically recommended significant cuts for fire grants as well as zero funding for safer grants opponents of the cuts have argued that the reduced levels are inadequate to meet the needs of fire departments while the administration has argued that reduced levels are sufficient to enhance critical capabilities in the event of terrorist attack or major disaster for fy2008 the administration proposed 300 million for fire grants in fy2008 45 cut from the fy2007 level funding was proposed for safer grants the total request for assistance to firefighters grants afg was 55 below the fy2007 level for fire and safer grants combined the fy2008 budget proposal eliminated grants for wellnessfitness activities and modifications to facilities for firefighter safety the budget justification requested funding for applications that enhance the most critical capabilities of local response to firerelated hazards in the event of terrorist attack or major disaster the budget justification also stated that the requested level of funding is an appropriate level of funding given the availability of significant amounts of funding for first responder preparedness missions from other dhs grant programs which are better coordinated with state and local homeland security strategies and unlike afg are allocated on the basis of risk on june 5 2007 the house appropriations committee recommended an appropriation of 570 million for fire grants and 230 million for the staffing for adequate fire and emergency response firefighters

allhazards focus and not limit the list of eligible activities the committee also expressed concern that large numbers of fire grant applications never reach the peer 5 pl 11053 title i sec 101 sec

all grant applications that meet basic eligibility requirements on june 15 2007 the house passed hr 2638 including an amendment adding 5 million to the safer account thus the final housepassed bill provided 570 million for fire grants and 235 million for safer on june 14 2007 the senate appropriations committee approved its version of the fy2008 appropriations bill for the department of homeland security as reported the bill would provide 560 million for fire grants and 140 million for safer the senate committee directed dhs to continue the present practice of funding applications according
