onward in spite of recurring differences of opinion over regional issues the most significant of which was the arabisraeli conflict the saudi and us governments divergent re sponses to arabisraeli conflicts in 1948 1967 and 1973 created conditions that verely tested b ilateral relations nevertheless the truman eise nhower kennedy johnson and nixon administrations each viewed the saudi monarchy as an ally in relation to other nationalist and socialist governments in the region and as bulwark against the spread of communism in the gulf region and beyond the october 1973 arabisraeli war

first postcold war decade of us saudi relations came to close the bilateral relationship remained strong in traditional areas such as defense cooperation but showed signs of weakness in other areas political ties were challenged by the lingering effects of antius terrorist attacks disagreements over the resurgence of israelipalestinian figh ting from late2000 onward nd basic incompatibilities in some us and saudi figures expectations concerning political reform and human rights in the kingdom september 11 2001 and its aftermath the direct participation of 15 saudi nationals in the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks kindled strong criticism in the united states of saudi involvement in terrorism or of saudi laxity in ac ting against terrorist groups the attacks constituted the most serious challenge to ussaudi relations since the 19731974 oil embargo and some analysts have ce contended that qaeda planners may have chosen large number of saudi participants for the attacks in an attempt to damage ussaudi relations saudi officials have acknow ledged the deeply negative effect the attacks had on saudi arabias relations with the united states10 qaeda leader osama bin laden is

encouraged fund raising in saudi arabia by some char itable religious groups and foundations that espoused extremist ideologies or were linke d to or exploited by qaeda and other terrorist groups as noted above this tr end emerged as an outgrowth of pan islamic solidarity movement in saudi arabia that began under king faisal in the 1960s and 1970s and was embraced by the ited states in the 1980s as an asset during the antisoviet struggle in afghanistan11 nevertheless by the 1990s osama bin laden and other sa udi dissidents had increased their criticism of the saudi governments domestic and foreign policies and its close relationship with the united stat bin laden and his followers declared war on the united states in 1996 ostensibly to secure the withdrawal of us troops from the arabian

middle east and other regions however qaeda rhetoric c ondemning secular democracy us society and aspects of western culture leads many observers to question the notion that bin laden and other qaeda

to encourage the protecti on of human rights the establishment of religious freedom and the liberalization of political life in saudi arabia continue but face some significant obstacles to outsiders saudi decision making processes remain opaque many experts agree that th leaders of the saudi monarchy seek to preserve their ultimate authority over political decision making in the kingdom and act to maintain their legitimacy among conservative constituent groups by carefully managing changes that could affect blished religious and cultural practices recent experience suggests that us relia nce on saudi government cooperation for counterterrorism regional s ecurity and global energy supply purposes may limit the us governments ability to press for more rapid or wideranging changes in saudi domestic and social policies as it has elsewhere across the arab world advocacy by the us government and other intern ational parties in support of social and political reform in the kingdom has been met with skepticism and allegations of outside interference at the same time some reform activists question the commitment of the united states to promote political and social liberalization because in their view renewed ussaudi security and counterterrorism cooperation strengthens the ability of the saudi government and the royal family to control the saudi population and perceive d political rivals some observers also believe that apparent saudi reluctance to adopt broader social reforms is product of the rapid transformation that the country has undergone since its blishment some of which has been met with violent opposition by all accounts the saud family and its close allies dominate political and economic decision making in the kingdom although saudi leader s have taken some nominal steps since the early 1990s to respond to calls for the protection of individual liberties and for more participatory accountable government within the ruling family political differences and

countrys inte rnational influence although decision making authority remains concentrated policy decisions on controversial issues appear to reflect saudi leaders efforts to manage and address the

debates saudis have debated questions of political legitimacy and authority in the kingdom th roughout its history continuing petitions from reform activists since the 1990s have called on the royal

government since 2003 activists have submitted petitions calling for specific political refo rms including the introduction of constitutional monarchy110 thencrown prince and now king abdullah responded to initial calls for reform by instituting national dialogue process which some observers have described as an unpreced ented opportunity for saudi citizens to publicly debate political and social issues and to offer criticism of government policies111 however the subsequent arrest nd detention of sign atories of various reform petitions has angered reform suppor ters and create doubt
