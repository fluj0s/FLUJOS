spanish and turkish forces ma ny nato members have rejected sending additional forces or even modifying how their forces are employed15 poland is still expected to provide an additional 1000 troops sometime in early 2007 while some maintain that forces that are not permitted to participate in offensive operations are of little value and put an unfair burden on us british canadian and dutch forces that are actively involved in co mbat others argue that thes forces even with their caveats help to provide security that is needed to fac ilitate reconstruction continued german presence16 despite german plans to send 500 additional troops and six tornado rec onnaissance planes to augment the 3000 german troops already serving with isaf reports suggest that opposition is growing in germany over its expanding military role in afghanistan this opposition has been heightened by the recent murder of german aid worker and the bduction of two other german workers by insurgents increasing german public and political opposition to military participati on in afghanistan could make it highly unlikely that the german government will rescind nati onal caveats and adopt more offensive posture as called for by nato and the ited states in light of this apparent growing opposition nato and us officials might reconsider calling for more offensive role for german forces as such pressure could increase german political opposition and result in reduction of german military participati on in afghanistan 1400 additional british troops reports maintain that in response to lack of commitment by other nato nations to provide additional forces great britain will deploy an additional 1400 sold iers to helmand province by the summer of 2007 bringing the british troop level

arbitrarily divide the pashtun tribes that live on bot h sides of the border and the use of mines would invoke bad memories of the hundreds of thousands of landmines laid during 25 years of conflict first by the soviet s in the 1980s and later by warring afghan militias in the 1990s the united nations and other international groups have spent millions of dollars to remove these mines and many

was not authorized to play direct role in the antinarcotics ffort and could only supply intelligence and security and logistical assistance59 some question if more direct nato involvement in afghan count ernarcotics efforts could achieve better results but additional troops would likely be required for more direct role in counternarcotic s operations issues for congress adequacy of forces congress might examine the adequacy of forces both us and nato in terms of their ability to successfully prosecute combat operations against taliban insurgency that has evolved in term s of tactics and its ability to conduct coordinate d relatively largescale milita ry operations one issue that might be explored is that of national caveats that limit the usefulness of some nations military forces it can be ar gued that because many nato nations significantly restrict their forces operati ons that disproporti onate burden is being placed on nato countries that do not rest rict how their forces are used in afghanistan such disparity could also conceivably result in rift between nato forces that participate in combat operations and those forces that are restricted from participating rift that insurgents might choose to exploit while it is possiblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33503crs12 60 ann scott tyson marine unit is told to leave afghanistan washington post march 24 2007 61 ibid

combat operations it can be argued that forces subject to national caveats are playing vital role in afghanistan by virtue of their presence which affords degree of security and enab relief and rec onstruction efforts can nato sustain or increase its current force levels as part of any discourse on the adequacy of nat forces in afghanistan congress might also consider natos ability to sustain current force levels in afghanistan or increase these levels if the situation requires of particular concern is the pass the hat manner in which nato obtains its fo rces from member countries which likely makes any sort of longterm planning difficult at best natos 2006 request for an additional 2000 to 2500 combat soldiers is considered by some as illustrative of these difficulties because of what some call lack of commitment by many nato members the united states and great britain were compelled to provide the majority of reinforcements needed to meet the gr owing security threat posed by the taliban insurgents and narcotics traffickers why was the us marine special operations unit asked to leave afghanistan congress may decide to examine the specific events that lead to the expulsion of the marine special operations company one report suggests that after the ambush some afghan witnesses stated that the marines fired recklessly at passing vehicles and pedestrians ong the crowded road flanked by shops60 such reaction by unit reportedly composed of some of the most experienced highly trained marines including many expert s in reconnaissance and marksmanship61 is considered by some to be highly unusual for supposedly elite and highly disciplined unit the evolving insurgency five years into the conflict in afghanistan it can be argued that the taliban insurg ency has evolved bot h operationally and in terms of its impact on efforts to exte nd security and reconstruction throughout afghanistan congress might decide to examine the current state of the insurgency and its potential for further growth and evolution and us and nato efforts to address this evolution reports suggest that insurgent attacks have more than doubled over the past six months now numbe ring more than 600 attacks per month resulting in at least 3700 military and civilian deaths in 200662 this pattern of attacks reportedly threatens to reverse so of the gains made in the past with development activities being especially hardhit in several areas resulting in partial or total withdrawal of international ag encies in number of the worstaffected provinces63httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33503crs13

november 13 2006 66 ibidthe nature of insurgent operations suggests that the taliban insurgency continues to evolve some military officials concede that despite coalition offensive operations the insurgency has grown stronger64 the insurgency now attacks in larger groups mounting more sophisticated and audacious operations that often feature coordinated fires and maneuvers the insurgents also have displayed tenacity that was not present in past opera tions by pressing their attacks as opposed to past hit and run attacks it can be argued that these operational characteristics represent taliban insurgency that has improved its militarily effectiveness over the past five years of conflic t despite repeated attemp ts by coalition ground and air forces to destroy it adequacy of the afghan national army congress might consider reviewing the us governments commitment to building and supporting an effective afghan national army prerequisite for the withdrawal of us forces from afghanistan the administration appear s to be supporting 50000 soldier afghan national army as opposed to the 70000 so ldier force that it committed to in 2002 critics of this policy suggest that it is based on desire to cut costs and does not take into account the current situation where in surgents are stepping up both conventional attacks and explosive device and suicide attacks against coalition forces in addition some analysts maintain that 50000 soldie r force would be inadequate to confront the insurgency and defend afghanistans we stern border with iran some suggest that such an approach which mig ht make sense from short term financial perspective could result in an undermanned afghan na tional army and require an indefinite commitment of us and foreign troops to pr ovide for afghanistans security needs beyond national security some suggest that success of the afghan national army is important for other reasons65 some maintain that afghanistan has unifying institutions that the karzai government controls kabul but not much more that the afghan national police are funda mentally corrupt organization and that in the rural areas of afghanistan druglord s and warlords are in charge some view the multitribal afghan national army as good place to start to build afghan national loyalty inadequate equipment for the afghan national army with numerous reports from us officials citing the poor st ate of the afghan national army in terms of equipment it is possible that congre ss might examine how the united states and nato and coalition countries plan to impr ove the equipment posture of the afghan national army taliban insurgent forces are said to be better equipped than their ana counterparts who reportedl ride into battle in for d ranger pick up trucks with

extreme course of action for us and nato troops more active role short of direct action might have an impact on insurgent activities according to one report while the solution to the illegal opium problem requires an interdisciplinary approach due to the central role opium producti on plays in afghanistans economy nato and us forces should play greater ro in targeting drug laboratories opium stockpiles and trafficking routes as this would not only help afghan counternarcotics efforts but so curtails the flow of drugs to europe which gets 90 percent of its heroin from afghanistan67
