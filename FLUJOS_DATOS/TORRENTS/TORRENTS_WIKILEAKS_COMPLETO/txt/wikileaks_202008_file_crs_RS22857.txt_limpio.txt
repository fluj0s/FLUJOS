clay wilson foreign affairs defense and trade division april 9 2008 abstract this report describes virtual reality technology which uses threedimensional usergenerated content and its use by the us military and intelligence community for training and other purposes both the military and private sector use this new technology but terrorist groups may also be using it to train more realistically for future attacks while still avoiding detection on the internet the issues for congress to consider may include the costbenefit implications of this technology whether sufficient resources are available for the communications infrastructure needed to support expanded use of virtual reality technology and whether there might be national security considerations if the united states falls behind other nations in developing or adopting this new technology order code rs22857 april 9 2008 avatars virtual reality technology and the us military emerging policy issues clay wilson specialist

technology enables web content that is interactive and user generated however vr technology goes beyond traditional web pages and allows users to operate in threedimensions of space simulated within the computer vr is part of what is known as web 20 secondgeneration method of using web technology to create communities or social networks where instead of passively viewing content each user can dynamically create and modify and share web content thus web 20 technology allows users to collaborate and create selforganizing communities that can 1 increase the value and power of peer relationships and 2 simultaneously disrupt traditional realworld methods for hierarchical control over information flows1 early examples of 2d web 20 social network communities include youtube linkedin and wikipedia similar web 20 tools were developed and used by junior military officers during operation iraqi freedom to create notes about observed enemy movements and then quickly share this information among multiple unit commanders 1 don tapscott and anthony williams wikinomics penguin group new york 2006 crs2 initially senior military officials became concerned about security and their loss of control over classified information flows2 however unit commanders convinced dod leadership of the value of peercontrolled sharing information about insurgents adaptive movements which resulted in an officially sanctioned system now called cavnet which allows fast access to knowledge acquired on the ground in combat3 other social networking sites now sanctioned by the military include companycommand and platoonleader both accessible via password4 many businesses now use different 2d web 20 tools to accelerate innovation and several large corporations have also established simulated presences inside commercial 3d vr worlds to expand realworld sales several government agencies including the centers for disease control and prevention the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and at least one member of congress have experimented with setting up their own presences in vr environments5 simulation and military training modeling and computer simulation have traditionally been used to train military httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22857 pilots and tank crews in many cases the trainee steps into simulator device which is surrounded by screens that generate 3d image completely controlled by highpowered computerized artificial intelligence however new vr tools go beyond many traditional limitations and now allow multiple participants to freely interact with each other in the similar 3d computerized environment in many cases computer networking capabilities have dramatically increased to the point where users can now run complex 3d vr simulations in the field using laptop connected to the internet6 training with vr allows large numbers of personnel to interact in simulated facetoface environment with other distant military units through the internet or through the classified network known as siprnet and with firstresponder units civilians and even medical personnel units providing training experience that is increasingly effective but at much lower cost than would be required for assembling these personnel for reallife facetoface training exercise vr technology offers potentially effective and economically efficient tool for training military personnel to better deal with dynamic or potentially dangerous situations vr participants use selfdesigned computer images called avatars that look and act like real people and operate in virtual world environments that can have almost any 2 pbs frontline innovating and improvising httpwwwpbsorgwgbhpagesfrontlineshows companylessons 3 pbs frontline innovating and improvising

characteristics busy checkpoint in downtown baghdad or subway tunnel in downtown new york under chemical attack by terrorists the resulting interactions can be unpredictable and can seem highly realistic to the individual operators involved some of the avatars can simulate local citizens and when operated by reallife actors can demonstrate culturally correct gestures show facial expressions and communicate emotions which military personnel trainees must interpret correctly during these virtual world encounters7 for more detailed discussion of the effects of virtual reality on trainees and operators see your guide to virtual worlds at httpwwwpbsorgmediashift200710digging_deeperyour_guide_to_vihtml website that is affiliated with the pbs media enterprise intelligence operations the intelligence community has started exploring for how vr communities might become actual battlefields in the future complete with cyber weapons for launching attacks against terrorists or other enemies intelligence officials point out vulnerabilities because vendors for many commercial vr communities do not keep records of conversations between avatars or monitor how vr areas are used some of which can be httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22857 protected by strong passwords however other officials also think this level of concern is unwarranted and that fears of threats to national security in vr are overblown they also indicate that even though some users may engage in clandestine activity some vr products employ electronic tools that automatically look for risky behavior by avatars8 the intelligence community has also indicated that it may initiate study of the behavioral characteristics found in virtual worlds to identify emerging social behavioral and cultural norms the lessons learned would be used to help automatically detect suspicious behavior and actions of individuals operating in virtual worlds that might pose threat to national security9 communications infrastructure some experts expect that virtual reality and virtual worlds will have the same impact on business and government entities as has the internet itself however us communications infrastructure and acquisitions methods are relatively old and many asian countries are wellnetworked with advanced equipment that may offer advantages that could allow them to establish the global standards for vr technology10 china for example has begun construction of virtual world called hipihi reportedly with 7 michael peck soldiers learn hazards of war in virtual reality national defense february 2005

dominating the vr market may also set the technical standards for the rest of the world and may also own and operate the vr servers that give them unique access to information about future global financial transactions transportation shipping and business communications that may rely on virtual worlds some us military and state government communications systems rely on commercial products and leased communications lines for training for homeland defense operations12 however research survey in 2007 found that american companies are not poised to be the leaders in embracing web 20 technology in coming years if anything theyre looking like laggards leading the way are indian firms 80 of which plan to increase their investments in web 20 over the next three years compared with 69 of asiapacific firms 65 of european firms 64 of chinese firms 64 of north american firms and 62 of latin american firms13 these observers question whether the united states could adequately protect the security of its assets if future vr communications standards and servers were controlled by another country or possibly an adversary country14 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22857 dod programs the military is reportedly planning to build virtual world called sentient worldwide simulation which will mirror real life and automatically follow realworld events in real time some virtual world scenarios are also used to train medical personnel for mass casualty events to do this vr hospital rooms are designed to duplicate actual civilian or military facilities and are populated with individually controlled avatars for nurses and physicians which interact with avatars of national guard members and first responders who must also locate and transport avatars of patients with different injuries other uses include therapy treatment for military veterans suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd the treatment objective is to help veterans deal with troubling experiences in iraq or afghanistan by immersing them back into the sights and sounds of simulated past battles to provide treatment the therapist can manipulate effects the patient sees in simulation to best suit the needs of the patient the repeated treatments are intended to gradually reduce the experiences that trigger the trauma and the memory 11 personal conversation with us state department officials 2008 12

become tolerable early results from trials reportedly suggest that virtual reality therapy is wellsuited to generation raised on video games15 urban resolve was distributed training simulation carried out in 2006 by us joint forces command jfcom joint experimentation directorate simultaneously at the us army topographic engineering center at fort belvoir virginia and at the space and naval warfare systems command facilities in san diego california the training exercise used virtual world technology to help develop skills in urban warfighting operations for future joint force commanders the scenario which involved more than 2 million individually simulated objects interacting in baghdad in the year 2015 pitted usled coalition force against an adversary operating in an urban environment jfcom is also planning to run series of experiments in another virtual reality training exercise called noble resolve which involves homeland security scenarios that protect against possible nuclear attack by terrorists in one simulation nuclear bomb will explode and the virtual world will enable evaluation of collaboration among local state national and international officials government officials are seen as directing firstresponder and lawenforcement operations alongside military personnel in httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22857 realistic vr environment according to the trade press jfcom officials have also indicated that they plan to build intricate vr simulations of many cities with the final goal of creating fully functioning virtual model of the entire world which will be known as the sentient worldwide simulation this reportedly will become synthetic mirror of the real life that will automatically follow realworld events in real time16 the training and doctrine command tradoc project office for gaming tpo gaming is new army organization intended to integrate video game graphics into training simulations for soldiers and smallunit leaders the new office plans to develop an army simulation tool kit scheduled for deployment between 2010 and 2015 that allows end users to build and customized their own training scenarios without needing contractor to do it for them17 operational and cost areas vr is not always the best choice for military training for example vr simulators are usually located in comfortable environments with air conditioning to cool computer equipment so the operators never get tired from running with large backpack or wet and cold or otherwise physically stressed as they would in realworld training exercise however vr offers the following advantages 1 the training mission can be repeated numerous times 2 worstcase and emergency scenarios can be simulated without the risk of injury to trainees and 3 real military equipment is not used in vr so costs for equipment maintenance and fuel are eliminated vr is increasingly seen as useful way 15 virtual iraq vr based therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder defense update 2005

progress defense news december 3 2007 p 32 crs6 to supplement or reduce the number of realworld exercises needed to adequately train military personnel policy issues some experts expect that global commerce will come to rely heavily on vr in world where banking transportation control communications and other global commerce are arguably conducted in vr they question how the united states will defend its national assets if global vr standards are dominated by china or if majority of vr servers are physically located in and operated by china right now the us military does training in vr some ask whether day will come when the us military might also conduct actual war fighting operations in vr to defend us assets and national security should research be funded to develop exploits specific to vr that can be used by dod how does the us communications infrastructure to support vr compare with that of china or with other countries httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22857 to what extent could vr help the intelligence community track possible terrorist activity how do the costs and benefits of vr compare to the cost and benefits for traditional military training exercises have there been evaluations of vr effectiveness what are the implications of the expansion of this technology to other military activities
