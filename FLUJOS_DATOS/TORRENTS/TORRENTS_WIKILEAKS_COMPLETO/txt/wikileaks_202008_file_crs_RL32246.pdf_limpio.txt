allocations to be exceeded is pr ohibited finally the house and senate appropriations committees subdivide their allocations among their respective 13 subcommittees point of order may be raised against any appropriations act or amendment that would cause one of these subdivisions to be exceeded7 the budget resolution also contains spending levels by functional categ ories eg national defense

discretionary spending was combined into single category at other times it was divided into two or more broad categories such as defense and nondefe nse spending currently adjustable discretionary spending limits still exist for highway and mass transit spending for fy2003 and conservation spending divided into six subcategories through fy2006 but the sequestration process to enfo rce them expired on september 30 2002 under the paygo requirement the net ffect of new direct spending and revenue legislation enacted for fiscal year could not cause positive balance on multiyear paygo scorecard ie cause an increase in the onbudget deficit or reduction in the onbudget surplus for each fiscal year this scorecard maintained the balances of the accumulated budgetary ffects of laws enacted during the current session and prior years the paygo require ment applied to gislation enacted through fy2002 but it covered the effects of such legislation through fy2006 the paygo requirement effectivel was terminated at the end of fy2002 as well as discussed below the discretionary spending limits nd paygo requirement were enforced primarily by seque stration which involved
