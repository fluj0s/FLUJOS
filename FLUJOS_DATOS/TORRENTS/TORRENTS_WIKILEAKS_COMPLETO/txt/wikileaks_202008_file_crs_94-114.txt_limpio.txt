law exempted most domestic workers under age 18 and provided that social security and unemployment taxes will be reported on the employers annual federal tax return before 1994 taxes were paid quarterly current law domestic service generally is defined as work performed as part of household duties that contribute to the maintenance of an employers residence or administers to the personal wants and comforts of the employer this includes work performed by housecleaners maids housekeepers babysitters gardeners etc when the service and earnings threshold requirements for such work are met the employer must deduct social security and medicare taxes and report the wages to the internal revenue service irs to do so the employer must have an employer identification number which is obtained from the irs the amount of the social security and medicare tax in 2004 for the employer and employee each is 765 on wages up to 87900 separate medicare taxes of 145 for the employer and the employee each must be paid on wages above 87900 an employer who pays household employees 1000 or more in calendar quarter must also pay the unemployment tax social security and federal unemployment taxes are reported on the employers annual federal tax return there often is confusion about whether domestic workers are employees many people have the impression that domestic workers are selfemployed as independent contractors if they work in more than one household and therefore bear the burden of reporting and paying social security and other taxes however the tests that determine that household worker is selfemployed are fairly difficult to meet generally person who works in someones home in circumstances where the homeowner retains measure 1 this report was written by former crs staffer geoffrey kollmann congressional research service the library of congress crs2 of control basically meaning the right to give instructions to the household worker is an employee history of provision domestic workers were first covered by the 1950 amendments to the social security act they were covered only if they earned at least 50 in cash from an employer in quarter and b were regularly employed defined as working some portion of each of at least 24 days for an employer in quarter the 50 limit was chosen because it was similar to the one that applied to employees who work in their own homes and because it then was the amount worker needed to earn to receive quarter of coverage qc certain number of which are necessary to be eligible for benefits in 1954 congress eliminated the 24day rule in 1977 congress changed the rules regarding eligibility for earning qc replacing the 50perquarter rule with one that granted qc for every 250 of annual earnings the 250 threshold was indexed to change annually thereafter in proportion to the growth in average wages in the economy in 2004 it is 900 however congress left in place the 50perquarter test for coverage of domestic workers recent legislation and new law in early 1993 the issue of coverage of domestic workers burst into public awareness when several cabinet nominees revealed that they had failed to report the wages they had paid to childcare providers subsequent media scrutiny made it apparent that underreporting of household wages was common it also highlighted that householders were supposed to be reporting even occasional work such as babysitting and lawn mowing as the threshold had not been changed for 43 years the question naturally arose of whether it should be raised several measures were introduced in the 103rd congress that would have raised the threshold by varying amounts on march 22 1994 representative andrew jacobs introduced hr 4105 which would have raised the threshold to 1250 year in 1995 to be indexed thereafter to increases in average wages this measure was included in hr 4278 approved by the house on may 12 1994 on october 5 1994 conferees agreed to measure that raised the threshold for social security coverage of household workers to 1000 effective in 1994 workers and their employers who paid the tax on earnings of less than 1000 in 1994 received refund but there was loss of wage credits for the earnings the measure also provided that the threshold would rise in the future in 100 increments in proportion to the growth in average wages in the economy it rose to 1100 in 1998 1200 in 2000 1300 in 2001 and 1400 in 2003 where it remains for 2004 domestic workers under age 18 are exempt except when they are regularly employed in job that is their principal occupation persons employing household workers will report social security and federal unemployment taxes on their annual federal tax returns beginning in 1998 employers of domestic workers earning more than the threshold have to make estimated quarterly tax payments in order to avoid tax penalty the conference report was approved in the house by vote of 4230 and in the senate by unanimous consent on october 6 1994 president clinton signed it into law pl 103387 on october 22 1994 for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94114
