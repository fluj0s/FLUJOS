anticorruption task force actf the leadership board approved three recommendations 1 to apply set of minimum coas against highprofile corrupt officials to signal change in us policy on corruption 2 to begin series of highlevel demarches to persuade the karzai government to follow through on promises to tackle corruption and 3 to consider at the next leadership board meeting recommendations on

corrupt officials on casebycase basis possible coas can run the spectrum from refusing to appear in picture with corrupt official to cutting off usg funded assistance to seizing illgotten assets to applying presidential proclamation 7750 which prevents the corrupt official and hisher family from obtaining us visas coas are intended to preclude or replace prosecutions when appropriate but to serve as tools to be considered to alter illicit behavior in addition to prosecution or when prosecution is not possible or has low likelihood of success the policy also provides that coa is recommended that will hinder prevent or interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation or prosecution however in many cases the proposed measure may be as or more effective than law enforcement actions in influencing the conduct of officials involved in corruption or nexusrelated activities particularly at the local level 4 crel isaf ambassador wayne and mg flynn also agreed to the recommendation to develop basket of minimum coas that would be applied as default to all corrupt officials that are prioritized as persons of interest by ncc andor actf these minimum coas include 1 public meetings with the official and photos and highprofile public visits from codels and other dignitaries 2 giving or receiving of gifts and 3 restrictions on opportunities for corrupt officials to participate in usfunded training travel and speaking engagements applying minimum coas is designed to help change perceptions held by parts of the afghan public that the us supports explicitly or implicitly known corrupt officials positive incentives for positive acts 5 crel isaf the coa policy approved by the leadership board also provides for positive incentives for afghan officials who have demonstrated that they are not corrupt who facilitate us efforts and are positive influences in given province or district examples of positive courses of action include recognition for notable activity project funding consideration for training opportunities media opportunities etc board will consider application of coas at next meeting 6 crel isaf the meeting decided that actf and ncc will

civmil anticorruption counternarcotics and illicit finance working groups also refer information to receive referrals from and coordinate actions with the ncc when incriminating information is

involving prominent official or having implications that would negatively impact the us relationship with key government officials or ministries at any time the leadership team may convene meetings to discuss sensitive cases or to review leadership board decisions and recommendations as part of the weekly principals meeting comment 9 crel isaf recognizing the major limitations of law enforcement actions in afghanistan at this time due to lack of capacity and lack of political will this civmil effort will use pragmatic courses of action to end tacit american support for corrupt afghan officials and to attempt to change the illicit behavior of officials and influential afghans given the fluidity of developments on the ground eg rumors of ahmed wali karzais appointment as ambassador to saudi arabia or oman and abdul razziqs initiative to form an anticorruption task force in spin boldak the time is right to determine an appropriate policy for dealing with such officials end
