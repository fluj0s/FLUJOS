act the act and one section of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act each relating to enhanced foreign intelligence and law enforcement surveillance authority were to expire on december 31 2005 their expiration date has been postponed until march 10 2006 the authority remains in effect only with respect to foreign intelligence investigations begun before sunset or to offenses or potential offense begun or occurring before that date aside from the fact there may be some disagreement of whether potential offense is suspected crime andor an incomplete crime andor future crime after march 10 2006 the law reverts to its previous form unless it has been amended or extended in the interim the consequences of sunset are not the same for every expiring section in some instances the temporary provision has been replaced with permanent one in some other provisions have been made temporary by attachment to an expiring section in still others the apparent impact of termination has been mitigated by related provisions either in the act or elsewhere the temporary provisions are sections 201 wiretapping in terrorism cases 202 wiretapping in computer fraud and abuse felony

remain in effect only until march 10 2006 subsection 224b creates two exceptions for matters that straddle the termination date one for foreign intelligence investigations and the other for criminal cases even quick reading of section 224 raises number of questions what is the substance of th temporary sections that disappear on march 10 2006 what is the breath of the subsection 224b exceptions what is the fate and impact of amendments to the expiring sections or to related provisions of law enacted after passage of the act but before march 10 2006 what is the substance of the sections in title ii that continue on unimpaired by virtue of their inclusion in the otherthan list of the subsection 224a these questions are among those likely to be asked as twilight approaches the 911 commission noted the coming sunset and expressed the belief that as general matter because of the concerns regarding the shifting balance of power to the government full and informed debate on the patriot act would be healthy 911 commission report 394 2004 the expiring sections deal with the power of federal authorities to conduct searches and seizures generally searches and seizures relating to communications in most instances they allow authorities to move more quickly they reduce the required layers of administrative and judicial approval they permit searches and seizures of wider range of targets thus making these tools available earlier in an investigation and they allow authorities to coordinate their activities in

prevented and that terrorists and criminals will be caught and punished they accomplish these things however by easing or removing safeguards designed to protect indivi dual privacy and to prevent government abuse and so they increase the risk that government authority will be abused and that the privacy of those who are neither terrorists nor criminals will be invaded the debate over sunset is debate of where the balance should be struck to further complicate the debate in some instan ces the expiring sections curtail rather than expand governmental authority bolster rather than erode the safeguards against governmental overreaching or abuse of authority the usa pa triot act sections were originally set to sunset on december 31 2005 by then both houses had passed legislation that amended and extended the expiring sections hr 3199 and conference report resolving their differences had been issued hrept 109433 2005 in order to provider further time for consideration the expiration date has been extended twice first until february 3 2006 pl 109160 2006 and mo re recently until march 10 2006 hr 4659 pl 109____ 2006

the act that expire on march 10 2006 will cease to exist after that date the same is true for any subsequent amendments to the expiring sections they expire along with their hosts preexisting provisions of law repealed or amended by the expiring sections will be revived automatically unless they themselves have been repealed or amended by intervening legislation as several have the impact of subsection 224b is somewhat more difficult to discern it provides two standards one with respect to any particular foreign intelligence investigations that began before sunset and second with respect to any particular offense or potential offense that began or occurred before sunset pl 10756 224 18 usc 2510 note the first seems fairly straightforward the authority granted by an expiring provision of the act may be exercised after sunset or may continue to be exercised after sunset with respect to any foreign intelligence investigation initiated before sunset the second comes with questions what is potential offense does the phrase refer to pre sunset circumstances whose criminality is determined in postsunset investigation or does the phrase also include postcrimes that evolved out of presunset circumstances which themselves constituted neither crimes nor elements of crime as general rule when congress uses ordinary words it is presumed to have intended them to have their commonly understood meaning 1 the word potential usually contemplates the incomplete the unfulfilled the undeveloped or the unawakened possibility rather than the suspected or uncertain possibility2 1 national railroad passenger corp v morgan 536 us 101 109110 2002 quoting walters v metropolitan ed enterprises inc 519 us 202 207 1997in the absence of an indication to the contrary

postsunset crimes that grow out presunset circumstances although hardly term of art earlier federal courts have used the term to describe possible past offenses in some cases3 and to describe possible future offenses in others4 congress in subsection 224b however is not referring to all potential offenses but only to those that began or occurred before sunset offenses occurring entirely after sunset cannot be said to have begun or occurred beforehand thus although it is scarcely beyond debate congress appears to have added the term potential offense out of an abundance of caution lest the exception be read to extend only to investigations of conduct whose criminality was known prior to sunset but not of presunset conduct w hose innocence or criminality was only ultimately determined

and inserting 2339b or 2339c 116 stat 728 2002 thus section 201 enacts 18 usc 25161q section 201 and therefore 18 usc 25161q expire on march 10 2006 pl 107197 amends subsection 25161q and therefore on the face of things the later amendment expires with the rest of 25161q yet although the language of the statute may indicate that the pl 107197 amendments expire with the rest of subsection 25161q the scant legislative history might suggest that congress intended to add the new crimes 18 usc 2332f bombing public buildings and places and 2339c financing terrorism to the wiretap predicate offense list permanently the house judiciary committee report there is senate report for instance notes the addition of the new crimes not only to the wiretap predicate list but to the list of federal crimes of terrorism in 18 usc 2332bg5b to the predicate offense list for 18 usc 2339a assistance of terrorists and to the forfeiture predicate list in 18 usc 981a1this section of the bill which is not required by the treaty but will assist in federal enforcement adds the new 18 usc 2332f and 2339c to four existing provisions of law hrept 107307 at 14 2001 other than its placement there is nothing to indicate congress intended to insert the new crimes temporarily on the wiretap predicate list but permanently on the other lists the reasons for making the section 224 provisions temporary do not seem to apply to the treaty implementing provisions the additions were made to implement treaty obligations not root out 911 terrorists on the other hand the treaty deals with terrorism offenses and the crimes added to subsection 25161q are much like those already found there more importantly the clearest indication of what congress means is what it says it said the treatyimplementing crimes should be added to that portion of the wiretap predicate list that is clearly scheduled to expire in other instances when called upon to construe statute in apparent contradiction to its precise

somewhat specific examples the department supplied drug cases have long been staple of the federal and state law enforcement wiretapping practices11 federal drug and explosives offenses and conspiracy to violate them are among the existing permanent federal wiretap predicates 18 usc 25161c r 844d f g h i and it is not clear why wiretaps under the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa should not be adequate and perhaps even more appropriate with respect to an individual with suspected ties to columbian terrorists 50 usc 1804 1805 1801 or so critics might contend 12 such critics might argue that the statistics published annually by the administrative office of the united states courts confirm that the authority under sections 201 and 202 is little used and little needed terrorism

department officials have explained that the section 203b along with several other sections of the usa pa triot act scheduled to expire have made it possible for criminal law enforcement and foreign intelligence investigators to share information for the more effective performance of their duties particularly in terrorism cases17 by way of example they have testified that the authority under section 203b has been used to advise federal intelligence officials of the manner and means by which monies were funneled to iraq and efforts to support and supply foreign terrorist organization 18 they argue that to allow section 203b and other usa pa triot act information sharing provisions to expire would be inconsistent with the information sharing legislation congress has enacted subsequently they point particularly to provisions that allow sharing with foreign officials therefore were section 203b allowed to expire united states law enforcement officers would be allowed to share certain foreign information collected through criminal investiga tive wiretaps with foreign intelligence services such as mi5 but would arguably not be allowed to share that same information with the cia 19 the concern with information sharing has always been that law enforcement investigators will call upon foreign intelligence powers in order to avoid the constitutional and other legal safeguards that ordinarily attend the exercise of their own authority corresponding concern is that foreign intelligence investigators will likew ise call upon law enforcement authority to avoid the safeguards that ordinarily attend their own foreign intelligence authority at least one congressional hearing witness has speculated that the availability of section 203 may have led to the use of criminal law enforcement powers for purposes of an intelligence probe 20 others may question whether there are any real consequences of expiration other permanent provisions of the wiretap law will continue to allow information sharing with other investigative and law enforcement officials21 and in terrorism cases with intelligence authorities22 the 17 eg oversight of the usa patriot act hearing

burdensome process of obtaining wiretap order rather than search warrant to obtain unopened voicemail this was so despite the fact that authorities could use search warrant for example to obtain messages stored on the suspects own answering machine section 209 of the usa patriot act has modernized federal law by enabling investigators to access more quickly suspects voicemail by using search

in the netherlands report at 22 the justice department also reports that since passage of the act such warrants have been used in variety of criminal cases to obtain key evidence including voice mail messages left for foreign and domestic terrorists myths at 209 and it points out that while the procedure under title iii is more demanding and consequently slower and more burdensome the warrant procedure necessarily involves finding of probable cause on evidence presented under oath and found by neutral magistrate id critics might suggest that congress could have supplied consistency of treatment in different manner it might have concluded that an ongoing conversation ie one in which communications are being transmitted but have not been received should be accorded the same level of title iii protection whether it involv telephone conversation face to face conversation an email conversation or voice mail conversation as it now stands telephone conversation is treated differently than an incomplete voice mail conversation here and elsewhere critics might also suggest that information on the utility of the new authority seems somewhat general and fairly skeletal here and

part of the original package 110 hr hearing at 72 28 the house and senate proposals contained essentially the same provision 110 hr 28 the justice departments explanation ran as follows existing law contains provisions that allow providers of electronic communications service to disclose the communications or records relating to such communications of their customers or subscribers in emergencies that threaten death or serious bodily injury this section amends 18 usc 2702 to authorize such disclosures if the provider reasonably believes that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of the information without delay current law also contains an odd disconnect provider may disclose the contents of the customers communications in order to protect its rights or property but the current statute does not expressly permit provider to voluntarily disclose noncontent records such as subscribers login records 18 usc 2702b5 this problem substantially hinders the ability of providers to protect themselves from cyberterrorists and criminals yet the right to disclose the contents of communications necessarily implies the less intrus ive ability to disclose noncontent records in order to promote the protection of our nations critical infrastructures this sections amendments allow communications providers to voluntarily disclose both content and non content records to protect their computer systems

hands of law enforcement and the system owner or operator in those likely instances in which the interception does not result in pr osecution the target of the interception will never have an opportunity to challenge the activity through suppression proceeding indeed such target would never even have notice of the fact that their communications were subject to warrantless interception the

technical conforming amendment section 220 passed untouched through the legislative process from request to presidential signature34 the justification for the proposals was rather straightforward current law requires the government to use search warrant to compel provider to disclose unopened email 18 usc 2703a because federal rule of criminal procedure 41 requires that the property to be obtained be within the district of the issuing court however the rule may not allow the issuance of 2703a warrants for email located in other districts thus for example where an investigator in boston is seeking electronic email in the yahoo account of suspected terrorist he may need to coordinate with agents prosecutors and judges in the northern district of california none of whom have any other involvement in the investigation this electronic communications information can be critical in establishing relationships motives means and plans of terrorists moreover it is equally relevant to cyberincidents in which terrorist motive has not but may well be identified finally even cases that require the quickest response kidnaping threats or other dangers to public safety or the economy may rest on evidence gathered under 2703a to further public safety this section accordingly authorizes courts with jurisdiction over investigations to compel evidence directly without requiring the intervention of their counterparts in other districts where major internet service providers are located 108 hr hearings at 55

justice department asserts that section 220 has proven beneficial in number of criminal cases some involving charges of terrorism in section 220 congress adapted federal law to changing technology by allowing courts to order the release of stored comm unications through search warrant valid in another specified judicial district the enhanced ability to obtain this information efficiently has proved invaluable in several terrorism investigations such as the virginia jihad36 and the shoebomber37 cases as well as timesensitive criminal investigations such as one involving dangerous fugitive38 in addition to allowing law enforcement to gain access to information quickly in timesensitive investigations congress also significantly improved the justice departments ability to mount largescale child pornography investigations by including section 220 in the usa patriot act the ability to obtain search warrants in the jurisdiction of child pornography investigation rather than in the jurisdiction of the internet service provider is critical to the success of complex multijurisdictional child pornography case section 220 has also dramatically reduced the administrative burdens in judicial districts that are home to large internet service providers report at 201 the attorney general has expressed the view that it is imperative that section 220 be renewed allowing the provision to expire would delay many timesensitive investigations and result in the inefficient use of investigators prosecutors and judges time39 critics might suggest that the principal objection to section 220 is that it makes it expensive and inconvenient for service providers to contest or request modification of orders directed to them from district courts throughout the country 40 for the justice department with united states attorneys offices throughout the country by way of contrast the burden is simply matter of resource allocation it might be argued some may feel that the section allows the justice department to forum shop should the federal courts in the home districts of large providers prove sympathetic to the burdens such orders impose upon the providers they might also contend that expiration arrives with little loss in terrorism cases since section 219 of the act which does not expire allows for nationwide service of search warrants in terrorism cases 36 several

released if it winds up on the white house desk and somebody leaks it if j edgar hoover tells bad stories about you then you have right to go in under the federal tort claims act as the aggrieved party and sue it also then says that if someone goes in and wins the lawsuit against the government because surveilled information has been inappropriately leaked the head of that bureau or agency

of action created in section 223 appears somewhat uncertain reading only the language of termination and before considering the exception any cause of action created by section 223 seems to expire on march 10 2006 this could mean either that suit pending or merely actionable survives thereafter or alternatively that pending suits survive but none may be filed thereafter or that regardless of when it is filed any cause of action will only survive with respect to matters occurring prior to that date under some circumstances the demise of cause of action deprives the courts of subject matter jurisdiction longstanding supreme court pr ecedent holds that when law conferring jurisdiction is repealed without any reservation as to pending cases all cases fall with the law 42 taking the exception into consideration the language on its face seems to say that section 223 continues in effect with respect to any particular foreign intelligence investigation that began before march 10 2006 or with respect to any particular offense or potential offense that began or occurred before march 10 2006 that is cause of action arising out of foreign intelligence investigation initiated before the date of expiration or out of criminal investigation of conduct occurring before the date survivesregardless of when the conduct giving rise to the cause of action occurred on the other hand subsection 224b may speak only to investigations not to causes of action it may be that the exception is intended to do more than extend investigative powers conveyed by other expiring sections of the

technical assistance necessary to accomplish electronic surveillance in manner that will protect its secrecy and produce minimum of interference with the services that such person is providing to the target of electronic surveillance this would enhance the fbis ability to monitor international terrorists and intelligence officers who are trained to thwart surveillance by rapidly changing hotel

dealers and mobsters who for example frequently switch cell phones to evade surveillance prior to enactment of the usa patriot act such authority was not available under fisa for cases involving terrorists section 206 of the act however now permits officers in international terrorism investigations to obtain court order that applies to the suspect rather than particular phone or phone company this new authority has put investigators in better position to avoid unnecessary catandmouse games with terrorists who are trained to thwart surveillance while particular examples of the use of mu ltiplepoint wiretaps pursuant to section 206 remain classified the following hypothetical illustrates the utility of this authority suppose for example the investigators become aware of an qaeda plot to launch bomb attack investigators also discover recent cellular telephone number for the suspected bomber for which they immediately obtain fisa surveillance order when they attempt to begin surveillance of the suspect however they discover that he has changed cellular telephone numbers and providers in order to thwart surveillance because of section 206 in cases where the subjects actions may have the effect of thwarting the identification of service provider investigators can now obtain fisa multiplepoint surveillance order and immediately serve it on the suspected bombers new cellular provider allowing undercover agents to monitor his new cellular telephone number immediately without section 206 however investigators in such cases would be forced to waste valuable time

ovision they have stated that this even allows the tapping of pay phones that person regularly walks past there is though requirement for minimization in that agents must stop liste ning when they learn that the conversation is not pertinent to the subject of their warrant the argument for roving wiretaps is that suspected terrorists might repeatedly change cell phones the problem with this argument is that the government by definition cannot listen to phone until they know that it exists once they know they could just add th new number to an existing warrant in debates with fbi agents

in the position of having to accept the validity of the warrant and its application to them virtually without question although the section does permit provider to inquire with the attorney general as

section 214 makes several adjustments in the fisa pen registertrap and trace device procedures fisa once permitted applications for fisa pen register or trap and trace device order for telephone communications in order to acquire information relevant to foreign intelligence or international terrorism investigation and upon the additional certification that the communications monitored would likely be either 1 those of an international terrorist or spy individual engaged in international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities that involve violation of us criminal laws or 2 those of fore ign power or its agent relating to the criminal activities of an international terrorist or spy 50 usc 1842a1 c2 c3 i2000 ed section 214 opens the fisa pen registertrap and trace device procedure to both wire and electronic communications eg telephone email internet communications 50 usc 1842d2a it drops the requirement that the communications be those of international terrorists or spies or be related to their activities 50 usc 1842c2 it adds the caveat that any investigation of us person for which order is secured to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities may not be conducted based solely on activities protected by the first amendment to the constitution 50 usc 1842a1 c2 it adds this same caveat with respect to emergency fisa pen register or trap and trace device use 50 usc 1843ab1 g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 the administrations original request sought to make pen register and trap and trace device procedures more compatible when added to fisa two years ago the pen registertrap and trace section was intended to mirror the criminal pentrap authority defined in 18 usc 3123 the fisa authority differs from the criminal authority in that it requires in addition to showing of relevance an additional factual showing that the communications device has been used to contact an agent of foreign power engaged in international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities this has the effect of making the fisa pentrap authority much more difficult to obtain in fact the process of obtaining fisa pentrap authority is only slightly less burdensome than the process for obtaining full electronic surveillance authority under fisa this stands in stark contrast to the criminal pentrap authority which can be obtained quickly from local court on the basis of certifi cation that the information to be obtained is relevant to an ongoing investigation the amendment simply eliminates the agent of foreign power prong from the predication and thus makes the fisa authority more closely track the criminal authority 155 hr hearings at 57 see also 155 hr 2975 hrept 107236 at 61

suspected qaeda agents in this country the usa patriot act also has updated federal pentrap law under fisa by making the legal requirements for obtaining court permission for pentrap orders in international terrorism investigations more similar to the standards that apply in ordinary criminal cases previously fisaauthorized pentrap orders were available in terrorism investigations only if the suspect was or was communicating with an agent of foreign power fisa thus prevented officials from using pentrap devices in many settings that might have revealed information relevant to foreign intelligence investigation under section 214 of the act however the government now can obtain pentrap order when the information likely to be obtained is foreign intelligence information or is relevant to investigations intended to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities while specific examples of the use of pentrap devices pursuant to section 214 remain classified the department has utilized section 214 on several occasions in international terrorism investigations including investigations of suspected qaeda operatives in the united states and the streamlined pentrap authority has made it easier to identify additional subjects in terrorism investigations report at 256 critics might argue that streamlining the fisa pen registertrap and trace device procedure is particularly illadvised first the procedure is already subject to minimum of judicial supervision orders are issued upon the fbis certification of relevance not upon the courts finding of relevance54 unlike wiretap orders there is requirement that the targets of the order be notified after the order expires unless the results are to be used as evidence in official proceedings55 unlike comparable orders in the criminal sphere there is requirement of subsequent report to the court of the particulars of execution56 criminal orders call for judicial re examination every 60 days fisa orders every 90 days57 second the nature and extent of the expanded authority is substantial where orders once permitted authorities to monitor the identification of parties to telephone conversations over particular instruments they now permit authorities to monitor internet use58 third in terrorism cases officials presumable enjoy adequate 54 50 usc 1842 55 compare 50 usc

patriot act capture the substantive material of the communication in question the usa patriot acts expansion of and consolidation of the definitions of pen registers and trap and trace devices endanger the original distinction upon which the lower level of scrutiny was justified the expanded definition would now seem to cover web surfing email messages electronic fax distributions and any other electronic form of communication the fbi justifies these definitional expansions by interpreting web traffic as substantially similar to tele phone conversations despite the substantial differences including the vast amount of information available from an email routing protocol that cannot be gleaned from listening to phone conversation this issue has never been litigated and remains unresolved 59 epic report the amendment significantly eviscerates the constitutional rationale for the relatively lax requirements that apply to foreign intelligence surveillance that laxity is premised on the assumption that the executive branch in pursuit of its national security responsibilities to monitor the activities of foreign powers and their agents should not be unduly restrained by congress and the courts the removal of the foreign power predicate for pen registertrap and trace surveillan ce upsets that delicate balance

request for administrative subpoena authority to replace more narrowly drawn fisa procedure the business records section of fisa 50 usc 1861 and 1862 requires formal pleading to the court and the signature of fisa judge or magistrate in practice this makes the authority unavailable for most investigative contexts the time and difficulty involved in getting such pleadings before the court usually outweighs the importance of the business records sought since its enactment the authority has been sought less than five times this section would delete the old authority and replace it with general administrative subpoena authority for documents and records this authority modeled on the administrative subpoena authority available to drug investigators pursuant to title 21 allows the attorney general to compel protec tion of such records upon finding that the information is relevant 156 hr hearings at 57 the house judiciary committee converted the request into an amendment of the

investigation of international terrorism provided that the investigation is not conducted solely upon the basis of activities protected by the first amendment to the constitution this section is problematic in other ways judges for example have authority to deny request if the application meets the requirements of the section it is unnecessary to report the actual documents seized or their usefulness to the court or congress while section 215e does not waive any privilege persons served by an order are gagged furthermore the act overrides federal privacy statutes and explicitly bars

intelligence investigations initiated before that date whether the wall of separation between criminal and foreign intelligence investigations will be or must be reconstructed at that point is unclear at best section 504 of the actwhich does not sunset adds language to the fisa wiretap and physical search schemes calling for continued cooperation and declaring cooperation bar to the certification in fisa application of an intelligencegathering purpose 50 usc 1806k 1825k 68 moreover the department of justice and the fisa review court now appear to doubt that fisa prior to passage of the act required such wall of separation69 thus the expiration of section 218 may not require reconstruction of the wall although applications for fisa wiretap or search orders would once again have to certify that foreign intelligence gathering constituted the purpose for the application 68 federal officers who conduct electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information under this title may consult with federal law enforcement officers to coordinate efforts to investigate or protect againsta actual or potential attack or other grave hostile acts of foreign power or agent of foreign power b sabotage or international terrorism by foreign power or an agent of foreign power or c clandestine intelligence activities by an intelligence service or network of foreign power or by

50 usc 1805k similar language appears in 1825k for physical searches 69 it is quite puzzling that the justice department at some point during the 1980s began to read the statute as limiting the departments ability to obtain fisa orders if it inte nded to prosecute the targeted agents apparently to avoid running afoul of the primary purpose test used by some courts the 1995 procedures limited contacts between the fbi and the criminal division in cases where fisa surve illance or searches were being conducted by the fbi for foreign intelligence fi or foreign counterintelligence fci purposes the procedures stated that the fbi and criminal division would ensure that advice intended to preserve the option of criminal prosecution does not inadvertently result in either the fact or the appearance of the criminal divisions directing or controlling the fi or fci investigation toward law enforcement objectives although these procedures provided for significant information sharing and coordination they eventually came to be narrowly interpreted within the department of justice as requiring wall to prevent the fbi intelligence official s from communicating with the criminal division regarding ongoing fi or fci investigations the departments attitude changed somewhat after internal and general accounting office reports concluded that the departments concern over how the fisa court or other federal courts might interpret the primary purpose test had inhibited necessary coordination between intelligence and law enforcement officials the internal report also concluded based on the text of fisa and its legislative history that not only should the purpose of the investigation not be inquired into by the courts but also that congress affirmatively anticipate that the underlying investigation might well have criminal as well as foreign intelligence objective 310 f3d at 723 725 727

218 is perhaps the most fundamental of the changes accomplished by the expiring sections of the act therefore it is not surprising that the justice departments defense of the section is both extensive and explicit the usa patriot act authorizes government agencies to share intelligence so that complete mosaic of information can be compiled to understand better what terrorists might be planning and to prevent attacks prior law as interpreted and implemented had the effect of sharply limiting the ability of law enforcement and intelligence officers to share information which severely hampered terrorism investigators ability to connect the dots however the usa patriot act along with changes in attorney general guidelines and foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa court procedures brought down this wall separating intelligence from law enforcement and greatly enhanced foreign intelligence information sharing among federal law enforcement and national security personnel intelligence agencies and other entities entrusted with protecting the nation from acts of terrorism this increased ability to share information has been invaluable to the conduct of terrorism investigations and has directly led to the disruption of terrorist plots and numerous arrests prosecutions and convictions in terrorism cases the recent investigation and prosecution of members of an qaeda cell in lackawanna new york illustrates the benefits of the increased information sharing brought about by the usa patriot act this case involved several residents of lackawanna who traveled to afghanistan in 2001 to receive training at an qaedaaffiliated camp near kandahar the investigation of the lackawanna six began during the summer of 2001 when the fbi received an anonymous letter indicating that these six individuals and others might be involved in criminal activity and associating with foreign terrorists the fbi concluded that existing law required the creation of two separate investigations in order to retain the option of using fisa criminal investigation of possible drug crimes and an intelligence investigation related to terrorist threats over the ensuing months two squads carried on these two separate investigations simultaneously and there were times when the intelligence officers and the law enforcement agents concluded that they could not be in the same room during briefings to discuss their respective investigation with each other the usa patriot act however took down the wall separating these two investigations by making clear that the sharing of casesensitive information between these two groups was allowed as result of key information shared by intelligence investigators law enforcement agents were able to learn that an individual mentioned in the anonymous letter was an agent of qaeda further information shared between intelligence and law enforcement personnel then dramatically expedited the investigation of the lackawanna six and allowed charges to be filed against these individuals five of the lackawanna six pleaded guilty to providing material support to qaeda and the sixth pleaded guilty to conducting transactions unlawfully with qaeda these individuals were then sentenced to prison terms ranging from seven to ten years before the passage of the usa patriot act applications for orders authorizing electronic surveillance or physical searches under fisa had to include certification from highranking executive branch official that the purpose of the surveillance or search was to gather foreign intelligence information as interpreted by the courts and later the justice department this requirement meant that the primary purpose of the collection had to be to obtain foreign intelligence information rather th an evidence of crime over the years the prevailing interpretation and implementation of the primary purpose standard had the effect of limiting coordination and information sharing between intelligence and law enforcement personnel because the courts evaluated the governments purpose for using fisa at least in

more coordination that occurred the most likely courts would find that law enforcement rather than foreign intelligence had become the primary purpose of the surveillance or search in recent testimony before the senate judiciary committee patrick fitzgerald us attorney for the northern district of illinois recounted from personal experience how this wall between law enforcement and intelligence personnel operated in practice i was on prosecution team in new york that began criminal investigation of usama bin laden in early 1996 the teamprosecutors and the fbi agents assigned to the criminal casehad access to number of sources we coul d talk to citizens we could talk to local police officers we could talk to other us government agencies we could talk to foreign police officers even foreign intelligence personnel and foreign citizens and we did all those things as often as we could we could even talk to qaeda membersand we did we actually called several members and associates of qaeda to testify before grand jury in new york and we even debriefed qaeda members overseas who agreed to become cooperating witnesses but there was one group of people we were not permitted to talk to who the fbi agents across the street from us in lower manhattan assigned to parallel intelligence investigation of usama bin laden and qaeda we could not learn what information they had gathered that was the wall the usa patriot act brought down the wall separating intelligence officers from law enforcement agents section 218 of the usa patriot act eliminated the primary purpose requirement the department has moved aggressively to implement sections 218 and 504 of the usa patriot act and bring down the wall these efforts to increase coordination and information sharing between intelligence and law enforcement officers which were made possible by the usa patriot act have yielded extraordinary dividends by enabling the department to open numerous criminal investigations disrupt terrorist plots bring numerous criminal charges and convict numerous individuals in terrorism cases examples the removal of the wall separating intelligence and law enforcement personnel played critical role in the departments successful dismantling of portland oregon terror cell popularly known as the portland seven members of this terror cell had attempted to travel to afghanistan in 2001 and 2002 to take up arms with the taliban and qaeda against united states and coalition forces fighting there at least one member of the cell battle had contemplated attacking jewish schools or synagogues and had even cased such buildings to select target for such an attack by the time investigators received this information from the undercover informant they had suspected that number of other persons had been involved in the afghanistan conspiracy but while several of these other individuals had returned to the united states from their

yet have sufficient evidence to arrest them before the usa patriot act prosecutors would have faced dilemma in deciding whether to arrest battle immediately if prosecutors had failed to act lives could have been lost through domestic terrorist attack but if prosecutors had arrested battle in order to prevent potential attack the other suspects in the investigation would have undoubtedly scattered or attempted to cover up their crimes because of sections 218 and 504 it was clear that the fbi agents could conduct fisa surveillance of battle to detect whether he had received orders from an international terrorist group to reinstate the domestic attack plan on jewish targets and keep prosecutors informed as to what they were learning this gave prosecutors the confidence not to arrest battle prematurely while they continued to gather evidence on the other members the cell ultimately prosecutors were able to collect sufficient evidence to charge seven defendants and then to secure convictions and prison sentences ranging from three to eighteen years for the six defendants taken into custody charges against the seventh defendant were dismissed after he was killed in pakistan by pakistani troops without sections 218 and 504 of the usa patriot act however this case like would have been referred to as the portland one rather than the portland seven the department shared information pursuant to sections 218 and 504 before indicting sami alarian and several coconspirators on charges related to their involvement with the palestinian islamic jihad pij pij is alleged to be one the worlds most violent terrorist outfits in this case sections 218 and 504 enabled prosecutors to consider all evidence against alarian and his coconspirators including evidence obtained pursuant to fisa that provided the necessary factual support for the criminal case by considering the intelligence and law enforcement information together prosecutors were able to create complete history for the case and put each piece of evidence in its proper context prosecutors and investigators also used information shared pursuant to sections 218 and 504 in investigating the defendant in the socalled virginia jihad case the information sharing between intelligence and law enforcement personnel made possible by sections 218 and 504 was useful in the investigation of two yemeni citizens who were charged last year with conspiring to provide material support to qaeda and hamas the department used sections 218 and 504 to gain access to intelligence which facilitated the indictment of enaam arnaout the executive director of the illinoisbased benevolence international foundationbif arnaout ultimately pleaded guilty to racketeering charge admitting that he diverted thousands of dollars from bif to support islamic military groups in bosnia and chechnya he was sentenced to over 11 years in prison the broader information sharing and coordination made possible by sections 218 and 504 assisted the prosecution in san diego of several persons involved in an qaeda drugsforweapons plot which culminated in several guilty pleas two defendants admitted that they conspired to distribute approximately five metric tons of hashish and 600 kilograms of heroin originating in pakistan to undercover united states law enforcement officials additionally they admitted

illegally acting as an agent of the former government of iraq during this investigation intelligence officers conducting surveillance of dumeisi pursuant to fisa coordinated and shared information with law enforcement agents and prosecutors investigating dumeisi for possible violations of criminal law because of this coordination law enforcement agents and prosecutors learned from intelligence officers of an incriminating telephone conversation that took place in april 2003 between dumeisi and coconspirator this phone conversation corroborated other evidence that dumeisi was acting as an agent of the iraqi government and provided compelling piece of evidence at dumeisis trial report at 28 the absence of the wall has stimulated concerns that the cooperation between law enforcement and

from liability arising out of an investigation might be thought to survive because they can be characterized as matters with respect to any particular foreign intelligence investigation or with respect to any particular offense or potential offense began or occurring before march 10 2006 g5g152g151g156g146g141g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 in the absence of an explicit enforcement device explicit immunity provisions encourage communications providers and other third parties to cooperate in the execution of fisa order on the other hand immunity from civil liability removes one of the principal incentives for third party addressed in fisa order to petition the court to quash or modify the order justice department officials have argued that the assistance of providers can be critical to the timely execution of an order that comparable immunity has long existed for assistance in the execution of court ordered law enforcement wiretap and that the authority has been effectively used at least once by an fbi field office in an espionage investigation 72 critics might question why recourse to fisa wiretap order was necessary when law enforcement wiretap orderswhich afford immun ity to assisting communications providersare available for espionage investigations 18 usc 2516 g21g158g150g150g138g155g162g561 section 225 establishes immunity for assistance in the execution of fisa surveillance order and perhaps for compliance with any fisa order 50 usc 1805h it encourages cooperation and discourages court challenges 72 house hearings statement of mary beth

as noted at the outset section 6006 of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 118 stat 3742 2004 amends the definition of agent of foreign power for fisa purposes to include foreign national who is preparing for or engaging in international terrorism and b makes the sunset provisions of section 224 applicable to the amendment73 fisa makes agents of foreign power the appropriate targets for fisa surveillance and physical search orders 18 usc 1805 1824 the definition of agents of foreign power already included individuals preparing for or engaging in international terrorism for or on behalf of foreign power 50 usc 1801b2c section 6001 excuses the need to show that the illicit activity is being conducted at the behest or benefit of foreign poweras

on intelligence 107th cong 2d sess 2002 the senate report explains the rationale for the section as it appeared in s 113 the purpose of s 113 is to amend the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 fisa to permit surveillance of socalled lone wolf foreign terrorists s 113 would allow fisa warrant to issue upon probable cause that nonunited states person is engaged in or preparing for international terrorism without requiring special showing that the nonunited states person also is affiliated with foreign power by eliminating the requirement of foreignpower link for fisa warrants in such cases s 113 would allow us intelligence agencies to monitor foreign terrorists who though not affiliated with group or government pose serious threat to the people of the united states in light of the significant risk of devastating attacks that can be carried out by nonunited states persons acting alone individual terrorists must be monitored and stopped regardless of whether they operate in coordination with other individuals or organizations srept 10840 at 2 73 section 6001 provides in generalsection 101b 1 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 50 usc 1801b1 is

first blush there might be some question of whet her provision that declares that agents of foreign power need not be agents of fore ign power is sufficient to come within keith case reservations concerning the fourth amendments application in terrorism cases75 the multi national definition of international terrorism and the limitation of the sections amendment to foreign nationals may suffice but the question seems to have troubled some but not all of the witnesses who testified regarding similar legislation in the 107th congress76 some members of the senate judiciary committee also suggested that sections rationale might have to be reenforced if it is to be reauthorized77 g21g158g150g150g138g155g162g561 section 6001 amends the fisa definition of agent of foreign power to include foreign national who is preparing for or engaging in inte rnational terrorism thereby excusing the need to show that the illicit activity is being conducted at the behest or benefit of foreign poweras long as the target is not an american not us person although justice department believes the section is constitutional there might be some question of whether defining an agent of foreign power as one who need not be an agent of foreign power comes within keith reservations for agents of foreign power 75 we have not addressed and express opinion as to the issues which may be involved with respect

explanation of the justice departments view of the constitutionality of s 2586 77 srept 10840 at 112 additional views of sens leahy and feingold in many ways s 113 seems to be legislative change in search of rationale first we were told that this amendment to fisa would have allowed the fbi to obtain warrant before 911 to search the computer and belongings of zacarias moussaoui then after it became clear that the fbi had all the evidence it needed to procure such warrant the rationale changed next we were told that the bill was necessary to conduct surveillance of lone wolf terrorists who purportedly operate in isolation next after it became clear that few if any international rrorists work alone and that existing criminal tools such as title iii were sufficient to handle those rare cases we were told that the measure was necessary because it was hard to prove the connection between terrorists now in this report the implication is revived that the fbis pre911 failures were due in large part to problems with the law it app ears however that the search for rationale to support this billand one that can be put forth without meaningful ov ersight of fisas actual implementationcontinues in full force when the sunset on this measure arrives we will need stronger rationales than this to justify its extension
