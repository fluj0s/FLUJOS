united nations nations unies office of internal oversight services internal audit division ii audit of unep secretariat to the convention on biological diversity aa200622003 executive summary between february and march 2006 oios conducted an audit of the unep secretariat to the convention on biological diversity scbd in m ontreal canada whose budget for the biennium 20042005 was us28 million oios was pleased to note that all the recommendations of the previous audit conducted in 2000 aa2000129 had been satisfactorily implemented and have been closed this audit confirmed that scbd is committed to maintaining strong internal control environment oios would like to commend scbd for the open approach it adopted to work with the audit team and for the prompt action taken in addressing the recommendations raised in the areas discussed below governance there appeared to be adequate governance mechanis ms for overseeing the work of the scbd and the protocol on biosafety to further strengthen current mechanisms scbd should establish procedures for the accreditation of non governmental organisati ons and follow up more strictly on the receipt of credentials signed by heads of state and governments for government delegates host country agreement oios was pleased to note that reimbursable ta xes totalling approximately us240000 due from the provincial government at the time of the last udit had been received and scbd was longer encountering difficulties in claiming back taxe s from federal and provincial government organisational structure and functions the current organizational structure dates back to the development phase of scbd which was primarily focussed on servicing meetings scbd is now entering the implementation phase and oios is of the opinion that the current structure may not be capable of sustaining the current meeting schedule plus additional monitoring activities that will be required as part of the implementation phase oios is also concerned that unep has still not sent statement of delegated authority to the unep administered conventions rental agreement scbds right to rentfree accommodation expired in 2001 oios is of the view that scbd should approach the canadian government and the state of quebec to see if they would be willing to house cbd rent free to enable scbd to use the current rental of approximately us775000 per annum for delivery of its mandate conference services scbd sought and was granted by cop 5 in 2000 approval to establish conferences services section costing approximately us500000 per annum at the time of the audit the need for specialist function dealing with organising meeting has been tablished but review of whether this function should be outsourced or pplemented b external assistance needs to be undertaken to establish the cost effectiveness of having conference services section in house human resources management arrangements for human resources management could be strengthened by seeking unon and unep assistance with accelerating the recruitment proce ss and creating policies on training overtime and travel of participants financial management oios was very pleased to note that controls over financial management were adequate these could be strengthened further by the formulation of f unding strategy that targets other member states instead of traditional donors only and start paying all staff salaries through electronic funds transfer security and safety to enhance security of both staff and property scbd should request assistance from unon security in liaising with icao and discussing and agreeing their responsibilities towards scbd as the lead agency for security in montreal scbd should also issue individual identification cards to all staff members and

secretariat is headed by an executive secretary at the asg level and is supported by 42 professional and 29 general service sta ff the budget for the biennium 20042005 was approximately us28 million the parties to the convention have established trust funds to meet the costs of administering scbd includi ng the costs of the secretariat collected contributions for 2005 amounted to approximately us16 million 4 oios previously reviewed the scbd in 2000 aa2000129 the findings and recommendations were reviewed as part of this audit and any issues which were still open are discussed further in the body of the report while those which were closed were followed up to ensure there were changes draft of the report was shared with mr ahmed djoghlaf executive secretary of the secretariat on biol ogical diversity in march 2006 whose comments which were received in april 2006 are reflected in th attached final report in italics oios is pleased to note that action has been initiated to address all recommendations raised ii audit objectives 5 the overall objective of the audit was to advise the executive secretary scbd on the adequacy of arrangements for the administration of scbd activities this included assessing whether the governance framework provide d scbd adequate guidance and support for the definition and execution of its responsibilities b whether scbd management had established adequate mechanisms to ensure that it understood and was only executing activities in support of its mandate and c whether internal control systems for administering the convention were adequate and were operated in compliance with united nations regulations and rules page 2 iii audit scope and methodology 6 the audit focussed on the adequacy of overa ll arrangements for administration of scbd the audit covered activities for the bienni um 20042005 with total expenditure of approximately us28 million it included review and assessmen t of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records 7 oios also followed up on the implementation of the recommendations raised in the previous audit referred to above iv audit findings and recommendations governance secretariat to the convention on biological diversity scbd 8 there appeared to be an adequate governan ce structure in place for overseeing the work of the scbd comprising conferen ce of parties cop and subsidiary body on scientific technical and technological advice sbstta mechanism was in place for the implementation monitoring and followup of cop decisions all decisions were numbered and quarterly status report was produced which was posted on the scbd website the social economic and legal affairs division of scbd collated all decisions implemented and presented them to the cop for decision to retir them the reporting mechanism roles and responsibilities were defined b cartagena protocol on biosafety 9 protocol on biosafety was signed in 2000 which has its own governing body referred to as the conference of parties serving as the meeti ng of the parties to the protocol copmop the relationship between scbd cop and cop mop was described in an information note given to the intergovernmental committee for the cartagena protocol on biosafety in 2001 this makes clear that the scbd cop is the pa rent body and the copmop is part of and not separate from the convention c secretariat 10 the secretariat established to serve the convention on biological diversity was also established to serve as the secretariat to the pr otocol the protocol states that copmop will pay for distinct costs related to its administ ration scbd with the agreement of the scbd cop have interpreted this to mean that ther are posts whose costs cannot be shared because they are paid out of the common pool into which both the protocol and the convention pay these are the posts funded by programme support costs there are other posts such as the legal officer where the activity can be share d and oios was pleased to note that time recording exercise was implemented to establish an initial split of 85 percent of their time being charged to scbd oios was very pleased to note scbd is continuing to use the time recording system and has experimented with expanding the system to all staff page 3 d credentials and accreditations 11 scbd has not been following the rules of proce dures for the presentation of credentials for nongovernmental organisations for the confer ences and meetings similarly scbd has not been following up on the receipt of credentials signed by heads of state and governments for government delegates recommendation to ensure that the work of the convention is not compromised the secretariat to the convention on bi ological diversity should establish procedures for the accreditation of n on governmental organisations and follow up more strictly on the receipt of credentials for government delegates rec 01 12 scbd commented that it accepted the r ecommendation and it would ensure strict implementation of the rules of procedure regar ding credentials and will s ubmit to the parties for review draft policy for accreditation of ngos to cbd meetings oios thanks scbd and will close the recommendation upon receipt of th draft policy for accreditation of ngos to cbd meetings b mandatemission 13 the mandate and mission of the convention on biological diversity and the protocol were set out in section one and two of the 2005 ve rsion of handbook of the convention on biological diversity oios was especially pleased to note that the handbook of the convention on biological described mechanism to update the mandate and mission in response to changes in activities c host country agreement local taxes 14 oios was pleased to note that an amount of approximately us240000 which was identified as due from the provincial government at the time of the last audit had been received and scbd was longer encountering difficulties in claiming back taxes from federal and provincial governments further action is proposed beyond recording this saving in the next oios annual report b supplementary agreement with the provincial government of quebec 15 oios was pleased to note that the suppl ementary agreement with the provincial government of quebec which was not signed at th time of our last audit was signed in march 2001 and was in line with the 1946 convention on privileges and immunities d organisational structure and functions delegation of authority 16 prior oios audits found that there was clear statement of delegated authority from unep to its outposted offices including unep administered conventions in respect of administration of programme personnel and other resources and activities unep informed page 4 oios in 2000 that it was drafting document dealing with delegated authority oios was very concerned to note that at the time of this audit statement had yet been issued in respect of delegated authority for administrative activities to unep offices away from nairobi headquarters b roles and responsibilities 17 the roles and responsibilities of each part of the organisational structure of the convention and the protocol were defined in each budget doc ument and made available on the website for public access the roles and responsibilities were approved by the scbd executive secretary and involved consultations with the unep headquarters oios is of the opinion that the information should be extracted from the budget doc ument and placed on the intranet as an easy reference for staff and other interested parties recommendation to ensure that secretariat to th convention on biological diversity scbd and other interested parties ar aware of the roles and responsibilities of the various scbd divisions scbd s hould ensure that after the approval of each budget document the information relating to roles and responsibilities is placed on the intranet rec 02 18 scbd commented that it accepted the recommendation and would implement it during 2006 oios thanks scbd and will close the r ecommendation upon notification that roles and responsibilities of the various scbd divisions have been placed on the intranet c reporting lines 19 the reporting lines of the convention and th protocol were clearly set out in the organigram shown in the quarterly report to the scbd cop which is posted on the website as with the roles and responsibilities oios is of th opinion that such information should also be posted on the intranet for ease of access th is is covered by recommendation 02 above and further action is proposed d structure 20 the current structure dates back to the velopment phase of scbd which was primarily focused on servicing meetings oios noted that scbd was currently servicing over 50 meetings per biennium which was absorbing th available resources scbd is now entering the implementation phase and oios is of the opinion that the current structure may not be capable of sustaining the current meeting schedul plus additional monitoring activities that will be required as part of the implementati on phase scbd management responded that the parties are aware of the need to adjust the cbd to the new phase and convened an open ended working group on the review of the implementation of the convention which was held in september 2005 in montreal the eighth cop in reviewing the report decided to convene the second meeting of the working group before cop 9 to be held in germany in 2008 the secretariat will prepare set of documents to assist the working group to fulfil its mandate in addition three budget documents were submitted by the secretariat to cop 8 clearly articulating and costing the transition from the development to the implementation phase the cop in its decision viii3133 inter alia authorizes the executive secretary to review the terms of reference of posts in the secretariat with view to adjusting the staffing to meet the new page 5 challenges facing the convention and to ensure the effective functioning of the secretariat report on this issue will be submitted to cop 9 in the report on the administration of the convention for 20072008 biennium oios thanks scbd and recommendation will therefore be raised memorandum of understanding agreements and contracts with other organisations 21 scbd did not have list of the memora ndum of understanding mous that had been entered into or were in force at the time of the audit there was documentation explaining when and in what circumstances mous should be raised and as consequence oios noted that mous were being raised for such things as the organisation of conference in addition the mous that were being raised were not being passed through the legal officer recommendation to ensure the secretariat to the convention on biological diversity scbd has clear understanding of when to use memorandums of understanding mous and to ensure that there are mechanisms to ensure that mous are complied with scbd s hould seek advice from unon and unep in the creation of document dealing w ith the creation and implementation of mous and related types of agreements rec 03 22 scbd commented that it accepted the recommendation and would implement it during 2006 oios thanks scbd and will close the recommendation upon receipt of document dealing with the creation and implementation of mous and related types of notification that roles and responsibilities of the various scbd divisions have been placed on the agreements f provision of services to scbd rental agreement 23 at the time of the last audit scbd recei ved free accommodation inclusive of such things as rent cleaning maintenance security ga rdening landscaping and waste collection this arrangement expired in 2001 and as the landlord was reluctant to renew the rental agreement rent free scbd sought and was given cop approval to pay rent of approximately us775000 per annum 2002 up to the time of the udit oios found evidence that scbd had made efforts to find cheaper accommodation within montreal however there was evidence that they had approached the canadian government or the state of quebec to see if they would be willing to house scbd rent free nd if not whether other partners in the public and private sectors could be approached for rent free accommodation oios was also concerned that the rent was being paid one month in advance which is not in accordance with financial regulations and rules 10519 recommendation since all financial incentives made on behalf of the host government have been subsequently renewed except for the rental of office space secretariat for the convention on biological diversity s hould see if rent free status can be reinstated or alternatively approach ot her partners in the public and private sectors for rent free accommodation rec 04 page 6 24 scbd commented that it accepted the recommendation and would implement it during 2006 oios thanks scbd and will close the r ecommendation upon notification that rentfree status has been reinstated b offer of gratis personnel 25 the canadian government offered scbd ans of services valued at us150000 per year for five years in the form of loan of professiona l services of neutral ch aracter in the field of management or administrative support the posts for this purpose were created but not filled as the loan would have resulted in gratis type ii personnel the action taken by the secretariat not to utilize this loan is commendable as it w ould have been against the regulations and rules stai19996 gratis personnel c service level agreement 26 unon recently signed service level agr eement with unep governing timeframes and milestones for delivery of services scbd had not been aware of the service level agreement and whether it would apply to services delivered to scbd and the protocol recommendation to ensure that secretariat to th convention on biological diversity scbd has mechanism to hold unon accountable for services provided scbd should clarify with unep whethe r the service level agreement signed with unon applies to the conventions nd if not should seek assistance from unep in putting an agreement in place which covers the unep conventions operating in montreal rec 05 27 scbd commented that as the host of the scbd unep should ensure that the service level agreement signed with unon should also cover the unep administered conventions including cbd it is suggested that the recommendation be redrafted accordingly oios thanks scbd for its clarification but considers that it is the responsibility of scbd to first discuss with unep whether the existing unep service level agreemen t should cover scbd or whether separate agreement is required the recommendation will be closed upon notificati on of the outcome of discussions with unep and the actions consequently undertaken to improve accountability of unon for services provided to scbd d conference services 28 scbd sought and was granted approval to blish conferences services section at the cop 5 in 2000 currently costing approxima tely us500000 per annum this was in recognition of the high number of meetings whic h were organised and planned per biennium which could exceed 50 in number the need for specialist function dealing with organising meeting has been established but review of whether this facility should be outsourced or supplemented by external assistance has never been undertaken recommendation to ensure that secretariat to th convention on biological diversity scbd is able to deliver and effectiv ely service meetings scbd should hire page 7 conferences services specialist to advi on the optimal resources required to meet the needs of scbd and the balan ce between inhouse and use of external resources rec 06 29 scbd commented that it accepted the recomme ndation and would request unon to hire consultant to undertake the review in 2006 oios thanks scbd and will close the recommendation upon receipt of copy of the c onsultants report on the optimal resources required to meet the conference service needs of scbd and the balance between inhouse and use of external resources g work programme 30 the planning process is known and understood by all involved in the preparation of the work programme but the process has never been formally documented given that scbd is moving from the development to the implem entation phase which might require re examination of elements of the planning pro cess oios is of the opinion that formally documenting the process would be of value recommendation to improve the effectiveness and tran sparency of the planning process for the creation of the work programme secretariat to the convention on biological diversity should develop framework document to make staff aware of the elements and their respective roles and responsibilities in the planning process rec 07 31 scbd commented that it accepted the recommendation and would implement it during 2006 oios thanks scbd and will close the recommendation upon receipt of framework document on the planning process h human resources management staffing table 32 scbd records showed 31 professional and 26 general service staff whilst unon records showed 42 professional and 36 general service sta ff the cause of the discrepancy was that scbd was not regularly receiving the sta ffing table information maintained by unon recommendation to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the secretariat to the convention on biological diversity scbd staffing table scbd should liaise with unep and unon hrms to put in pl ace procedures to facilitate flow of information between the three offices fficient to ensure that all three have an accurate and complete copy of scbd staffing table rec 08 33 scbd commented that it accepted the recommendation and would implement it during 2006 oios thanks scbd and will close the reco mmendation once procedures are put in place to facilitate flow of information between unep scbd and unon hrms in connection with the staffing table page 8 b programme support cost staff 34 scbd paid us3million in programme s upport costs psc for the biennium 20042005 and in return received four prof essional and six general service posts at cost of approximately us12million oios is of the opinion that ther may be scope for scbd to explore with unon the possibility of using some of the psc fo r covering other overheads such as training this is addressed in recommendation 11 and further action is proposed c fellowship programme 35 oios noted that scbd has established fellowship programme for scholars from developing country parties to gain knowledge in th area of biodiversity at an approximate cost of us15000 per fellow the programme is funded by the member states as part of the core budget the fellows are paid travel costs and stipend from the core budget the current arrangements seem to be form of internship programme which would mean that payment could not be made from the core budget to cover their costs recommendation to ensure compliance with applicable ited nations regulations and rules the secretariat to the convention on biological diversity scbd should seek guidance from unon on the establishment and operation of its fellowship programme rec 09 36 scbd commented that it accepted the recommendation and would implement it during 2006 oios thanks scbd and will close the r ecommendation upon notification that guidance has been sought from unon on the establishment and operation of the fellowship programme d job descriptionsclassification 37 scbd currently operates system of review ing and updating job descriptions when jobs are readvertised or new functions are form ed consequently oios found up to date job descriptions for the staff of the protocol and fo r recently formed sections such as conference services section oios took sample of the rema ining job descriptions and noted that they had not been reviewed since 1997 though scbd admitted that job descriptions for some of these staff might have changed scbd has taken action on this point in discussion with the cop as outlined in paragraph 20 above and additional recommendation is raised recruitment 38 fifteen staff were hired in 2004 and 2005 oios reviewed two cases and was satisfied that the recruitments had been carried out in accordance with stai20024 and unepcbdcop424 f vacancy rate 39 at the time of the audit oios noticed 27 percent vacancy rate which included 21 posts one of which was initiated in 2003 scbd attribut this to problems with the galaxy system but there was analysis to show where within the galaxy process the problems had occurred page 9 recommendation to assist in improving the recruitm ent process secretariat to the convention on biological diversity scbd in consultation with unep and unon should undertake review of wh ere the recruitment problems are occurring and prepare report for cons ideration by scbd executive secretary and unon director division of administ rative services outlining the actions which can be taken to improve the recruitment situation rec 10 40 scbd commented that the executive secretar has already requested that the chief of recruitment of unon visit montreal to consid er ways and means to expedite the recruitment process meeting between the executive secret ary and the oic of unep was held in nairobi on 13 april 2006 on this issue instead of reques ting report the auditors may wish to call on heads of unep and unon to review the reasons behind such delay with view of filling all the vacant posts as soon as possible oios thanks scbd for the prompt action taken whilst it appreciates that the immediate need of scbd is to fill vacancies oios believes it is important for unep and unon to discuss and establish the causes of the problems and how they can be prevented in the future this may identify problems that are common to more than one convention oios therefore believes that th report must be produced and will close the recommendation upon receipt of copy of report an alysing the causes of the problem and the actions taken to prevent recurrence g scbd training 41 oios was pleased to note that traini ng needs assessment was undertaken in 2002 which resulted in staff development plan and whic h covered the united nations competencies at the time of the audit costed action plan to implement the training identified was still under development and the plan did not address the number of days training per year staff could expect to receive it also excluded basic tr aining in the applicability of united nations regulations and rules to the convention recommendation secretariat to the convention on biological diversity should with assistance from unon and unep creat training policy which includes how training needs will be identified how much training staff should receive year how the training should be funde d including the possibility of using programme support costs rec 11 42 scbd commented that it would request unon to assist in preparing such training policy to be funded under the programme support co sts as the budget adopted by cop8 for 2007 2008 makes financial provisions for such training requirement oios thanks scbd and will close the recommendation upon receipt of c opy of the training policy detailing how the training will be funded h epas 43 oios noted that there appeared to be satis factory arrangements in place to ensure that performance appraisals were carried out in accordance with stai200203 performance appraisal system and as such recommendation is raised page 10 i leave 44 as per the prior audit oios was pleased to note that scbd appeared to have satisfactory system in place with respect to leave and as such recommendation is raised j compensatory time off cto and overtime 45 from 2001 to 2005 approximately 30 scbd pr ofessional staff members were granted cto whilst this practice is in conformity with the staff rules of the lead agency icao there was evidence that the system scbd practiced was conducted in accordance with these staff rules and there was evidence of consultati on with the other unep convention in montreal to ensure that practices were harmonised as such oios was pleased to note that the practice was suspended in january 2006 46 the absence of procedures and policies on over time also extended to general service staff suggesting to oios the need for general review of this area recommendation to ensure the procedures on compensatory time off and overtime are transparent and in line with unep practices and those of other united nations agencies in montreal secretariat to the convention on biological diversity should create its own procedures in consultations with unon and unep which should be placed on the intranet rec 12 47 scbd commented that it accepted the recommendation and would implement it during 2006 oios thanks scbd and will close the r ecommendation upon receipt of copy of the procedures on compensatory time off and overtime k private use of telephone fax and dhl 48 oios was pleased to note that since the previ ous audit scbd had established an adequate system to track and recover expenditures arising from private use of telephones fax and courier which appeared to be working effectively l consultants and individual contractors 49 for the period 20042005 scbd entered in to around 300 consultant contracts and contracts for individual contractors agreemen ts at cost of approximately us15 million oios reviewed ten percent of these contracts nd noted lack of documentary evidence on file to support compliance with the stai19997 such as terms of reference not always present on the file in addition oios found two examples were scbd utilised consultancy contracts to hire the services of company instead of an individual and one instance where scbd did not use an allinclusive fee when entering into agreements with an individual contractor recommendation to ensure compliance with stai19997 is documented the secretariat for the convention on biological diversity should ensure evidence is available on file to support that people are hired in accordance with the stai and that page 11 checklist is developed to ensure that ll its conditions are complied with rec 13 50 scbd commented that it accepted the recommendation and would implement it during 2006 oios thanks scbd and will close the r ecommendation upon receipt of copy of the procedures outlining the documentation that shoul d be kept on file and who has responsibility for ensuring the completeness and accuracy of the files m travel policy 51 at the time of the audit scbd had trav policy based on the cop decision iii24 which stated that travel of participants from deve loping countries in particular least developed countries and smallisland developing states will be funded scbd policy was to fund one participant and it was the responsibility of the nati onal focal point of the member state to select the candidate however oios is concerned th at this policy has not been translated into procedures to implement this policy in partic ular how decision is made between countries when limited funding is available scbd commented that the conference of the parties in its decision viii3121 requests the executive secret ary with guidance from the bureau of the conference of the parties to develop as an interim arrangement for the 20072008 biennium pending endorsement by the conference of the parties at its ninth meeting procedures for the allocation of funding from the special voluntar trust fund bz for facilitating participation of parties in the convention process to developing countries in particular the least developed countries and small island developing states as we ll as parties with economies in transition to secure adequate representation from each re gion the secretariat will fulfil this audit recommendation through the implementation of this cop decision oios thanks scbd for this additional information in light of which further action is proposed i financial management unpaid pledges 52 oios followed up on the recommendation rais ed its prior audit aa200012903 and confirmed that there appeared to be adequa arrangements in place to follow up on unpaid pledges reminders were sent twice or three times year to member states and there was good liaison between scbd and unon bfms who are responsible for the followup the recommendation is closed and oios proposes further action b strategy for collecting voluntary contributions 53 scbd was asked aa200012904 to deve lop strategy for collecting the amounts pledged for the general trust fund for additional voluntary contributions in support of approved activities under the convention on biological diversity and the general trust fund for voluntary contributions to facilitate the participation of parties in the convention on biological diversity and to consider the staff resources required to execute the strategy the scbd strategy has been to target the 27 core contributors out of the potential 188 cop members and there has been limited consideration of the scope for charging for such things as publications which at the time of audit were free the existing recommendation is closed and replaced by new one page 12 recommendation to ensure that adequate funds are sourced for the voluntary contributions for additional activities such as conferences and to facilitate developing country participation in the meetings of the convention secretariat to the convention on biological diversity should formulate

biological diversity be as at decembe r 2004 showed the account receivable to be approximately us214000 while the records held by scbd showed approximately us721000 oios concluded that this was due to the absence of policies detailing the cut off point at which contributions s hould be written off oios was of the opinion that there was scope for general review of accounting policies in ge neral dealing with such as issues as receipt of miscellaneous income and whether such funds could be retained by scbd given its status as an organisation under the umbrella of the united nations recommendation to facilitate accurate and consistent treatment and reporting of financial information in accordance with united nations accounting policies and united nations financial regulations and rules the secretariat for the convention on biological diversity in consultati on with unon and unep should undertake review of the practices for treatment and recording of financial information which

required by the procurement manual after an initial competitive bidding exercise to select the companies scbd practice has been to hire the same company on the basis of price check that they remained competitive in respect to other companies this process whilst it is efficient is not in accordance with the procurement manual that encourages the use of competitive selection process section 94 of the procurement manual sets the criteria and recommends that competitive bid or request for quotation be done whenever procurement actions are being initiated alternatively scbd should consider entering into systems contract if it is determined based on previous experience and project needs that the deliverables to be procured are required on recurring basis for an extended period of time recommendation to ensure that services obtained by secretariat to the convention on biological diversity scbd are subject to competitive bidding in accordance with the procurement manual scbd should
