federal energy regulatory commission final rule order number 679 promoting transmission investment through pricing reform july 20 2006 docket number rm064 000 15 on october 3 2001 the us supreme court heard arguments in case new york et v federal energy regulatory commission that challenged fercs authority to regulate transmission for retail sales if utility unbundles transmission from other retail charges in states that have opened their generation market to competition unbundling occurs when customers are charged separately for generati on transmission and distri bution nine states led by new york filed suit arguing that the federal power act gives ferc jurisdiction over wholesale sales and interstate transmissi on and leaves all retail issues up to the state utility commissions enron in an amicus brie f argued that ferc clearly has jurisdiction over all transmission and ferc is obligat ed to prevent transmission owners from discriminating against those wishing to use the transmission lines on march 4 2002 the us supreme court ruled in favor of ferc and held that ferc has jurisdiction over transmission including unbundl ed retail transactions 16 transmission lines generally carry bulkpower transfers between utilities and move power to load centers distribution lines move pow er to ultimate customers subtransmission is sometimes considered transmission and other times considered distribution for regulatory continuedtransmission pricing was also addre ssed in epact05 1241 to encourage investment in transmission ferc issued order 679 on this issue promoting transmission investment through pricing reform on july 20 200614 the order identifies specific incentives that ferc will allow but the burden remains on an applicant to justify the incentives historical context there are three components to electric power delivery generation transmission and distribution transmission by its nature is generally considered an interstate transaction whereas distri bution is considered intrastate state public utility commissions regulate the siting of all tran smission and distribution lines within each states borders as well as distribution charges and retail electric rates in states that have not restructured the sy stem operates as it has since enactment of the federal power act with retail consumers paying one price that includes transmission distribution and generation this is referred to as bundled transaction in states that have restructured consumers are b illed for separate tran smission distribution and generation charges this is referred to as unbundled electricity service ferc regulates all transmission includi ng unbundled retail transactions15 generators of electricity need to move their power to their ultimate customers

exceed the maximum shortcircuits radio interference and noise may occur low voltages are also problem and can cause customers equipment to malfunction and can damage motors system operating constraints refer to reliability and security maintaining synchronization among generators on the system and preventing the collapse of voltages are major aspects of the role for transmission operators23 north american electric reliability council guidelines require utilities to be able to handle any single outage through redundancy in the system when practical nerc recommends the ability to handle multiple outages within system reducing the constraints on the system through technology improvements is one way to increase the transfer capability over existing lines24 the regulatory regime has shifted the operations of the electric utility industry creating larger and more fre quent bulk power transfers across transmission system designed largely for local intrastate service however investment and infrastructure have not kept up with increases in the bulk power transfers nd electricity demand between 1978 and 1998 electricity demand had been growing at an average rate of 28 per year25 transmission capacity expressed in relation to electricity demand increased by 35 per year between 1978 and 1982 and then declined by 12 per year between 1982 and 199826 actual annual transmissi on investment had declined from nearly 5 billion in 1975 to about 225 billion in 199827 reversing this trend between 1999 and 2005 transmission investme nt increased at 12 annual rate28 however during the same period to tal circuit miles of 230 kv and above transmission lines owned nd operated by investorowned utilities increased by 08 annually29 this long period of insufficient transmission investment has led to transmission lines that are congested in several regions of united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33875crs10 30 capacity margin is the amount of unused available ca

crs noted that bulk power transmission lines in many parts of the country were ready operating at or near capacity and the chief capacityrelated barrier to bulkpower transfers wheeling was that the transmission system was not built for bulkpower transfers33 according to nerc the number of requests to use the transmission system that were denied because of congestion transmission line relief tlrs

recent years is the problems encountered when siting them siting and building transmission lines have been very difficult because of citiz opposition as well as inconsistent siting requirements among states even though the transmission of electricity is considered interstate commerce the sitin g of transmission lines has been the responsibility of the states in addition several federal agencies

energy is required to certify congestion on the transmission lines but epact05 does not specifically define congestion the first congestion study was completed in august 200645 as result of this study the secretary may designate any geographic area experiencing electric energy transmission capacity constraints or congestion that adversely affects consumers as national interest electric transmission corridor ferc may issue permits for construction of transmission lines to transmission owners within national interest transmission corridor if ferc finds that state does not have the authority to approve the siting of the f acilities or that state commission that has authority to approve the siting of facilitie s has withheld its approval for more than one year permit holders are able to petition in us district court to acquire rights ofway for the construction of transmission lines through the exercise of the right of eminent domain46 on april 26 2007 doe issued two dr aft national inte rest electric transmission corridor designations draft report one stretching from the mid atlantic region through new york nd the other in southern california47 epact05 created new federal power ac t 216a2 which states that after considering alternatives and recommendations from interested parties including an opportunity for comment from ffected states the secretary shall issue report based on the study which may designate any geographic area experiencing electric energy transmission capacity constraints or congestion that adversely affects consumers as nationa l interest electric transmission corridor doe broadly defines the term constraint s that adversely affects consumers to include not only constraints that cause pe rsistent congestion but also constraints that hinder the development or delivery of generation source that is in the public interest which allows for national corri dor designation when there is constraint that adversely affects c onsumers even though there is present congestion48 doe did not consider alternatives to new transmission such as conservation or efficiency improvements in existing lines in identifying national corridors doe received comments

corridor49 doe argues that nothing in 216 of the federal power act requires that the doe demonstrate that transmission is the best or most costeffectiv solution to congestion problem50 in its final order doe concluded that consideration of nontransmission soluti ons to the congestion problems facing the midatlantic critical congestion ar ea is neither required nor necessary as precondition to designating the mid atlantic area national corridor fpa section 2 16a2 calls for the secretary to consider alternatives and recommendations from interested parties before making national corridor designation the statute however does not specify what the term alternatives refers to numerous commenters would have us to interpret the phrase to mean alternative solutions to congestion or constraint problems which would then necessitate comparison of nontransm ission solutions against transmission solutions nothing in the language of fpa section 216 requires or suggest such an interpretation51 another controversial aspect of the national corridor designation is their geographic boundaries epact05 did not fine the term corridor and doe has concluded that while there may be

facilities underground november 2003many transmission systems could increase the capacity of the transmission system with technology improvements while many new technologies would require significant capital investment one study by the new york independent system operator concluded that relatively inexpensive equipment upgrades could significantly increase the line ratings and could reduce congestion56 the study indicated that significant number of transmission lines operate below their thermal limits because of equipment limitations at substations by remediating those limitations with relatively inexpensive quipment eg disconnect switches bus connectors relays according to the new york study operation at thermal capacities could be reached with little or risk of service interruption other technological improvements to in crease transmission capacity and allow the transmission system to be opera ted more efficiently include upgrading transformers retrofitting electromechanical devices with digital devices to allow operation of the system closer to thermal limits and restringing existing towers with aluminum conductor composite core cable these would require significant capital investment burying power lines many reasons have been given for burying power lines including reduced maintenance less susceptibility to weathe r damage fewer traffic accidents involving poles improved aesthetics and increased property values the primary reason against burying power lines is the high co st design and inst allation of underground systems is more complex and expensive and takes longer than for overhead systems in addition the cost and time involved to modi fy or repair an existing system is also reportedly higher57 the overwhelming damage to

conclusion for the transmission system to operate efficiently and reliably many observers argue that the tensions between economic regulatory and technology issues must be balanced currently the transmission industr is widely viewed as being in state of disequilibrium with significant regula tory and economic uncertainty in addition regional differences complicate regulato ry solutions large component of regulatory uncertainty originates with piecemeal appro ach to electric utility restructuring on both the federal and st ate level in 1991 crs stated that comprehensive regulatory reform of the electric power industry is neither desirable nor practical without clearer vision of what form the industry should take too many uncertainties leave the future nature of the electric power industry such that major overhaul of regulation would involve significant risks to the present stability of available and reliable electric power with little guarantee of improved service or lower costs89 the energy policy act of 1992 introduced competition to wholesale electric transactions without provisions for comprehensive plan to address reliability issues and the development of effici ent wholesale markets in addition many states have passed legislation or issued regulatory orders to introduce retail competition each with its own set of rules for utilities to follow provisions in epact05 are intended to address many issues left outstanding by epact92 although regulatory certainty may improve as result of epact05 clear er vision of the role of competition in the electric power industry and additional investment in transmission infrastructure and technology continues to be necessa ry to support an adequate and reliable transmission system
