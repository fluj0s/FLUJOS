pursuant to s ection 503 the pension and welfare benefits administration has identified when plans review procedures shall be deemed reasonable4 in general plan must meet specified timing requirements when making initial coverage determinations and when reviewing adverse coverage determinations preservice claims that is claims for bene fits that require appr oval prior to obtaining medical care must be distinguished from postservice claims or those that seek reimbursement for services rendered the manner in which plan participants are notified of benefit determinati ons as well as the content of such notifications are also defined by the regulations although the regulations do not provide fo r the availability of external review following the internal review of adverse c overage determinations they do allow group health plan to maintain two levels of mandatory review for such determinations5 many private health plans including aetna us healthcare and pacificare health systems have announced that they will voluntarily provide access to external review when care is denied6 thus participants in such plans will have to exhaust both levels of review before they may seek relief under erisa s civil enforcement provisions interpretive guidance on the relationship between the regulations and state external review requirements is also included in the regulations section 25605031k2i states state law regulating insurance shall not be considered to prevent the application of requirement of this section merely because such state law establishes review procedure to ev aluate and resolve disputes involving adverse benefit determina tions under group health plans so long as the review procedure is conducted by person or entity other than the insurer the plan plan fiduciaries the employer or an employee or agent of any of the foregoing however the regulations state that external review albeit mandated by state law is not part of the full and fair review required by section 503 of erisa7 thus the regulations indicate that participants do not have to exhaust such state law procedures before they may bring suit under the ci vil enforcement provisions of erisa8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20845crs3 9 29 usc 1144 for additional discussion of erisas preemption provisions see crs report 98286 erisas impact on medical malpractice and negligence claims against

review language accompanying the liability continuedpreemption and corporate health insurance v texas department of insurance section 514a of erisa expressly pr eempts any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan 9 the us supreme court has interpreted this language as applying to any state law that has connection with or reference to such plan10 the court has also stated that under this broad common sense meaning state law may relate to benefit plan and thereby be pre empted even if the law is not specifically designed to affect such plans or the effect is only indirect11 state law that relates to an erisa plan may avoid preemption if it regulates insurance within the meaning of erisas s aving clause section 514b2a qualifies section 514a by excepting from preemption any law of any state which regulates insurance banking or securities12 however an additional cl ause serves as an exception to erisas saving clause section 514b2b erisas deemer clause indicates that state law that purports to regulate insurance cannot deem an employee benefit plan to be an insurance company for purposes of regulation13 interest in erisas preemptive effect on state patient protection statutes has increased steadily since aetna first indicated that it would challenge texas health care liability act the act senate bill 286 became effective on may 22 1997 aetna promptly challenged it on the grounds that it was preempted by section 514a of erisa the act sought to regulate managed care in three ways first it provided statutory cause of action against managed care entities that failed to meet an ordinary care standard when making healthcare treatment decisi ons second it estab lished an independent review procedure to determin whether treatment is appropr iate and medically necessary third it protected physicians from hmoimposed indemnity clauses and from retaliation by hmos for advocating medically necessary care for their patients the fifth circuit concluded that the liability antiindemn ification and anti retaliation provisions of the act were not preempted by erisa14 however the fifth circuit found that the independe nt review provisions were pr eempted the fifth circuit maintained that because the independent review provisions attempt to impose state administrative regime on coverage determinations they are preempted by erisa15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20845crs4 15 continued provisions and making review voluntary on the entitys part were not preempted 16 corporate health insurance 215 f3d at 538 17

idwhile the court conceded that the independent review provisions di d regulate insurance in the manner contemplated by erisas savi ng clause it found that the provisions are preempted because they conflict with substantive provision of erisa16 following the supreme courts determin ation that the saving clause must be interpreted in light of the legislative intent concerning erisas civ il enforcement provisions the fifth circuit recognized that erisas enforcement scheme preempts not only directly conflicting remedial schemes but also s upplemental state law remedies17 in this case the independent review provisions created an alternative reme dy for obtaining benefits because plan would be bound by the decisi on of the independent review organization participant could obtain be nefit even if he did not follow erisas civil enforcement procedures moran v rush prudential hmo in moran v rush prudential hmo the seventh circuit conclude d that an illinois external revi ew statute did not conflict with erisas civil enforcement scheme and was sa ved from preemption by erisa like the fifth circuit the court determined that the statute related to an employee benefit plan the court also found that the statute regula ted insurance and thus was protected by erisas saving clause further the court maintained that erisas deemer clause was not applicable because the plan at issue was an insured plan that is offered by an hmo and not selffunded by an employer18 the court relied on the supreme courts interpretation of the deemer clause in fmc corp v holliday 19 in that case the court found that the deemer clause m akes clear that if plan is insured state may regulate it indirectly through regulation of its insurer and its insurers insurance contracts20 in this case the plan was offered by rush prudential hmo unlike the fifth circuit the seventh circ uit found that the illinois external review statute does not create an alte rnative remedy scheme that conflicts with section 502a of erisa21 although the statute requires an hm to provide covered service if an independent reviewing physician determines that the service is medically necessary the court found that the procedure created by th statute is not ta ntamount to the relief offered under section 502a22 the court explained that because the provisions of the statute were incorporated into the plaintiffs insurance cont ract they did not operate as an alternative remedy for recovering bene fits rather the provisions established an additional internal mechanism for making d ecisions about when service is medically necessary the court appears to have distinguished external review that becomes parthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20845crs5 23 in its opinion the supreme court acknowledged th at it granted certiorari to resolve the conflict between the fifth and seventh circuits while this opinion does not directly address the fifth circuits opinion regarding preemption of the xas statute it is likely that the independent review provisions of the texas statute will be re cognized as permissible in light of this opinion 24 the mccarranferguson act requires that the business of insurance be subject to state regulation the statute provides with certain exceptions that act of congress shall be construed to invalidate any law enacted by any state for the purpose of regulating the business of

the supreme court affirmed the judgement of the seventh circuit23 the court determined that section 410 of the illinois statute was regulation of the business of insurance and thus saved from preemption pursuant to erisas savings clause and the mccarranferguson act24 the court reviewed section 410 against multifactor test used to determine whether state law regulates the business of insurance25 under the multifactor test the court first asked whether with commonsense view the law was specifically directed toward the insurance industry26 with regard to the illinois statute th court found that despite rushs contrary assertions the statute was dir ected at the insurance industry and did not apply to any other industry27 the court then considered three f actors established unde r mccarranferguson to determine whether the illinois statute s hould be saved from preemption state law would not be subject to preemption if it 1 has the effect of transferring or spreading risk 2 if it is an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured or 3 if it is limited to entities within the insurance industry28 the court noted that the factors were guideposts and that state law is not required to satisfy all three to survive preemption29 applying the three factors to the i llinois statute the court determined that the second and third factor s were clearly satisfied recognizing that the statute could likel be saved from preemption under mccarran ferguson rush also argued that preemption was appropriate b ecause congressional intent should override erisas savings clause in making this argument rush compared the provisions in the illinois statute to the cl aims for damages which the court found to be preempted in pilot life ins co v dedeaux 30 in pilot life the court found that erisa preempted participants cla im for damages because the cla im constituted an alternative remedy outside the limited scope of remedies congress provided for in erisa31 thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20845crs6 32 slip op at 23 33 slip op at 25 34 slip op at 27 35 for more information on both bills see crs report rl30978 patient protection during the 107th congress sidebyside com parison of house and senate billscourt distinguished the illinois statute from the remedy sought in pilot life and other cases finding that the illinois statute merely prescribes state regulatory scheme that provides new cause of action under state w and authorizes new form of ultimate relief32 the court also rejected rushs ar gument that independent review was an alternative scheme of arbitral adjudication and thus in conflict with c ongress intent to confine dispute resolution under erisa to the courts33 in dismissing rushs argument the court noted that the state scheme was significantly different from arbitration and was actually closer to m andate for second opinion ra ther than arbitration34 external review and patient protection legislation in the 107th congress the patient protection bills passed by the house hr 2563 and senate s 1052 would each amend erisa to require group health plans and health insurance issuers to provide participan t and beneficiaries with the opportunity for an independent external review of claim denials35 under both bills first qualified external review entity would review the request for external review to determine whether the claim is appropriate for an independent medical review to be eligible for such review the claim denial must involve medically reviewable decision that is the denial must involve question of medical necessity the use of an experimental or investigational item or service or otherwise require an evaluation of medical facts if the qualified external review entity determines that the claim is appropriate for an independent medical review then an independent medical reviewer will make its determination during its review the independent medical reviewer would cons ider all appropriate and available evidence and information incl uding the internal review decision the recommendation of the treating health professi onal and the plan or coverage document the determination of the i ndependent medical reviewer would be based on the medical condition of the participant or beneficiary and valid or rele vant scientific and clinical evidence the independent medical reviewer would have to meet specified independence licensure and expertise requirements furthe r the independent dical reviewer would be permitted only reasonable level of compensation the decision of the independent medical reviewer would be bindi ng on the plan or issuer determination that the plan or issuer should provide the be nefit could not be appealed
