divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30740the national security agency issues for congress summary the national security agency nsa one of the largest components of the us intelligence community has reached major watershed in its history responsible for obtaining intelligence from international communications nsas efforts are being challenged by the multiplicity of new types of communications links by the widespread availability of lowcost encryption systems and by changes in the international environment in which dangerous security threats can come from small but well organized terrorist groups as well as hostile nation states nsas efforts to adjust to the changing geopolitical and technological environment have been strongly encouraged by congress and reflect major shift in congressional oversight of the agency although congress has always approved funding for nsa for decades routine oversight was limited to few members and staff in the 1970s congressional investigations of intelligence agencies resulted in greater public attention to nsa and criticism of activities that infringed on the civil liberties of us persons subsequently both the senate and the house of representatives established intelligence oversight committees that have closely monitored nsas operations the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa was enacted in 1978 to regulate collection by foreign intelligence agencies of the communications of us persons the end of the cold war the expansion of low cost encryption and the explosion of communications systems led congress to take more public profile in overseeing the large and secretive agency reacting in large measure to congressional concerns nsa launched two separate management reviews one by outside experts the other by longtime agency officials both made strong criticisms of agency personnel policies an outmoded organizational structure and an unwillingne ss to utilize civilian practices that more effective than those available inhouse the current nsa director lt general michael v hayden usaf has used these analyses to launch series of major initiatives designed to improve nsas operations to attract and reward more qualified people from outside industry and is developing major contract for outside support of its nonsensitive information technology it functions major renewal effort is underway but observers believe many challenges lie ahead that will require cong ressional oversight many of the reforms in personnel policies recommended are difficult to implement in government organization especially in an extremely tight market for technical specialists the technical complexities of dealing with widespread and sophisticated encryption as well as the proliferation of communications devices remain to be resolved nsa is along with other intelligence agencies not wellpositioned to analyze developments among the assortment of terrorist groups and narcotics smugglers around the world that can seriously affect us interests nsa has also come under heated criticism in the european parliament for allegedly collecting in cooperation with the british commercial intelligence to benefit

mission the national security agency issues for congress introduction the national security agency nsa one of the largest components of the us intelligence community has reached major watershed in its history responsible for obtaining intelligence from international communications1 nsas efforts are being challenged by the multiplicity of new types of communications links by the wides pread availability of lowcost encryption systems and by changes in the international environment in which dangerous security threats can come from small but well organized terrorist groups as well as hostile nation states nsa was established in 1952 as highly compartmented secret codebreaking effort undertaken by handful of military officers and civilians but the agency has gradually become an acknowledged government agency responsible for signals intelligence sigint this evolution has been in significant measure result of congressional initiatives congress provided the statutory framework for nsa and its activities laws have been enacted that carefully prescribe the limits of nsas electronic surveillance of us persons congress has been increasingly inclined to take public notice of problems at nsa and is supporting reforms that are designed to make nsa more effective in current technological and geopolitical environments the challenges facing nsa are formidable difficult operational environment as well as limitations on spending levels for intelligence call into question the future capabilities of nsa public interest in nsa has been heightened in recent months by some members of the european parliament who allege that the united states and few other countries are cooperatively engaged in systematic electronic eavesdropping in order to promote the commercial interests of us corporations this report willhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30740crs2 2 for additional information on congressional oversight of nsa see appendix aattempt to provide an unclassified description of nsas evolution the technical and operational environment that now exists and indicate some issues that the executive branch and congress will be facing in coming years an unmistakable change affecting nsa has been the openness with which its policies and problems are now discussed both by the agencys leadership and by congressional oversight committees until very recently nsa was the most secretive intelligence agency more shielded from public scrutiny than the central intelligence agency cia only the most elliptical references were made in public to the sigint mission and at one time nsa employees identified themselves only as working for the defense department in the past few years however senior intelligence officials frequently describe nsas problems and reports accompanying intelligence legislation include extensive commentary on the challenges facing nsa and the approaches encouraged by congress these changes were made possible by the absence of superpower competitor capable of exploiting any inadvertent security slip and by the need to justify intelligence spending at time when international climate is apparently more benign these factors removed inhibitions against nsa going public and at the same time created political environment that would require public understanding of nsas mission if the agency could continue to obtain the funding necessary to update its operations roles and missions the growing influence of congress for decades congress was content to consider the signals intelligence effort and the organization of nsa primarily as the responsibility of the executive branch for quarter century after the end of the second world war nsa and the nations other intelligence agencies undertook their activities with little publicity and with congressional interest limited to handful of members of armed service s and appropriations committees the intelligence investigations of the 1970s however led to wellpublicized hearings that placed many secrets including those of nsa on the public record of greater enduring significance was the establishment of select intelligence committees in both the house of representatives and the senate these committees were granted the authority to conduct oversight over the intelligence activities of the federal government including nsa they became along with the appropriations committees the points of contact between the intelligence agencies and congress as result of the extreme sensitivity of much intelligence information the two intelligence committees came to act essentially as surrogates for the congress and the public in regard to intelligence agencies until the mid1990s much of interest of the committees as reflected in report language and public hearings centered on the cia and especially its operations directorate sigint activities were undoubtedly matters of congressional concern but they were very rarely the focus of public attention2 in recent years with the end of the cold war the two intelligence committees have had much more intensive concern with nsa as reflected in more detailed report language on nsas activities the extent of oversight is reflected by comments inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30740crs3 3 us congress 106th congress 1st session house of representatives permanent select committee on intelligence

its identification of process and management problems that require attention the committee believes that nsa management has not yet stepped up to the line there have been some efforts at reform but there are still several areas where change is not only needed but is critical for nsas future3 congress has taken more open interest in nsa at time when the agencys roles and missions are facing significant reformulation congress has provided guidance for nsas future direction and has made budgetary allocations based on its sense of appropriate goals personnel policies and organizational structure most observers believe moreover that given the fluid state of international affairs and information technologies that further congr essional attention is likely as nsa changes to adapt to its new environment changing technologies the primary targets of electronic surveillance during the cold war were the communications of hostile military organi zations and governments most of such communications were encrypted in many cases this message traffic could be read only sporadically if at all although useful information can often be obtained without actually reading the actual messages some communications were carried on land lines that could be intercepted only if they could be physically tapped inevitably difficult undertaking it was nonetheless the government and military circuits that provided the most import ant intelligence of military capabilities hostile intentions and diplomatic maneuvers that could place this nations security at risk civilian communicationstelegraphs telephones facsimile devices etcwere usually unencrypted and often sources of valuable information albeit of secondary priority in the past decade two important trends have combined to change the nature of electronic surveillance efforts the end of the cold war meant policymakers and military officials had wider range of countries that they were concerned with and placed much greater emphasis on nonstate actorsterrorist groups and narcotics smuggling organizations that have come to be seen as genuine national security threats these links are not necessarily easy targets given the great expansion in international telephone service that has grown by approximately 18 annually since 1992 intelligence agencies are faced with profound needle inahaystack challenge s

increasingly displaced by fiber optic cables5 fiber optics can carry far more circuits with greater clarity and through longer distances and provides the greater bandwidth necessary for transmitting the enormous quantities of data commonplace in the internet age inevitably fiber optic transmission present major challenges to electronic surveillance efforts as their contents cannot be readily intercepted at least without direct access to the cables themselves the widespread use of fiber optics may also affect requirements for expensive sigint satellites since transmissions over fiber optic cables cannot be intercepted from spacebased platforms6 in addition to the widespread use of fiber optic cable civilian communications have been marked by increased access to highquality encryption systems formerly available only to governments and militaries some systems are available at cost on the internet and others can be obtained commercially at minimal expense this has led to an extensive debate in the united states about the need for export controls on sophisticated encryption systems although it is universally acknowledged that commercial encryption systems available throughout the world prese nt major challenges to intelligence and law enforcement agencies us intelligence officials have argued that permitting export of highquality us systems with associated systems support would greatly extend the capabilities of other governments and hostile groups to protect their communications after extensive discussions within the executive branch and congress steps have been taken to loosen but not remove us restrictions on encryption exports7 nsa officials were active in criticizing unrestricted encryption exports and observers suggest that these views which were shared by many in congress especially within the intellige nce and armed services committees may have fueled press criticism of nsa changing threats coupled with the evolving global technological environment have undoubtedly made nsas tasks far more difficult the proliferation of communications throughout the world and the spread of encryption may make electronic surveillance almost impossible much

but doctrinal and organizational8 personnel matters nsa has employed many highly gifted scientists engineers and mathematicians however shifting geopolitical concerns and budget reductions required in the early 1990s led to early retirements and fewer newly hired employees during the same period the agency was also required to move towards personnel structure more closely reflective of national demographics simultaneously revolution in communications and information technologies was launched in many small startup firms whose culture and salary and personnel benefit levels were radically different from those of government agencies as the extent of these problems became apparent congress has provided guidance in several areas diversity and equal opportunity issues at least since the enactment of the national security agency act of 1959 nsas personnel policies have been the subject of congressional interest that act in essence established separate personnel system for nsa by the mid1980s the house intelligence committee became concerned with the relatively small numbers of africanamericans hispanics and women within the nsa workforce in 1993 blacks constituted 9 of the total

personnel with some officials expressing concerns that others would receive preference at their own expense11 since the mid1990s public congressional hearings and published committee reports have not given extensive discussion to diversity issues although efforts continue to increase the diversity of nsas workforce other personnel issues have complicated hiring and promotion policies changing personnel requirements since the end of the cold war the nature of sigint targets has changed the sheer quantity of communications has dramatically risen and sophisticated encryption systems are increasingly available throughout the world these changes in targets and technologies have required substantially different nsa workforce long staffed by civil servants and military personnel who made their whole careers in cryptologic specialities nsa officials must now be able to shift rapidly among disparate sigint efforts and varying targets different skill mixes are required at nsa at time when technical specialists in communications computer services and encryption systems are in high demand throughout the economy observers believe that entry and mid level government salaries are not equal to opportunities currently available in an especially dynamic sector of the economy furthermore workers in technical fields often shift jobs in short periods and it may not be possible to retain them solely on the basis of the career benefits of federal service12 as has been the case with other intelligence agencies staffing levels at nsa have been reduc ed during the past decade many analysts and others who spent their careers focusing on soviet and warsaw pact issues longer directly relevant to us security concerns have retired or moved into new specialities some media observers suggest however that nsa continues to be burdened by an old guard of cold warera careerists whose talents are not precisely suitable to emerging missions although such charges are difficult to

intelligence committees view that the situation at nsa is unique not only in the enormity of the task of modernization but also in the direct impact on national security should nsa modernization fail13 one approach that has been adopted is to increase reliance on contracting out personnel services although security considerations can complicate the use of non career personnel14 in some cases it has been possible to acquire the services of some retired nsa officials who are able to receive the relevant clearances with little delay in other situations nsa is able to compartmentalize some activities and make use of specialists who do not need access to sensitive information some observers warn however that contract person nel will tend not to be as committed to the agencys missions and may work subsequently for nongovernment concerns with an increased possibility of unauthorized sharing of classified information charting nsas future direction in recent years congressional oversight committees have become concerned about the effect of the changed international threat environment and new technologies on nsas future effectiveness the requirement to replace aging satellite systems in particular have placed pressures on intelligence spending across the board the size and extent of nsas budget inevitably meant that it would be subject to close scrutiny thus in 1997 the senate select committee on intelligence established technical advisory group tag to review the us sigint effort along with other technical challenges facing the intelligence community the tag was composed of leading us scientists and experts in technology and intelligence and has made two classified reports on nsas capabilities according to the senate committee the tag identified serious deficiencies as resources have been reduced the nsa systematically has sacrificed infrastructure modernization in order to meet daytoday intelligence requirements consequently the organization begins the 21st century lacking the technological infrastructure and human resources needed even to maintain the status quo much less meet emerging challenges15 one media account indicates that the tags conclusions were

several thousand skilled computer scientists16 according to the senate report the tag also recommended new business procedures and additional resources the report indicated that the fy2001 authorization bill would likely reflect tag recommendations with resources being shifted to longterm infrastructure modernization at the expense of some shortterm collection17 the house permanent select committee on intelligence also reached the conclusion in 1998 that very large changes in the national security agencys culture and method of operations need to take place18 the committee indicated its approach first the committee is funding and mandating external manag ement reviews second the committee is attempting to infuse fresh thought needed expertise especially in syste ms engineering and greater fairness by insisting that significant portions of certain categories be contracted out and that outside proposals and expertise be solicited notably in systems engineering advanced resea rch and development and in development activities third fences have been placed on portions of the budget with the prospe ct that considerable amount of money could be reprogrammed for

national security agency welcomes ms beverly wright chief financial manager separate report by smaller group of outside experts with experience in the telecommunications industry made similar recommendations20 the two sets of recommendations reflected consensus by these advisory groups and by congressional overseers that nsa requires more centralized management that separate divisions that had long enjoyed functional independence need greater coordination to reduce duplicative functions and that there needs to be strategic vision of how the agency is to adapt to changed geopoliti cal and technological enviro nments both reports reflected confidence in the importance of nsas missions but both were highly critical of nsas management and personnel structures the outside experts concluded the most serious issues are leadership accountability and empowerment as evidenced by great dissatisfaction with decision making within the agency21 the nsa officials noted the agencys fundamental problems lack of governance lack of leadership and lack of strategic alignment although some specific criticisms reflect the inherent limitations of government agencies in comparison with the civilian telecommunications industry nsa was urged to take special steps to hold middle managers responsible for personnel decisions although nsa has traditionally hired recent college graduates and retained them until retirement changes in technology in the international environment as well as disparities in government and civilian salaries imply that in the future there may be fixedterm positions and upgraded salary levels for some critical technical specialists nsa was also urged to move away from its traditional preference for performing all functions inhouse rather than to look for creative ways to find civilian contractors not just as sources of manpower but as solution providers and to make hard choices over priorities rather than to make acrosstheboard budgetary reductions the outside team of experts urged nsa not only to take advantage of the potential advantages of outsourcing but also to bring in mid and upperlevel managers from successful businesses in november 1999 hayden launched 100 days of changeanother series of managerial initiatives responsive to the recommendations of these groups he subsequently summarized nsas challenges maintaining strong

sigint modernization this initiative is known as trailblazer and the studies are expected to be undertaken in 2001 elements of uncertainty few observers deny that significant structural changes in nsas organization are warranted but some caution that the changes thus far envisioned may not resolve the expected problems skeptics note in particular that outsourcing is panacea that it may mean the loss of experienced personnel with longstanding ties to nsa without necessarily reducing overall costs to the taxpayers further they argue the necessity of granting sensitive clearances to contractor personnel may increase risks of compromi sing classified information and processes all agree that costs of background security investigations will increase other objections may be raised concerning the consolidation of it functions in centralized office the flexibility of individual components to design unique systems may be jeopardized and the nsa director has acknowledged that certain legitimate functi ons may have to be curtailed observers note that many of the technological advances in the past decade have been made by decentralized organizations that permit component divisions to establish their own operational practices and develop their own it solutions without micromanagement from headquarters staff the external team argued that intelligence targets will continue to be increasingly transnational in nature and alignment to geographical locations and entities is obsolete although all observers would agree that nsa cannot maintain uniform depths of area expertise for all potential concerns some suggest that there are areas that will be of intense concern to the us government for decades to come and dispers ing area familiarities acquired over many years would be seriously mistaken congressional observers strongly support the use of nsas budget to establish priorities they do not indicate that they believe nsa has mishandled funds they do maintain that the

law enforcemen t agencies in gathering information on threats with both foreign and domestic components but many uncertainties remain many observers strongly oppose the use in court cases of information derived from sigint provided by nsa at the same time sigint specialists are highly reluctant to see nsa diverted from its foreign intelligence missions to tasks that may risk involvement in domestic controversies congress included in the fy20001 intelligence authorization bill hr 4392 section 606 requirement for report from the attorney general regardin g actions taken in regard to the dissemi nation of intelligence information within the justice department this provision replaced an earlier version that would have required the establishment of procedures to accomplish this dissemination33 nsa and counterpart agencies in number of other countries especially great britain have come under much criticism in the european parliament for allegedly monitoring priva communications of nonus businessmen in coordinated electronic surveillance effort known as echelon in order to support domestic corporations some critics go further and charge that nsas activities represent constant threat to civil liberties of foreigners and us persons as well though nsa has reassured congressional oversight committees that the agency complies strictly with us law these controversies will undoubtedly continue34 conclusion the national security act establishes sigint as recognized function of the us government and requires that it is usually to be carried out by nsa the us government thus has accepted responsibility for electronic surveillance activities that are condemned but not necessarily eschewed by some foreign countries although some specialists in international law argue that electronic surveillance is inherently illegal us officials contend based on constitutional responsibilities statutes and longestablished practice that electronic surveillance related to national security andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30740crs14 preventing terrorism and international narcotics smuggling is legitimate function of the us government unlike some foreign countries the us has not asserted right to conduct electronic surveillance to support its economic wellbeing managing this effort in changing geopolitical and technological environment according to knowledgeable observers and congressional overseers requires that nsas organization and operations be substantially altered this process is currently underway to strengthen the nsa directors role in managing the agency but many uncertainties remain that will determine nsas future national security official can confidently predict what collection priorities will exist in five years time nor can the equipment acquisition priorities be firmly projected very far into the future with congressional encouragement the current leadership of nsa is drawing increasingly on talent available in the civilian community to offset the difficulties involved in retaining talented technological experts in very tight sector of the labor market this effort may not result in the stable loyal workforce that in the past led to nsas gradual successes against cold war targets some observers also believe that nsa will ultimately require significant budgetary increases at time when there is determination to restrict overall government spending the future success of nsa is by means guaranteed the current nsa director s managerial initiatives and the move to use outside contractors have widespread support but these efforts may not achieve all their intended goals nsa may not be adaptable to radically changing develo pments in international telecommunications and the bewildering emergence of terrorist groups previ ously unheard of the wider public may come to view nsas activities as inherent threats to privacy that outweigh the value of information acquired attention will be paid to the costs and benefits of allocating additional funds to nsa at time when there are sure to be competing demands the current level of congressio nal concern with nsa is unlikely to diminish observers expect that in the face of attacks on nsa by some in the media and by number of european parliamentarians members of congress will be asked to defend or criticize not only nsas operations but also its statutory roles and missions funding for nsas efforts to adapt to altered geopolitical and technological environments will have to be balanced against other competing needs to much greater extent than in the past observers expect that congress will continue to involve itself in internal changes in the agency designed to acquire technological capabilities to acquire information

effort in the 1920s and 1930s the servic maintained small sigint effort and for time the state department collaborated with the army in operating an american black chamber that attempted with limited success to intercept and decrypt foreign diplomatic comm unications by the time the united states entered world war ii us codeb reakers were able to decrypt some codes of japan germany and other foreign countries success in breaking japanese diplomatic codes achieved through the exercise of the greatest ingenuity and utmost resourcefulnesswas acknowledged publicly after the end of the war in the congressional report regarding the attack on pearl harbor36 during the course of world war ii sigint efforts proved to be exceptionally valuable especially in regard to acquiring military information the crucial victory at midway in june 1942 that halted japans advance in the pacific was gained through sigint the allies ability to keep supplies flowing across the north atlantic depended on limiting uboat attacks this too was accomplished through good sigint some observers have concluded that sigint enabled the allies to end the war at least year earlier than would otherwise have been possible during world war ii cooperation with the british in sigint collection and analysis proved very fruitful although both countries were initially reluctant to share their codebreaking secrets they gradually came to appreciate the advantages of sharing both collection and analysis angloamerican cooperation did not end with the conclusion of hostilities in 1945 but actually expanded with the beginning of the cold war and the expansion of us security interests throughout the world the relationship with the british would eventually encompass the canadians australians and to lesser extent the new zealandershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30740crs16 after the war the army and the navy and subsequently the newly independent air force all continued sigint collection an effort was made to coordinate the services sigint efforts in single organization known as the armed forces security agency established by the secretary of defense in 1949 coordination problems were not however resolved until octo ber 1952 when president truman established the national security agency in an effort to provide more effective structure for coordinating signals intelligence activities truman had determined that the sigint function was national that it would serve civilian policymakers in the state department and the white house as well as the military this action was taken in secret memorandum that was not made public at the time nsa became the us focal point of global sigint effort signals are collected at field stations throughout the world most of which operated by the military services some initial processing and analysis may have be performed at the collection site but in general the take is forwarded to nsa which moved its headquarters from arlington virginia to fort meade maryland in 1957 after decryption and analysis the resultant data is provided to allsource intelligence agencies such as the cia or the defense intelligence agency dia nsa has always been staffed by combination of civil servants and active duty military personnel but the agency also provides operational guidance to sigint collection stations maintained by the cryptologic elements of the military services collectively described as the central security service css during the cold war nsas operations along with those of allied countries were primarily directed at the soviet union its warsaw pact allies and communist china massive efforts were made to collect sigint dealing with military threats to the us and its allies in addition to sigint provided to nationallevel decision makers tactical sigint collection analysis and reporting was incorpo rated in military operations including those occurring in the korean and vietnam wars for many years nsas efforts did not receive much public scrutiny congressional oversight was conducted by small subcommittees of armed services and appropriations committees without public hearings the first major legislation dealing directly with nsa was the national security agency act of 1959 pl 86 36 this act did not describe the functions of nsa but dealt with housekeeping matters such as pay and allowances training property

at nsa observers note that it was an early reflection of the importance of congressional oversight it gave the nsa director authority to terminate the employment of nsa personnel whenever he considers that action to be in the best interest of the united states such actions can be taken notwithstanding usual civil service procedures for personnel actions in 1996 these provisions were superseded by enactment of the fy1997 national defense authorization act pl 104201 sections 16311635 which established intelligence personnel policies for the entire defense department including authority to terminate employees in the interests of the united states appeals of decisions to terminate can only be made to the secretary of defense38 in the mid1970s public concerns that us intelligence agencies were spying on domestic groups opposed to the vietnam war led to hearings by select committees in both chambers39 interest in nsa centered on watch lists that had been maintained to collect communications of us citizens who were suspected of ties to hostile foreign countries and groups40 there was also interest in project known as shamrock by which copies of international telegrams were provide d to nsa on daily basis by three telegraph companies these practices had been terminated by the early 1970s but members of congress considered that the agency should be held accountable for them41 the desire to bring such practices under the constraints of statutory law contributed to passage of the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 during the hearings conducted by the senate

pursuant to presidential direction the secretary of defense had established nsa in accordance with his statutory authorities he noted further that for the past 22 years ie since circa 1953 congress has annually appropriated funds for the operation of the nsa following hearings before the armed services and appropriations committees of both houses of congress in which extensive briefings of the nsas signals intelligence mission have been conducted43 the church committee concluded the national security agency is one of the largest and most technically oriented components of the united states intelligence community its basic function is collecti ng and processing foreign communications and signals for intelligence purposes nsa is also responsible for creating and supervising the cryptography of all united states government agencies and has special responsibility for supervising the military services cryptologic agencies another major responsibility is protecting the security of american communications the committee regards these functions as vital to american security nsas capability to perform these functions must be preserved the committee notes that despite the fact that nsa has been in existence for several decades nsa still lacks legislative charter moreover in its extensive investigation the committee has identified intelligence community abuses in levying

legislation that such legislation provide for civilian control of nsa and that the role of nsa with referen ce to the monitoring of communications of americans be defined45 many of the most important statutory provisions relating to nsa were enacted in the wake of these congressional investigations congress passed the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 fisa 50 usc 1801 which establishes procedures for electronic surveillance in the united states for foreign intelligence purposes46 it provides that the attorney general may authorize surveillance in situations wherein the target is communications of foreign powers in cases in which communications of us persons might be acquired then approval of court created pursuant to the fisa would be required information acquired in accordance with fisa provisions is to be used for foreign intelligence purposes even though in recent years congress has expanded fisa to permit use of some types of information acquired under its provisions to be used for law enforcement purposes in certain circumstances fisa in essence ensures that foreign intelligence electronic surveillance operations within the united states are conducted in accordance with statutory authorities and with supervis ion by the justice department and with oversight by congress although in the pearl harbor investigations the us government officially revealed its prewar sigint efforts ongoing sigint activities had not been acknowledged fisa provided authority in us statutory law for electronic surveillance activities to be conducted for foreign

protection with respect to the information and products produced by the agency there was little congressional guidance on the functions and responsibilities of the agency and few congressionally provided statutory tools to be used to perform those functions47 charter legislation for the entire intelligence community became very complex and ultimately was victim of partisan disputes in the late 1970s48 it was not until 1992 that the national security act was amended to provide functional charter for nsa49 the act now gives the secretary of defense the responsibility to ensure through

of nonconcurrence is stated in recent years few observers express concerns about the nsa director being serving officer the amended national security act also provides that the dci develops budgets for the annual national foreign intelligence program which includes nsa the dci also establishes the requirements and priorities that govern the collection of national intelligence these provisions provide authority for the dci to oversee nsas budget and operations there are however multiple occasions for differences between the roles of the secretary of defense and the dci the defense secretary is inevitably more focused on aligning nsa closely with the operating forces of dod and tends to emphasize collection of direct interest to military commanders the dci for his part tends to see nsa as one component of an interagency effort to gather intelligence for senior policymakers in washington he approves collection and analysis priorities that reflect their requirements these respective responsibilities are well understood defense and intelligence staffs attempt to make adjustments to accommodate differing requirements within budgetary constraints any major reorganization or

separate arrangements made with other commonwealth countries this cooperation was widely considered by senior military leaders at the time and by historians subsequently with having significantly reduced the amount of time needed to defeat nazi germany and japan as well as the number of allied casualties although both the united states and great britain tackled various communications links of

potential soviet military activities originating in arctic regions formal arrangements to cooperate in collecting and analyzing sigint were made by the two countries and others given shared

the target of criticism from those who view intelligence agencies as inevitable threats to civil liberties in general however the agencys low public profile and the esoteric nature of its work attracted less attention than the more dramatic covert actions undertaken by the cia in the past few years however reports prepared under the auspices of the directorategeneral for research of the

containing preprogrammed key words56 us intelligence officials have responded to these charges by describing the statutory framework under which nsa operates and the oversight mechanisms in place in both the executive and legislative branches there have been categorical denial s that intelligence is passed to us companies to provide them commercial advantages although it is freely acknowledged that sigint is used to provide the us government with information about bribery and other illegal practices of foreign firms and that this information has been used as the basis for diplomatic complaints57 nsa has successfully persuaded the congressional leadership that it faithfully and responsibly conducts its electronic surveillance activities in accordance with law and relevant

investigation will not include the calling of witnesses and interestingly an amendment calling for an investigation of eavesdropping by all eu governments was not adopted61 in part foreign objections stem from concern about the capabilities of nsa to monitor their communications and those of european companies there is also especially among some irritation that the united states has closer sigint relationship with some of its allies than with others in part however observers perceive attacks on nsas activities as instinctive hostility among political elements long skeptical of close useuropean relations and determined to forge more independent european identity some objections also undoubtedly arise from deepseated opposition to the work of all intelligence agencies there is question that the worldwide capabilities of nsa cause suspicion and resentment among some foreign elements us officials justify nsas activities on international law the necessity to acquire information about threats to national security international terrorism and the narcotics trade while the potential for abuse is acknowledged the united states has legal structure that regulates electronic surveillance in addition intelligence derived from sigint supports many collective military and diplomatic efforts with european and other allies
