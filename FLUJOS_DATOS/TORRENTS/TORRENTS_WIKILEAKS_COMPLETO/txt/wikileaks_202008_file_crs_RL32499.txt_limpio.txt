statements saudi leaders have said they are committed to cooperating with the united states in fighting terrorist financing pointing out that saudi arabia has been victim of terrorism and shares the us interest in combating it saudi leaders acknowledge providing financial support for islamic and palestinian causes but maintain that official saudi support goes to any terrorist organizations such as hamas qaeda affiliated terrorist attacks in saudi arabia from 2003 to 2006 appear to have given added impetus to the saudi leadership in expanding counterterrorist financing efforts since mid2003

saudi government charitable committees and international islamic charity organizations based in saudi arabia have provided financial and relief assistance to muslims around the world this has included the provision of assistance to individuals and groups engaged in or victimized by various nationalist and religious conflicts similar public and private saudi efforts have financed religious education and proselytization programs in dozens of muslimmajority and muslimminority countries in places such as afghanistan pakistan the philippines chechnya bosnia indonesia nigeria kashmir kosovo and the west bank and gaza some of these activities appear to have provided financial or material support to individuals or groups actively involved in terrorism armed violence or the propagation of divisive religious ideologies in 2007 the us department of state reported that saudi donors and unregulated charities have been major source of financing to extremist and terrorist groups over the past 25 years1 official us government concerns about this trend were apparent prior to the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks which amplified public criticism within the united states of alleged saudi involvement in terrorism or of saudi laxity in acting against terrorist groups various critics have accused the saudi government of directly supporting terrorism and of creating permissive environment that has allowed funding to flow to terrorists and extremists the final report released by the bipartisan national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission indicates that the commission found evidence that the saudi government as an institution or senior saudi officials individually funded qaeda the report also states however that saudi arabia was place where qaeda raised money directly from individuals and through charities and indicates that charities with significant saudi government sponsorship may have diverted funding to qaeda the bush administrations statements on saudi arabias counterterrorism policies have praised new saudi efforts to combat terrorist financing while generally confirming accounts that suggest that the activities of some saudi entities and individuals have contributed to the spread of terrorism and extremism over time in april 2008 undersecretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence stuart

steps taken by saudi arabia to counter terrorist financing many in conjunction with the united states and suggests some implications of recent saudi actions for us counterterrorism policy saudi arabia allegations of terrorist financing in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks numerous allegations have been leveled against the saudi arabian government and prominent saudi citizens regarding financial support for international terrorist groups although many of the allegations fault the saudi government for failing to act decisively to close down channels of financial support some critics go so far as to accuse saudi government officials of responsibility for the september 11 attacks through design or negligence and for the continuing threat posed by the perpetrators or by likeminded terrorist groups since september 11 us government officials have welcomed undeniable progress in the saudi arabian governments efforts to combat terrorist financing2 while maintaining concern that wealthy donors in saudi arabia are still funding violent extremists around the world from europe to north africa from iraq to southeast asia3 the following are summaries of the more publicized post september 11 reports of alleged saudi involvement in terrorist financing general allegations the 911 commission4 the final report released by the bipartisan national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states indicates that the commission found evidence that the saudi government as an institution or senior saudi officials individually funded qaeda the report also states however that saudi arabia was place where qaeda raised money directly from individuals 2 us treasury secretary john w snow statement following visit to saudi arabia september 17 2003 3 testimony of stuart levey

commission report july 22 2004 crs3 and through charities and indicates that charities with significant saudi government sponsorship such as the haramain islamic foundation may have diverted funding to qaeda for more on this subject see action against questionable charity below specifically the report describes bin ladens use of the golden chain an informal financial network of prominent saudi and gulf individuals originally established to support the antisoviet afghan resistance movement in the 1980s us officials state that this network collected funds and funneled them to arab fighters in afghanistan and later to qaeda using charities and other non governmental organizations5 according to the commissions report saudi individuals and other financiers associated with the golden chain enabled bin laden and qaeda to replace lost financial assets and establish base in afghanistan following their abrupt departure from sudan in 1996 these activities were facilitated in part the report argues by the extreme religious views that exist within saudi arabia and the fact that until recently saudi charities were subject to very limited oversight although the report highlights series of unsuccessful us government efforts to gain access to senior qaeda financial operative who had been detained by saudi arabia in 1997 the report credits the saudi government with assisting us officials in interviewing members of the bin laden family in 1999 and 2000 the report argues that these meetings were integral to us efforts to understand the role of bin ladens personal wealth in the financing of qaeda as result of this assistance us officials learned that saudi government actions in the early 1990s had in effect divested bin laden of his share of the bin laden family fortune leading qaeda to rely thereafter on core group of financial facilitators based in the persian gulf and particularly in saudi arabia for funding the report also credits saudi government actions following the may 2003 bombings in riyadh which apparently reduced the funds available to qaeda perhaps drastically council on foreign relations studies6 an independent task force sponsored by the council on foreign relations has issued two reports that address terrorist financing and saudi arabias alleged financial support for terrorism the 5 fbi agents discovered handwritten list of 20 alleged qaeda financiers

council on foreign relations june 15 2004 see httpwwwcfrorgpdfrevised_terrorist_financingpdf the council on foreign relations does not institutionally endorse the studies produced by its independent task forces and notes that task force members are solely responsible for the content of their respective reports crs4 task forces october 2002 report strongly criticized what it asserted was saudi financial support for international terrorist groups for example the report stated both in its summary and in the main body for years individuals and charities based in saudi arabia have been the most important source of funds for qaeda and for years saudi officials have turned blind eye to this problem the authors argued that connection between saudi donors and qaeda is logical for several reasons saudi arabia possesses the greatest concentration of wealth in the region saudi nationals and charities were previously the most important sources of funds for the mujahideen fighters against the soviet occupation in afghanistan saudi nationals have always constituted disproportionate percentage of qaedas own membership and qaedas political message has long focused on issues of particular interest to saudi nationals especially those who are disenchanted with their own government emphasis added the report grouped saudi arabia with pakistan egypt and other gulf states and regional financial centers as source and transit countries implying that donations to terrorist causes not only originate in these countries but also that donations from other countries pass through them route to terrorist organizations the saudi government responded by charging that the reports allegations were based on false and inconclusive information7 treasury department spokesperson reportedly described the report as seriously flawed because in the departments opinion it did not describe new initiatives to combat terrorist financing adequately8 the task forces second report released in june 2004 updates the first report and chronicles the steps the saudi arabian government had taken to strengthen its financial legal and regulatory systems and to combat terrorist financing since late 2002 the report acknowledged the saudi governments announcement of the enactment or promulgation of profusion of new laws and regulations and the creation of new institutional arrangements intended to tighten controls over the principal modalities of terrorist financing the report welcomed the steps and concluded that on comparative basis saudi arabia had taken more decisive legal and regulatory action to combat terrorist financing than many other muslim states the second report also identified several areas in which its authors argued that saudi authorities could have done more to combat terrorist financing it argued that additional action was essential because of the fundamental centrality that persons and organizations based in saudi arabia have had in financing militant islamist groups on global basis the report cited lack of publicly available enforcement information as the basis for its questions about the saudi governments commitment to implement its new terrorist financing laws and regulations for example the report specifically criticized the saudi governments failure to punish in demonstrable manner specific and identified leaders of charities found to be 7

in all because the administration refused on national security grounds to release the chapter in public forum there has been speculation about the degree to which the deleted pages might reveal saudi

attacks19 the saudi foreign minister appealed to president bush to publish the censored pages so as to enable saudi arabia to rebut these suspicions but the president refused on the grounds that an ongoing investigation of the september 11 attacks might be compromised20 the brisard report controversial private report issued by french investigator jeancharles brisard in december 2002 made several detailed allegations about the involvement of prominent saudi nationals in the financing of international terrorist organizations the united nations security council did not solicit or endorse brisards report although it has been mischaracterized as report in the public record21 although most public allegations of saudi support for terrorist activities have not quantified the amounts of money involved brisards report asserted that qaeda received between 300 million and 500 million during the decade prior to 2002 by abusing this pillar of islam charitable donations and taking advantage of the saudi regulatory vacuum22 brisard described saudi donors as wealthy businessmen and bankers the report has been the subject of lawsuit in the united kingdom regarding defamation of

private individuals and organizations in saudi arabia have financially supported insurgent operations in iraq24 news accounts have suggested that insurgent recruiters and facilitators prefer to deal with saudi young men because saudis provide for their own expenses and often personally finance insurgent operations25 senior us treasury department official testified in july 2005 that saudi

implicated in terrorist financing according to the 911 commission monograph on terrorist financing the saudi government turned blind eye to the financing of qaeda before september 11 2001 and the saudis did not begin to crack down hard on qaeda financing in the kingdom until after the may 2003 qaeda attacks in riyadh the report recognized the significantly higher levels of cooperation that us officials have received from their saudi counterparts since may 2003 securing 97 author meeting with ministry of interior officials riyadh saudi arabia march 2005 98 ibid testimony by then deputy

of us efforts to curb the flow of funds to terrorist groups private donors and accountability us officials have said that the saudi government should give more emphasis to demanding personal responsibility for terrorist financiers and act against those who tolerate or promote financing of terrorist activity the us treasury department has observed that while current regulations take account of the financial activities of charitable concerns they do not apply to direct donations made by private donors100 the 911 commission terrorist financing monograph stated that as of 2004 saudi authorities had failed to impose criminal punishment on any highprofile donor some individuals have had their assets frozen by saudi authorities and have been forbidden from traveling outside saudi arabia however several prominent saudi individuals suspected by us authorities of involvement in terrorist financing have not been charged or prosecuted in the united states saudi arabia or other jurisdictions these individuals are believed to be in saudi arabia the us state department has stated that saudi arabia should demonstrate its willingness to hold elites accountable for money laundering and terrorist financing related offenses on september 11 2007 treasury undersecretary stuart levey stated that when the evidence is clear that these individuals have funded terrorist organizations and knowingly done so then they should be prosecuted and treated as real terrorism because it is101 saudi authorities assert that the availability of sufficient evidence to support courtroom prosecutions of alleged terrorist financiers is limited by the classification of information in some cases currency controls and cash couriers although saudi arabias financial customer information requirements are more stringent for international transfers under newly adopted regulations some loopholes may remain the fatf report called on saudi officials to increase the amount of information required for foreign currency conversion transactions at money remittance centers in the kingdom since 2006 saudi customs authorities have introduced new currency and precious items declaration system at all border crossings for amounts under 16000 the use of cash couriers has been identified as primary mechanism for the transfer of insurgency funds into iraq and us treasury department officials have stated that iraqs neighbors have responsibility to act to prevent the transfer of large amounts of cash to insurgent organizations in iraq the extent to which couriers may be ferrying cash from saudi arabia into iraq is unclear however press reports have described insurgent groups preferences for saudi recruits because of the large amounts of personal funding usually in cash that some saudi nationals have brought with them to iraq102 100 glaser testimony before senate committee on the judiciary november 8 2005 101 brian ross us saudis still filling qaedas coffers abc news september 11 2007 102 ghaith abdulahad outside iraq but deep in the fight washington post june 8 2005 crs25 outlook it seems clear that challenges to internal security and terrorist incidents in saudi arabia have impelled the saudi leadership to devote heightened attention to countering the financing of terrorism this has been particularly true since mid2003 when terrorists began mounting series of attacks on residential and office compounds apparently in an effort to target the saudi government as well as the western presence in saudi arabia both us officials and independent observers have welcomed the mechanisms that saudi authorities have put in place with the aim of stemming the flow of funds destined for terrorist groups they point out however that the effectiveness of these measures will be tested by the degree to which saudi authorities succeed in implementing the various regulations that have been established in recent years to date us officials have continued to express approval of changes in saudi policy along with disappointment with saudi enforcement measures particularly with lack of public prosecutions for individuals accused of financing terrorism outside of the kingdom issues for congress several committees and members in the 108th and 109th congresses expressed interest in these issues and held hearings and introduced legislation relating to us saudi cooperation in the fight against terrorism and terrorist financing section 575 of the fy2005 omnibus appropriations bill pl 108447 prohibited saudi arabia from receiving aid or any direct assistance from the united states unless the president exercised waiver authority and certified that saudi arabia was cooperating with efforts to combat international terrorism and that the proposed assistance will help facilitate that effort the president exercised this waiver by presidential determination 200538 on september 26 2005 and provided 200000 in terrorism financing assistance nadrctf to saudi authorities the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act pl 108458 required the president to submit to congress within 180 days strategy for collaboration with the people and government of saudi arabia including framework for cooperation on efforts to combat terrorist financing in the 110th congress section 2043 of the implementing recommendations of the 911 commission act pl 11053 signed august 3 2007 finds that the kingdom of saudi arabia has an uneven record in the fight against terrorism especially with respect to terrorist financing and requires the administration to submit report 180 days after enactment describing the long term strategy of the united states to work with the government of saudi arabia to combat terrorism including through effective measures to prevent and prohibit the financing of terrorists by saudi institutions and citizens the document submitted in january 2008 does not describe strategy for future counterterrorist financing cooperation

encourage implementation of new saudi laws and regulations hearings and inquiries seeking specific information about terrorist financing threats and monitoring us and foreign government efforts to strengthen regulatory regimes implementation capacity and enforcement may improve public consideration of these issues intelligence considerations may limit the degree to which officials can publicly

enforce existing regulations particularly to prosecute prominent alleged financiers 103 continued january 30 2008 for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32499
