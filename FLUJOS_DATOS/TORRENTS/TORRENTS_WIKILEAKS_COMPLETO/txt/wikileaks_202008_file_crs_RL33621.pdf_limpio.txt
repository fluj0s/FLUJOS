the supreme cour t gave favorable decisions to the defendants in three out of the six death penalty cases it announced in hill v mcdonough the court ruled unanimously that the methodoflethal injection claims can be brought under 42 usc 1983 rather than under the habeas corpus statute 28 usc 2254 in house v bell case involving death row inmate who claimed that dna evidence proved he did not commit the crime for which he was found guilty the court found in 5 3 ruli ng that the petitioner had satisfied the gateway standard for habeas review but left open the question of whether the constitution precludes execution of an innocent defendant found guilty and sentenced following constitutionally adequate trial in holmes v south carolina the court unanimously held that capital defendant cannot be denied the right to introduce evidence of third party guilt the other cases in which the court upheld application of state death pe nalty statutes appear to reveal greater division among the justices over the fairness of cap ital punishment the 54 decision in kansas v marsh centered around debate concerning cap ital punishment as much as it did ruling on the unusual statute in kansas wh ich provided that juries should sentence defendant to die rather than serve life in prison when the evidence for and against imposing death is equal in brown v sanders second 54 decision the court upheld the petitioners death senten ce even though two of the sentencing factors presented to the jury were declared invalid in oregon v guzek the court held that states may reasonably refuse to allow convicted capita l defendants to offer alibi evidence for the first time at the sentencing phase of their trials two justices would have permitted the exclusion of an evidence at sentencing that cast doubt upon the jurys guilty verdict but the ma jority were obviously unwilling to go that far httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33621contents introduction 1 hill v mcdonough 1 house v bell 3 holmes v south

tennessee and south carolina in the other three cases2 the court affirmed the states death penalty sentences hill v mcdonough3 on june 12 2006 the court held unanimous ly that the use of lethal injection as form of execution in the state of florida constituted challenge to the cruel and unusual provision of the eighth amendmen t and properly raised claim under 42 usc 1983 which provides cause of action for civil rights violations rather than under the habeas corpus provisions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33621crs2 4 hill v crosby 437 f3d 1084 1085 11th cir 2006 5 126 s ct at 21012102 6 id at 2102 7 id 8 id 9 id at 2103 10 id 11 id 12 id at 2104the petitioner hill challenged florida s injection protocol under 42 usc 1983 as likely to cause him seve re pain and suffering but the lower courts construed his suit as habeas petition under 28 us c2254 and dismissed it as procedurally barred second and successive petition4 in an opinion written by justice kennedy the court reversed noting the distinction between challenges to the lawfulness or duration of confinement which must be brought via habeas corpus petition and challenges to the circumstances which need not be5 the difference is that the former but not the latter necessarily challenges the legality of sentence ie finding that state cannot detain or execute an inmate in one particular manner does not mean that it cannot detain or execute him at all6 the reasoning of the court in hill was that although florida law prescribed thal injection as the means of execution it left the specific method of injection up to the correction officials and hill challenged only the particular three drug sequence intended for his execution7 inasmuch as hill left open the possibility that florida could execute him by lethal injection by another method decision in his favor under 42 usc 1983 did not imply that his sentence by lethal injection generally is unlawful8 the court was sensitive to the concerns raised by florida the united states solicitor general and others that deathrow inmates will simply challenge individual aspects of their planned executions one at time and thereby effectively block their executions9 notwithstanding the court rejected proposal to require prisoners such as hill to identify in their complaints alternative means of execution that they would accept10 according to the court heighten ed pleading requirements should result from changes to the federal rules of criminal procedure s imilar to the specific pleading requirements which ar mandated by the federal rules of civil procedure and not as general rule by casebycase litigation11 the court also noted that filing section 1983 action does not entitle an inmate to stay of execution which allows courts to consider factors such as whether suit is speculative or filed too late in the day12 at least temporarily the decision in hill may delay executions as challenges to the constitutionality to the st ates lethal injection method of execution are addressed and decidedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33621crs3 13 126 s ct 2064 2006 14 id at 20772078 15 513 us 298 1995 cited at 126 s ct 20762077 justice kennedys majority opinion said

in deciding this case that in capital case truly persuasive demonstration of actual innocence made after trial would render the execution of defendant unconstitutional and warrant federal habeas

falls far short of any such threshold 20 id at 41719 21 id at 419 427 oconnor and kennedy jj concurringhouse v bell13 on june 12 2006 the court decided its second death penalty case in 53 decision with justice kennedy joined by justices breyer stevens souter and ginsburg for the majority justice alito did not participate this case raised an issue which has hung over the imposition of capital punishment in recent years as it relates to newly discovered evidence and the possibility that an innocent person could be executed paul house sought release from tenness ees death row based on what his appeal to the court calls new reliable evidence of innocence14 which involves an application of the miscarriageofjustice exception to the procedural default of state claims in fede ral court under schlup v delo 15 house claimed that dna tests show that the semen found on the murder victim carolyn munceys clothes belonged to her husband hubert muncey and not to h ouse as jury in union county tenn found 20 years ago the lower federa l courts rejected his claims16 the issue before the supreme court was first how strong his case for innocence must be to qualify for habeas review in federal court17 in addition house asked the court to resolve an issue left open earlier and find the new evidence exonerated him18 although the court has not explicitly decided that it is unconstitutional to execute convicted but innocent person it suggested the possibility in 1993 in herrera v collins 19 there in 54 opinion however it ruled that leonel torres herrera had right to reopen his case 10 ears after his convic tion based solely on his claim of new proof of innocence20 justices oconnor and kennedy joined that opinion without endorsing the suggestion and with the stipulation that they believed that there was little doubt of herreras guilt21httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33621crs4 22 126 sct at 20762077 23 id 24 id at 2077 25 id at 2087 26 id at 208687 27 id at 2087 28 id at 20922094 29 id at 2093 30 id at 2087 the question is not whether hous was prejudiced at his trial because the jurors were not aware of the new evidence but whether all the evidence considered together proves that house was actually inno cent so that reasonable juror would vote to convict himthe house court referred to the standard of schup v delo and held that it was more likely than not that reasonable juror viewing the record as whole would find house guilty beyond reasonable doubt22 justice kennedy writing for the majority noted that all the evidence old and new incriminating and exculpatory without regard to whether it would necessarily be admitted under rules of admissibility that would govern at trial must be taken into account23 he stated that when an inmate comes to federal court with evidence of innocence the courts function is not to make an independent factual deter mination about what likely occurred but rather to assess the likely impact of the evidence on reasonable jurors24 the majority decided that houses revelation about dna and the blood stains were enough to overcome the strict standard s that must be met before prisoners are allowed to reargue issues of i nnocence long after their convictions25 they declined to reach however the question left open in herrera whether the constitution precludes execution of an actually innocen t defendant found guilty and sentenced in constitutionally adequate trial26 should such right exist house had failed present evidence of sufficient persuasion to claim it27 chief justice roberts in the dissent said the majority had ignored the trial judges determination that h ouse and several of his witne sses were unreliable the chief justice also noted that the trial judge had found that munceys autopsy blood was spilled on houses jeans after the fbi already had determined that the blood on his pants belonged to the victim28 justice roberts dissent agreed with the majority on the herrera issue but argued that despite th evidence the case against house remains substantially unaltered from the cases presented to the jury29 as result justice roberts said the schlup standard was not met30 the judgment upholding the denial of habeas corpus relief was reversed and the case was remanded for consideration of houses procedura lly barred claimshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33621crs5 31 126 s ct 1727 2006 32 id at 1730731

2005holmes v south carolina31 holmes was convicted of mu ltiple crimes including first degree murder and sentenced to death at his trial the court did not allow holmes to present evidence that third party had committed the crimes he had been charged with on may 1 2006 the supreme court with justice alito writing the opinion for unanimous court ruled that south caro lina had deprived bobbie lee holmes of fair trial when it prevented him from putting on evidence contradictory to the states case and which also pointed to another possible suspect the prosecution relied heavily on forensic evidence that strongly supported petitioners guilt the petitioner sought to rebut the states forensic evidence by introducing expert testimony suggesting that the evidence had been contaminated and that the police had engaged in plot to frame him the petitioner also sought to intr oduce evidence that another man by the name of jimmy mccaw white had been in the victims neighborhood on the morning of the assault and white had either acknowledged petitioners innocence or admitted to committing the crimes himself in whites pretrial testimony he denied making the incriminating statements and provided an alibi for the time of the assault32 the trial court excluded petitioners thirdparty guilt evidence citing the state supreme courts gregory decision which held that this evidence is admissible if it raises reasonable inference as to the fendants own innocence but is inadmissible if it merely casts bare suspicion or raises conjectural inference as to anothers guilt33 the state supreme court affi rming the trial court cited both gregory and its later decision in gay34 and held that where there is strong forensic evidence of an appellants guilt gratuitous evidence regarding third partys alleged guilt does not raise reasonable inference as to the appellants own innocence35 applying this standard the south carolina state supreme court held that the petitioner could not overcome the forensic evidence against him36 the us supreme court granted certiorari based upon the question regarding whether south carolinas rule governing the admissibility of thirdparty guilt evidence violates criminal defendants constitutional right to present complete defense grounded in the due process c onfrontation and compulsory process clauses37 the us supreme court held that criminal defendants federal constitutional rights are violated by an evidence rule under which th defendant may not introducehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33621crs6 38 126 sct at 1728 39 id at 17281729

if the prosecu tion has introduced forensic evidence that if believed strongly s upports guilty verdict38 the court said state and federal rulemakers have broad latitude under the constitution to establish rules excluding evidence from criminal trials this latitude however has limits whether rooted directly in the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment or in the compulsory process or confrontation cl auses of the sixth amendment the constitution guarantees criminal defendants meaningful opportunity to present complete defense this right is abridged by evidence rules that infringe upon weighty interest of the accused and are arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve while the constitution thus prohibits th exclusion of defense evidence under rules that serve legitimate purpose or th at are disproportionate to the ends that they are asserted to promote wellesta blished rules of evidence permit trial judges to exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by certain other factors such as unfair prejudice confusi on of the issues or potential to mislead the jury an application of this principle is found in rules regulating the admission of evidence proffered by criminal defendants to show that someone else committed the crime with which they are charged such rules are widely accepted and are not challenged here in gregory the south carolina supreme court adopted and applied rule intended to be of this type in gay and this case however that court radically changed and extended the gregory rule by holding that where there is strong evidence of defendants guilt especially strong forensic evidence proffered evidence about third partys alleged guilt may or perhaps must be excluded under this rule the trial judge does not focus on the probative value or the poten tial adverse effects of admitting the defense evidence of thirdparty guilt instead the critical inquiry concerns the strength of the prosecutions case if th prosecutions case is strong enough the evidence of thirdparty guilt is excluded even if that evidence if viewed independently would have great probative value and even if it would not pose an undue risk of harassment prejudice or confusion of the issues furthermore as applied below the rule seems to call for little if any examination of the credibility of the prosecutions witnesse s or the reliability of its evidence the point of this is that by evaluatin g the strength of only one partys evidence logical conclusion can be reached regard ing the strength of contrary evidence offered by the other side to rebut or cast doubt because the rule applied below did not heed this point the rule is arbitrary in the sense that it does not rationally serve the end that the gregory rule and other similar thirdparty guilt rules were designed to further nor s the state identified any other legitimate end served by the rule thus the rule violates criminal defendants right to havea meaningful opportunity to present complete defense39 justice alito was guided by string of supreme court decisions which were used as precedent to set up balancing st to weigh and determine the

only one partys evidence logical conclusion can be reached regarding the strength of contrary evidence offered by the other side to rebut or cast doubt41 kansas v marsh42 on june 26 2006 the supreme court narrowly upheld the death penalty in kansas in 54 decision which reversed th kansas supreme court and ruled that the kansas death penalty statute does not viol ate the eighth or fourteenth

connecting the womans husband to the crime43 during the time that marshs appeal was pending the kansas supreme court held in state v lepas that kansas death penalty statute under which marsh had been sentenced was unconstitutional becau it mandated sentence of death when the aggravating and mitigating circumst ances offset and counterbalanced each other44 the court held that the u s supreme court

error because the process used to select which defendants ar sentenced to death does not comport with the fundamental respect for humanity underlying the eighth amendment the kansas supreme court held that there was way that kansas weighing equation is permissible under the eighth and fourteenth amendments48 justice thomas writing for the 54 major ity said our precedents establish that state enjoys

mitigating circumstances outweigh aggravating circumstances51 finding that walton controlled the court reasoned that the kansas death penalty statute may constitutionally direct imposition of the death penalty when the state has proved beyond reasonable doubt that mitiga ting circumstances do not outweigh aggravating circumstances even when they are of equal weight52 even if walton did not directly control the court stated st ate has range of discretion in imposing the death penalty including how the aggravating and mitigating circumstances are weighed as long as the state system satisfies the requirements of fermion v georgia and gregg v georgia 53 the court reasoned that the use of mitigation evidence is product of the requirement of individualized sentencing54 the court

essentially the eighth amendment forbids mandatory death pena lty in doubtful cases and that this is precisely what the kansas statute does that is case where mitigating factors equally balance aggravating factors is doubtful case in justice shouters estimation58 justice souters concern is that in such case which he calls tie the tiebreaker has nothing to do with the deta ils of the crime or any facts about the defendant but that the st atute presents mandatory death as the tiebreaker59 justice souter is troubled by this in light of th fact that the past decade has shown dna test exonerating numerous death row defendants60 citing the experience of illinois justice souters dissent not ed that 13 deathrow inmate s were released between 1977 and 2000 triggering state moratorium on executions and referred to studies that he said showed that dozens of death ro w inmates in other states were wrongly convicted61 justice scalia said the studies that justice souter cited are factually inaccurate because many of the inmates th ey list as innocent were not exonerated but were released for technical legal reasons62 oregon v guzek63 on february 22 2006 the supreme court in an
