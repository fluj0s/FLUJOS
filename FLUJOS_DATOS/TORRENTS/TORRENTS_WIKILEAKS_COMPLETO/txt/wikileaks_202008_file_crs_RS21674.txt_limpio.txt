traditionally the blue slip has been used by some senators to delay and sometimes prevent the confirmation of persons whom they find objectionable who have been nominated as us attorney us marshal us district court judge and us court of appeals judge in recent years various changes to the blueslip process have eliminated the traditional veto power of blue slips this report provides brief background on the blueslip process followed by an overview of current issues concerning blue slips the debate over the need for blueslip policy and recent and possible future changes to the process this report will be updated as committee actions warrant see also crs report rl32013 the history of the blue slip in the senate committee on the judiciary 1917present by mitchel sollenberger background and overview of the issues the senate judiciary committees blueslip policy has been central component in its consideration of nominations this policy is judiciary committee custom in which the chairman seeks the assessment of nominees from homestate senators in practice the chairman will send bluecolored form to the senators of the state where the president has nominated an individual to be either us circuit or district court judge us marshal or us attorney if homestate senator has objection to nominee blue slip is returned to the chairman with positive response for period of over 20 years 195619791 however if senator had some objection to the nominee and wanted to stop committee action he or she could decide not to return the blue slip or to return it with negative response under such circumstances the withholding of blue slip or single negative response would halt all further action on nomination 1 for historical account of the blueslip process see crs report rl32013 the history of the blue slip in the senate committee on the judiciary 1917present by mitchel sollenberger congressional research service the library of congress crs2 over the years the blueslip policy has been modified to prevent homestate senator from having such absolute power over the fate of nominee from the state today committee action on judicial nomination is stopped only if the president has failed to consult with the homestate senators all blue slips have been made public since 20012 since the blue slip is not committee rule however the chairman has the discretion to change the policy when deemed necessary as result even if the chairman has publicly stated blueslip policy he or she is not obligated to follow it therefore the stated and practiced blueslip policies can at times be confusing if not contradictory to one another in the 108th congress judicial nominations have experienced delays in confirmation in several instances some of which involve blue slips the blueslip policy raises several important issues for the senate today first it may be useful to define the blue slip in terms of how it functions in the contemporary context although today the blue slip only stops committee action in certain instances for many years it was used as an absolute veto by some senators3 second even if defined as stated by the chairman the blueslip policy can still be difficult to understand because the stated and practiced methods of handling httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21674 blue slips may not match third the increased interest in blue slips has raised the issue of whether they should be used at all finally scholars are discussing how the blue slip has changed and what proposals for change would work in todays confirmation process4 defense of the blueslip process the blue slip in its strictest form5 is mechanism that encourages the president to consult with senators about their homestate nominations without blueslip policy the president may fail to see the need to consult homestate senator in the selection process6 although this is primary argument made in support of the blueslip policy7 there are other justifications as well 2 current 108th congress blue slips are available at httpwwwusdojgovolpblueslips1html visited nov 5 2003 3 university of massachusetts professor sheldon goldman refers to the traditional use of the blue slip as the silent veto see sheldon goldman et clintons judges summing up the legacy judicature vol 84 marapr 2001 p 238 4 number of scholars have focused on this issue see brannon p denning the judicial confirmation process and the blue slip judicature vol 85 marapr 2002 elliot slotnick the changing role of the senate judiciary committee in judicial selection judicature vol 62 may 1979 sarah binder

the blueslip policy that allows homestate senator to delay or stop committee action when he or she returns negative blue slip 6 in 1979 senate judiciary committee hearing attorney general griffin bell stated if there were blue slip procedure and we the white house wanted to send name in we would see us congress senate committee on the judiciary the selection and confirmation of federal judges hearings before the senate committee on the judiciary part i 96th cong 1st sess washington gpo 1979 p 23 7 see us senate judiciary committee opening statement of senator patrick leahy before continued crs3 some have argued that the blue slip is senatorial responsibility that provides home state senators with the opportunity to make the tough decisions on judicial nominations8 another justification is that the blue slip provides homestate senators with the power to voice concern over nominations they feel are unacceptable to them9 still others have argued that the blue slip is an institutionalized form of senatorial courtesy10 for the most part these arguments justify the blue slip because it appears to maximize the role of the homestate senator in the selection of judicial nominations the net effect of traditional use of the blue slip provides homestate senators with more leverage to encourage the president to consult on such issues than the senate possesses collectively criticism of the blueslip process there has been criticism of the blueslip process one concern is that the blue slip has been used by homestate senators to select judges on political not professional basis11 that is if the president does not select the individual preferred by homestate senator the offended homestate senator can delay or prevent committee action on judicial nomination for almost any personal political or arbitrary reason httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21674 such an argument has led some to believe that the blueslip process is perversion of what the founders intended12 instead of allowing the entire senate to fulfill its constitutional duty few individual senators have improperly taken the senates advice and consent role and used it for their own benefit another argument has been made that the blue slip weakens the presidents power to select judges still others have found that the blue slip places too many restrictions on the executive branch and does not reward the president when he does consult with homestate senators finally another argument finds that the blue slip has been transformed from device that encourages the president 7 continued judicial

preempting anybody but from assuming our responsibility that is why we are here senators that is to call these tough shots within our states see us congress senate committee on the judiciary the

david cohen of common cause stated the intent of our founding fathers has been turned on its head by the archaic blue slip system see us congress senate committee on the judiciary the selection and confirmation of federal judges hearings before the senate committee on the judiciary p 63 crs4 to consult with homestate senators into weapon that few individual senators use to extract unreasonable concessions13 criticism of the blueslip policy has largely addressed the ability of homestate senators to unduly influence the president when he selects nominations others feel that some senators have improperly used the blue slip and have therefore changed the intended nature of the confirmation process in either case the arguments make the point that the blue slip is an arcane practice that the senate should consider ending blue slips as sustained procedure the enduring use of the blue slip over its more than 80year history arguably provides proof that senators generally support the procedure the blue slip in part has sustained itself because it has been transformed into an effective tool for homestate senators to use in the confirmation process as one scholar explains the blue slip process can be seen as type of sanction that has evolved to police observance of the confirmation process norms14 the sanction blue slips provide senators is delay or veto threat on judicial nominations against the president such threat slowly evolved out of the early practice of senatorial courtesy15 one student of the process seeks to reinforce this understanding httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21674 senatorial courtesy may have been sufficient to encourage senators to defer to the views of the home state senator from the presidents party when nominations came to the floor but it clearly was not strong enough threat to force the president to consult with interested senators before nominations were made institutionalizing senatorial courtesy in the form of printed practice blue slips would have conferred strategic advantage on home state senators from the presidents party16 modifications to the blueslip policy previous blue slip changes at the beginning of congress or following change in leadership the judiciary committee chairman may choose to modify the blue slip policy or leave it unchanged over the years the blue slip has undergone various changes the blue slip originated as tool used by committee chairmen to gather information on nominee starting in 1956 chairman james eastland changed the strictly informationgathering role of the blue slip to one in which homestate senator could stop all action on nomination when he or she returned negative blue slip or failed to return one twentythree years later in 1979 chairman edward m kennedy changed

confirmation process p 92 15 senatorial courtesy is defined as the senates practice of declining to confirm presidential nominee for an office in the state of senator of the presidents party unless that senator approves sometimes called the courtesy of the senate the practice is customary one and not always adhered to senator sometimes invokes the custom by declaring that the nominee is personally obnoxious or personally objectionable to him see walter kravitz congressional quarterlys american congressional dictionary 3rd ed washington cq press 2001 p 231 16 binder blue slips sink ships institutionalizing senatorial courtesy p 21 crs5 the policy by informing his colleagues that when senator failed to return blue slip he would let the full committee vote on whether to proceed in 1981 the next chairman senator strom thurmond continued senator kennedys policy but in practice sometimes permitted the movement of judicial nomination even when homestate senator returned negative blue slip twenty years later in 2001 chairman patrick leahy modified the blueslip policy to allow movement of judicial nomination only when both homestate senators had returned positive blue slips finally in 2003 chairman orrin hatch changed the blueslip policy twice once at the beginning of the 108th congress chairman hatch modified the policy to permit committee action even if negative blue slip was returned provided that the president had consulted with both homestate senators the second instance occurred just before the 2003 august recess when chairman hatch scheduled hearing on judicial nomination even though both home state senators returned negative blue slips17 considerations for possible future blue slip changes recent proposals and the effects they might have on blueslip policy include the following abolish the blueslip system through the use of timetables in late httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21674 2002 president george w bush proposed that the senate be required to vote on judicial nominations not more than 12 months after judicial vacancy occurs18 this change would ensure that individual senator could indefinitely prevent senate action on judicial nomination the 12month time limit would however take the enforcement role played by blue slips out of the confirmation process because the senate would be required to act on judicial nomination within the year time frame even if the homestate senator had presented negative blue slip institutionalize the blueslip process through formal rules19 this modification suggested by professor denning would benefit senators by making the blueslip policy clearer because the judiciary committee would agree to blueslip rule each congress if the blueslip process were more transparent denning contends it would lessen the need for senators to use outside sources which tend to give conflicting histories of the blue slip to gain institutional or historical knowledge of blue slips on the other hand by creating blueslip rule others say the process of modifying the blue slip policy for special or unique circumstances may become too difficult to accomplish thus diminishing the blue slips flexibility and reducing its value in addition the committee might have difficulty in securing approval for blueslip rule each congress modify the blue slip to function as request only this change would allow the judiciary committee to use the blue slip as way to obtain information about judicial nominee from homestate senators without the process remaining an automatic block to committee action for more than 30 years the judiciary committee used the 17 chairman hatch has not referred to this incident as change in his blueslip policy therefore it is not clear if this modification is onetime change or something more permanent 18 for more information on president bushs proposal see crs report rs21506 implications for the senate of president bushs proposal on judicial nominations by betsy palmer 19 denning suggests memorializing the custom in senate rule or at least judiciary committee rule see denning the judicial confirmation process and the blue slip p 226 crs6 blueslip policy in this fashion20 as senator reportedly once stated the blue slip is useful to the committee for getting to know things utilized in the right way it can aid in developing information21 some observers have noted that as with the timetable alternative this modification would take the enforcement mechanism22 out of the hands of homestate senators the president would then be free they say to select anyone regardless of the views of the homestate senator httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21674 20 crs report rl32013 the history of the blue slip in the senate committee on the judiciary 1917present pp 89 21 quoting
