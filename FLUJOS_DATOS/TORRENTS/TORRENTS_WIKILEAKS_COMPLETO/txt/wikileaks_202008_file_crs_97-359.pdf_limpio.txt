their strategic offensive forces it would also ban all landbased missiles with multiple warheads mirved icbms in september 1997 the united states and russia signed protocol extending the elimination deadlines in start ii from the beginning of the year 2003 to the end of the year 2007 the two nations also agreed that they would begin negotiations on deeper reductions in start iii treaty as soon as start ii entered into force the united states senate gave its consent to the ratification of start ii in january 1996 the lower house of the russian parliament the duma began considering the treaty in 1995 but did not vote to approve it until april 14 2000 during its efforts to win approval officials in the yeltsin government stressed that start ii would serve russias interests because russia could not afford to retain its forces at start i levels they argued that start ii would allow russia to maintain parity with the united states by reducing us forces to levels that russian forces may decline to during the next decade as russia retires its older systems duma members criticized many provisions in the treaty arguing that they favored the united states and would undermine russias nuclear deterrent by forcing russia to eliminate its mirved icbms they believed russia could maintain parity with the united states without arms control reductions if it retained force of mirved icbms those who favored start iis ratification agreed that some provisions in the treaty may favor the united states but they maintained that russia could not afford to rebuild or retain its mirved icbm force instead they argued that russia could use the prospective start iii treaty to correct problems in start ii duma members have also expressed concerns about the economic implications of start ii in particular and russias strategic offensive forces in general many refused to support start ii ratification until the government presented plan to maintain and finance russias nuclear forces until the year 2010 some in the duma have linked start ii to us plans to deploy ballistic missile defenses they argue that these defenses would undermine russias nuclear deterrent particularly if russia had eliminated its mirved icbms the federal law on ratification links start ii implementation to continued us compliance with the 1972 abm treaty some in the duma have also linked start ii to natos inclusion of new members from the nations of central and eastern europe they believe that us and nato nuclear weapons may move closer to russias borders creating threat that russia might counter with its own nuclear weapons after many delays in 1998 and 1999 the duma finally voted to approve start ii ratification in april 2000 however the treaty still has not entered into force the us senate must give its consent to ratification of protocol that extends the elimination timelines in start ii in addition the federal law on ratification states that the treaty cannot enter into force until the united states approves several 1997 agreements that modify the 1972 abm treaty the us senate has not yet debated these agreements and some doubt that it will consent to their

protocol during summit meeting in helsinki in march 1997 presidents clinton and yeltsin agreed to amend start ii to extend the elimination period in the treaty in its original form start ii states that the parties must reduce their forces to treatyman dated levels by january 1 2003 but many in russia had expressed concerns about this deadline in part because start ii had not entered into force in 1993 as had been expected which sharply shortened the amount of time in the elimination period as result the united states and russia agreed to extend the elimination period by 5 years to december 31 2007 the two nations signed protocol formaliz ing this agreement on september 26 1997 at the same time in separate letters the two parties agreed that they would deactivate the weapons to be eliminated under the treaty either by removing warheads or taking other agreed steps by the end of 20033httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97359crs2 3continued 1997 4vladimir lukin chairman of the international

third strategic arms reduction treaty start iii as soon as start ii entered into force the two presidents agreed that start iii would limit each side to between 2000 and 2500 warheads on strategic offensive forces they also agreed that they would address warhead stockpiles and nonstrategic nuclear weapons in the negotiations the promise of further reductions in start iii responded to concerns that many in russia had raised about the economic burden of start ii force structure these analysts had noted that russia would have to build several hundred new single warhead missiles to retain its forces at start ii levels after it eliminated its mirved icbms with the lower limits in start iii russia could maintain parity with the united states without investing in large numbers of new systems4 although start ii has not yet entered into force the united states and russia began discussions on general principles for start iii in 1999 in addition in june 1999 presidents clinton and yeltsin agreed that the two nations would conduct more detailed discussions about start iii in conjunction with discussions about possible modifications to the 1972 abm treaty during the latter half of 1999 although these discussions were not linked to start ii directly some analysts believed that progress on start iii could help address some of the concerns that members of the russian duma had expressed about start ii ratification process the united states senate gave its advice and consent to the ratification of start ii in january 1996 president clinton has stated that he will submit the september 1997 protocol after the russian parliament approves start ii president yeltsin initially submitted start ii to the russian parliament in 1995 he resubmitted it with the new protocol in april 19985 the

start ii treaty must not be delayed any longer an interview with rear admiral valentin kuznetsov in continuedearly 1998 leaders in the duma stated that they would probably debate the treaty and vote on its ratification before the end of the session in june 1998 but they failed to accomplish this objective many observers attribute this delay to domestic politics in april president yeltsin had forced the duma to approve sergei kiriyenko as his choice for prime minister many members responded to their loss in this confrontation by refusing to address other yeltsin priorities like the start ii treaty6 furthermore few members seemed interested in the treaty june meeting with defense minister sergeyev and foreign minister primakov attracted fewer than 50 duma members the duma resumed work on start ii during its fall session and it had drafted law on ratification for the treaty by the end of november 1998 it planned to begin debate on the treaty in december but the communist party delayed that debate because the duma did not yet have draft law on financing for the nations strategic nuclear forces many believed that start ii should not be approved without this law nevertheless officials in the yeltsin government continued to press for start ii approval and many began to believe the duma would act by the end of december however it again delayed its consideration of the treaty after the us and british air strikes on iraq in middecember the treatys future clouded again after the united states announced its plans in january 1999 to negotiate amendments to the 1972 abm treaty however after prime minister primakov again pressed the duma to ratify the treaty in midmarch 1999 the duma leadership sent the draft law on ratification to president yeltsin for his approval he approved the draft and returned it to the duma in late march 1999 on march 19 the dumas leadership announced that it had scheduled debate and vote to begin on april 2 1999 however this debate was canceled after nato forces began their air campaign in yugoslavia after russias parliamentary elections in late 1999 weakened support for the communist party which had led the opposition to start ii many observers concluded that chances for treaty ratification had improved furthermore on december 31 1999 president yeltsin resigned so the duma could longer delay action on the treaty to counter president yeltsins policies the acting president vladimir putin expressed his support for the treaty and pressed for ratification in meetings with duma leaders he made the treaty priority after his election to the presidency in late march 2000 and succeeded in winning an affirmative vote in the duma on april 14 although the duma delayed vote on start ii for several years senior officials in the

position as head of the strategic rocket forces his opinion probably holds more weight than the lukewarm support offered by his predecessor defense minister rodionov these officials all argued that russia could not afford to maintain its forces at the levels permitted in the start i treaty and therefore must reduce to start ii or lower levels for economic reasons they also argued that with its forces declining anyway russia could only maintain parity with the united states if start ii compels the united states to reduce its forces as well8 furthermore they noted that the protocols delay in the elimination deadline to 2007 means that russia would not have to spend any additional money eliminating weapons systems under start ii they argued that these weapons would reach the end of their service lives in this time frame and would have been eliminated anyway9 many members of the duma and other analysts in russia expressed strong doubts about start ii some opposed the treaty because they generally opposed the national security policies of the yeltsin government and start ii is symbol of such policies some opposed start ii because they objected to other areas of us policy for example some in russia argued that the us congressional passage of legislation that would impose sanctions on russian firms if they sold missile technology to iran would hurt start ii specificallyyevgeny primakov who was russias foreign minister at the time reportedly notified the united states that these sanctions would delay start ii passage10 many however have enumerated concerns that derive from the provisions in the treaty and its relationship to russias national security these criticisms coalesced around few key issues force structure and economic implications of start ii the effects of us missile defense deployments on russias nuclear deterrent and the effect that nato expansion might have on russias military security and political stature duma concerns concerns with start ii provisions force structure issues some members of the duma argued that the start ii treaty is not in russias national security interest because it would eliminate the core of

their infrastructure rokhlin says start2 will cause rearmament fbissov96181 september 17 1996 12a report prepared for the cprf communist party of the russian federation faction of the duma stated that the start ii treaty virtually preserves the existing structure of american strategic offensive weapons and calls for relatively little effort in the conversion of the landbased component of us icbms see cprf report on start ii ratification fbistac96001l october 2 1996 p 19 in addition an unidentified member of the duma defense committee reportedly said some of the defense committees members believe the treatys provisions concerning the destabilising role of intercontinental ballistic missiles with separable warheads are discriminatory because the provisions cover groundbased missiles which are the bulk of the russian missile forces but do not similarly affect sea launched missiles which spearhead the us force duma expert predicts difficult start2 job for perry fbissov96201 october 16 1996disintegration in russias conventional forces many see these nuclear weapons as key measure of russias superpower status furthermore without mirved icbms many argue that russia would not be able to retain 3500 warheads on its deployed forces as it eliminates its mirved icbms and the other icbms and slbms that will reach the end of their service lives during the next decade russias strategic offensive forces could fall to around 1500 warheads under current economic circumstances russia could not afford to build hundreds of new singlewarhead missiles to retain parity with the united states even at start ii levels11 at the same time the critics note that start ii does not ban mirved slbms which constitute the bulk of the us strategic offensive force12 therefore the treaty favors the united states and does not serve russias interests some in the duma have also argued that start ii favors the united states because the united states can take greater advantage of the downloading provisions in the treaty these provisions permit both parties to reduce their forces by removing warheads from deployed missiles rather than by eliminating the missiles altogether however the treaty allows the parties to remove maximum of 4 warheads from each missile because the majority of russias mirved icbms carry 10 warheads downloading by 4 warheads would not leave these missiles with single warhead as result russia will have to eliminate the missiles entirely most of the us mirved icbms in contrast carry only 3 warheads so the united states can download these missiles to singlewarhead status in addition the united states can download rather than eliminate its trident missiles to reduce these forces to the treaty limit of 1750 warheads on slbms because the treaty permits these seabased systems to carry multiple warheads critics in the duma claim that this imbalance in the treatys downloading provisions is unfair to russia for two reasons first russia would have to eliminate far greater number of missiles than the united states and second the united states would have far greater reconstitution potential if it withdrew from the treaty and restored its forces to higher levels by some calculations the united states would be able to keep 2000 unloaded warheads from its minuteman iiihttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97359crs6 13podberezkin alexei and anton

for their operational deployment on launchers13 although start iis critics have been vocal in enumerating their concerns with the treaty many who support ratification agree that the treaty favors the united states as result there are generally two schools of thought among duma members about solutions to these force structure problems some believe russia should reject start ii and pursue its own course in strategic offensive forces others believe russia should approve start ii and use the negotiations on start iii to correct the flaws in start ii some of those who argue against start ii ratification contend that russia should retain its mirved icbms to maintain strategic balance with the united states they argue that russia could extend the service lives of its existing ss18 icbms and eventually construct new facility to produce new large ballistic missiles they could not use the facility that produced the existing missiles because it is located in ukraine14 furthermore without the start ii ban on mirved icbms they argue that russia could arm its new ss27 singlewarhead icbm with three warheads on each missile this too would allow russia to maintain greater number of warheads on its strategic forces to accommodate this alternative some argue that even if russia agreed to reduce its forces to start ii levels it should seek to amend the treaty to remove the ban on mirved icbms those who argue that russia should approve start ii and move quickly to start iii believe that this is the only way for russia to maintain parity with the united states in strategic offensive forces and many believe that this parity is essential because they see russias nuclear forces as one of the sole remaining indicators of russias superpower status hence it could be politically unacceptable for russian officials to advocate that russia allow itself to become less of nuclear superpower than the united states some who hold this view contend that russia cannot afford to extend and replace its current force of large mirved icbms as result the us advantage would be far greater without start ii than it would be under that treaty because the united states could retain its forces at start i levels while russian forces declined due to economic pressures and the aging of its systems as result they argue that russia should seek to reduce us forces to around 1500 warheads the number russia may have in 10 years through start iii treaty15 in addition although many agree that the us advantage under start iis downloading provisions is unacceptable they argue that the parties should resolve the problem in start iii treaty possibly by mandating the elimination of warheadshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97359crs7 16arbatov alexei georgiyevich and colonel petr borisovich

and article 7 unofficial translation provided by the pir center moscow april 14 continuedremoved from missiles this would prevent the united states from reloading those warheads on its missiles16 critics of this second school of thought believe that russia cannot rely on start iii to resolve the problems in start ii they argue that the framework reached in helsinki does not assure that the united states and russia will ever conclude treaty they note that the united states might have little interest in doing so precisely because it benefits so much from the provisions in start ii as result they fear that russia would approve start ii anticipating start iii but end up with only start ii in place17 economic issues as was noted above officials in the yeltsin government argued that russia could not afford to maintain its forces at start i levels and therefore must approve start ii so that the united states would have to reduce its forces to the same lower levels that russian forces will fall to as older systems are retired most members of the duma appear to agree with this assessment but many have questioned whether start ii is the solution to this problem they note that the elimination of mirved icbms and the retirement of aging submarines would further reduce russian forces to around 1500 warheads by the year 2010 and they contend that russia cannot afford to build new systems at rate needed to support force structure at start ii levels these force structure calculations were one of the key factors that convinced many in russia to pursue start iii treaty with the united states either immediately after or in place of start ii but for many in the duma the promise of further reductions in start iii was not enough they questioned whether the government had plan to maintain russias nuclear forces under start ii or start iii and whether the government would provide the funds needed for these forces in the future the absence of such plan is one of the reasons that some gave for the delay in the dumas debate on start ii in 1998 18 as result the federal law on start ii ratification contains condition stating that the government must provide stable and primary financing of the russian strategic nuclear forces it also mandates that the president of the russian federation present the parliament with program on the development and financing of russias strategic nuclear forces later than two months after the federal law on start ii ratification enters into force19 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97359crs8 19continued 2000 20this treaty and its 1974

concerns about possible us nmd deployment escalated in 1999 after the clinton administration added funds to the defense departments future years budget to support deployment and stated that the president would decide whether to proceed in june 2000 the administration has sought to negotiate amendments to the abm treaty with russia so that the united states can deploy its nmd site in alaska rather than around icbm silos in north dakota but several officials have stated that the united states could withdraw from the treaty if the talks fail russian officials have stated that changes in

start ii to us plans to develop and possibly deploy national ballistic missile defense system nmd particularly if such deployment exceeds the limits in the 1972 antiballistic missile abm treaty20 some argue that russia should not enter into another arms control agreement with the united states if the united states is unwilling to abide by past commitments others contend that nationwide missile defense system in the united states would undermine russias national security21 few believe that the united states will limit its missile defenses to small number of interceptors directed against threats from rogue nations they note that some members of congress have suggested far more extensive deployments and that even if the united states begins with limited intentions it might eventually deploy more extensive defensive system22 several duma members have argued that russia will find it difficult to maintain an effective nuclear deterrent without multiplewarhead icbms if the united states deploys an nmd because mirved missiles provide costeffective means to penetrate ballistic missile defenses23 and the problem could become more acute if as expected the number of warheads on

ratification of the treaty between the russian federation and the united continuedforces even limited abm system could cast serious doubt on the capacity of the russian strategic nuclear forces to inflict guaranteed unacceptable damage on the us side in retaliatory actions24 these concerns have led many in the duma to conclude that russia should reserve the right to withdraw from start ii if the united states withdraws from the abm treaty this view is codified in the federal law on start ii ratification which notes that us withdrawal from the abm treaty could be viewed as an extraordinary event giving russia the right to withdraw from start ii25 president putin appeared to support this approach when he stated during the dumas debate on start ii that russia would pull out of the entire system of agreements on strategic nuclear forces as well as start ii if the united states dismantles the abm treaty26 the united states is unwilling to accept formal linkage between russian approval of start ii and continuing us compliance with the abm treaty officials in the united states have long argued that the two treaties are independent and each enhances the security of both parties some in the duma have also argued that us plans for the deployment of advanced theater missile defenses tmd could undermine russias deterrent because defenses deployed close to russian territory could intercept russias longrange ballistic missiles27 the united states and russia sought to address these concerns in two agreed statements on theater missile defenses and the abm treaty that they signed in septembe r 1997 these agreements do not limit the capabilities of us tmd systems but both nations have stated that they would not deploy tmd systems in way that could pose realistic threat to the strategic offensive forces of the other side28 the duma also approved the ratification of these agreements on april 14 2000 and it highlighted the connection between these agreements and start ii in

tactical nuclear weapons along russias borders would be able to strike strategi c targets inside russia30 these critics note that russia cannot offset the increased threat from nato forces with its own weakened conventional forces31 hence russia must maintain nuclear forces to guarantee its security in the face of an expanded nato32 some believe russia should rely on nonstrategic nuclear weapons such as short range missiles and aircraft to counter natos conventional superiority this is analogous to natos reliance on nuclear weapons during the cold war to counter the advantage of soviet and warsaw pact conventional forces others however believe russia should respond to natos enlargement by increasing its reliance on strategic nuclear forces where increased reliance on nonstrategic nuclear weapons would represent military response in the absence of sufficient conventional forces an increased reliance on strategic nuclear weapons would represent more of political response those who support this type of response contend that nation would threaten russia with conventional or nuclear weapons if russia maintained strong and credible nuclear deterrent strategic nuclear forces would not only serve as key measure of this deterrents strength they would also remind nations that russia is nuclear superpower to be reckoned with33httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97359crs11 33continued broadscale aggression by conventional armed forces and arms against it or its allies the report also states that russia cannot be assured of keeping the status of great power under present conditions

states of america on further reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms article 2 unofficial translation provided by the pir center moscow april 14 2000 35see duma mp says start ii difficul t to ratify in present form interfax june 20 1998although the united states and its nato allies have held extensive discussions with russia in an effort to ease concerns about nato enlargement officials in the united states do not see any link between natos plans and the start ii treaty instead most agree that the duma and others in russia have linked the two in an effort to gain leverage and attract attention for russias views on nato enlargement nevertheless the duma expressed its concerns in the federal law on start ii ratification stating that the deployment of nuclear weapons on the territories of states that joined nato after start ii was signed could be considered to be an extraordinary event giving russia the right to withdraw from start ii34 the path to start ii ratification and implementation during 1996 many us arms control analysts believed that the duma would eventually approve the start ii treaty many expected vote to occur after the june 1996 presidential elections in russia and november 1996 elections in the united states after secretary of defense perry received strongly negative response when he addressed the duma in october 1996 however growing numbers of analysts in the united states began to doubt that the duma would ever approve start ii not only had the dumas suspicions of us and nato intentions increased but the list of start ii issues of concern to duma members seemed too long and the nature of their concerns seemed too complex to solve without changing the treaty or other areas of us policy in ways that the united states would find unacceptable this pessimism began to ease in late 1997 after the united states and russia signed the protocol to start ii and agreed on framework for start iii many expected these agreements to address the key concerns voiced by the most influential members of the duma president yeltsin assured the united states that he would press the duma to ratify the treaty and as was noted above the duma initially had the treaty on its agenda for its session during the first half of 1998 during that session sentiments towards the treaty did appear to shift towards the positive for example vladimir lukin chairman of the international relations committee and former ambassador to the united states expressed his support for the treaty lev rohklin the chairman of the defense committe who opposed ratification was replaced by roman popkovich he has also opposed ratification if the treaty remains in its current form but believes that conditions attached the draft law on ratification could address his concerns35httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97359crs12 but in the first half of 1998 russias domestic political problems intervened to delay debate on start ii during the first few months of the year the duma focused on budget issues and domestic policies then president yeltsin fired prime minister chernomyrdin and restructured the government this not only diverted the dumas attention away from start ii it also led to the showdown over sergei kiriyenko which soured relations between yeltsin and the duma even when the duma did address start ii few appeared interested the june 16 meetings at the general staff attracted fewer than 50 deputies even though those who organized the meeting had expected more than 150 to attend when the domestic pressure s eased in the latter half of 1998 leaders in the duma again promised to address start ii officials in the yeltsin government continued to press for start ii approval and many began to believe the duma would act by the end of december it had completed draft law on ratification and draft law on financing for strategic offensive forces however us military actions and their negative effects on usrussian relations led to further delays the duma delayed its consideration of the treaty after the us and british air strikes on iraq in middecember and then again after nato forces began their air campaign in yugoslavia in march 1999 these problems were compounded by russias negative reaction to the us announcem ent in january 1999 that it planned to negotiate amendments to the 1972 abm treaty so that it could deploy an nmd site in alaska many observers view the dumas approval of start ii on april 14 2000 as result of support from newlyelected president putin in spite of continuing strains in us russian relations his background and reputation for toughness along with his support for and from the military when combined with the losses suffered by the communists in the parliamentary elections in december 1999 allowed him to win enough votes to ensure the treatys approval but the dumas vote does not yet assure that start ii will enter into force or that implementation will be smooth and speedy this is in part due to the fact that the united states and russia remain at odds over possible modifications to the abm treaty president putin and other russian officials have made it clear that russia could withdraw from start ii if the united states withdraws from the abm treaty to deploy an nmd site in alaska and the russian federal law on ratification states that start ii cannot enter into force until the united states approves the protocol that extends the time line for eliminations the agreed statements on demarcation that modify the 1972 abm treaty and the memorandum of understanding on succession to the abm treaty the clinton administration had planned to submit these documents to the senate for its advice and consent after the duma approved start ii but some reports indicate that it may withhold these agreements until the united states and russia reach broader agreement on abm treaty modifications that would permit the deployment of us nmd site in alaska regardless the us senate could refuse to consent to the ratification of any modifications to the abm treaty in part because some members believe the treaty should lapse so that the united states can deploy more robust nmd if this were to happen then the future of start ii and followon start iii treaty would be in doubt some however have argued that the dumas vote is less relevant to the implementation of start ii than it is to the broader arms control process inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97359crs13 particular they note that now that the duma has approved start ii the united states and russia can move forward on start iii negotiations in the wake of the start ii vote president putin stated that russia would like start iii to reduce us and russian forces to 1500 warheads rather than the 20002500 warheads outlined in the helsinki framework agreement and because these discussions are linked to the talks on modifications to the abm treaty some observers believe that the united states may agree to deeper cuts in offensive forces if russia agrees to modify the abm treaty hence according to this school of thought start ii implementation may be less relevant because the next round of negotiations could produce agreements that not only mandate deeper reductions in offensive forces but meet both nations national security interests others however remain skeptical they argue that it will be difficult for the united states and russia to reach agreement on the details for start iii in part because the united states does not want to cut its forces as deeply as russia has suggested and even if the two nations reach agreement on both start iii and abm modifications there are assurances that either sides legislative branches will approve their ratification the us senate in particular may consider rejecting the agreements because they either provide for too much reduction in us offensive forces or too little relief from the constraints of the abm treaty and russias duma may object if it views the agreements as providing for too much relief from the abm treaty or not enough reduction in offensive forces hence even if the vote on start ii is viewed as an entry into further progress on the arms control agenda the future remains uncertain
