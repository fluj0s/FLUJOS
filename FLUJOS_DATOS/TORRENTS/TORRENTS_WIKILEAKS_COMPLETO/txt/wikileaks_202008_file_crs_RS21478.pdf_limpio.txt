thailands foreign exchange reserves decline in the stock market bankruptcies am ong number of major thai banks and corporations and sharp deterioration of propert prices the combination of these shocks led to sharp economic downturn ten years prior to the 1997 crisis thailand had been one of the worlds fastest growing economies be tween 1990 nd 1996 gross domestic product gdp averaged 86

asean initiative eai which seeks closer economic ties with asean countries including bilateral free trade agreements with countries that are committed to economic reforms and openness 9 the white house fact sheet on free trade and thailand october 19 2003proposal for usthailand fta several policymakers have urged the bush administration to seek free trade agreement with thailand in order to deepen commercial and political relations between the two nations promote economic reform in thailand reward thailand for its cooperation with the united states on number of issues including the us war against terrorism and provide new opportunities for us exporters in october 2002 the united states and thailand signed trade and investment framework agreement tifa in order to resolve bilateral economic issues and to initiate discussions on the possibility of negotiating bilateral free trade agreement8 in june 2003 president bush and thailands prime minister thaksin met and issued joint statement indicating their desire to resolve issues being discussed under the tifa i ncluding ipr investment and customs procedures as first step toward possible free trade agreement subsequent talks under the tifa resolved number of ipr and customs valuation issues as result on october 19 2003 during state visit by pres ident bush to thailand the two sides formally announced they would begin ft talks on february 12 2004 the ustr formally notified congress of its intent to begin negotiations with thailand for fta economic and political benefi ts and costs of an fta although it is not yet clear what usthailand fta would entail it is likely that such an agreement would provide overall economic benefits to both sides white house fact sheet contends that an fta with thailand would boost us exports particularly of ag ricultural products and range of services and would boost th investment climate for us firms9 most economists argue that lowering trade barriers reduces costs for consumers and promotes economic efficiency boosting economic growth for all national participants in an fta for example economists maintain that significant reduction in thailands tariff barriers on us agricultural products would likely lowe r prices for all such products in thailand boosting us exports to thailand and increasin g the economic welfare of thai consumers by increasing their purchasing power the same benefits are projected to accrue to thai exporters and us consumers if us trade barriers were lowered similarly reduction in thai barriers on auto parts trade would likely boost us exports of auto parts to thailand lowerpriced auto parts would ma ke manufacturers of au tos in thailand more competitive by lowering their costs on the other hand some economists argue that bilateral ftas lead to trade diversion wher production and trade is diverted away from efficient producers outside the free trade area to less efficient producers who are inside the free trade area in addition lowering tr ade barriers produces both winners and losers the losers are in those sectors which face tougher competition because they are longer receiving the same level of pr otection they once did in order to remain competitive they must cut costs those that cannot remain competitive must exit the market resulting in job losses in that sector as result sect ors in both countries that might be negatively affected by usthailand fta may oppose ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21478crs6 10 one concern expressed by thai opponents to the ft is that us efforts to obtain stronger ipr protection on patents will prevent thailand from gain ing access to low cost drugs such as those used by hivaids patients us negotiators deny this would occurstatus of fta negotiations the two sides completed their sixth r ound of fta negotiations in chiang mai thailand on january 1013 2006 although us negotiators stated that some progress was made they expressed disa ppointment over the lack of pr ogress in the talks major stumbling blocks reportedly include us proposals on intellectual property rights10 and liberalization of the services sector includi ng distribution financial services such as banking insurance and securities brokerage and telecommunications thai officials have sought to reduce high us tariffs on lig ht trucks 25 and re strictions on sugar imports in addition the january 2006 fta talks were reportedly temporarily disrupted by an estimated 10000 thai protesters on january 19 2006 thailands lead negotiator in the usthailand fta talks nitya pibulsonggram resigned as result it is unclear whether the us goal of completing the fta negotiations by spring 2006 will be achieved
