programs review and analysis of the allocation of funds to institutions and the distribution of aid to students summary the federal supplemental educational pportunity grant federal workstudy and federal perkins loan programs are collectively referred to as the campusbased financial aid programs largel because participating institu tions play central role in their operation and because the aid they make available to student s comprises federal funds matched in part with institutional funds in r ecent years the programs have been criticized because large share of f unding is allocated to institutions on the basis of amounts received in prior years for base guarantees as opposed to being allocated exclusively on the basis of aggregate student financial need they also have been criticized because the current funding procedures allow institutions that receive proportionately greater funding on perstudent basis to provide larger awards to students with higher income s than can be provided to lowerincome students at institutions that receive less f unding in recent congress bills have been introduced to modify the funding procedures by gradually phasing out base guarantee funding and requiring all campusbased f unding to be allocated to institutions according to existing needbas ed fair share formulas this report describes and analyzes the process through which federal funds are allocated to institutions under the cam pusbased programs b the potential for allocating all campusbased funding accordin g to the existing needbased formulas and c the current distribution of aid to students it will be updated to track legislative proposals addressing the cam pusbased allocation procedures major findings presented in the report include the following under each program the majority of f unds are allocated to institutions on the basis of amounts received in prior years while only modest amount are allocated according to aggregate student financial need as calculated acco rding to fair share formulas under the needbased formulas the cost of attendance at an institution is the dominant factor in determining institutional need much greater amounts of instituti onal need are calculated on per student basis at highcost institutions than at lowcost institutions at lowcost institutions institutional need comprises limitedamounts of aggregate student need attributable to large numbers of predominately lowincome students while at highcost institutions it tends to comprise greater amounts of need attributable to smaller number of mostly middle and upperincome students it is estimated that if the allocation procedures were to be modified so that funding was allocated enti rely on the basis of institutions proportionate share of institutional need more institutions would receive allocation increases than would receive allocation decreases larger proportions of students at highercost institutions receive campusbased aid and receive larger awards than do comparable students at lowercost institutions however average awards at highercost institutions cover smaller percentage of costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32775contents overview of the

three needbased federal student aid fsa programs authorized under the higher education act of 1965 as amended hea1 the federal supplemental educational opportunity grant fseog pr ogram the federal workstudy fws program and the federal perkins loan program are collectively referred to as the campusbased financial aid programs the programs are called the campusbased programs largely because par ticipating institutions of hi gher education ihes have significant role in administering the programs and because they must use institutional funds to match the federal funds they receive for the operation of the programs in contrast to other needbased fsa programs in which aid is awarded to students according to nondiscretionary crite ria the financial aid administrators of participating ihes have discretion in determining the mix and amount of aid individual students receive from funds ma available under the programs the fseog program allows ihes to provide grant aid to undergraduate students who have not yet earned first baccalaur eate degree the fws program supports undergraduate and graduate students through subsidized parttime employment under the perkins loan program ihes use federal capital contributions fccs to help establish revolving loan funds from which they make lowinterest loans to undergraduate and gradua students over 38 billion in financial aid is awarded annually to students unde r the three programs the programs are popular with many ih and financial aid administrators because of the flexibility they provide to tailor aid to meet the specific needs of students and for the ability to shift funds between programs the programs have come to be criticized however for the way in which the majority of funding provided for the programs is allocated to institutions in proportion to the amount they received in previous award years as oppos ed to being allocated entirely according to the aggregate financial need of th students attending each institution the programs have also been criticized because the current distribution of funds allows institutions that receive pr oportionately more funding on perstudent basis to

incomes than can be awarded at other institutions2 some have proposed modifying th campusbased programs funding procedures to gradually phase out the curre nt practice of allocating the majority of funds to institutions on the basis of the amounts they received in prior years and to require that all funding eventually be provided in proportion to the aggregate financial need of students at participating institutions3 others have expressed concern that amending the allocation pro cedures without also providing increased funding for the campusbased programs overa ll might result only in making more aid available to needy students at some institutions at the expense of needy students at those institutions that would experience funding decreases4 in the 109th congress hr 609 as introduced in the house woul d have amended the allocation procedures for the campusbased programs to gradually phase out provisions that provide for the allocation of funds on the basis of the am ounts institutions received in prior years so that eventually all funds would be allocated to ins titutions on the basis of their aggregate student financial need5 however these provisi ons were removed during consideration of the bill and hr 609 as passed by the house would have retained the current allocation procedures the senate bill to reauthorize the hea in the 109th congress s 1614

discussion of the development of the allocati on procedures and significant changes to them over the history of the programs next the report analyzes the allocation of funds to ihes according to the current allocation procedures focusing on key aspects of these procedures that largely affect the distribution of funds to institutions the report then discusses issues related to the campusbased programs that may be considered as the 110th congress debates reauthoriz ation of the hea in particular it examines how the distribution of funds to institutions might be affected should the current allocation procedures for the programs be amended to phase out the allocation of funds on the basis of prior year allocations in favor of providing ins titutions with funding entirely on the basis of aggregate student need as had been proposed in prior congresses the report concludes with review and an alysis of the distri bution of campusbased financial aid to different ty pes of students at

financial aid programs under each of the campusbased programs the us department of education ed allocates funds to participating ihes according to complex twostage procedure these allocation procedures are specified in the authorizing statute of each program while there are slight differences between programs the allocation procedures all share the same basic framework in the first stage

equal to some portion of the funds it received in fy1999 however there are also procedures for allocating base guarantee to ihes that began participating in campusb ased program after fy1999 in the second stage any funds remaining after the allocation of base guarantees are allocated to ihes according to needbas ed formula allocation procedures under the allocation formulas for the programs each

first for base guarantees and then for fair share increases can be traced back to procedures developed in the late 1970s and first put into place for the 19791980 award year7 funding for the campusbased pr ograms previously was allocated according to different twostage procedur in which funds first were apportioned on statebystate basis according to the student population in each state and then suballocated to ihes on the basis of the st udent need at institutions within each state according to procedure called the panel review process under the panel review process institutions would apply to receive share of the funds allocated to their state based on the projected financial need of their students regional panel would then review the institutions applications and determine the amount of funding each ihe would receive in the mid1970s the panel review proce ss became subject to criticism for being too complex and timeconsuming and for leading to inequities in the distribution of aid to students8 in response the us office of education convened panel of experts to study nd make recommendations on how to allocatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32775crs5 9 us office of

implementation of new allocation procedures over time these procedures have been modified slightly however the same basic structure remains at the time the new allocation procedures were adopted it was decided that in the first year of their implementation ihes would first be allocated funds in amounts comparable to what they had received in the past called the conditional guarantee this was the precursor to the current base guarantee funds remaining after the allocation of conditional guarantees would be allocated according to the fair share formulas in the first year of implementa tion conditional guarant ees were to be set at the greater of the amount of funds ihes had expended in either the 19771978 or 19781979 award years the next year they were to receive 90 of that amount in subsequent years conditional guarantees were to be gradually reduced until ultimately all funds we re allocated according to the fa ir share allocation procedures10 ultimately however conditiona l guarantees now called base guarantees were not phased out11 the majority of the funds appropriated for each of the three campusbased programs continues to be allocated for institutional base guarantees it is important to note that as appropria tions increase greater proportion of funding becomes available for fair share increases while decrease in appropriations results in proportionally more f unding being allocated for base guarantees the capacity of an ihe to award campusbased aid to eligible students is directly related to the amount of funds it receives the major factors determining each ihes allocation are its base guarantee its cost of attendance coa the number of fsa applicants and the expected family contributions efcs of those students the remainder of this first

than its fair share base guarantees are determined according to the following procedures first from the funds appropriated for any of the programs each ihe that participated in that particul ar

and recei ved larger allocation in its second year of participati on than in its first its base guarantee is equal to 90 of the allocation it received in its second year of participation in cases where the annual appropriation is insufficient to award ihes their full base guarantee according to any one of the abovementioned step s base guarantees that ar to be allocated according to that step are proportionally reduced and funds are to be allocated to institutions under any subsequent stages of the allocation procedures fair share allocations under each of the programs after the llocation

being met by selfhelp aid loans and employment the panel of experts responsible for developing the formulas decided that to maintain consistency with these ratios supplemental educational opport unity grants would provide grant aid up to the point of meeting 70 of college costs while funding for the other two programs would provide aid to meet up to 30 of college costs wh the formulas were

programs selfhel p need and adjusted selfhelp need respectively each measure what is essentially the same student need fair share procedures the calculations to determine an institutions fair share of funding its fair sh are shortfall and its fair share increase are relatively straightforward compared with the calculation of institutional need as was shown in figure 1 for any of the campusbased programs an institutions fair share is the amount of the annual appropr iation an institution would receive if all funds were allocated in the same proportion as the ra tio of institutional need relative to the national total of the institutional need of ll participating ihes an institutions fair share shortfall is the difference between its fair share amount and the amount it received as base guarantee funds remain ing after the allocation of base guarantees are allocated as fair share increases ihes receive fair share increases in proportion to their share of the national total of shortfalls21 total allocation in general an institutions total allocation is the sum of its base guarantee and its fair share increase however subsequent to the allocation of base guarantees and fair share increases small adjustments may be made to ihes allocations these include allocation reduc tions as penalty for the underutilization of funds in prior award years and the rea llocation of such funds to other ihes with remaining funding shortfalls analysis of the allocation of funds to institutions under the campusbased programs this part of the report analyzes the allo cation of funds to ihes according to the current campusbased allocati on procedures this analysis draws upon information from both the fiscal operations report and application to participate fisap and from 20042005 award year fy 2004 allocations data22 the two major components of the allocation procedures are analyzed the base guarantee and the fair share increase the primary unit of analysis us ed throughout the remainder of the report is categories of institutions grouped by aver age coa cost of attendance is used ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32775crs12 23 each quintile contains approximately but not exactly the same number of institutions because cut points between categories were rounded to the nearest hundred dollars for ease of presentation thus each grouping consists of institutions with coas falling within specified ranges the number of ihes with in each coa category varies from program to program because the various institutions have elected to participate in different combinations of programs program participation by institutional coa category is shown in table 12 finally since coa is calculated separately for undergraduate students and graduate and professional students weighted av erage of the two is used in this analysisthe primary unit of analysis because as variable in the fair share allocation formulas coa has an important impact in affecting the allocation of funds to institutions later it will be shown that there are also large differences among categories of institutions grouped by coa in the percentage of students awarded campusbased aid and in average award amounts institutional coa as unit of analysis categories of institutions grouped by c oa are the primary unit of analysis used in this report these categories were created by simply ranking all the ihes that participate in one or more of the cam pusbased programs in descending order according to their average coa and then grouping them into quintiles containing approximately equal numbers of institutions23 the top quintile of ihes was further subdivided into two subgroups with the t op subgroup containing the top 5 of ihes ranked according to coa and the other subgroup containing the next

and proprietary institutions are distributed somewhat evenly across the lowermiddle to uppermiddl cost categories since the allocation formulas are based in large part on an institutions coa yet do not take into account its sector it is expected that the use of coa as unit of analysis will lead to more telling observations about how the allocation form ulas affect the amount of funds ihes receive and ultimately the distribution of ai d to students attending those institutions base guarantee as explained earlier under current law ihes participating in the campusbased programs receive base guarantee that b ears direct relations hip to the amount of funding they received in prior years at the time the fair share allocation formulas were introduced it was anticipated that base guarantees would eventually be phased out and that this would be done gradually in manner th at would not result in wild fluctuations in the amount of funds ins titutions received for the fseog program provisions to phase out the base guarant ee were even included as part of the authorizing statute for period of time under the higher education amendments of 1980 p l 96374 the allocation procedures were amended to call for 20 decrease in each institutions base guar antee for every 20 million appropriated for the program in excess of 400 million ho wever the higher education act technical amendments of 1982 pl 97301 prevented this provision from being implemented since then base guarantees have remained part of the allocation procedures for each of the campusbased programs24 under the higher education amendm ents of 1986 pl 99498 the campus based allocation procedures were amended to provide ih with base guarantees equal to 100 of their 1985 allocation the revised allocation procedures also provided that after base guarantees were awarded 25 of the funds remaining from each programs appropriation were then allocated as pro rata shares to ihes in amounts pr oportional to their base guarantees only 75 of the funds remaining after the allocation of base guarantees were allocated according to the fair share formulas under the higher educati on amendments of 1998 pl 105244 the procedures for determining base guarantees were revised again these procedures described earlier in this report remain in effect prior to the higher education amendments of 1986 the campusbased allocation procedures had specified that f unds would first be apportioned to states primarily on the basis of the population in each state prior to being allocated to ihes thus an ihes allocation depended in pa rt on the state in which it was located since the 1986 amendments ed has allocated funds directly to ihes and the state in which an institution is located has not pl ayed direct role in funding allocations however the legacy of the base guarant ee allocation procedures has had the effect of perpetuating the distribution of funds to ih in manner that to an extent reflects the distribution of the stude nt age population across states and ihes institutionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32775crs14 need as they existed years ago given that institutions have grown at different rates and so has the aggregate financial need of their students some institutions base guarantees may be close to or even exceed their fair share of funds while others base guarantees may

table also shows d the percentage of total program funding that is allocated for base guarantees totals are provided for each program as well as by coa categories and by state the table shows that the majority of the funding provided for each of the campusbased programs is allocated to meet institutions base guarantees in the fws program twothirds of funding goes to base guarantees and for the perkins loan program over 92 of funding is provi ded to meet base guarantees there does not appear to be strong relationship between institutional coa and whether ihes receive funding only according to base guaran tee procedures or if they also receive fair share increase however in each of the programs middlecost ihes receive somewhat greater proportion of their fundi ng for base guarantees than do ihes on average also under the fseog program very highcost ihes are allocated much greater proportion of their funding for base guarantees than are ihes on average when examining the proportion of funds llocated for base gu arantees by state table 3 shows wide variation in the fseog and fws programs in some states more than 90 of funding goes toward mee ting base guarantees while in others base guarantees comprise less than half of total allocations this degree of variation may have resulted in part because in some states ihes may have seen considerable growth in institutional need since the base guarantee procedures were implemented whereas in others base guarantee funding meets or exceeds total institutional need for most institutions in the perkins loan program more than 90 of funds are allocated for base guarantees in all but few states this is likely because in contrast to the other two campusbased programs appropriations fo r perkins loan fccs have decreased substantially since the early 1980s when appropriations decrease base guarantees comprise greater proportion of total funding through fy2004 funds remained available for perkins loan fcc base guar antees and fair share increases despite declining appropriations largely because considerable number of institutions have ceased participation in the program d this not occurred it is likely that funds would have been available only for the allo cation of base guarantees funds were appropriated for perkins an fccs for fy2005 nor fy2006 given that more than half of funds appropriated for the campusbased programs are allocated for base guarantees if base guarantees were to be reduced or phased out so that all funds were allocated according to the fair share formulas there could be noticeable shift in the distribution of funds allocated to ihes any change in the distribution of funds to ihes would be due to the application of the fair share formulas the fair shar formulas are analyzed in the next

feasible for ihes to collect and report information on students actual efcs however the current practice of determining campusbased funding allocations prior to the start of each award ear still necessitates that fair share allocations be based on the characteristics of the student s that attended participating ihes in prior award years 27 at present dependent student receives an automatic

adjusted gross income or earned income is 16000 or less the fisap data analyzed in this report includes eligible students attending participating institutions in ay20022003 in which the income cutoff to receive an automatic zero was 13000 28 us department of education dear financial aid administrator letter cb949 may 1994 previously the highest income band was 45000 and above for undergraduate dependent students and 15000 and above for unde rgraduate independent students and for continuedfair share increases under the fair share formulas ihes are eligible to receive fair share increases to help reduce the shortfall between their ba guarantee and their fair share of funds earlier in this report it was shown that an institutions fair share is the amount of funds it would receive if th total appropriation were llocated entirely on the basis of institutional need it was also explained that institutional need is an expression of the relationship between the average cost of attendance coa at an institution and the average expected family contributions efcs of the fsa applicants who are students at that institution this section examines the relationship between coa and efc in detail and show s how this affects the amount of funds ihes receive for fair share increases average student efcs used in fair share formulas when the fair share formulas were developed uniform methodology was adopted in which average efcs are calculated for categories of students grouped by income bands and dependency status in lieu of using actual efcs of the students at each institution25 this procedure was adopted in part because it could be administratively burdensome for institutions to collect and report efcs for each student in attendance and because it is presumed that students with the sa dependency status and with comparable incomes will have similar efcs26 in implementing the fairshare formulas ed calculates average efcs for students categ orized into 14 income bands students who have received an automatic zero efc based on the information reported in their fafsa are assigned an efc of 027 the table of efcs is shown in table 1 the income bands used in the table of efcs are determined administratively by ed and have been adjusted only few times since the formulas were first implemented the last revision to the income bands ccurred in 1994 for the 19951996 award year when the highest income bands were raised to 60000 and above for dependent students and to 20000 and bove for independent student s and some lower income bands were consolidated28httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32775crs20 28 continued graduate and professional students 29 analysis of npsas 2004 data shows that with in some of the income categories used in the table of efcs the proportion of undergra duate independent students with dependents versus the proportion of undergraduate inde pendent students without dependents differs across institutional sectors 30 npsas 2004 data presented in figure 2 and figure 3 are filtered to include only students who applied for federal aid this repres ents an approximation of the population that completed fasfa which is the population used by ed in preparing the table of efcs this is larger population than that of stude nts who attend institutions participating in the campusbased programs since not all fafsa filers ultimately attend postsecondary institution there may be differences between the npsas sample and the complete fafsa database since the relationship between an instit utions coa and students average efcs determines its institutional n eed it is important that the average efcs for each income band reflect as closely as possible the actual efcs of students at participating institutions it appears however that with the growth in incomes that has occurred over the years the current income bands used in the fair share formulas may longer be as reliable proxy of actual student efcs for upperincome student s as they once were because so many students are in the highest income category at many institutions particularly highcost institutions students in the highest income category often comprise the largest group of students at lowcost ihes students in the higherincome categories do not contribute to the tabulation of institutional need because their composite efc is typically greater than the ihes coa however at highcost institutions the need calculated for students in the upper income ba nds often constitutes the majority of institutional need the table of efcs also does not take into account whether independent students have their own dependents in general for fsa purposes independent students with dependents and those without are categorized parately since slig htly more than half of undergraduate students are cl assified as independent fo r fsa purposes and with the significant effect that havi ng dependents typically has on lowering students efcs calculating average efcs for independent st udents without taking into account whether they have their own dependent s may result in average efcs that mask or cancel out the differences in efcs that exist for inde pendent students with dependents and those without dependents this could affect the calculation of institutional need if independent students with dependents and those without dependents are unevenly distributed across institutions for example if independent students with dependents attend certain institutions in greater or wer proportions than do independent students without dependents then the practice of co mbining all independent students as single group could result in lower or higher amounts of institutional need being calculated for them than otherwise might occur if inde pendent

up into mu ltiple categories in addition given the uneven distribution of indepe ndent students with and w ithout dependents across the various income bands it app ears that better approximations of

campusbased aid the amount of institutions allocations as dete rmined under the campusbased fair share formulas by design is based on the aggregate need of all students eligible for fsa aid at the institution in the current pos tsecondary education nvironment in which college costs have been rising rapidly in recent years it is not uncommon under the fair share formulas for institutional need at highercost ihes to be comprised largely of the financial need of middle and u pperincome students whereas at lowercost ihes institutional need is comprised primarily of the financial need of lower and middleincome students in many instances students attending highcost institutions who are from upperincome families have mo re financial need than students attending lowercost institutions who are from lowerincome families institutional need is the sum of the financial need of the students attending any particular ihe the critical factor in the calculation of institutional need is the relationship between institutional coa and students composite efcs at lowercost ihes upperincome students composite efcs are often so high relative to coa that under the formulas they do not

combined with the even greater need calculated for lowerincome students this can result in very high amounts of in stitutional need being calculated for high cost ihes figure 4 shows the average amount of need calculated under the fair share formulas for each prog ram by category of institution on perstudent basis figure 4 demonstrates that on perstudent basis the largest amounts of need are calculated for ihes with the highest coas while it is not surprising that students with any given efc will have more need if they attend institutions with high coas than if they attend lowercost institutions the effect that this has on the distribution of aid to institutions and the subsequent availability of aid to students attending these institutions is striking this is especially so because as will be shown later in this report low and middleincome students constitute the greatest proportion of students at lowcost ins titutions and upperincom students make up the greatest proportion of those attending hi ghcost institutions the design of the fair share formulas however results in si gnificantly greater amounts of need being calculated for students at highcost

b stedman and crs report rl31129 higher education tax credits and deduction an overview of the benefits and th eir relationship to tr aditional student aid by adam stoll james b stedman and linda levineof the aid shown in the pell grant and leapsleap category is pell grant aid with pell grants serving as the foundation of needbased aid for lowincome students it is not surprising that pell gr ants are received in the greatest amounts by students attending the lowestcost ihes wh ich are attended by lowincome students in the greatest proportions31 with few students at highcost schools receiving pell grants fseog need at these ihes is affect ed only slightly by the subtraction of pell grant aid the comparatively small am ount of leapsleap aid is distributed relatively evenly across categories of ihes and fseog need is not disproportionately affected by its subtraction in any category of institutions as previously mentioned the form ula for calculating fseog need was designed with the presumption that 75 of college costs would be met through the combination of students efc scholarships and grants in the current formula efc and federal grants pell grant and leapsleap aid ar subtracted from the amount of aggregate student need calculated in the formula to ensure that fseog funding is provided to supplement pell grant and ot her gift aid but not duplicate it since the time when the formulas were last amended higher education tax benefits eg the hope and lifetime learning tax credits and the higher education deduction have evolved as new type of federal financial assistance that shares an essential characteristic with gift aid namely that students or their parents receipt of the credits is not conditioned on any nonacademic obligation eg repayment of funds or service requirement gift aid and tax benefits may be referred to as obligation free aid 32 the fseog need formula however does not contain any provision that would account for the receipt of higher edu cation tax benefits by eligible students the different treatment of the various types of obligationfree aid could be of concern when considering their effect on the calculation of fseog need pell grants are targeted to lowincome students who disproportionately attend lowcost institutions while the hope and lifelong learning higher education tax credits are primarily beneficial to ddle and upperincome students since pell grants and leapsleap aid are subtr acted from the student need computed under the fseog need formula and hope and lifelong lear ning tax credits are not this may affect how closely fseog need as calculated represents actual aggregate student need while it appears that subtracting out tax credit aid might make the fseog need formula more equitable than it currently is in determining aggregate student need especially when distinguishing between institutions attended by students with different incomes there does not appear to be any easy way for ihes to gather and report the value of tax credits on the fi sap for use in the allocation of fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32775crs27 fws selfhelp need in the fws program the aggregate amount of institutional selfhelp need tabulated for di fferent types of students differs noticeably between categories of ihes figure 6 shows that in the category of institutions with the lowest coas more than 80 of all selfhelp need is attributable to either undergraduate independe nt students or to undergraduate dependent students who are from families with incomes below 24000 conve rsely in the category of ihes with the highest coas less than 8 of selfhel p need is attributable to these types of students while more than 80 is attri butable to either dependent undergraduate students from families with in comes above 60000 or to gr aduate and professional students for purposes of comparison it is important to note that the two highest cost categories of ihes account for the top 5 and 15 of ihes respectively based on coa while the other four categor ies each account for 20 of ihes figure 6 clearly shows that at highcost ihes very little selfhelp need is attributable to undergraduate independe nt students and lowerincome pendent students while the vast majority of selfhelp need is ttributable to upperi ncome dependent and graduate and prof essional students major reason why such large amounts of selfhelp need are calculated for the highestcost ihes has to do with the trea tment of graduate nd professional students in the formula for calculatin g selfhelp need for underg raduate students selfhelp need is calculated by multiplying the numbe r of students in each income band by the minimum of either 25 of the ihes average undergraduate coa or b the difference between undergraduate coa and the efc taken from the table of efcs for students in that income band howeve r for graduate and professional students selfhelp need is calculate d exclusively by multiplying the number of students in each income band by the difference between gr aduate and professi onal student coa and the efc taken from the table of efcs fo r students in each respective income band for undergraduate students 25 of coa is often the lesser of the two amounts and thus serves to limit the amount of sel fhelp need calculated for undergraduate students for graduate nd professional students the difference between coa and efc is often quite large especially at highercost ihes with highercost ihes often having large graduate pr ograms this characteristic of the selfhelp need formula contributes to highcost institutions having large amounts of institutional need this in turn provides them with higher funding allocationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32775crs28 perkins loan adjusted selfhelp need in the tabulation of institutional need for the perkins loan program figure 7 shows that similar to the fws program there is also wide variation across categor ies of ihes in the amount of institutional need attributable to different categories of students however in the perkins loan program an even greater proportion of ad justed selfhelp need is accounted for by students attending highercost ihes than is in the fws

additional funding it is estimated that smaller changes in fundi ng levels would occur for other categories of ihes since approximately 40 of fs eog funding is currently provided for fair share increases and because these fair shar increases are designed to close any gaps that exist between the amount of funding an ihe receives for its base guarantee and the amount it would be entitled to receive if all funding were allocated according to fair share procedures it may not be surprising that the elimination of base guarantees would result in only modest redistribution of funds across

antees by groups of ihes ranked by coa ay20042005httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32775crs36 summary in this part of the report estimates were presented of shifts that might occur in the distribution of campusbased funding allocations across categories of ihes should changes be made to pha out base guarantee fundi ng in favor of allocating funding entirely according to fair share crite ria these estimates showed that since it is often highercost ihes that currently receive less than their fair share as calculated according to the allocation proce dures these institutions in the aggregate would receive increased allocations if fundi ng were to be allocated solely according to existing fair share procedures since the fair share formulas calculate greater amounts of need on perstudent basis for ih with high costs than low costs this is not surprising the estimates presented in this part were based on the prospect of eliminating base guarantees in favor of allocating all funding accordin g to the existing fair share formulas in general it is estimated that this would result in more ihes experiencing allocation increases than decreases althoug h across categories of institutions higher cost ihes would experience allocations increases in the greatest proportions if proposals were also made to modify the calculation of institutional need in some way this could also affect the distributi on of funds for example if the amount of fseog need or adjusted selfhelp need calculated on perst udent basis under fair share formulas were to be limited to the federal share of fseog or perkins loan awards respectively the amount of ins titutional need calculated on perstudent basis would vary significantly less across ihes based on their cost of attendance additionally more accurate calculations of aggregate student need might also be obtained if the income categories used in the table of efcs were revised upward to better reflect the incomes current fsa applicants thus more significant changes in the distribution of funds across instituti ons could be brought about by both phasing out the funding for institutional base guar antees and by reexamining and modifying the fair share allocation procedures distribution of campusbased aid to students this last part of the report explores th distribution of aid to students under the campusbased programs the framework

27 2004 table 8 also shows that as institutional coa increases ihes are able to give larger fseog awards to greater proporti ons of students across almost all income bands perhaps what is most striking how ever is that at very highcost ihes greater percentage of undergraduate depe ndent students from fa milies with incomes as high as between 42000 and 60000 receive fseog aid than do students in any income range in the two lowestcost categories of ihes the average fseog awards provided to students at the highestcost ihes are also approximately four times as great as the amount received by students at lowcost ihes these findings are particularly noteworthy because ihes are required to award fseog aid first to students with exceptional financial need def ined as having the lowest efcs at the institutions with priority goin g to recipients of pell grants34 thus at some higher cost ihes even after awarding fseog aid to all eligible pell grant recipients there often remain sufficient funds to allow fse og aid to be provided to eligible students higher up the income ladder at lowerc ost ihes this typically is not the case given that at each participating instituti on priority in the awarding of fseog aid must go to pell grant recipients it may be interesting to see how the distribution of fseog aid compares with the distribution of pell grant aid table 9 shows for

value of fws awards provided to students and somewhat greater variation in the pr oportion of students receiving fws aid the modest variation across ihes in award am ounts is likely due in large part to the nature of the program being that aid is provided as compensation for parttime employment and because award amounts are dependent upon the number of hours worked and the hourly wage rate na

professional st udents b fseog students receiving fseog aid as percentage of only those undergraduate students eligible for fseog aidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32775crs49 summary and conclusions the procedures currently used to allocate funds to institutions under the campus based programs were developed several decades ago in response to concerns that had been raised about the inequitable distribu tion of funds when these procedures were developed it was envisi oned that funds would be allo cated according to series of formulas designed to provide each institu tion with funding in proportion to its fair share of aggregate student need to ease the transition to the new formulabased fair share method of allocating funds for limited period ihes were to receive conditional or base guaran tee of funding proportional to the amount they had received in base year however in stead of being phase d out over time base guarantees remain the primary method fo r allocating the majority of the funds appropriated for the campusbased programs in recent years proposals again have been made to phase out funding for base gu arantees and to transition to the allocation of funds to institutions entir ely on the basis of their fair share of aggregate student need to facilitate an understandi ng of the potential consequences of modifying the current procedures for allocating funds to institutions this report has set out to explain in detail the functioning of the current allocation procedures and the resulting distribution of aid to students throughout the report the distribution of funding to institutions and the distribution of aid to students was explored by grouping institutions into categories in rank order of their costs of attendance it was shown that under each of the campusbased programs the majority of funding is currently allocated to institutions on the basis of thei r institutional base guarantees in each of the programs there is only modest variation across categories of institutions in the proportion of total funding allocated to institutions on the basis of their base guarantees while there is somewhat mo re variation across institutions grouped by states most of the funding provided fo r the fseog and fws programs is allocated according to institutional base guarantees and nearly all is for the perkins loan program an analysis of the calculation of institutional need has shown that institutional coa plays critical role in determining the amount of aggregate need calculated under the fair share formulas for any particul ar ihe since coa varies widely across institutions vastly different amounts of need can be calculated on perstudent basis depending on the characteristics of the ins titution in many instances for highcost institutions the average amount of need calculated on perstudent basis greatly exceeds the maximum award amount and exceeds the federal share by an even greater amount when examined in the aggr egate for categories of institutions it was shown that at lowcost institutions institutional need is largely the aggregate need of undergraduate independe nt students and lowincome pendent students whereas at highercost institutions institutional need is largely the aggregate need of upper income undergraduate depende nt students and graduate and professional students it was also noted that for the fseog program aggregate student need is offset by pell grant aid which is targeted primarily at lowincome students while adjustments are made for higher education tax benefits which are beneficial primarily to middle nd upperincome studentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32775crs50 the prospect of eliminating the allo cation of funds for institutional base guarantees in favor of providing all funding on the basis of fair share criteria was also examined it was found that in the fse og program there would only be modest redistribution of funds across categories of ihes based on coa nonetheless there would be considerable amount of chur ning in the allocation of funds within categories and more institutions would receive an increase in funding than decrease for the fws and perkins loan programs if funds were to be allocated entirely on the basis of the fair share formulas very highcost ihes as category would receive funding increase due to the high aggregate need of their student bodies overall however more ihes would receive allocation increases than decreases if base guarantees were eliminated analysis of the distribution of aid to st udents revealed that despite there being strong correlation between students family income and the cost of attendance at the institution student attends larger proportions of students at highcost institutions receive campusbased aid than st udents at lowcost institutions in the fseog program award amounts are larger at highcost ihes than at lowcost ones while in the fws and perkins loan programs awards tend to be of similar values across institutions and student groups hi ghercost institutions are more likely to participate in all three campusbased programs than are lowercost institutions however even when examining only institutions that participate in all three programs it is revealed that highercost institutions are able to give larger awards to higher proportion of their student s than are lowercost institutions the findings presented in this report highlight an important characteristic of need based financial aid th at student financial need is relative to the coa at the institution student attends middle or upperincome student attending higher cost institution may have financial need whereas similarly situated student attending lowcost institution might have financial need under the campus based programs this has resulted in highercost institutions having greater institutional need on perstudent basis than lowercost institutions in turn this has allowed highercost ihes to provide larger awards even to students with higher incomes than could be provided by lowercost ihes still at highercost ihes these substantially larger campusbased awards typically cover much smaller portion of coa than do awards at lowercost ihes
