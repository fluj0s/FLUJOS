from stefan rahmstorf rahmstorfozeanklimade to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject last millennium section 65 comments by sr date tue 26 jul 2005 120933 0200 cc wg1ar4ch06jossucaredu jonathan overpeck jtouarizonaedu eystein jansen eysteinjansengeouibno hi keith and all please everyone have look at point 4 i think section 65 is in remarkably good shape certainly compared to my own there are some comments from 1 about the new proxy reconstructions the section says most of these are shown in the figure this immediately raises the question why not all which one is not shown this section will be scrutinised with great suspicion by some people so we need to be careful can you clarify which one you left out and why or can we just write these are shown that would be much nicer 2 several times you say simply scaled would scaled do as well the simply in this context sounds bit like we criticise that 3 is predictand word that everybody knows id never seen it before 4 now here is my biggest question that i think we need to discuss in the whole group figure 6521 shows simulations of the past millennium relative to 15001899 means is this really the best reference period it differs from how we show the data reconstructions ie relative to 19611990 everyone knows what that climate actually was since there are good instrumental data for 19611990 so that it makes sense to look at changes relative to that period nobody knows what the real 15001899 mean was so this is fictitious baseline pro it gets rid of end effects ie model initialisation problems at the beginning as in von storch 04 and different anthropogenic forcings used at the end eg some ignore aerosols the simulations look closer together in this way right i have not formed clear opinion on what is best 5 also on the figures i like the grey bands but heres suggestion for improvement instead of leaving the core region between those two bands white i think they should also be shaded either the same grey or darker shade of grey this makes it more clear that we are talking about one wide uncertainty band here not about two seperate things it had confused at first when i saw it even though i was there when we discussed this in beijing final point we need to keep an eye on developments concerning the model tests of the proxy method there seem to be several important things in the pipeline there cheers stefan to reach directly please use 1rahmstorfozeanklimade my former addresses pikpotsdamde are read by my assistant brigitta stefan rahmstorf 2wwwozeanklimade 3wwwrealclimateorg references 1 mailtorahmstorfozeanklimade 2 httpwwwozeanklimade 3 httpwwwrealclimateorg
