inspect or generals office conducted jointly risk assessment of the 2005 tsunami relief project in sr i lanka the tsunami which hit the coast of sri lanka on 26 december 2004 severely damaged 11 of t he 25 coastal districts in sri lanka some 35000 lost their lives and more than 500000 were internally displaced most of the social infrastructure along the coast such as schools hos pitals and administrative and security structures were damaged or became dysfunctional immediately af ter the tsunami the tsunami operation is funded under project 05sblakem131 with budget of us 1535 million programme strategy and programme implementation time was limiting factor in the formulation of th unhcr strategy for sri lanka with hindsight some of the objectives had been too ambitious and it was considered unlikely that the objectives and their expected impact could have been achieved within the timelines established for example as of midmay 2005 unhcr had completed 252 shelter s against the projected figure of 6550 4 per cent with firm plans in place for only 3850 shelters this highlighted risk that the funds available could not be effectively utilised by 31 d ecember 2005 it was recommended that the programme strategy be refocused and revised to be m ore realistic and achievable the targets of the shelter projects have been revised to current pro jection of 4000 transitional shelters and the replacement of 400 emergency shelters the overall progress of construction of transitional shelter by unhcr and other implementing agencies is progr essing steadily moreover project 05sblakem131 will be extended into 2006 to ensu re the funds are utilized the team was informed that to ensure the funds were effectively employed more emphasis would be placed on activities for conflict affected internal ly displaced persons in case there was greater shift towards the needs of this group than initiall indicated the team recommended that the revised project and budget reallocation be presented to don ors for their agreement there have been initial discussions between unhcr and echo colombo one of the largest contributors towards the special project with echo informing unhcr that it can already proceed with projects adding conflict affected internally displaced persons at the time of the review due to the slow rate of implementation there was risk that once the transitional shelters were erected unhcr did not ve the beneficiaries to occupy them it was found that some 25 per cent of the registered benef iciaries were already taken care of by ngos erecting shelters it has been recognised that the shelter sector was over provided and unhcr has reflected this in its revised targets from review of the completed shelters it was not ed that water and sanitation was not fully implemented water and sanitation was the responsib ility of unicef in ampara and the responsibility of international ngos in jaffna the issue needed to be addressed and assurance obtained that work on water and sanitation are impl emented hand in hand with the construction of the shelters the representation has requested unicef to speed up programme implementation and has received firm commitment from them that t hey will progress more quickly coordination with external partners in the early stages of the emergency the family rallied round to cope with the disaster shortly 3 after however considering the magnitude of the dis aster the number of people affected as well as the geographical area to be covered activities wer difficult to coordinate the team found that the activities of agencies were not always properly coordinated and agency specific objectives and targets were not always clear difficulties in coor dination were compounded due to diverse relief assistance much of it spontaneous responses by var ious individuals and groups of individuals national as well as international and as resul t there was some duplication of assistance nonetheless it should be noted that as the emergen cy situation disappeared within the first few weeks and post emergency deaths were reported as initially predicted the emergency phase of the operation must be deemed successful the representation agreed that there has been some wastage and overlap in the tourist zones in the sou th they highlighted that well functioning distribution system was established in the north protection although unhcrs involvement with tsunami affected internally displaced persons is described as exceptional and shortterm the requirements for pr otection work are longterm and crosscutting and therefore must be seen within the context of protection continuum shortterm compartmentalized approach could undermine unhcrs credibility and more importantly could leave many of those unhcr is seeking to assist with out protection it was recommended that new timeline for the implementation of protection issue s be established these concerns were noted especially taking into account that consideration i s being given by the to extending the tsunami related programmes into 2006 discussions with prot ection partners are underway and new agreements have already been entered into with part ners procurement the inordinately long time taken to finalise the sh elter design as well as the indecisiveness of unhcr sri lanka as to the quality and quantity of th goods to be procured delayed the implementation of the unhcr transitional shelter pr ogramme the bulk of the procurement was not initiated until april 2005 this tarnished the imag of unhcr at the field level with the government and other agencies involved in the process the delays in the receipt of the materials and the subsequent decisions made to bridge the gap due to the delays had financial impact most of the b enefits achieved by procuring internationally were lost for example the zinc roofing internationally procured cost us 950000 the local cost would have been us 157400 165 per cent higher slight ly higher than the 15 per cent benchmark established by unhcr the urgency of the procuremen t and the initial aim to complete the transitional shelters by 30 june 2005 was not fully taken into account before the internationally procured zinc sheets arrived further 10000 were procured locally at cost of us 98000 therefore most of the envisaged savings by procurin g internationally were lost and the programme overprocured roofing sheets enough for almost 40 00 extra shelters the team found that local procurement systems and p rocedures were generally in place and operating effectively the team suggested some impr ovements to ensure that the procedures were open and transparent as well as more effective so the electronic system used by the representation to monitor and manage procurement ac tivities lacked some critical elements and we recommended that it be enhanced full evaluation of the current procurement proced ures will be undertaken in september 2005 to align them with unh cr rules and guidelines shelter coordination unhcr accepted to be the lead agency for coordinati ng the transitional shelter programme but appropriate staffing resources although requested by the representation were not put in place to 4 ensure this was carried out effectively from the ou tset it was only at the time of the review mid may that sufficient staff members were assigned t his was too late and has affected unhcrs ability to competently coordinate these activities the representation explained that valuable time was lost as the identified candidate pulled out at the 11 th hour and local resources were not easily obtained at the time of the review many of the decisions an d actions by those involved in transitional shelter had already been taken while unhcr was instrumenta l in the development of common strategy and standards it was not able to effectively influ ence the implementation of them unhcr shelter personnel are now onboard which should ensure an i mprovement in coordinating shelter activities there is risk however particularly with prominen t and wellfunded ngos that unhcr does not have the necessary authority and credibility and st art to properly coordinate their activities as par t of the revised strategy unhcr should clearly defin its role and its responsibilities as lead agency to ensure that unhcrs added value and impact can b measured the representation felt that they had developed high degree of credibility with the government donors and international ngos in coordinating shelter activities the representation also believed that they had adopted fully consultative approach and the shelter strategy has been revised to reflect this gender issues despite the disproportionately high numbers of deat hs of women and girls the team found that there were inadequate interagency efforts to analyse the implications of this and to incorporate full gender equality dimension into the response it was found that women have particular difficulties in accessing government bodies established to respond to the tsunami the representation had made important efforts to derstand and address the genderdifferentiated impact of the tsunami there now needs to be cons istent and deliberate effort by the representative to increase the capacity of unhcr an d implementing partner staff on gender equality issues and stepup its advocacy role it is recommended that the representation advocate and support the work by womens groups to gain pass age of the current bills against domestic violence and for womens rights the representation stated that unhcr was working clo sely with the members of the gender working group unaids unfpa and unicef as well as other agencies and relevant government bodies to maintain coordinated approach to addres s areas of concern raised by the team on gender related issues staffing issues due to rotation of management leadership and direc tion were not fully effective during the initial few months of the operation this affected unhcrs relations with external partners and donors who commented on the lack of leadership and indicat ed that new face was constantly representingheading unhcr at the field level junior and inexperienced staff members both national and international were delegated significant responsibilities although th ey appeared to be carrying out their functions competently it would have been more appropriate if senior staff based in colombo visited the operational areas more regularly to monitor program activities to provide supervision and guidance and to encourage the junior staff the presence of relatively high number of staff nd experts on mission in the office of the representation lead to heavy demand on the longsta nding experienced national staff also the office of the representation had created several organizational units and the local staff had cle ar 5 understanding of their responsibilities the assess ment team was informed that there was little sharing of information nor transparency in decisio nmaking that lead to lack of cohesion this was evident from the colombo staffs relationship w ith different field offices the team were also told that the long working hours the stressful env ironment the lack of sensitivity of some international staff and experts as well as the use of sometimes offensive language was not well received the team felt that the expertise and the experience of some of the national staff were not fully harnessed substantial team building efforts re required following mission by the desk in july 2005 it wa s concluded that there was need for larger restructuring in the unhcr sri lanka operation it was also indicated that of the ten international staff sent to sri lanka on temporary assignments an d the seven on mission there will be only five international staff at p23 and noa level remainin g beyond 31 august 2005 augmenting the structure in some field

conducted jointly risk assessment of the 2005 tsunami relief project in sri lanka the tsunami operation is funded under project 05sblakem131 with budget of us 1535 m illion 2 the tsunami which hit the coast of sri lanka i n december 2004 severely damaged 12 of the 25 districts in sri lanka including the coastal distri cts of jaffna mullaitivu trincomalee batticaloa ampara hambantota matara and galle total of so 35000 lost their lives while more than 500000 have been internally displaced most of the social infrastructure along the coast such as schools hospitals and administrative and security structures were damaged or became dysfunctional immediately after the tsunami 3 it was obvious that the country was not prepared fo r natural disaster of this scale nor were aid agencies adequately equipped to deal with the situa tion in coastal areas where access was limited the presence of unhcr in the country with its expertise and relief items was in many ways fortunate for the victims in the days immediately after the tsuna unhcr responded immediately and opened its local relief stockpiles to assist with urgently nee ded nonfood relief items nfri in affected areas 4 following field assessments discussions with the g overnment of sri lanka gosl the united nations country team untc and other actors unhcr took the lead on coordinating the relief operation distribution of nonfood household item s and other consumable materials unhcr also took the lead in coordinating emergency and transit ional shelter assistance targeting 16550 families in the north east and south of the island this was xpected to meet the shelter needs of some 66200 beneficiaries as part of the agreed integrated response unhcr was to strengthen and support the logistical capacity of the aid community in additi on unhcr was to strengthen the protection of victims of the tsunami by focusing on land and prop erty rights and documentation 5 the findings contained in this report have been d iscussed with the officials responsible for the activities during the debriefing held on 21 may 200 5 draft of the report was shared with the direct or bureau for asia and the pacific and with the office of the representation in sri lanka in june 2005 the comments which were received in august 2005 re reflected as appropriate ii mission objectives 6 the main objectives of

other international organisations the team also made an assessment of internal control systems conducted interviews with staff analysed applicable data and reviewed available documents and other relevant records iv findings and recommendations programme strategy and programme implementation 10 time was limiting factor in the formulation of th unhcr strategy for sri lanka with hindsight the objectives were too ambitious and as time passes there were still number of internal and external factors which continue to affect unhcrs ability to fully implement the original project at the time of the mission the representation only had clear strategy for erecting 3850 shelters against the 6550 planned while roofing materials for almost 8 000 shelters had already been purchased it appea red unlikely therefore that the objectives and their expected impact could be achieved within the timeli nes established this was confirmed by the low rate of implementation of project objectives at the time f the mission unhcr had completed 252 shelters 4 pe r cent of the 6550 projected figure and the implementation of protection activities had not rea lly started as an example of the latter the subpro ject agreement with norwegian refugee council nrc on m ainly protection and legal issues was only 9 signed in may 2005 it was noted that the rate of implementation of unhcr in comparison with other actors was very low for instance in ampara from t he overall need of 17018 transitional shelters so 8016 had already been completed and 956 were in pr ogress of these unhcr had constructed only 42 11 in response to the teams concerns and observations with regard to the implementation rate the representation stated that it was important to ensu re accountability to donors beneficiaries and the government with regard to the quality of the shelte rs provided the processes that were undertaken to provide them and the speed of construction in compe tition with other actors was less important the am fully appreciates unhcrs obligation to produce qua lity shelters and that many of the other shelters were substandard in comparison however oxfam was able to construct more than 1200 shelters and their shelters were of better quality than unhcrs it is the teams view that unhcr had not adequatel placed emphasis on the urgency of the transitional shelters resulting particularly in the shortterm in dissatisfied beneficiaries and questions from the g overnment as to unhcrs ability to meet the pledged numbers it is time for the representation to look forward and ensure that concerted efforts are made to achieve the new timelines established in response to the draft report the representation stated that the overall progress of construction of transitional sh elters by unhcr and other implementing agencies reflected steady and realistic progress to reach the set target by end september 2005 the team was later informed that the president held celebratio n to mark the accomplishment of the erection of 50 000 shelters the president acknowledged the key role hcr played in assisting the government in steering the international effort towards achieving the targ et 12 the nonachievement of project objectives had finan cial implications at the time of the mission from budget of us 72 million for shelter and us 16 million for protection only us 4 million and us 42000 respectively had been disbursed or commit ted clear strategy had been developed for the funds of us 29 million already allocated to the sh elter activities for conflict affected internally displaced persons overall therefore there was r isk that the funds available would not be effective ly utilised by 31 december 2005 13 due to the slow rate of implementation the team id entified the risk that once the transitional shelters were constructed unhcr may not find benef iciaries to occupy them beneficiaries were losing confidence in unhcrs ability to complete the shelt ers expeditiously from the 2034 beneficiaries registered many of them registered in february 200 5 for unhcr transitional shelter through the partner rural development foundation rdf some 50 0 beneficiaries had already been provided shelters by other ngos this was just an indicative figure s complete reverification exercise would be required to assess the true situation on the other hand considering the good quality of unhcrs shel ters compared with those which the team inspected constr ucted by some others as well as the increasing delays in permanent shelter construction now estim ated at 18 months to 4 years new beneficiaries ar coming forward despite this the actual needs shou ld be closely monitored to ensure funds are not invested in shelters that are longer required the unhcr operation has reduced the targets of the shelter project significantly when it was recognize d that the shelter sector was oversubscribed 14 our review of the pilot shelter project in ampara nd jaffna identified that water and sanitation work had not yet been completed in ampara it was t he responsibility of unicef in jaffna that of international ngos such as world vision movimondo leads and forut the issue needed to be addressed with the partners to have assurance that the water and sanitation work is implemented hand in hand with the construction of the shelters the ck of these facilities has particular implications for women given their responsibilities for home and fo od management their increased needs during menstruation and for children who are very vulnera ble to disease and dehydration the representation met unicef on various occasions in an attempt to sp eed up programme implementation and received firm commitment for progress to be quicker risk remains however given unhcrs dependency on other agencies for such activities 10 recommendation the unhcr bureau for asia and the pacific and the represent ation in sri lanka should refocus and revise the tsunami special project 05sblakem131 to make the objectives and expected outputs more realistic and achievable the representation should take into account the changing environment and the projects being implemented by other actors followup by oios rec 01 response unhcrs targets have been reduced significantly the curr ent projection is to construct 4000 transitional shelters and replace 400 emergency shelters t he protection sector is currently under revision there will be significant shift in focus as ag encies participating in the country team have realized that there is need for equity in the distri bution of aid in the districts affected by the tsunami moreover the asia bureau received indications during the mission of its director to sri lanka and her discussions with the hcrc that the tsunami ppeal that provided the inter agency response framework will be extended and that formal consent of the donors will be sought in due course based on this project 05sblakem131 will accordingly be extended to 2006 the overall progress of construction of transitional shel ters by unhcr and other implementing agencies reflects steady and realistic progress to rea ch the target date of end september 2005 15 for recommendation 01 the team is pleased to note the action taken to revise and refocus the tsunami special project with the risk areas noted by the team being addressed nonetheless at the d of the project it would be useful for the bureau for sia and the pacific to conduct an endofproject assessment and lessons learned exercise this could be of assistance in future emergency activities to more easily manage risk and to provide assurance of greater likelihood of achieving project objectiv 16 some donors expressed their concern over unhcr s extended involvement in the tsunami project and that it may overshadow its basic respo nsibility visàvis the conflict affected internall displaced persons the government partners in the n orth expressed concerns about the amount of resources being spent on tsunami victims in compari to conflict victims the team observed that the concerns were not totally unfounded given the very desperate conditions under which conflict affected internally displaced persons have lived in for more than ten years recommendation the unhcr bureau for asia and the pacific and the representa tion in sri lanka in case of greater shift towards using the funds for conflict affected internally displaced persons should seek the agreement of donors for any revision involving real location of funds between tsunami and conflict affected internally displaced persons followup by oios rec 02 response initial discussions between unhcr and echo colombo one of t he largest contributors towards the special project have already been initiated echo has in formed unhcr that in the 11 districts affected by the tsunami unhcr can proceed with projects adding conflict affected internal displaced persons while projects have as of yet been identi fied the representation in colombo and the asia bureau are developing concrete programme of ac tivities for the conflict internally displaced persons that should augment existing conflict related programmes once this is done the reallocation of resources will only take place once cons ent of the donors and the unct is obtained 17 for recommendation 02 the team is pleased to note that donors are being consulted on the possibility of channelling more of the tsunami fund s to conflict affected internally displaced persons the assessment team is satisfied that this risk is bein g addressed 11 18 the tsunami affected the female population dispropo rtionately women and girls died in much greater numbers reflecting in some measure the vul nerabilities created by gender inequalities includ ing power disparities and unequal access to national re sources in the society despite this the represent ation has not given sufficient attention to the implicati ons of this phenomenon the revision of the progra mme strategy therefore offers an opportunity to strengt hen the focus on addressing inequalities which wer exacerbated by the impact of the tsunami strengt hened focus underpinned by gender analysis and genderequitably targeted resources would increase greatly the possibility of making progress with so of the objectives this should include providing gal protection and advice equitable physical and s ocial security to address the vulnerabilities created or exacerbated by the tsunami as well as monitoring verall protection and security of internally displaced per sons particularly for women and children recommendation the unhcr representation in sri lanka in consultation with t he various womens groups and partners should ensure an adequate level of resources are as signed to address the disproportionality of women and girls needs as result of t he tsunami the representation should ensure the promotion and integration of women as well as increasing their capacities through the use of the genderbudgeting approach1 followup by igo rec 03 response new subproject agreement with the agency women in need wi n has been signed to look into the concerns raised in the above recommendation the agency concerned is working closely with persons affected by the tsunami the most vulnerable of whom re the women the partner also focuses on empowerment and the importance of identifying soluti ons from within andor amongst the community to ensure that solutions are durable programm to provide counselling services and legal assistance to those affected by the tsunami in va rious locations and 24hour hotline have been put in place the representation is an active participant at the gender working group as part of the unct the gender theme group as well as the unaids working group these meetings provide forum to share information such as the recommendations contained her ein to the notice of the wider group to ensure consistency in approach in addressing these conc erns b coordination with external partners 19 unhcrs initial contribution of nrfi to the tsunami affected communities in the early days of the emergency had high visibility and was welcomed and acknowledged by the authorities donors and other agencies the team through its interviews with external partners found that many of the subsequent contributions and the participation of u nhcr and the were neither visible nor recognised by the donors or the host country the s ituation is largely reflection of the status that prevailed as within days after tsunami hundreds f humanitarian actors arrived crowding the humanitarian operation it is appreciated that due to the magnitude and suddenness of the disaster mechanism for coordination could easily have been p ut in place either by the government or agencies nonetheless the lack of strong coordinat ion resulted in hundreds of actors operating almost independently overall however as the emergency si tuation disappeared within the first couple of week s and post emergency deaths were reported as initi ally predicted this phase of the operations must b deemed as being successful 1 gender budgeting approach would be linked to rbm efforts it calls for an increased use of gender quality mainstreaming in the programme budgeting process w ith the objective of ensuring that resources are located in genderequitable way 12 20 in the confusion following the tsunami the term c oordination became the buzzword within the government and undonor circles without clear understanding of the substance or the actions that were being coordinated the team found that ther was similar situation some five months later an d although many agencies and groups of agencies both and nongovernmental are trying to co ordinate the coordination efforts were not fully effective the purpose content and the depth of th various coordination meetings seemed to be varied so were the attendees and their respective terms of references as well as their competencies to repres ent their offices the situation is further complic ated as there is among the major partners and the gover nment coherent approach to or understanding of the relief operation 21 one statement though from development expe rt is noteworthy unhcr was described as thinking organization with some real sensitivity and understanding of issues such as property and nd rights unhcr was encouraged to give visibility to some promising practices it has engaged in and identified being done by others some of the women interviewed welcomed the ongoing if fledgling efforts by unhcr to highlight and address issues af fecting women recommendation the unhcr representation in sri lanka should critically asse ss its operational and coordination arrangements within the office of the representation and its coordination mechanism with its field and suboffices followup by igo rec 04 response mission by the desk in july 2005 has concluded there is need for larger restructuring in the unhcr sri lanka operation the bureau director is pursuing the matter with the chief organizational and developmental management section odms to undertake jointly with senior bureau participation mission to sri lanka in september 2005 the mission will undertake review of existing strategies operational objectives against current political realities and an operational management structure that should help to achieve the results this would also come as part of the headquarters increased focus on results based management and its roll out to field locations in the asia region beginning with the operation in sr i lanka c protection 22 although unhcrs involvement with tsunamiaff ected internally displaced persons is described as exceptional and shortterm the requirements for its protection work longterm and crosscutting mean that many initiatives must be seen within the conte xt of protection continuum these include effor ts to identify pressing land and property rights issues to advocate for their resolution to provide assist ance to regain documentation to relocate people to transit ional accommodation which will not be shortterm given the multitude of problems surrounding reconst ruction and rehabilitation and to support the prevention and response to sexual and genderbased violence sgbv while the main protection goal remains the enhancement of access of conflict affec ted internally displaced persons to national protec tion mechanisms it is often very difficult to different iate neatly between the two populations many peopl have been affected by both and while the tsunami is described as natural disaster its impact has be increased by policies which while not deliberate contribute to gender inequality and underdevelopmen t 2 shortterm compartmentalized approach will ther efore only further undermine unhcrs credibility 2 sri lanka has very low participation of women in d ecisionmaking eg there is only one female cabin et member and women are only 5 per cent of the parliament the sa figure as at independence poverty and underdev elopment affect many people with particular implications for women and girls eg 65 per cent of amparas population is below the poverty line prior to the tsunami and there were ready very high number of femaleheaded household s 13 and more importantly will leave many of those unhc r are seeking to assist without enhanced protection recommendation the unhcr bureau for asia and the pacific and the representa tion in sri lanka should not attempt at this point to differentiate between confli ct affected and tsunami affected internally displaced persons in the north and east the imperative is to facilitate access to enhanced protection for both populations with the protection rationale varying ac cording to location followup by igo rec 05 response this has been noted and unhcr has instigated round of discussio ns with the unct on equality issues in relation to aid for tsunami and conflict internally displaced persons unhcr also promotes equity through the internally displaced persons working group spearheaded by unhcr as the lead agency working with internally displaced pers ons in the country the working group is producing paper on equity that will contain an introducti on on the problem and its scope together with statistics and including policy frame work built on international standards the goals of this document together with the working group on equity will be presented at the ct meeting in august recommendation the unhcr bureau for asia and the pacific and the representa tion in sri lanka should establish new timeline for protection issues taking into considerat ion the need to build the capacity of partners selected for particular aspects of the work ch as norwegian refugee council on documentation and registration and women in need and rural deve lopment foundation on sgbv 3 this will help to ensure that the funds address specific needs and help to build or rebuild specific capacities followup by igo rec 06 response the suggestions made by the team are noted especially taki ng into account that consideration is being given by the to extending the tsunami related programm into 2006 as defined and elaborated in the transitional strategy unts in additio n discussions with protection partners are underway and new agreements have already been enter ed into both with national and international organizations including government departments and m inistries these agreements address concerns relating to pi issuance of documentati on provision of pro bono legal aid counselling and legal service on issues such as sgbv hcr is also focusing on strengtheningenhancing the capacity of national organizations s well as government departments in the process to ensure sustainability d procurement and logistics procurement 23 the inordinately long time taken to finalise the shelter design for ampara resulted in the pilot project of 42 shelters being completed only by apri l 2005 the bulk of the procurement was initiated nly thereafter delaying the implementation of the unhc r transitional shelter programme at the time of th 3 the nrc lawyers and paralegals are all locally rec ruited with the first woman on the team recruited after the teams visit the difficulty of recruiting woman lawyer or paralegal had been discussed with the team and ppears now to have been overcome increasing the capacity of loca l actors is critical part of protection delivery including building awareness of rights and supporting mechanisms to ac cess those rights 14 review there was still comprehensive bill of qua ntities the delays were also compounded by the indecisiveness of unhcr sri lanka as to the quality and quantity of the goods to be procured this is supported by the fact that procurement documents s uch as invitation to bid itb were issued prior t the requisition form being completed by programme an d without clearly indicating on the itb the specifications of the required materials the delay s in implementing the pledged number of shelters tarnished unhcrs image at the field level with the government and the other agencies involved in the process the representative highlighted that it was difficult to determine the procurement pending the shelter design being drawn up for example the choi ce between concrete columns timber frames and pipe work 24 the delays in the receipt of the materials nd the subsequent decisions made to bridge the gap resulting from the delay had financial impact an d most of the benefits achieved by procuring internationally were lost for example zincroofing sheets were procured internationally t cost of us 950000 this was for 7000 shelters although about 4000 were planned if pr ocured locally they would have cost some us 11 million an increase of us 157400 165 per cent higher which is only slightly higher than the 15 per cent benchmark established by unhcr the urgenc of the procurement should have been taken into account as the initial aim was to complete th transitional shelters by 30 june 2005 as these goods were not received on time to bridge the gap additional zinc sheets for over 600 shelters were procured locally at us 98000 therefore most of t he envisaged savings by procuring internationally had been lost and the programme has enough roofing sheets for almost 4000 extra shelters galvanized iron gi pipes were ordered locally wit h delivery duty unpaid at cost of us 310000 to receive them duty unpaid the supplier needs to import them specifically for unhcr delays were encountered in their receipt in the interim additional gi pipes were procured locally exstock duty paid at cost of us 49000 if decision had been made to procure all the gi pipes exstock duty paid from the out set it would have cost us 347000 difference of us 37000 some 12 per cent 25 the additional procurement could have been av oided although it may be used later in the programme and the economies of scale of procuring internationally have almost been lost with hindsight an alternative strategy of staged procur ement some local from the start of the operation and later internationally would have ensured cost effe ctiveness by enabling the programme to be up and running in the initial stages in the case of jaffn if the materials had been available that part f the project would have been completed by the time of th mission 26 our review of local procurement found that sy stems and procedures were generally in place and operating effectively ie competitive bidding ev aluation of offers received submission and approva l by the chairperson of the local committee on contracts and headquarters committee on contracts the team suggested some improvements to the system for instance on the itb instead of giving the criter ia what was actual being requested ie type and qua lity of goods reference was made that unhcr had the right to decide on the selection criteria aft er the offers had been received it was also state d that unhcr will identify the supplier at our discretion in the teams opinion these notes were not appropriate or compliant with unhcrs procurement p rocedures the team recommended that efforts be made to ensure procurement procedures are objective open and transparent the representation was of the opinion that the notes were pragmatic at the by allowing unhcr to choose the supplier on the basis of issues such as delivery as well as cost the team would reemphasis that the criteria for selection should be established prior to the offers being rec eived when dealing with funds provided by donors there is need for unhcr to always be transparent and fair 27 we suggested some improvements to the system moreo ver the electronic system used by the representation to monitor and manage procurement in cluded basic information but it lacked some critical elements such as the requisition reference quantities required the date of the request inf ormation 15 on payments as well as the status of each order w recommended that the system be enhanced to consolidate purchasing data and ensure procurement activities are effectively managed the representation argued that this was not considered priority as the information was available somewhere in the office the team cautioned the representation against thi s approach from experience wellmanaged emergency operations estab lished proper systems and procedures from the outset in the long run this is more cost effective and gives senior management assurance that procurement activities are well managed and control led and mitigates the need for investing resources in backtracking exercise 28 in jaffna procurement for the shelter project tota lling us 74000 was initially conducted through the unhcr project implementing unit based in the government agent ga office in jaffna there has however not been subproject agreement with the ga since 2003 and in practice ga staff were unhcr project staff they were working under the direct supervision of unhcr the procurement procedures adopted were not transparent and did not comply with unhcr rules and procedures the team was pleased to note that this practice was stopped from april 2005 with purchase s over us 5000 routed through colombo b logistics 29 logistics network was established countrywi and for nfri it appears to be operating effectively considering the level of activities w found that warehouse systems and procedures were generally in place and working satisfactory but ggested internal controls be enhanced to more effectively manage and monitor logistical activitie s 30 colombo is the logistical hub where consolid ated logistical information should be available we noted however that the tracking system only maintai ned and monitored information on receipts and transfers to and from colombo goods received and or transferred between field offices were not included the representation indicated that the tracking syste m should have included all movements to from and within the field the team is pleased to note this but would highlig ht that work was still required to ensure this is effectively put into pra ctice 31 the team questioned the necessity to allocat almost fulltime resources to the installation an d implementation of the unhcr commodity tracking syste m at the office of the representation while at the same time operating parallel tracking systems in excel it was the teams opinion that these resources could have been better employed at the fi eld level the representation explained that these staff members were engaged for their experience and exper tise in tracking stock the staffing resources requested for the field were not filled the team is still of the opinion considering the t ime limitation of the project that logistics resources at the colombo level could have been more effectively employed at the field level 32 the clearance of goods through the port was real concern as there was serious blockage with items stuck and delayed for months at the time of the mission unhcr goods valued at over us 825000 were held in port awaiting clearance moreo ver the procedures for the clearance of goods were cumbersome and lengthy the team has been informed that four different procedures for clearing goods and obtaining exemption to duties had been introduc ed since january 2005 recommendation the unhcr representation in sri lanka should enhance its procur ement systems and procedures to more effectively manage and monitor purchasing activit ies and to provide assurance to management that transactions are complete followup by oio s rec 07 16 response full evaluation of the current procurement procedures will be undertaken in september 2005 to align itself with the unhcr procedural rules and guidelines also with the engagement in the tsunami shelter programme beginning to wind down it has been r ecognized that there is not sufficient enough reasons to warrant maintaining the current logistics capacities steps have already been taken to rationalize the level and number of staf f within that unit 33 the team is pleased to note the action taken and will close the recommendation on confirmation that the evaluation has been completed and procurem ent procedures have been enhanced shelter coordination 34 unhcr accepted to be the lead agency for coor dinating the transitional shelter programme but appropriate staffing resources were not put in plac to ensure this was carried out effectively from t he outset it was only at the time of the review mid may that sufficient complement of staff was assigned this was too late and has affected unhcr s ability to effectively coordinate activities 35 at the time of the review many of the decisi ons and actions by those involved in shelter had already been made or taken while unhcr had drafted shelter strategy and guidelines due to the lack of staff and staffing structure it was unable to ffectively influence the process as result ther was lack of cohesion in the type of transitional shelte rs being erected the quality of the shelters and t he sub standard materials used by some partners were cau for concern in some cases the living conditions were deplorable and starting to cause medical probl ems due to heat accumulation and the lack of proper ventilation some agencies are already in the proces s of upgrading the transitional shelters although the unhcr shelter staff are now onboard which should ensure an improvement in unhcrs role in coordinating shelter activities there is risk p articularly with prominent and wellfunded ngos tha t unhcr does not have the necessary authority to move forward and properly coordinate their activities the representation felt that they had developed hi gh degree of credibility with the government donor s and international ngos in coordinating shelter acti vities the representation also believed that they h ad adopted fully consultative approach and the shelt er strategy has been revised to reflect this 36 reconstruction of permanent houses is major devel opment programme with one important concern being the 100m buffer zone although unhcr is not involved in permanent housing it has played an important role especially in the north to identify land that can be used for permanent constructions some of the transitional houses are b uilt on these lands given unhcrs responsibilities for conflict related internally displaced persons some of whom are also victims of the tsunami the t eam suggests that unhcr play an advocate role visàvis the parties to the conflict to identify land in th north and the east for reconstruction efforts 37 at the emergency shelter stage the lack of coordin ation and decision making processes were very evident the director of the centre for national op erations requested the humanitarian community to supply 50000 tents and unhcr pledged 10000 some 2000 tents were airlifted from jordan and the remainder based on headquarters decision arriv ed by sea by the time they arrived there was longer need for them and at the time of the revi ew some 5500 tents were stored in their original s ea containers pending decision on what to do with th em the value and transport cost of these tents was over us 1 million but there was little impact to s how for it decision needs to be taken to redep loy these tents this has to be done fairly soon cons idering the climate and conditions in which tents re stored 17 recommendation the unhcr representation in sri lanka should in consultation with the supply management service redeploy some 5500 tents valued at about us 3900 00 longer required for the tsunami emergency operation in order to prevent deterioration in st orage followup by oios rec 08 response offers have been made to all current emergencies and other ope ration through sms and by bilateral contact currently there is an interest in tents in indonesia zimbabwe and ghana it is the intention of the operation to reexport these tents as s oon as request has been confirmed it should be noted that the representation office has already obta ined from the government an official communication stating that the tents are longer needed in sri lanka 38 the team is pleased to note the action taken and will close the recommendation once notified of the effective deploymentuse of the tents f gender equality issues 39 overall many staff have made important effor ts to understand and address the gender differentiated impact of the tsunami there now nee ds to be consistent and deliberate effort by the representation to increase advocacy with both siste r agencies and the government as well as to increa the capacity of unhcr and implementing partner staf f on gender equality issues the ongoing difficulties in forging social consensus for pass age of two bills on violence and womens rights underscores the continuing resistance to the notion of gender equality and the lack of political will in promoting it the national mechanisms for the adva ncement of women the ministry and the national committee wield little authority and are under re sourced women are looking for allies in their str uggle for equality and the uns mandate requires that thi s be central theme 40 the system has made some commendable effor ts it should however be more assertive in promoting the need to understand womens mens and childrens experiences the disproportionate number of female deaths has already been stated t he implications now need to be better understood there is some evidence that widowed men are neglect ing or in some cases abusing their children some of these men remarried within weeks of the deaths f their wives and have remarried very young girls who have little choice 41 the team highlighted that identifying and exp anding the use of promising practices are critica l for the struggle to end sgbv recent community rvices workshop resulted in an assessment of achievements and constraints in sgbv prevention and standard operating procedures sops were introduced for adaptation and contextualization th team suggests that the sops be shared by the representation more widely with view to providin g contribution to an integrated and coherent systemwide approach in sri lanka to the problem recommendation the unhcr representation in sri lanka as member of the u n country team should advocate more deliberate focus on gender equality to ensure that the r esponse to the tsunami and conflict affected populations whether it is for loss of livelihoo ds domestic and other forms of violence documentation land and property rights or neglect and abuse of children uses disaggregated data and gender analysis more fully followup by igo rec 09 18 response unhcr works closely with the members of the gender wor king group unaids unfpa and unicef as well as other agencies and relevant governm ent bodies to maintain coordinated approach to address areas of concern that has arisen the cond stage of unhcrs sgbv campaign has started in order to create awareness at mo re grass roots level to ensure that the message is clearly conveyed countrywide the campaign is expected to begin in the last quarter of 2005 unhcr also worked with unfpa in creating awarenes s on issues of gender equality as well as the equality between conflict and tsunami affected internally displaced persons unhcr has been working with drc and nrc and other relevant part ies on documentation issues to expedite the process of providingreplacing relevant do cuments and to make effort to address property rights and restitution for conflict and tsunami affect ed internally displaced persons recommendation the unhcr representation in sri lanka should use documentation nd advocacy to encourage the use by the government and other authorities of promisin g or good practices which will facilitate womens access to decisionmaking processes this should include trendsetting cases being established with the norwegian refugee council partnership on acceptance of alternative forms of evidence of ownership of property and land followup by igo rec 10 response the representation has entered into an agreement with nrc to provide protection to the victims of the tsunami and conflict affected internally displaced persons through the provision of legal counselling and court representation the representation has also entered into partnership with the council of housing and evictions cohre to increase access of internally displaced persons to judicial or other remedies for their land or property rights protection under this agreement it is envisaged that test cases will be identified in the nrc leg aid clinics and cohres experienced legal team will bring these cases to court this should ass ist in establishing body of jurisprudence in sri lanka that will recognize alternative means of demo nstrating ownership of property and land as well as recognizing the importance of economic so cial and cultural rights recommendation the unhcr representation in sri lanka should ensure improved ac cess for women to the structures and mechanisms for rehabilitation and reconstruct ion unhcr should partner with unifem and other agencies to facilitate governmentled co untrywide consultations which would highlight the particular barriers and constraints for women nd open the doors of decision making to them followup by igo rec 11 response together with the actions mentioned above the representatio n has established contacts with unfpa and unicef and is working closely with unifem to nsure work on gender issues andor sgbv is carried out in coordinated manner effort is presently underway to recruit an external consultant with experience in sgbv programming and familiarity with working with internally displaced persons to enhance unhcrs sgbv programmi ng once onboard this should ensure all offices have clear strategy on how to move toward multisectoral response to sgbv prevention and response 19 g general programme matters project management and monitoring 42 the team briefly reviewed the subproject agreements entered into with partners and made some suggestions to improve project management and monitoring and suggested that to ensure better understanding of the programme and improved coordin ation with other actors the related inputs to the project be clearly outlined and quantified overall for the programme there was need to develop smart specific measurable achievable relevant t ime bound performance objectives and related indicators to allow comparison and benchmarking and to measure progress over period of time the current performance indicators in some cases were u nrealistic and not measurable the representation took note of our suggestions 43 the team was pleased to note that uhncr in sri lanka had implemented strong project monitoring procedures this needs to be continued t ensure any problems with partners management of unhcr funds are identified early so that remedial action can be initiated b rural development fund rdf 44 rdf has been working with unhcr for number of years but has limited experience in shelter activities the representation stated that rdf was considered as the most viable option with past track record of 12 years trusted and effective cooperatio n with unhcr the partner made good impression on us and we found them to be enthusiastic keen to get started on the programme and considering their limited experience in shelter had done good job i n the construction of the 42 pilot shelters howeve r they need to be closely monitored to ensure that th promised level of production is achieved shelter coordinator and senior programme assistant have bee n assigned to the ampara office to monitor and strengthen the capacity of rdf to ensure the progra mme is successfully delivered in our opinion this is critical role to ensure the ampara part of the shel ter programme is effectively implemented 45 rdf maintained manual accounting records which alt hough slightly cumbersome were found to be adequate to manage and monitor unhcr funds we p rovided some advice to tighten internal controls particularly over banking procedures but overall w found them to be satisfactory h staffing issues 46 for the operation to be effective from the out set it was essential that unhcr identified appropriate staffing levels and expertise and depl oyed them on timely basis similarly continuity f staff is normally one of the key elements which ads to successful operation 47 due to the rotation of management leadership and direction was found not to be always effective this had negative impact on unhcrs relations wit h external partners and donors as they commented on the lack of leadership and indicated that new face was constantly representingheading unhcr the representation informed the team that once senio r management endorsed the plan of action they underlined the need for unhcr to keep very low pr ofile especially in the south where civil society nd government administration were fully operational 48 the team noted the shelter expert had been contract ed under questionable service agreement that was not in line with unhcrs standards and did not contain many of the mandatory clauses review by unhcr legal affairs section confirmed this moreover the contractor or individual in this case was expected to provide large range of ser vices to the office which could not be achieved it was recommended that the responsibilities be revise d to be more realistic the reporting line clearly 20 defined and activities more closely managed by unh cr staff the questionable service contract relating to the shelter consultant was made null and void as soon as it was brought to the attention of the asi bureau and was subsequently replaced by unhcr in dividual consultancy contract in addition adjustments to reporting lines within the represent ation office has also taken place to address the observation made in the report especially the shel ter unit 49 at the field level junior and inexperienced staff members both national and international were delegated significant responsibilities sometimes w ithout adequate briefing or guidance for example p 2 although competently carrying out his functions was in charge of the operations in ampara where th bulk of the activities were being implemented the representation indicated that junior internation staff members were recruited from pool of unvs ready working in sri lanka having requested headquarters to identify 12 international staff mem bers for the emergency operation the team was also of the opinion that senior staff based in colombo d id not visit the operational areas enough this sho uld have been done regularly to monitor programme activ ities to provide supervision and guidance and to encourage junior staff more field missions andor deployment of staff from colombo in the shortterm at least until 31 december 2005 may be necessary 50 as result of the unhcr emergency programme num ber of personnel were assigned to the office of the representation they were all locate d in the unhcr colombo office which was already crowded number of additional organisational unit s within the office were created as result ther was situation where experienced national staff we re required to provide services to the incoming experts with little regard for their expertise an d long experience the team observed and was inform ed that the unit heads convened many meetings resulted in lack of coordinated decision making the pushing and pulling of some national staff in dif ferent directions led to lack of cohesion 51 the team was also told that one or more of the staffexperts on mission used inappropriate or abusive language which national staff found to be ffensive and demoralizing this led to poor morale among some of the national staff members who could have played more decisive role in assisting programme and protection staff to make the right cisions overall there was perception that the expertise and the experience of some of the nationa l staff members were not being fully harnessed national staff appeared unwilling to come forward t help international staff and consultants but rea cted only to instructions given whether they were releva nt practical or cost effective this scenario was not the best for an effective and efficient unhcr opera tion recommendation the unhcr bureau for asia and the pacific jointly with the division of human resources management should assist the office of the representation in sri lanka to streamline and consolidate the staffing levels and operational structure as well as assess the need for the number of international staff and experts on mission followup by ig rec 12 response of the ten international staff sent to sri lanka on temporar assignments and the seven on mission there will be only five international staff at p23 and noa level remaining beyond 31 august 2005 augmenting the structure in some field locations as well as the functional units in the
