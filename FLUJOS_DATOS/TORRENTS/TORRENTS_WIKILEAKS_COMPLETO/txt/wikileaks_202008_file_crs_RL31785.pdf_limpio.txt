foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31785foreign assistance to north korea summary since 1995 the united states has provide d over 1 billion in foreign assistance to the democratic peoples republic of north korea dprk also known as north korea about 60 of which has taken the form of food aid and about 40 in the form of energy assistance channeled through the korean peninsula energy development organization kedo add itionally the bush administration has proposed offering north korea broad econo mic development assistance in exchange for pyongyang verifiably dismantling its nuc lear program although the president has considerable flexibility to offer some forms of short term development assistance longer term aid would likely require congressional action since the current north ko rean nuclear crisis erupted in october 2002 when north korea reportedly admitted that it has secret uranium enrichment nuclear program the dollar amount of us aid has fallen by an order of magnitude us funds have been provided to kedo ce fy2003 and the bush administrations position is that it would like to perman ently halt kedos currently suspended construction of two nuclear reactors in nort h korea us food aid also has fallen considerably in recent years food has b een provided to help north korea alleviate chronic massive food shortage s that began in the early 1990s and that led to severe famine in the mid1990s that killed an estimated 12 million north koreans food aid to north korea has come under criticism because the dprk g overnment restricts the ability of donor agencies to operate in the country making it difficult to assess how much of each donation actually reaches its intended recipients and how much is diverted for resale in private market s or to the military compounding the problem is that south korea and china by far north koreas two most important providers of food send almost all of their aid dir ectly to north korea with virtually monitoring the wfp says that food c onditions have worsened since north korea introduced economic reforms in 2002 the administration appears to be loosel adhering to its dprk food aid policy ie it will provide base levels of food assistance to rth korea with more to come only if the dprk allows greater access nd monitoring after announcing the policy in february 2003 the administration

us strategy toward the democratic peoples republic of korea dprk commonly referred to as north korea was relatively simple deter an attack on south korea an approach that included freeze on virtually all forms of economic contact between the united states and north korea in the 1990s tw developments led the united states to rethink its relationship with the dprk north koreas progress in its nuclear weapons program and massive chronic food shortages there in response the united states in 1995 began providing the dprk w ith foreign assistance which has totaled over 11 billion this aid has consisted of energy assistance through the korean peninsula energy development organiza tion kedo food aid and small amount of medical supplies including three medical kits that were sent to the world health organization in april 2005 to help in dea ling with the reported outbreak of avian influenza in north korea see table 1 since the current north kor ean nuclear crisis erupted in late 2002 the level of us aid has fallen by an order of magnit ude in large measure because us has sent almost funds to kedo since the organi zations executive board voted to halt oil shipments to north korea in november 2002 in all likelihood the dropoff in aid levels has reduced the already little leverage us aid had exerted on north korean behavior particularly relative to chinas and south koreas continued assistance to and increased trade with the dprk aid and the debate over north korea policy aid to north korea has been controversial since its inception and the controversy is intricately linked to the overall debate in the united states south korea and other countries over the best st rategy for dealing with the dprk north korea is deemed threat to us interests because it possesses advanced

kedo korean peninsula energy development organization figures from kedo humanitarian aid supporters of aid conte nd that humanitarian assistance has saved and improved the lives of millions of north koreans many also say humanitarian and development assistance is one way to induce north korea to cooperate with the interna tional community proponents of engagement argue that in the long run aid could fundamentally change the character of the north korean regime by increasing the dprks exposur to and dependence on the outside world the agreed framework which froze the dprks plutonium nuclear facilities for eight years north koreas establishment of relations with number of european countries pyongyangs unveiling of signif icant economic reforms since july 2002 and spate of economic and humanitarian agreements with south korea are often cited as examples of this cooperation in contrast many critics argue that aiding north korea has led to marginal changes in the dprks behavior at best at worst aid arguably has helped keep the current north korean regime in power has allowed the regime to avoid making fundamental economic and political reforms that could improve humanitarian conditions and possibly allo wed additional funds to be channeled into the dprk military establishment moreover critics suggest aid has encouraged pyongyang to engage in further acts of military blackmail to extract more assistance from the international community in this view the aid under the agreed framework halted north koreas plutonium program but it did not keep the country from pursuing secret uranium enrichment program disclo sed in october 2002 some argue that the best response to the north ko rean threat is to try to trigger the current regimes collapse by suspending nonhumanitarian assistance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31785crs3 1 the sixparty talks consist of the united stat north korea china south korea japan and russia since the sixparty process was initiated in

crs report rl32167 drug trafficking and north kore issues for us policy by raphael perlfood aid to north korea has generate d its own particular debate some policymakers and commentators have called for it to be linked to broader foreign policy concerns either by using the pr omise of food to encourage cooperation in security matters or by suspending food aid to trigger collapse others arguing that food should not be used as weapon nd have called for delinking humanitarian assistance from overall policy toward the dprk either by providing food unconditionally or by conditioning it upon nort h korea allowing in ternational relief groups greater freedom to distribute and m onitor their aid us policy in recent times has delinked food and humanitarian aid from strategic interests coercive measures some critics of the current aid effort argue for more tailored form of containment that woul d include diplomatically and economically isolating north korea and calibrating ec onomic sanctions and development aid to reward or punish the dprks actions majo r difficulty with this approach is that us options are limited in the current diplomatic and political climate offering carrots such as allowing north korea to join international financial institutions would likely require reciprocal actions th at pyongyang to date has resisted punitive sanctions however would likely be only marginally effective without at least the tacit cooperation of beijing nd seoul china and south korea are by far north koreas two largest economic partne rs and aid providers and both countries place greater priority on preserving nort h koreas stability than on resolving the nuclear issue chinese support would be pa rticularly important as china is widely believed to be north koreas singlelargest provider of f ood and energy to this end china and south korea have been reluctant to use pressure tactics to induce changes in the kim jongil regimes behavior japan the country closest to the united states in the sixparty talks to discuss north ko reas nuclear weapons program has seen its economic importance to north korea diminis h markedly over the past four years1 meanwhile military options generally ar considered to be poor given the uncertainties surrounding north koreas nucl ear program and the risk of unleashing retaliatory north korean missile strikes on south korea andor japan therefore absent support from china andor south kor ea some say the actions most likely to hurt kim jongils regime are those that w ould cut off its supply of hard currency by curtailing sales of illic it materials particul arly narcotics nd counterfeit currency cigarettes and pharmaceuticals and w eapons through such devices as the proliferation security initiative psi and the illicit activities initiative the scale and scope of north korean criminal activity is believed to have risen in recent years and is thought to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in hard

in january 2003 president bush said that he would consider offering the dprk bold initiative including energy and agricultural development aid if the country first verifiably dismantles its nuclear program and satisfies other us security concerns dealing with missiles and the deployment of conventional forces3 the administration reportedly was preparing to offer version of this pl an to north korea in the summer of 2002 but pulled it back after acquiring more deta ils of pyongyangs clandestine uranium nuclear weapons program4 in june 2004 during the third round of sixparty talks to resolve the north korean nuclear crisis the united states offered proposal that envisioned freeze of north koreas wea pons program followed by series of measures to ensure complete dismantleme nt and eventually permanent security guarantee negotiations to resolve north koreas energy problems and discussions on normalizing usnorth korean relations that would include lifting the remaining us sanctions and removing north ko rea from the list of terroristsupporting countries in the interim japan and south korea would provide the north with heavy oil north korea re jected the proposal as s ham and it was not supported in public by any of the other participants in the talks with regard to development assistance programs in the near term the president has considerable flexibility to offer some forms of development assistance the foreign assistance act of 1961 for instan ce allows the president annually to provide up to 50 million per country for any purpose5 longerterm initiatives however would likely require changes in u s law and thereby require congressional action for instance the fy 2005 consolid ated appropriations act specifically bans many forms of direct aid to north kor ea along with several other countries6 many health and emergency disaster relief aid programs are exempt from such legislative restrictions because they have notwithstanding clauses in their enacting legislation additionally if the adminis tration were to designat north korea as country involved in drug production nd trafficking as some have advocated then by law north korea would be ineligible for receiving most forms of us development assistance7 congresss role the provision of aid to north korea has given congress vehicle to influence us policy toward north korea from 1998

cited policies that over time led to the famine were excessive use of chemical fertilizers and the excessive conversion of land into agricultural uses the latter practice contributed to the massive

for one to two million deaths approximately 5 10 of north korea s population although natural disasters were the immediate causes of the food cris is several experts have found the root causes of the

economic reforms the economic reforms the north korean government initiated in ju ly 2002 were perhaps the most sweeping in the countrys history and have had ma jor impact on the lives of north koreans12 the most important of the reforms were raising official prices to bring them closer to black market levels raising wage levels to meet the rise in prices granting farmers and cooperatives greater lattit ude to sell produce officially recognizing the informal markets that had sprouted in the 1990s and cu tting government subsidies to most industries13 in general those with access to hard currency such as the political elite appear to be doing much better as evidenced by the appearance of more cars and restaurants in pyongyang aid workers and defector reports indicate striking upsurge in entrepreneurial activity including activity outside the state sector new restaurants and other isure establishments have opened in pyongyang and wide range of products now appear in the

incomes appear to have increased now that they are permitted to maintain private plots andor sell abovequota produce on the open market indeed there are reports that cash crops have appeared as farmers can rais more money producing vegetables fruits and selling those in the market than in produc ing staple grains ch as maize or rice or potatoes14 however the reforms appear to have wo rsened

appeal for outside humanitarian assistance preferring development aid instead and therefore would longer participate in the consolidated appeals process cap and longer would have need for the office

appear to have improved since early 2005 they do not yet appear to have re turned to the level they had reached in the summer of 2004 in particular the num ber of monitoring visits the wfp has been permitted is down to threeyear lows and north korea has not reversed its demand that the wfp draw down its expatriate staff which is likely to reduce the number of monitoring visits the wfp has attempted to compensate by reaching an agreement in principle with dprk author ities on several ways to improve the quality of its monitoring including the ability to observe actual distributions of

sustain the regime and to stunt the development of local markets that are outside the governments direct control38 inability to conduct r andom spot ch ecks not only is the wfps access incomplete but

probable cause is north koreas lack of export competitiveness and relative ec onomic isolation from the rest of the world north korea has faced few or barriers to expor ting to japan and the european union for instance while its exports to those areas are far greater than to the united states the absolute values are minuscule compared with countries of comparable size that are integrated into the global trading system north koreas failure to generate export revenue is major reason the country is unable to import f ood on commercial terms to make up for its chronic food shortage in turn the ove

first payment of 55 million us policy options for aid to north korea congress and the administration have va riety of options for future assistance to north korea given the suspension of the kedo project the immediate decisions will revolve around food aid pa rticularly given increased demand for food assistance from other areas of the world additionally if talks with north korea over its nuclear program begin and score breakthrough there will likely be consideration of broader economic assistance package as discussed earlier any decision by the united states to apply sanctions impose facto quarantine or economically suspend or terminate its current aid would be expected to have limited economic effect on north korea because in the shorttomedium term china andor south korea which place high priority on maintaining north koreas stability could increase their own assistance to compensate table 6 in the appendix shows the dramatic increase in the south korean governments expenditures on engaging north korea since the june 2000 summit between kim jongil and kim dae jung the bulk of these funds which are in the 500 million per year range constitute direct or indirect

unconditionally the core humanitarian argument for continuing aid regardless of the north korean governments actions is that major reduction in assistance could lead to another famine propone nts of

food aid provides an opportunity for exposing north koreans to the outside world by virtue of the permanent and reasonably extensive monitoring presence maintained by the wfp and other aid groups an additional diplomatic benefit of providing food aid unconditionally is that it might weaken criticism in south korea of the bush administrations policy toward the dprk us food shipments lend support to president bushs often stated approach of supporting the north korean people despite hi s concerns about the regime81 discontinue food aid this option has been proposed both on security and humanitarian grounds cutting off food assistance could be used as part of an isolati on strategy or an attempt to trigger the collapse of the north korean regime the effects of the united states suspending food assist ance may be undercut however by increased shipments from china or south korea from humanitarian perspective sending food to north korea arguably diverts limited supplies of food aid from ot her needy and more accountable countries furtherm ore as discussed above some argue that the volume and consis tency of intern ational aid has enabled the north korean government to avoid importing food allowing it to spend hard currency on other items82 options between these extremes include establish external linkages condition future food aid on progress in political and securityrelated talks such as negotiations regarding the north s nuclear programs emphasizing geostrategic concerns might lead to greater immediate cooperation in certain negotiations from pyongya ng
