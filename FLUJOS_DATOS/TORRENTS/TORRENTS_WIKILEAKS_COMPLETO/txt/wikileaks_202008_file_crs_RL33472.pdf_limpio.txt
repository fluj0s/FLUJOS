refer to any of the laws rules standards and procedures that governments employ to protect hum ans other animals and plants from diseases pests toxins and other contaminants exampl of sps measures include meat and poultry processing standards to reduce pathogens residue limits for pesticides in foods and regulation of agricultural biotechnology sps measures can be barriers to trade in agricultural food and other products according to the world trade organization wto and others notable us disputes have included european union eu ban on us meats treated with growthpromoting hormones which wto dispute panel ruled was not supported by risk assessment and an eu moratorium on approvals of biotechnology products foreign countries have often objected to various us sps measures as well multilateral trade rules allow governments to adopt measures to protect human animal or plant life or health provided that they do not discriminate or use them as disguised protectionism this principle was clarified in 1994 by wto members approval along with the other socalled uruguay round agreements of the agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures this document sets out the basic rules for ensuring that each countrys food safety and animal and plant health laws and regulations are transparent scientifically defensible and fair the united states also has signed or is considering numerous regional and bilateral free trade agreements ftas that may contain sps language the united states participates actively in the three major international scientific bodies designated by the wto to deal with sps matters the codex alimentarius commission for food safety the office of international epizootics oie for animal health and the international plant protection convention ippc for plant health these bodies meet often to discuss threats to human and agricultural health evaluate spsrelated disputes and develop scientifically based sps standards which can provide guidance for countries formulating their own national sps measures although us wto officials frequently cite the benefits of sps cooperation under trade agreements some among them food safety and environmental advocacy organizations have been skeptical they have argued that implementatio n of the agreements can result in downward harmonization rather than upgraded health and safety standards defenders counter that trade rules explicitly recognize the right of individual nations to enact stronger protections than international guidelines if they believe they are appropriate and are justified by scientific risk assessment in congress which must approve legislation if trade agreement is to be implemented many members are interested in how the ftas might address sps matters some members may be concerned that as trade agreements lower agricultural tariffs more countries may turn to sps measures to protect their farmers from import competition also us sps rights and obligations are relevant as the 111 th congress considers new measures to regulate imported foods httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33472g21g138g151g146g157g138g155g162g561 g138g151g141g561g18

phytosanitary sps measures refer to any of the laws rules standards and procedures that governments employ to protect hum ans other animals and plants from diseases pests toxins and other contaminants exampl of common sps measures include meat and poultry processing standards to reduce pathogens residue limits for pesticides in foods fumigation requirements for grains and wood packing materials to kill pests restrictions on food and animal feed additives and regulation of agricultural biotechnology to name few international trade rules recognize the rights and obligations of governments to adopt and enforce such requirements these rules are spelled out primarily in the world trade organization wto agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures sps agreement wto fact sheet cautions that countries can wield sps measures as barriers to trade in agricultural food and other products sanitary and phytosanitary measures by their very nature may result in restrictions on trade all governments accept the fact that some trade restrictions may be necessary to ensure food safety and animal and plant health protection however governments are sometimes pressured to go beyond what is needed for health protection and to use sanitary and phytosanitary restrictions to shield domestic producers from economic competition such pressure is likely to increase as other trade barriers are reduced as result of the uruguay round agreements sanitary or phytosanitary restriction which is not actually required for health reasons can be very effective protectionist device and because of its technical complexity particularly deceptive and difficult barrier to challenge 1 technical barriers to trade tbts are related but different category of potential trade barriers tbts also are used by governments to regulate markets protect consumers and preserve natural resources but not all tbts are agricultural automobile safety standards cigarette labeling and pharmaceutical regulations are examples of nonagricultural measures examples of tbts that may affect trade in agricultural and food products include food ingredient or labeling requirements nutrition claims quality attributes animal welfare rules and packaging regulations 2 as trade between two countries expands more oppor tunities for disputes may arise more than half of all us agricultural trade in fy2008 was with just five other markets canada twoway trade of 372 billion the european union eu 278 billion mexico 229 billion china 172 billion and japan 146 billion so it may be surprise that many of these countries have been cited for numerous spsrelated barriers to imports of us farm and food products however similar barriers exist among many other us agricultural trading partners as well3 1 excerpted from understanding the wto agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measures at the wto website httpwwwwtoorgenglishtratop_esps_espsund_ehtm the wto is the global organization that administers the internationally agreedupon rules of trade between nations 2 different wto agreement on technical barriers to trade covers tbts including those related to food this crs report focuses primarily but not exclusively on sps measures some discussion of sps and tbt can also be found incrs report rl34468 the us trade situation for fruit and vegetable products by renée johnson 3 all twoway us agricultural

focused on foreign barriers to us food and agricultural exports in the 110th congress attention began to shift to us imports of such products this followed the emergence of evidence that adulterated pet food ingredients from china had sickened or killed an unknown number of dogs and cats and been fed to some food animals here and in canada also the u s food and drug administration fda issued import alerts in 2007 to detain all farmraised seafood from china and in 2008 to detain all dairy products and ingredients both due to food safety concerns 4 following are narrative examples of several sps problems us exporters have encountered in overseas markets for more extensive listing of sps barriers and foodrelated tbts between the united states and its top 10 agricultural trading

washington dairy cow imported from canada most countries banned us beef and cattle products these included japan south korea mexico and canada which together had purchased approximately 90 of us beef expor ts only two usborn bse cases were found among nearly 788000 us cattle tested during 27month special surveillance program nonetheless the bserelated bans caused losses to the us beef industry in 2004 alone that were estimated at between 32 billion to 47 billion5 since then us beef and veal exports have been slowly rebuilding they were valued at 35 billion in fy2008 compared with the fy2003 value of 37 billion despite extensive us evidence that the products are safe and that us human and animal health safeguards are effective number of these countries continue to limit the types of us beef and other cattle products that may be imported g7g23g561g15g142g138g157g561g10g152g155g150g152g151g142g561g6g146g156g153g158g157g142g561 the eu in 1989 implemented ban on the production and importation of meat from livestock treated with growthpromoting hormones the ban caused an estimated 100200 million in lost us exports annually the eu justified the ban as protecting the health and safety of consumers but several wto dispute settlement panels subsequently ruled that the ban lacked scientific justification and was inconsistent with wto trade rules the eu refused to remove the ban and the united states declined an eu offer of compensation in the form of an expanded quota for hormonefree beef the us government was granted the right to and did impose 100 retaliatory tariffs on 116 million of eu agricultural imports efforts by both sides to resolve this longrunning dispute so far have not succeeded mixed wto panel decision released on march 31 2008 on the one hand informally ruled that the eu hormone ban did not comply with wto rules but on the other hand ruled that the united stat must take new steps if it is to maintain the sanctions on october 16 2008 wto appellate body ruling essentially permitted the sanctions to continue while leaving open the possibility for continuing eu defense of its policy 6 4 see china concerns incrs report rl34198 us food and

challenged the eus facto moratorium since 1998 on biotechnology product approvals although the eu claimed to have lifted the moratorium in may 2004 by approving genetically engineered ge corn variety the three complainants pursued the case in part because number of eu member states continue to block biotech products even those the eu itself deems acceptable the moratorium reportedly has cost us corn growers some 300 million in exports to the eu annually the eu approach presumes that the products of biotechnology are inherently different from their conventional counterparts and should be more closely regulated the united states canada and argentina believe they ar not on february 7 2006 the wto dispute panel agreed in part with the complainants arguments ruling in its interim confidential report that moratorium had existed that bans on euapprov ed ge crops in six eu member countries violated wto rules and that the eu failed to ensure that its approval procedures were conducted without undue delay the wto dispute settlement body adopted the panels report on november 21 2006 since then the united states has been attempting to negotiate with the eu to speed ge approvals although progress reportedly has been slow 7 numerous nations have argued that the united states maintains its ownin their view frequently unjustifiablesps measures and tbts past examples they have proffered include prohibition against shrimp imports from southeast asian countries because their trawlers do not use the type of nets required of us shrimpers to protect sea turtles the wto has since ruled that the ban was applied in discriminatory manner overly burdensome animal disease rules affecting eu imports new mandatory countryoforigin labeling at retail for fresh meats and produce and us import restrictions against more than 100 products because foreign pest risk analyses have not been completed noting that agricultural trade must freely move in both directions many analysts argue that if us challenges to other nations measures are to have credibility us interests must be prepared to acknowledge their own barr iers and to negotiate their removal this approach is viewed with suspicion by some critics that include number of consumer advocacy organizations for example july 2007 report by public citizens global trade watch asserted that some of the recently negotiated free trade agreements prioritize facilitating access for imports over consumer safetyby committing the united states to defer to substandard foreign safety regulations and thus exposing consumers to even more potentially unsafe imported foods 8 the office of the us trade representative ustr responded with fact sheet arguing that all of the trade agreements permit the united states to unilaterally determine the appropriate level of protection for food products and that foreign country can force the united states to accept unsafe products or lower safety standards 9 consumer advocates countered that

can impose significant economic costs on agricultural and food exporters by forcing them to make expensive changes in production or marketing in order to comply foreign sps action can halt all imports of product resulting in major losses for the exporting industry the office of the us trade representative ustr annually publishes lengthy report documenting foreign trade and investment barriers and us efforts to reduce them this report required by the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 pl 100418 categorizes describes and in some cases quantifies these barriers on countrybycountry basis sixtytwo major trading partners are covered in the 2008 report 10 sps measures and tbts are generally detailed in each countrys profile and where feasible their impacts on us exports are quantified by ustr understanding the total costs of agricultural nontariff barriers ntbs such as sps and tbt measures can be helpful for gauging the overall level of trade protection that various countries enjoy and for determining how much importance to assign to reducing such barriers in trade negotiations however efforts to inventory and quantify these barriers have proven challenging one difficulty is that since ntbs lack tariffs transparency and are often embedded within complex regulatory schemes reducing these ntbs generally requires more work than reducing tariffs does 11 two usda agencies the economic research service ers and the foreign agricultural service fas attempted to estimate the impacts on us exports in 1996 using information gathered from among other sources usdas foreign agricultural attaches and industry groups working from that database fas found in 1997 more than 350 measures negatively affecting an estimated 58 billion in potential us agricultural exports east asia had the most technical barriers with an estimated impact on us exports of nearly 29 billion the americas accounted for nearly 13 billion and europe for more than 900 million processed products accounted for about 13 billion of the 58 billion total others were grains and oilseeds about 13 billion animal products nearly 900 million fruits and vegetables over 600 million and other products including cotton seeds nuts fish and forestry products about 1 billion in all 12 other studies have attempted to estimate the trade losses of all foodrelated ntbsnot only sps measures and tbts but also import quotas safeguard measures licensing rules and so forth 10 office of the us trade representative ustr 2008 national trade estimate report on foreign trade barriers at

estimate the tariff equivalents of the foodrelated ntbs employed by nine rich nations of the oecd organisation for economic cooperation and development bradfords computer simulation suggests that if all food ntbs there were removed economic welfare would increase annually by 185 billion in eight of these rich countries and by 50 billion in less developed countries bradford finds that japan and

principle is that genetically engineered products should continue to be regulated according to their characteristics and unique features not their production methodthat is whether or not they were created through biotechnology the framework relies on existing statutory authority such as those noted above and regulations to ensure the safety of biotechnology research and products including food and agricultural products 16 g10g152g150g142g149g138g151g141g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561 after the 2001 terrorist attacks congress created the department of homeland security whose agents now play major role in inspections of imports including food and agricultural products most of aphiss border inspection functions and personnel were moved into the new department congress also passed the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 the bioterrorism act pl 107188 which requires all foreign as well as domestic food manufacturing and related companies

the agricultural marketing agreement act of 1937 7 usc 601 et seq is an example of tbtrelated law this law among other things provides the authority for requiring imported commodities to meet the same or similar grade size or other quality requirements as domestic products if they are regulated by federal marketing order within the us department of commerce the national oc eanic and atmospheric

communicating with other countries on sps measures17 this office also shares information with and from industry groups and exporters ustr fass overseas posts and various regulatory agencies such as usdas animal and plant health inspection service and food safety and inspection service the environmental protection agency and the hhs depart ments food and drug administration fas has chaired regular meetings of usda technical staff from various usda agencies to discuss the status of emerging and ongoing spstbt issues including options for resolving potential dispute more broadly ustr chairs an interagency group ie both usda and non usda agencies with sps responsibilities that meets regularly on wto sps issues when sps and tbt concerns arise technical and ot her government officials usually initiate at least informal dialogue with countries concerning the measure in question they also are communicating with affected industries in the priv ate sector both to keep them informed and to gather additional information it is at this level that an sps issue is most likely to be resolved when usda or other government experts discuss its scientific aspects with their foreign counterparts these stafflevel discussions often help the importing and exporting parties to clarify their differences and to determine mutually acceptable conditions for importing the affected product that will not compromise the importing partys safeguards however not all problems can be solved in this manner eventually bilateral consultations with the foreign country over an outstanding sps or tbt issue might be pursued by ustr with usdas assistance ustr also can decide at any point to elevate the issue via complaint to the wto or if canadian or mexican measure the north american free trade agreement nafta triggering formal dispute resolution procedures 18 other ftas generally defer dispute settlement to the wto procedures usda officials noted that in more recent years they have been taking more holistic approach to sps work than in the past rather than simply identify and try to fix each spsrelated trade problem as it arises they attempt to forestall possible disputes by 1 cooperating with other governments in international scientific forums and 2 supporting capacity building within countries that lack satisfactory regulatory systems or that are new to the world

which meet periodically to discuss current and anticipated threats to human and agricultural health evaluate spsrelated disputes and develop common scientifically based sps standards such standards are voluntary and are intended to provide guidance for coun tries in formulating their own national sps measures and ultimately to help resolve trade disputes for example in 2004 and 2005 the united states joined with canada and mexico in gaining key changes to the oies guidelines for recognizing the trade status of countries with bse bovine spongiform encephalopathy or mad cow disease the revised guidelines seek to emphasize the effectiveness of countrys bse safeguards rather than merely the number of cases it reports using the new guidelines the oie in may 2007 formally recognized the united states canada and four other countries as having controlled bse risk essentially supporting these countries arguments that many types of their beef products should be accepted for import 20

years the united states has concluded or is negotiating growing number of multilateral bilateral and regional trade agreements these agreements aim to reduce the tariffs import quotas and other barriers that countries use to limit imports and to protect their domestic industries including agriculture as tariffs decline or disappear scrutiny can shift to use of sps measures which are another way nations may attempt to protect their domestic producers from import competition 23 present multilateral rules date back to the development and signing of the general agreement on tariffs and trade ga tt in 1947 number of subsequent negotiating rounds led up to the establishment of the wto on january 1 199524 the wto is responsible for administering the multilateral agreements the current set which now governs global trade are known collectively as the uruguay round ur agreements the ur agreements are designed to set out clear transparent and fair trade rules and to eliminate policies that distort and reduce trade among countries examples of such policies may be domestic and export subsidies import tariffs import quotas restrictions on foreign investment arbitrary and unscientific regulations among others the agreements also spell out procedures for global trade cooperation such as periodically reviewing individual countries trade commitmen ts policies and performance and for resolution of trade disputes with regard to sps measures gatt article xx allows governments to adopt measures necessary to protect human animal or plant life or health provided that they do not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate or use this as disguised protectionism this principle was clarified in 1994 by wto members adoption along with the other ur agreements of the agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures the sps agreement this document sets out the basic rules for ensuring that each member countrys food safety and animal and plant health laws and

significance is the agreement on technical barriers to trade it protects the right of members to adopt measures which ensure the quality of exports protect human animal or plant life protect the environment or prevent deceptive practices as long as these measures do not breach the disciplines set forth in the tbt agreement many of the disciplines in the tbt agreement are essentially identical to those in the sps agreement including the obligation to notify and allow for comments on proposed standards affecting trade but the tbt agreement explicitly states that sps measures are bound only by the terms of the sps agreement 26 g6g146g156g153g158g157g142g561g21g142g157g157g149g142g150g142g151g157g561g18g155g152g159g146g156g146g152g151g156g561 as noted governments can and often do resolve sps and other trade disagreements informally through bilateral and multilateral discussions usually among technical experts eg scientists health professionals and if necessary higherlevel trade officials those which cannot be resolved may be elevated to formally established dispute procedures within the wto these procedures are spelled out in another ur agreement called the understanding on rules and procedures governing the settlement of dis putes under the preur dispute settlement procedures country involved in the dispute co uld effectively block decision against it which is not permissible under the current procedures if wto dispute settlement panel ultimately determines that countrys sps or tbt measure for example is inconsistent with wto obligations and wto members adopt the panel or any appellate body report the defending country is expected to withdraw the measure compensation and retaliation are available as temporary remedies if compensation is not provided to the complaining country by the defending country and the two still fail to reach mutually acceptable solution the wto panel can authorize trade retaliation if the complaining country so requests such retaliation generally takes the form of higher tariffs against portion of the defending countrys exports to the complaining country 27

government and wto reports and press releases frequently cite the benefits of the sps and tbt agreements and progress made under these agreements in resolving disputes and facilitating trade between countries however some among them food safety and environmental advocacy organizations and groups that have more broadly opposed efforts toward globalization and toward harmonization of world trading rules have long expressed skepticism they have argued that implementation of the agreements can result in downward harmonization rather than upgraded health and safety standards this can happen when for example wto dispute settlement panel questions the scientific underpinnings of us safeguard andor the united states agrees to an effectively lower standard in order to bring trade negotiations with another country to successful conclusion 33 others counter that the current trade agreements explicitly recognize the right of individual nations as well as states and localities to enact stronger protections than international guidelines if they believe they are appropriate the united states is especially wellpositioned against challenges because its health and safety policies are scientifically defensible us officials have argued the wto itself has asserted that countries can to some extent apply the precautionary principle kind of safety first approach where scientific uncertainty exists34 more specifically the precautionary principle suggests that if scientific evidence is insufficient or inconclusive regarding practices or products potential dangers to human environmental animal or plant health that product or practic should be prohibited if there are reasonable grounds for concern the eu has been criticized by us and other interests for shielding itself behind this principle to impose otherwise scientifically unsupportable barriers to food imports 32 however access to the russian market has remained problematic seecrs report rs22948 usrussia meat and

advocates believe that the sps agreement too severely limits use of the principle35 the effectiveness and flexibility of the sps and tbt rules also are likely to be tested by rapidly emerging changes in food production technology such as biotechnology and nanotechnology neither appeared to be imminent concerns when the agreements were finalized in 1994 many believe that the sps and tbt agreements provide the foundation for developing transparent sciencebased trade guidelines as well as an effective framework for resolving disputes in these areas others have argued that the doha round should have revisited the agreements more closely with regard to these or other new technologies nanotechnology may provide the next test of existing international sps rules 2005 duke law and technology review article argues that measures regulating trade in nanotechnology likely would be subject to the sps agreement and that it could be used to objectively balance the relative risks and benefits of trade in nanotechnology products but as the same article cautions nanoparticles can present unique health and environmental risks 36 the president must submit all ftas to congress which in turn must pass implementing legislation if the united states is to participate ftas have become significant us trade policy tool each one can affect the us economy including the food and agricultural sector and the impact will vary across the range of crop and livestock products traded between the united states and another fta signatory many members of congress are already following closely number of ongoing spsrelated trade disputes that they believe have negatively affected agricultural producers in their states and districts also lawmakers have expressed concern that as recently signed trade agreements lower agricultural tariffs countries may turn more and more to sps measures to protect their farmers from import competition these members have stated that sps matters will be among the factors they will consider in voting for new ftas meanwhile international sps rights and obligations could come into play if the us congress considers legislation placing new restrictions and requirements on food imports as noted such bills are being proposed in the wake of number of highly publicized adulteration incidents related to food and agricultural imports notably from china any new measures are likely to be closely scrutinized by us trading partners for their adherence to international trade rules 35 friends of the earth international trade and peoples food sovereignty position paper april 2003 the document also charged that the codex is so heavily influenced by food and chemical corporations that the standards it sets may be lower than those already in place in many nations 36 nanotechnology
