instruction and parenting skills training for the adults and early childhood education for their children along with necessary supplementary services such as child care or transportation generally even start programs do not directly provide all of these services rather they establish networks of service providers including head start programs and grantees under the adult education act aea even start is the only federal program specifically dedicated to providing services to both disadvantaged young children and their parents the families served by even start programs are highly disadvantaged with very low levels of education and income and increasing proportions of them have limited english language skills the even start program was reauthorized in the 106th congress in pl 106 554 the departments of labor health and human services education and related agencies appropriations act for fy2001 esea title i part b was renamed the william f goodling even start family literacy programs and was reauthorized for five years beginning with an authorization of 250 million for fy2001 the reauthorizing language is largely the same as language contained in the literacy involves families together act hr 3222 goodling which was passed by the full house on september 12 2000 however language in hr 3222 specifying that religious organizations should be treated the same as other nongovernmental organizations in the awarding of subgrants was not included in the final reauthorization language pl 107110 the child left behind act of 2001 the elementary and secondary

esea title i part b provides education and related services jointly to disadvantaged parents and their young children the purpose of the program is to integrate early childhood education adult basic education and parenting skills education into unified family literacy program esea section 1201 an assumption underlying even start is that children whose parents have low literacy or basic education levels are more likely to be educationally successful if in addition to receiving early childhood instruction themselves their parents receive educational services plus instruction in how to help their children learn further parents may be more motivated to participate in adult basic education programs if one of the purposes of such education is to support their childrens educational development while some other federal education programs such as esea title i part programs also provide services to both disadvantaged young children and their parents even start is the only federal program specifically dedicated to this purpose under the even start legislation the us department of education ed is authorized to make grants to states for assistance to eligible entities consisting of local educational agency lea in collaboration with community based organization institution of higher education or other agency or nonprofit organization for joint programs of education for children aged 07 years1 and their parents in each participating family at least one parent must be eligible to be served under the adult education act aea ie not enrolled in school and not high school graduate or equivalent or if lea provides the basic education component of the program services may be provided to parents who are within the compulsory school age range for their state even start program services must include adult literacy instruction early childhood education instruction to help parents support their childs education recruitment screening of parents staff training and homebased instruction in addition child care and transportation services may be provided if these services are necessary and other funding sources are not available typically even start programs do not directly provide all of these services rather they establish networks of service providers including head start programs and grantees under the aea 1 title xvi of pl 106554 the departments of labor health and human services education and related agencies appropriations act for fy2001 permits the program to serve children 8 or older if services are provided in collaboration with esea title i part program crs2 even start programs must be coordinated with other programs with similar purposes operate yearround and be independently evaluated five percent of even start funds is reserved for programs serving migrant children plus the outlying areas and indian tribes2 and up to 3 is reserved for national evaluation technical assistance and program improvement remaining appropriations provide even start grants to the states in proportion to esea title i part grants3 with state minimum of the greater of 05 of all grants or 250000 up to 6 of state grants may be used for state administration and technical assistance4 local grants are made by state educational agencies seas based on recommendations by review panel consisting of an early childhood education specialist an adult education specialist and at least one additional member programs are to be in areas with high rates of poverty illiteracy unemployment limited english proficiency or disadvantaged children even start grants are to be made for period of up to four years and may be renewed for up to four additional years states receiving even start grants are required to develop indicators of program quality to be used to monitor and improve even start programs in the state and to determine whether to continue funding local programs pl 106554 title xvi requires states to submit to ed their quality indicators for even start programs to be eligible for continued funding under the program the federal share is generally limited to 90 for the first year declining to 50 for the fifth sixth and seventh years and 35 for subsequent years5 the federal share limitation may be waived if an entity would not otherwise be able to participate funding for the even start program grew from 14820000 in fy1989 the programs initial year to 225094720 for fy2005 including the fy2005 across theboard reduction the programs funding was significantly reduced to 99000000 in fy20066 see table 1 for the

education justifications of appropriations estimates to the congress note these amounts are not adjusted for price level changes program participants services and outcomes participants even start has grown from 76 local programs serving approximately 2500 families in 19891990 to 855 programs serving approximately 32000 families in 200020017 the most recent available data 20002001 are based on program data for period prior to changes required in the 2000 7 data included here are from the third national even start evaluation 2003 prepared for the us department of education planning and evaluation service crs4 reauthorization of even start these data indicate that even start programs tend to target families with children under age 5 40 of participating children were 02 years old and 28 were 34 years old the parents in the families served generally have low levels of education for example in 20002001 44 of parents had 9th grade or less level of education upon entering the program further the income of participating families is typically quite low 84 of families had income below the federal poverty level only 23 of participating parents in 20002001 were employed8 the share of participants who are hispanic was 46 in 20002001 while 30 were white 19 were african american and the remaining 7 were asian native american hawaiian or multiracial the percentage of participants from nonenglishlanguage backgrounds is high 45 of new even start enrollees speak english as second language the top four reasons given by parents for enrolling in even start were desire to improve their educational status get ged their parenting skills their ability to be better teacher of their child and their childrens chance of future school success services provided in most cases even start programs do not directly provide all of the required services rather they coordinate and integrate services provided by other agencies especially early childhood education provided by head start or state preschool programs or adult basic education provided by aea grantees the services most often provided directly by even start programs are early childhood education and parenting skills education in addition to the core services that all even start programs must provide the support services most often provided are child care meals transportation and social services the average federal budget for even start programs surveyed in 20002001 was 175439 the average federal even start program expenditures per participating family was 4708 in 20002001 the rates of actual participation in various even start activities by the families being served in 20002001 were 84 for adult education 89 for parenting education and parentchild joint activities and 95 for early childhood education with 82 of families participating in all core services maintaining the intensity of services and rates of participation continue to be an issue about half of the even start families who joined even start between 1997 1998 and 20002001 left the program within 10 months in 20002001 17 of families who left even start did so because they had completed their education goals under the program the majority of participants who left did so because of job conflicts relocation motivational issues and other concerns such as poor health homelessness etc evidence from the research literature has indicated that children who participate in intensive highquality services score higher on literacy measures9 and evidence from national even start evaluations has indicated that families participate more when more intensive services are offered as consequence even start projects have 8 nevertheless most of their income comes from wages although not from the non wage earning parent participating in even start 9 w steven barnett longterm effects of early childhood programs on cognitive and school outcomes longterm outcomes of early childhood programs the future of children vol 5 3 pp 2550 crs5 increased the amount of early childhood education and adult education services offered however most even start parents do not use all the hours of services available for themselves and their children for example in 20002001 on average children birth to two received 30 of the service hours made available for children aged 3 and 4 5 and schoolaged the averages were 37 44 and 62 respectively outcomes the most recent national even start evaluation for 20002001 was based on two data sources an experimental design study eds that tracked 18 projects that agreed to randomly assign new families to even start or control group and the even start performance information reporting system espirs which tracks annual data from the universe of even start projects although families participating in the eds were randomly assigned to control and even start groups the 18 projects participating were not randomly selected the eds families were more likely than even start families as whole to be hispanic 75 versus 46 and to be participating in even start projects in urban areas 83 versus 55 the national evaluation collected data on 41 different outcome measures for the families participating in the eds the results indicated that the even start children and their parents did not perform better than the control group children and their parents even start children and their parents made gains in literacy and other measures but so did control group parents and children the data show that children and parents in the control group made the same kinds of gains on literacy assessments on parent reports of child literacy on parentchild reading on literacy resources at home on family economic self sufficiency and so on that were seen for even start families10 the only area in which even start children did significantly better than control group children was in teacher reports of behavior problems for elementary school aged children legislation pl 107110 the child left behind act of 2001 the elementary and secondary education act reauthorization legislation which was signed into law on january 8 2002 moved the william f goodling even start family literacy programs from title i part b of
