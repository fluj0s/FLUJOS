appleton director inrccs reason 14 c d summary and table of contents 1 snf this telegram replaces ref as the departments comprehensive guidance on handling foreign national walkins defectors and asylum seekers all of whom are generally referred to in this telegram as walkins this telegram was coordinated with interagency partners including cia dhs dia and the fbi it explains the procedures for receiving walkins determining whether they are of intelligence value and whether defector temporary refuge protection resettlement parole or other status is appropriate and coordinating an appropriate response link to this telegram will be included in the chief of mission com guide on classnet httpdiplomapsstatesgovgovcom for guidance on handling us citizens requesting emergency protection temporary refuge at posts see ref b 2 snf coms should ensure that all post personnel are properly prepared to handle walkins post management rso and grpo have the most responsibility for ensuring proper handling of walkins but other officers may play critical roles 3 snf correct handling of walkins is important for three principal reasons walkins 1 may be sources of invaluable intelligence 2 pose numerous security challenges and 3 may need protection improper handling of walkins can put them and post personnel at risk and result in the loss of important intelligence thus posts procedures must be clear wellunderstood and workable at any hour day or night 4 u questions or comments regarding the guidance in this telegram should normally be directed by telegram to inrccs which will coordinate department response if additional guidance is required in an emergency walkin situation however post should contact the departments operations center 2026471512 which will alert the appropriate department personnel 5 u this telegram contains the following sections storage and dissemination of this telegram paragraph 6 b post preparation for handling walkins paragraphs 723 c procedures for handling walkin arrivals paragraphs 2433 d requirements for reporting on walkins paragraphs 3439 temporary refuge guidance and cautions paragraphs 4052 f longterm options for walkinsparagraphs 53 63 g travel assistance for walkinsparagraphs 64 65 end summary section storage and dissemination of this telegram 6 u posts should retain this telegram in the rsos files and in location accessible to duty officers replacing and destroying ref and any other prior versions rsos should ensure that all officers have read this telegram and know where it is retained section b post preparation for handling walkins 7 snf each posts counterintelligence working group ciwg should meet upon receipt of this telegram to review posts procedures for dealing with walkins the ciwg should ensure that posts procedures are consistent with the guidance in this telegram and local security concerns include appropriate defensive security measures and allow screened walkins to meet securely with appropriate post officials 8 snf posts walkins procedures should include 1 special procedures for the reception of embassy including consular section walkins of possible intelligence value 2 procedures for constituent posts if any and 3 procedures for approaches at residences in vehicles on the street via telephone and through both electronic and handdelivered mail heightened security at usg installations increases the possibility of approaches to usg officials outside usg facilities because of the inherent risks however post procedures should permit arranging substantive meetings outside post only in exceptional circumstances and only after approval of the com based on the recommendations of the rso and grpo 9 snf posts procedures must allow for appropriately balancing the following considerations which may come into play in walkin cases post security b the safety of the individual c the intelligence value and bona fides of the individual d whether the individual requires protection and if so whether appropriate protection is available from international organizations or hostcountry sources whether the individual should be resettled outside the hostcountry and if so whether resettlement in another country or the united states is possible f the time available for resolution of the case and g the need to safeguard the confidentiality of any information that may have bearing on future consularrelated activity or possible resettlement request 10 snf posts procedures must be cleared by the rso and coordinated with the grpo and at posts with an fbi legal attache legatt with the legatt all three should be on posts ciwg posts rso should update posts walkin plan with the grpo and legatt if any on semiannual basis or as needed 11 snf rsos should ensure that all relevant potential participants in handling walkins are appropriately briefed and trained noncleared personnel can be told that usg official will interview walkins because that fact is not classified the fact that walkin may be referred to other post officials for decision on further actions is classified and may not be shared with noncleared personnel all briefings should emphasize the importance of ensuring that the walk in is fully screened but should also convey that legitimate walkins may exhibit nervous or anxious behavior particularly because access controls and host nation security forces around many of our diplomatic posts make it difficult for walkins to approach our facilities discreetly all briefings should also stress the importance of not drawing attention to the walkin or alerting host nation security personnel 12 snf rso briefings should include 1 briefing those who may have first contact with walkin including nonusg local guards and receptionists on the procedures to follow at first contact 2 providing additional briefings to msgs other usg security personnel and usg duty officers on semiannual basis or as needed on more sensitive aspects of the program 3 briefing consular officers on handling walkins who approach through consular service window and 4 briefing all arriving cleared usg personnel on the procedures for approaches that occur off post premises as part of the arrival briefing 13 snf to ensure that walkins can communicate their wishes clearly post may wish to prepare language cards that can be shown at first contact to walkin who does not speak english giving options from which the walkin can select one option should be i wish to speak with an american official other options should be plausible alternatives such as i wish to obtain information about travel requirements in addition to the local language post should consider having such cards available in priority interest languages such as russian spanish arabic farsi mandarin and korean as appropriate in light of the local environment 14 snf the rso should incorporate posts procedures into the msg and local guard orders as necessary 15 snf posts should designate room preferably outside the public access control pac hardline for conducting the initial interview of walkin 16 snf post should have an interview guide that can be used during the initial interview and should maintain current roster of cleared usg personnel who can provide interpretation services to assist the rso and others in interviewing walk ins as required 17 snf post procedures should clearly identify the officer who will do the initial interview of walkin and backup for when that officer is absent these are normally the rso and assistant rso these officials should have prearranged signal and appropriate contact numbers for notifying grpo of walkin of possible intelligence value 18 snf msgs local guards and receptionists should have codeword or prearranged signal to alert the rso or other designated officer of person requesting to speak with us officer 19 u post should verify that current phone numbers addresses and directions for host government offices that handle refugee claims and the local offices of the unhcr and undp are included in posts walkin procedures and the duty officer handbook this information should also be readily available as handout for walkins 20 u post procedures should contain current information on the host governments legal obligations towards persons claiming to be refugees or to be in danger of being tortured these obligations may arise from the host countrys domestic law andor treaty obligations states party to the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees its 1967 protocol and the 1969 african union convention governing the specific aspects of refugee problems in africa have agreed not to expel or return refugees as defined in those instruments from their territory under certain circumstances states party to the 1987 convention against torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment have agreed not to expel or return an individual from their territory to another country where there are substantial grounds for believing that heshe would be in danger of being subjected to torture 21 snf rso and grpo should coordinate any operational tests of walkin procedures 22 snf rsos should review walkin procedures with constituent posts and ensure that they are properly prepared to handle walkins this should include ensuring that constituent posts procedures are also incorporated into local guard orders as necessary 23 snf posts without an rso grpo or unhcrundp presence incountry should promptly develop additional postspecific guidance to ensure that the guidance in this telegram is adjusted to fit their situation section c procedures for handling walkin arrivals 24 snf the msg local guard receptionist or other employee or official who first makes contact with the walkin should ascertain whether the walk in wishes to talk with the usg official using the language cards as necessary if so they should use the prearranged signal to inform the usg official designated to deal with walkins normally the rso or assistant rso as soon as possible posts with msgs may wish to instruct nonusg local guards receptionists and others likely to be walkins first point of contact to refer walkin who wishes to speak with usg official to the msg and then have the msg involve the rso 25 c posts first priority must be to determine whether the individual is carrying weapon device or hazardous material that endangers post personnel walkins must be screened and searched before being permitted within the security perimeter if walkin possesses any object or item that appears suspicious or potentially hazardous security personnel should deny access even if the walkin presents the item as evidence of some intelligence he offers eg red mercury presented as proof of plutonium enrichment security personnel are not required to prove that an object item or material is hazardous to refuse entry to the walkin only dssupplied andor ds approved instruments should be used to examine suspect material posts should follow established ds and department procedures for screening and reporting suspect materials eg white powder incidents in the event post encounters material or information relating to alleged radioactive materials please refer to ref c for comprehensive interagency approved guidance 26 c the walkins identification andor travel documents should be copied as soon as the walkin is screened in if at all possible otherwise the papers should be copied before the end of the walk ins initial interview identifying and keeping records of walkins is important for security and intelligence reasons copying their identity documents early is advisable because walkins may get cold feet and leave if kept waiting for an interview 27 snf after the walkin has been searched the rso or designated alternate must interview the walkin using posts interview guide the rso should attempt to establish the individuals bona fides walkins may in fact be mentally disturbed persons intelligence vendors fabricators provocateurs from hostile intelligence services or persons gathering information on behalf of terrorist organizations once the subjects bona fides are established to the rsos satisfaction the rso should establish what the walkin wants whether the walkin appears to be of possible intelligence or counterintelligence interest how much time the walkin has and methods for future contact among other information the rso must also attempt to determine whether the individual is in imminent danger including 1 immediate physical danger 2 danger of involuntary repatriation to country where the individuals life or freedom would be threatened for reasons of race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion or 3 danger of involuntary repatriation to country where it is more likely than not that the individual will be subjected to torture finally the rso may have reason to interview the individual for information regarding potential threats to usg personnel and facilities if such information is obtained the rso generally should advise the legatt and should consider flagging the individual for the rewards for justice program 28 snf monitoring of foreign nationals in walkin rooms overseas is permitted only in accordance with guidelines set forth in ref d all other recording or monitoring conducted by post employees including those in cover positions must be consistent with the department notice of january 24 1977 the vance memorandum which states that officer or employee of the state department shall direct arrange for permit or undertake the monitoring or mechanical or electronic recording of any conversation including any telephone conversation without the express consent of all persons involved in the conversation unless advance approval is granted by the secretary or the deputy secretary of state reproduced at tab u special agents legal authorities available at httpintranetstategov 29 c post personnel should never leave walk in unattended if possible two or more post officials should work together during the interview phase 30 snf if the rso finds the walkin credible and to be of possible foreign intelligence or counterintelligence interest the rso should follow post procedures to ensure transfer of the walkin to the grpo as quickly as possible with minimal exposure to other post personnel the grpo will determine further actions interview contact again at later date etc 31 c post must strictly limit disclosure of the fact of any request for temporary refuge departure from the host country asylum in the united states thirdcountry visa assistance issuance or refusal of visas or permits to enter the united states and requests to resettle elsewhere only usg personnel with needtoknow should be made aware of such requests 32 c post should provide comment in response to press inquiries unless otherwise instructed by the department 33 c post must consult with the department prior to responding to congressional inquiries on specific walkin cases section d requirements for reporting on walkins 34 snf if walkin is of intelligence interest the case will be handled by the intelligence community ic once that interest is established and reporting on the case will occur in ic channels post must notify the department of allall cases not handled within the ic and involving the following using the reporting channels described in paragraphs 3739 below except where otherwise indicated person who may have information on immediate threats to usg personnel or facilities see paragraph 35 below for reporting channel instructions b person who possesses information regarding plans and intentions of governments andor organizations hostile to the united states c person who may have information on weapons proliferation weapons of mass destruction counterterrorism counternarcotics or any significant new intelligence or militaryrelated subjects d foreign diplomat foreign consular officer other foreign government official including members of the national police and the military or political party official regardless of hisher country of nationality person who appears threatened by involuntary repatriation to country where the persons life or freedom would be threatened for reasons of race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion or where it is more likely than not that the person would be tortured see paragraph 36 below for reporting channel instructions f persons seeking resettlement including asylum in the united states see section paragraphs 4052 below and ref for additional guidance on such cases g persons granted temporary refuge see paragraphs 5052 for instructions on reporting such cases 35 snf security threat information reportable per paragraph 34a above should be reported via terrep or terrep exclusive channel telegram as appropriate as soon as possible threat information of an extremely urgent nature should be provided to the rso and other appropriate post officials immediately and relayed to the ds command center dscc at 571 3453146 or via dscc secure line at 571 3457793 36 snf cases involving threats of involuntary return as described in paragraph 34e above should be brought to the departments attention immediately by phone email or cable slugged for prma with us mission geneva attention refugee and migration affairs rma as an info addressee 37 snf except as specified above for threat and involuntary return cases telegrams should be sent through normal channels be slugged for inrccs p dsci and the appropriate regional bureau and describe the timesensitivity of the case inrccs is the action office and will distribute to other bureaus as appropriate in extremely sensitive cases post should send roger channel telegram to inrccs which will ensure appropriate limited distribution 38 snf if the case may require consideration of us resettlement options posts may also wish to slug prma drlmlga lhrr and cavo and to add dhsuscis washdc as an info addressee 39 snf all telegrams should use the pinr and asec tags cvis and pref tags also should be used in potential resettlement cases all telegrams referring to unhcr should add us mission geneva attention refugee and migration affairs rma as an info addressee section temporary refuge cautions and guidance 40 snf walkins sometimes request that they be permitted to remain in an embassy or other usg facility beyond closing hours the department considers this request for temporary refuge not request for asylum and post officials should be particularly careful not to equate the two in us immigration law asylum is status granted to qualified refugees and an application for asylum can only be made in the united states walkin may request asylum in an embassy based on the erroneous belief that safe passage out of the host country will be assured if the request is granted while few mostly latin american countries recognize such right of diplomatic asylum the united states and most other countries do not recognize that concept or accept that the granting of refuge in an embassy is an authorized use of diplomatic facilities walkin who requests asylum may also in substance be requesting an opportunity to resettle in the united states guidance on such requests is below under longterm options 41 snf granting walkin temporary refuge in an embassy or other usg facility may actually increase the danger to an individual particularly in hostile countries and if the individual is hostcountry national the longer the person remains the more likely the host government will become aware of the request for temporary refuge and possibly take retaliatory action in hostile countries the united states generally is unable either to assure walkins safe conduct out of the country or continued safety in the country once they leave post premises thus granting temporary refuge may lead to protracted stalemate with the walkin effectively residing in post premises residence within post of persons hostile to the host government could be continuing source of controversy and lead to serious adverse effects on us interests and unexpected financial implications for the post 42 u in light of these factors all foreign national walkins seeking refuge in usg facility should be informed that post cannot ensure their safe conduct out of the host country b their future safety within the host country or c their entry into the united states they should also be informed that they may actually endanger their own welfare or interests by remaining at post 43 snf temporary refuge may never be granted to foreign nationals who simply wish to immigrate to the united states or evade local criminal law if granting refuge would put post security in jeopardy or if the department instructs post not to do so 44 snf post should use appropriate measures to remove person seeking refuge from the premises when temporary refuge is not warranted 45 snf only the com or principal officer or person designated to act on their behalf in their absence may grant request for temporary refuge 46 snf temporary refuge may be granted only if there is compelling evidence that the walkin is in imminent physical danger for any reason or in imminent danger of persecution for reasons of race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion 47 snf within the kinds of cases described in paragraph 46 post should grant temporary refuge in those rare situations in which an individual faces not just imminent physical danger but immediate and exceptionally grave physical danger ie possible death or serious bodily injury either in the host country or in another country to which the individual will be summarily returned by host country authorities 48 snf also within the kinds of cases described in paragraph 46 post may at its discretion grant temporary refuge if the physical danger or the danger of involuntary repatriation as defined above is less serious but appears imminent in determining if granting temporary refuge is appropriate in such instances post should consider the following questions how serious and immediate is the threat to the walkin b will the threat to the individual increase or decrease if the walkin is allowed to remain at post c can the individual leave or be required to leave post without being noticed d if detection by host government authorities is inevitable and the alleged threat is from the host government can the walkins presence and subsequent departure be explained in manner that will not further endanger the individual what are the likely consequences of allowing the individual to temporarily remain at the post with regards to the individual other persons in the host country the security of the post and the safety of us government personnel f is the individual of intelligence value to the united states g is the person facing immediate and exceptionally grave physical danger on account of peaceful political religious or humanitarian activities consistent with us values and policies 49 cnf temporary refuge generally should not be granted at residential diplomatic or consular premises the inviolability of diplomatic residences except the coms is linked to the diplomats residency and may be lost if the host government declares persona non grata png the diplomat whose residence is involved consular residences do not enjoy inviolability unless it is provided by special agreement as practical matter all residences whether diplomatic or consular are generally less secure than the embassy or consulate 50 c if temporary refuge is granted post should notify the department in an appropriately classified niact immediate precedence telegram and should notify other relevant overseas posts by immediate precedence telegram telegrams to the department should be slugged for inrccs p prma lhrr ldl dscc drlmlga cavo and the appropriate regional bureau dhsuscis washdc should be direct telegraphic info addressee post also should notify the department by telegram if temporary refuge is requested but denied unless the case is clearly without merit eg appeals by drunken or deranged person 51 snf if the host government or the government of the aliens nationality if the individual is thirdcountry national requests an interview with walkin who is granted temporary refuge post should notify the department and await guidance post should notnot comply with such interview requests unless explicitly authorized to do so by the department 52 sbu if granted temporary refuge should be terminated as soon as circumstances permit eg when the period of active danger ends but only with department authorization post management should inform the department to the same addressees listed in paragraph 50 when temporary refuge is terminated person who has been granted temporary refuge may of course leave voluntarily whenever heshe wishes post management should reasonably ensure that the decision to leave is voluntary section f longterm options 53 u walkins often wish to resettle in the united states but this may not be appropriate or possible the united states encourages local or regional resettlement of refugees and international resettlement burdensharing among many governments 54 cnf in routine cases involving walkins from third countries who may be refugees the walk in should be referred to the host government for adjudication of his or her status as long as the host country has satisfactory asylum or refugee processing procedures in most cases potential refugees should also be referred to the local office of the unhcr especially if local refugeeasylum procedures are not available unhcr is mandated to provide protection for refugees and has primary international responsibility for seeking durable solutions for refugees including possible opportunities for thirdcountry resettlement this mandate extends to unhcr even in countries that are not party to any of the treaties just mentioned where there is unhcr office unhcrs responsibilities are normally handled by the local undp office beware however that in some countries unhcr or undp may be placed in an awkward position if it is notified of case and there is need to conceal the case from the host government if this possibility exists post should approach unhcr or undp discreetly 55 cnf if it appears that entry into the united states is the appropriate longterm solution to walkins situation the walkin should not be issued nonimmigrant visa except in unusual circumstances after consultation with the department nonimmigrant admission will generally not be appropriate because the circumstances that lead an individual to become walkin normally lead also to ineligibility under section 214b of the immigration and nationality act ina as an intending immigrant admission to the united states therefore normally should be as refugee or parolee in some circumstances an immigrant visa may also be available refugee admission 56 u person outside the united states may be granted refugee admission if he or she qualifies as refugee as defined in us law and meets other applicable requirements dhs has sole responsibility for adjudicating applications for refugee admission outside the united states dhsuscis officers determine whether or not an individual is refugee on casebycase basis after personal interview to qualify person must normally be outside his country given adequate justification however dhs may adjudicate an in country refugee application when requested by us ambassador with the concurrence of prma and dhsuscis in washington see ref f entitled how post can refer cases to the us refugee admissions program and ref g entitled worldwide processing priority system for fy 2010 for more information 57 u the us definition of refugee encompasses person who under the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees and its 1967 protocol is outside his or her country of nationality or if he or she has nationality the country of last habitual residence and has experienced past persecution or has wellfounded fear of persecution in that country on account of race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion us law deems the following persons to have been persecuted on account of political opinion person who has been forced to abort pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such procedure or for other resistance to coercive population control program person who has wellfounded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such procedure or be persecuted for such failure refusal or resistance 58 u persons admitted to the united states as refugees are eligible for initial reception and placement assistance from nongovernment organizations ngos funded under cooperative agreements with prm and for other publicly funded benefits 59 u if the host government cannot or will not protect the individual from involuntary repatriation and unhcr is unable to intervene and post believes that the person may qualify as refugee post should contact prma for guidance on how to proceed parole 60 snf foreign nationals may also travel to the united states pursuant to the secretary of homeland securitys parole authority under section 212d5 of the ina parole may be granted based on humanitarian or significant public benefit grounds authority over humanitarian parole requests rests with dhsuscisraiohab authority over significant public benefit parole spbp rests with dhsice dhsiceoialepb has developed guidelines in consultation with the department for the processing of spbp cases guidelines for both types of parole are contained in ref h 61 snf use of parole for walkin may be warranted in extraordinary cases such as when other resolution appears feasible and walkin is of special interest to the united states when walkin is in immediate danger or when the case is politically sensitive if post wishes to pursue parole for walkin it must submit request by telegram slugged for inrccs cavofp drlmlga p and the appropriate regional bureau an info copy should go to the appropriate dhs bureau the telegram must provide justification for the request include certification by the com or the deputy chief of mission dcm that the information provided is complete and accurate and identify all interested agencies at post that were involved in reviewing and endorsing the request class name check must be completed and all required security advisory opinion requests saos must be submitted the results of the class name check should be indicated in the cable 62 u all financial arrangements for parolees must be made in advance post should not make any guarantees of such assistance but
