mime_suspect_name xspamlevel dear fortunat and others here is the revised section 658 ive put in most of your changes and also most of those suggested by stefan particularly with regards to clarifying the sign of the radiative forcing most importantly ive removed the table i agree it seems to imply solidity that is really not there the one thing i have not done is condense it greatly of course the real reason for going into such detail rather than just saying well the forcing and response are uncertain so we cant conclude anything is i think its important to show that paleoclimate scientists have gone to some effort to try to deduce climate sensitivity from the paleorecord the parameter that is probably of most interest to ipcc in that respect the details are important as are the magnitudes of uncertainty represented in the different studies obviously at any point in the proceedings the section can be shortened but i thought it useful to start with this level of quantification and show paleoclimate has this similarity with the rest of ipcc in addition to more qualitative concepts ive responded to your individual comments below at 615 pm 0100 11105 joos wrote dear david here my comments on the updated climate sensitivity section please apologize if i formualate my comments straight away but i need to leave very soon many of my comments might have to do with presentation your main conclusions in paragraph f are fine my view is that it would be ideal to address the issue from probabilistic view point this is of course not always possible 1 maunder minimum section several studies using monte carlo approaches show that almost any climate sensitivity is posssible when taking into account uncertainties in radiative forcing input data as well as observational records over the 20 century as constraints see the paris report for more information the uncertainty does not only arise from indirect aerosol effect but also form the whole range of forcing agents that all have an uncertainty attached eg reto knutti did some evaluation of his results where he assumed that the aerosol forcing is exactly know error even then climate sensititivity remains unconstraint clearly uncertainty is growing when going further back in time than the last century as done here then the numbers provided in the table are useless as you now state in the last sentence of the revised text 2 other sections i think similar concerns also hold for the other sections for example the lgm global cooling is very uncertain i have just heard yesterday talk by ralph schneider who showed how different sst reconstructions alkenone cdca mat radiolare etc disagree global sst cooling might be anywhere between 0 and 4 k or so of course climap and the recent glamap update provide reasonable estimate however the point is that uncertainies are huge the table is very focused and stand alone thing for the reader it gives the impression that climate sensitivity for different period can be well evaluated however this is not the case 3 my conclusion the table should be dropped i have quite strong feeling here as it seems to that the number in the table are very hard to defend and should not be made prominent the table and reference to it has been dropped the whole section should be condensed considerably your main conclusions in paragraph f are fine well removing the table will shorten this section further comments 1 section d 1 solar forcing reduction estimate range up to 065 for mm eg reid 97 and bard et correction made and reference added and i also corrected the numbers as stefan suggested although the upper number is actually larger given the reid estimate 2 section d last equilibrium the statement that transient effects are not important is very hard to defend 2a the warming and forcing up to today is considered certainly we are now far from equilibrium lag of 30 years or so 2b the volcanic forcing is very pulse like and i do not see how the equilibrium concept holds here it can only be evaluated in transient way 3c the mm is probably not in equilibrium climate as solar forcing has likely varied over the mm as indicated by radiocarbon althoug sunspots were not present ive removed the word transient but i have justified the equilibrium aspect of the sentence with reference we investigated that issue by running from 1500 through the maunder minimum and seeing what the prior changes in solar forcing did to the maunder minimum cooling the effect as noted in the reference was small in our model 3 section b end of 1 how should such general climate sensitivity be defined for now ive simply suggested what should also be factored in i dont know that its our place to come up with new definition per although if ipcc is interested we could try 4 section c somewhat mix of model and observations end of 2 it is not clear which forcing was operating in these different models at least it is not stated in the text and hence one can not directly imply climate sensitivity in the way done here for this the forcing that went into the model simulations must be known i looked at each of the references and saw what forcing they actually used they were all very similar except for one which used current orbital parameters not really important this comment is now included hope this is useful and looking foreward to further debate the issue thanks for the comments david ps jonathan the attached endnote library includes the references we discussed yesterday as well as all the ones relevant for this section jonathan t overpeck
