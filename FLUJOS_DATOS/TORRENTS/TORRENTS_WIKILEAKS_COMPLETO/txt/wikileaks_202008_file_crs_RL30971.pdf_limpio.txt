appears to be broa d agreement in congress on the overall objective of us policy toward cuba to help bring democracy and respect for human rights to the island there have been several schools of thought on how to achieve that objective some advocate policy of keeping maximum pressure on the cuban government until reforms are enacted while continuing current us efforts to support the cuban

dutyfree treatment of selected us imports from bolivia colombia ecuador and peru atpas goal was to encourage grow th of more diversified andean export base thereby promoting deve lopment and providing an in centive for andean farmers and other workers to pursue ec onomic alternatives to the drug trade atpa expired on december 4 2001 following lengthy debate the 107th congress reauthorized the

president george w bush prior to expiring atpas trade preferences provided small incentivebased part to larger andean counternarcotic s strategy coca production was the primary target of these efforts and because coca s been highly profitable undertaking key element of the counternarcotics st rategy is supporting the cultivation of alternative cash crops atpas supporte rs argued before congress that reduced tariffs played part of the alternativ development strategy by providing an additional financial incentive to substitute legal crops asparagus has been one success story for coca cultivation the in crease in nonagricultural exports eg copper cathodes also may reflect the eff ects of this preferential tariff program others noted that through the life of the program atpas benefits were quantitatively small in part because they did not affect large portion of andean exports many andean exports were either ineligible under atpa or were eligible for preferential treatment unde r the generalized system of preferences gsp as well the united states international trade commission usitc determined that if these two groups of andean exports were exclude d those articles that entered the united states exclusively under the at pa provisions that is woul d not be eligible under the gsp in the absence of atpa would amount to only 10 of exports from the beneficiary countries this did not change for 10 years suggesting that atpas trade effects were unlikely to increase unless the programs parameters could be modified supporters of the atpa program proposed that it be reauthorized to reinforce the us commitment to the alternative velopment counternarc otics strategy and that benefits be extended to additional andean exports to broaden their effects opponents raised concerns over the adverse impact its reduced tariffs would have on us domestic producers there was also interest in trying to rationalize treatment among countries in the region that were provided preferential treatment under different trade arrangements such as atpa the north american free trade agreement nafta and the caribbean basin trade partnership act cbtpahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30971crs22 on december 4 2 001 atpa expired and us tariffs were reimposed on affected andean exports on february 15 2002 the bush administration deferred collection of these tariffs for 90 days in expectation that the 107th congress would either reauthorize atpa or provide shor tterm extension of its trade preferences in part because the atpa legislation was eventually linked to the larger debate on trade promotion authority tpa congress was unable to complete work on the bill before the deferral expired the program was eventually reauthorized in the

in place prior to atpas expiration were made retroactive to december 4 2001 and presumably any duties collected are reimbursable as passed into law the andean trad promotion and drug eradication act reflects the findings of the 107th congress that extending and expanding trade preferences to beneficiary c ountries is part of an effective us foreign policy to counter illicit drug trafficking from the andean region to enhance the effects of the expired atpa it extends preferentia l treatment through december 31 2 006 and expands it to cover many andean exports previously excluded such as certain textile and apparel articles footwear leather products petroleum watches and canned tuna in general the provisions provide treatment similar to that received by caribbean countries under the

growing social issues the seeds of argentinas financial and political crisis were planted in 1991 with adoption of its currency board to fight hy perinflation the conve rtibility law which enacted the currency board legally guarant eed the convertibility of peso currency to dollars at onetoone fixed rate and m onetary policy was forcibly constrained to uphold that promise although this program achieved its goal of reducing inflation to remain credible over the long run it required continuing st rong economic growth and disciplined macroeconomic policies particularly if it were to weather the inevitable external shocks argentina proved unable to enforce the economic policies needed to support the convertibility plan and was ev entually beset by numerous external shocks nagging fiscal deficits growing debt obligations and deteriorating cu rrent account deficits combined with the 1999 braz ilian devaluati on the real appreciation of the us dollar rising interest rates and the gl

monetary fund imf confidence waned in argentinas ability simultaneously to reverse its recession correct its fiscal deficit honor its foreign bt obligations and maintain the convertibility plan last d itch financial po licies such as forced debt restructuring and limiting bank withdrawals strained credibility abroad and incited rioting at home that culminated in the economic and political crisis including argentinas default on over 90 billion of sovereign debt president duhaldes economic progra m initially centered on abandoning the currency board and the pesos 1to1 peg w ith the dollar in favor of dual exchange rate system this soon gave way to fl oating exchange rate system but included bank deposits and loans being converted at rate of 140 pesos and 100 pesos to the dollar respectively the freeze on ba nk deposits was also maintained the mismatch in the conversion ra between bank loans asse ts and deposits liabilities caused banks to become tec hnically bankrupt despite
