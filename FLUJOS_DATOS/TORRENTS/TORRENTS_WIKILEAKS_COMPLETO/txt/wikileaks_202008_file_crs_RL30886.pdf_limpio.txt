on international narcotics control share of traffic mexico continued to be the transit point for about 5065 of the cocaine entering the united states from south america in 2000 with the uncertain and varying estimates being similar to estimates in recent years mexico also continued to be major source country for heroin marijuana and methamphetamine and major center for money laundering activities control efforts seizures of cocaine by mexico in 2000 were down 31 from 1999 and down 12 from the 19941999 average which might be viewed as lagging performance seizures of opium were down from unusually high levels in 1999 but represented 32 increase over the 19941999 average seizures of heroin were up slightly while seizures of marijuana methamphetamine and drug labs were up significantly arrests were up slightly in 2000 to reach the highest levels in the last seven years except for 1996 but numerous instances of apparent corruption persist several important drug traffickers were arrested in 2000 including key members of the arellano feliz or tijuan cartel ismael mayel higuera guerrero chief operations officer and jesus chuy labra aviles financial manager while only one mexican national was extradite d to the united states in 2000 on drugrelated charges january 2001 ruling by the mexican supreme court and mexican senate approval of the temporary surrender protocol are promising developments eradication of opium and marijuana declined somewhat in 2000 but with fewer hectares of cultivation the potential yield of opium declined markedly to new record low and the potential yield of marijuana was lower than four of the previous six years cooperative efforts usmexico counternarcotics cooperation continued at unprecedented levels during the final years of the

recent congressional interest and action congress has had longstanding interest in mexicos counternarcotics efforts beginning with legislation originally enacted in the mid1980s congress has required the president to certify annually subject to congressional review that drug producing or drugtransit countries have cooperated fully with the united states in drug control efforts during the previous year to avoid suspension of us aid1 mexico has been fully certified each year but congress has closely monitored these certifications and resolutions of disapproval to reverse the presidential certifications were introduced in 1996 1997 1998 and 1999 in 1996 floor action was taken in 1997 each house passed separate weakened resolutions in 1998 senate version was defeated in floor action and in 1999 action was taken on house resolutions following the election of opposition candidate vicente fox as president of mexico in july 2000 several members called for modification of the certification procedures or exemption of mexico from the process president bush certified mexico as fully cooperative in drug control efforts on march 1 2001 citing the arrest of key members of the

entering the united states from south america and is major source country for heroin marijuana and methamphetamine3 agency experts agree that mexicos share of illicit traffic in the various areas has remained high over the years although there are variations in the estimates the methodology for making the estimates whether derived from seizures or some other means is not regarded as entirely adequate and the estimates may be affected by changing trafficking patterns and demand as much as enforcement efforts in many cases estimates have not been provided in recent administration reports and congressional testimony with regard to cocain the major drug of concern the state departments recent incsr report covering the year 2000 cited dea estimates that 55 of the cocaine sold in the united states transits mexic about the same time dea offici testified in march 2001 that 65 of south american cocaine reaches american cities via the usmexico border while us customs official indicated that more than 50 entered via the southwest border4 these uncertain and varying estimates are similar to the estimates in recent years with respect to heroin the recent incsr report did not estimate the percentage of usbound heroin produced in mexico but it noted that mexico produces only about two percent of the worlds opium nearly all destined for the united states and that production in mexico plummeted as result of eradication efforts and severe drought us customs official stated in march 2001 hearings that 14 of the heroin seized in the united states comes from mexico while an independent study indicated that mexico is the source of 29 of the heroin used in the united states5 in other areas the recent incsr report noted that mexicobased transnational criminal organizations have become the largest distributors in the united states of methamphetamine and precursor chemicals like ephedrine with methamphe tamine seizures in the united states growing from 96 kilograms in 1998 to 358 kilograms in 1999 and 638 kilograms in 2000 according to dea virtually all the marijuana smuggled into the united states whether grown in mexico or shipped through mexico from lesser

by the mexican government show raw estimates of areas sprayed data on ephedrine seizures were provided by the embassy of mexico for the reporting period december 1 1999 to november 30 2000 caution should be exercised in considering the changes in the various areas as an indication of mexicos seriousness in controlling drug trafficking the trends may also be affected by the demand for the drugs the amoun t of drugs produced or available the sophistication of the drug traffickers the intelligence and capabilities of mexican counterdrug agencies the effectiveness of report ing and monitoring methods the effect of weather conditions on eradication efforts and competition from alternative drug suppliershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30886crs4 7 see crs report rl30475 mexicos counternarcotics efforts under zedillo december 1994 to march 2000 by k larry storrs p 4seizures of drugs with regard to mexican seizures of drugs in 2000 the results portrayed in the table demonstrate some setbacks as well as successes compared to the results in the previous year that were unusually high7 seizures of cocaine which many consider to be the key test were down to 232 metric tons in 2000 31 decline from the seizures in 1999 and 12 decline from the average seizures in the previous six years 19941999 but roughly equal to the performance in recent years except for 1997 and 1999 in this case the decline in seizures might be viewed as sign of lagging performance as sign of success from mexicos commitment of about 500 million over three years for interdiction technology to seal the border against the transit of drugs or as sign of the difficulty of capture as traffickers increasingly utilize multiple maritime avenues including small gofast boats fishing vessels and commercial carriers and diverse overland routes yearly results may also be skewed by limited number of large seizures with some recent maritime operations resulting in the seizure of 38 metric tons of cocaine mexican government data for the reporting period of december 1 1999 to november 30 2000 shows seizures of cocaine at 276 metric tons 1 increase over seizures of 273 metric tons in the previous year and the highest level of seizures in the last six years except for 1997 seizures of opium were also down to 041 metric tons 49 decline from the unusually high level in 1999 but 32 increase from average seizures in 19941999 and the highest level of seizures in the last seven years except for 1999 seizure results in other areas were more positive seizures of heroin were up to 0302 metric tons in 2000 17 increase from 1999 31 increase over the 19941999 average and the highest rate in the last seven years except for 1996 seizures of marijuana increased to 2005 metric tons in 2000 37 increase over 1999 and significant 105 increase over the average in 19941999 and the highest level of seizures within the last seven years seizures of methamphetamine increased dramatically in 2000 to 0638 metric tons 78 increase over 1999 171 increase over the 19941999 average and the highest level by far of seizures ever reported suggesting the growth in importance of this drug seizures of ephedrine as reported by mexican officials increased to 0560 metric tons in 2000 53 increase over 1999 and 24 increase over the 19971999 average but an 81 decrease from the average for the 19951999 period with the extraordinarily large seizures in 1995 and 1996 the seizure of 23 illicit drug labs in 2000 was dramatic increase as well registering 65 increase over 1999 and 77 increase over the 19941999 period for the highest number of seizures recorded on the chart acco rding to new attorney general rafael macedo concha narcotics seizures have increased significantly in the fox administration in report on the

in all categories the numbers of arrests of foreigners were up 15 from 1999 to the highest level on the chart except for 1998 and the numbers of arrests of mexicans and total arrests were up over 5 to the highest levels in the last seven years except for 1996 among the key arrests in 2000 were the apprehensions of five members of the arellano feliz or tijuana cartel with the most important being ismael mayel higuera guerrero chief operations officer and jesus chuy labra aviles financial manager and lesser collaborators being enrique harari garduno carlos ariel charry guzman and ismael higuera avila other notable arrests where usmexico cooperation was highlighted were the apprehensions of heroin traffickers isaias and juan hernandez ibarra and the capture of agustin vazquez mendoza after six year manhunt on charges of killing dea agent in phoenix arizona still other important arrests were the apprehensions of drug cartel collaborators hugo baldomero medina garza and olegario meraz gutierrez along with the arrests mexico often seized important assets of drug trafficking and money laundering operations while noting that none of the leading drug traffickers were arrested or convicted in 2000 the recent incsr report states that the arrests and prosecutions were significant accomplishments involving successful operational planning and execution and new level of interagency cooperation critics argue that mexican authorities have failed to weed out corruption to arrest major drug traffickers to extradite mexican citizens to the united states on drugrelated charges and to enforce the countrys antimoneylaundering legislation9 major instances of drugrelated corruption mentioned in the press include the appare nt suicide in march 2000 of senior official in mexicos federal

states in 2000 following the general pattern for the zedillo administration with six persons but major drug traffickers being extradited on drugrelated charges those extradited on drug charges included three us citizens two argentines and one mexican national while previous mexican policy and court decisions required that mexican nationals wanted for crimes committed abroad be prosecuted in mexico the zedillo administration broke new ground by extraditing seven mexican nationals and one dual usmexican national to the united states between 1996 and 2000 on grounds that this was permitted under the usmexico extraditi on treaty and mexican extradition law in exceptional cases despite this stance mexican courts continued to be relucta nt to approve extradition of mexican nationals even when recommended by the mexican foreign ministry and they freed several alleged drug traffickers after raising questions about the constitutionality and appropriateness of extraditions especially where capital punishment or life sentences might be applied at the end of 2000 there were 51 persons in mexican custody pending extradition including agustin vasquez mendoza ismael higuera guerrero and the brothers isaias and juan hernandez ibarra mentioned above in january 2001 the mexican supreme court ruled that mexican citizens may be extradited to the united states for prosecution on drug charges provided that they are sentenced under mexican guidelines this seemed to clear one legal hurdle but the incsr report notes that adverse lower court decisions on other issues particularly the question of life imprisonment and capital punishment continue to impede the extradition process and may do so until resolved by the countrys highest court13 while the favorable decision by the mexican supreme court was issued during the period of the fox presidency the bush administrations statement of explanation for the mexic an drug certification noted that the decision was the culmination of sustained effort by the zedillo administration in another favorable development the mexican senate in december 2000 approved protocol to the us mexico extradition treaty already approved by the us senate that would permit the temporary surrender for trial of fugitives who are serving sentences in one country but are also wanted on criminal charges in the other country following the meeting of

blamed for recent serious cases of drugrelated corruption including the escape from high security prison in jalisco in midjanuary 2001 of reputed drug lord joaquin chapo guzman and the escape from

events president fox announced national crusade against drug trafficking on january 24 2001 promising to eliminate corruption in the police and prison system s and to enhance law enforcement efforts against drug traffickers since then large number of the prison officials in jalisco have been questioned and charged and many customs officials and antidrug agents in the state of chihuahua were removed from office eradication of illicit crops with respect to eradication of illicit crops the results are somewhat complicated by the fact that with continuing declines in the area under cultivation the potential area of harvest and the net potential yield may decline in favorable way even if there are reductions in the effective eradication estimates the results are also complicated by the fact that mexican data show raw estimates of areas sprayed while the united states data show effective eradication estimates of the crop destroyed factoring out repeated spraying in the same area and other variables the us estimate of effective eradication of opium poppy cultivation in 2000 of 7600 hectares was 4 lowe r than in 1999 and 6 lower than the average effective eradication in the 19941999 period however with the continuing decline in total area under cultivation combined with severe drought the estimated potential harvest was only 1900 hectares 47 decline from 1999 and 61

president zedillo 19942000 with the full range of law enforcement military and border and drug control agencies being involved while the flow of drugs from mexico remains high and incidences of corruption persist the clinton administration seemed to be confident that president zedillo was committed to rooting out corruption and establishing close working relationship with the united states in this area at the highest diplomatic level there is the binational commission established in 1977 which brings cabinetlevel officials together once year to discuss the full range of usmexico relations including legal and anti narcotics affairs with specific focus on counternarcotics issues the high level contact group hlcg established in 1996 provides for cabinetlevel coordination twice

four or five times year on law enforcement issues15 acting through these groups the two countries agreed in may 1997 upon an antidrug alliance during visit to mexico by president clinton the leaders developed draft joint strate gy in november 1997 when president zedillo visited washington and the two presidents signed protocol to permit temporary extradition of crossborder criminals for trial and

unit which implements new antimoney laundering legislation in addition the two countries conducted exchanges of judges and prosecutors in recent years in 1999 to strengthen law enforcement efforts the mexican congress passed legislation codifying the use of assets seized in counternarcotics operations and created new office in the ministry of the treasury to manage these assets the mexican government also issued regulations that specified reporting requireme nts for the importation of precursor chemicals and shared information regularly with other governments in the area of militarytomilitary cooperation the united states during the clinton administration provided unprecedented counternarcotics training to mexican military personnel and it provided some military equipment although the 73 huey helicopters provided in 1996 were returned to the united states in 1999 when they proved to be unsatisfactory in 2000 the interdiction working group developed protocol
