of the medicare geographic classification review board are required by statute to be budget neutral accordingly the per discharge amount us ed to pay all hospitals is reduced presidents proposal under

per discharge amount for all hospitals in the nation the budget includes savings for this proposal rationalize postacute hospital payments current law patients receiving treatment fo r certain conditions such as hip and knee replacements can receive rehabilita tive care in variety of postacute care settings including skilled nursing facility snf and an inpatient rehabilitation facility irf

proposal establish hospital valu ebased purchasing program current law section 501b of the mma provided an incentive for an eligible hospital to submit quality data for ten quality m easures known as the starter set in order to avoid 04 percentage point reduction in its annual payment update from cms for fy2005 2006 and 2007 section 5001 of the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 dra required

certain quality data in form and manner and at time specified by the secretary the dra required cms to develop nd implement method for hospital valuebased purchasing in 2009 the value based purchasing system must be budget neutral while creating incentives for highquality hospitals and minimum benchmarks for lowquality hospitals the tax relief and health care ac t of 2006 pl 109432 trhca requires hospital out patient department s to submit data on quality measures in order to avert 2 percentage point re duction in their annual payments starting in 2009httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34359crs6 presidents proposal the presidents budget mentions valuebased purchasing programs for hospitals but doe s not include specifics however the proposals are expected to achieve 165 b illion in savings over the fiveyear window from 2009 to 2013 adjust hospital paym ent for never events current law the trhca directs the inspect or general in the department of health and human services to study and report to congress on 1 the incidences of never events those listed and endorse d as serious reportable events by the national quality forum nqf as of nove mber 16 2006 for medicare beneficiaries 2 the extent to which the medicare prog ram paid denied payment or recouped payment for services furnished in connection with such events and the extent to which beneficiaries paid for them and 3 the administrative processes of cms to detect such events and to deny or recoup payments for related services according to nqf never events are errors in medical care that are clearly identifiable preventable and serious in their conse quences for patients and indicate real problem in the safety and credibility of health care facility examples of never events include surgery on the wrong body pa rt foreign body left in patient after surgery mismatched blood transfusion ma jor medication error severe pressure ulcer acquired in the hospital and preventable postoperative deaths presidents proposal the proposal would prohibit medicare payment for never event hospitals would also be re quired to report occurrences of never events or receive reduced annual update the pr esidents budget does not include savings in fy2009 but does include timated savings of 190 million over the fiveyear budget period medicare part b physicians services current law medicare payments for servi ces of physicians and certain non physician practitioners are made on the basis of fee schedule the fee schedule is intended to relate payments for given service to the actual resources used in providing that service the fee schedule assigns relative values to services that reflect physician work ie the time skill and intensity it takes to provide the service practice expenses and malpractice costs the relative values are adjusted for geographic variations in costs the adjust ed relative values are then converted into dollar payment amount by conversion fact or the conversion factor for the first half of 2008 is 380870 05 above the 2007 level the fee schedule places limit on payment per service but not on overall volume of services the form ula for calculating the annua l update to the conversion factor responds to changes in volume if the overall volume of services increases the update is lower if the overall volume is re duced the update is higher the intent of the formula is to place restraint on overall increases in medicare spending for physicians services several factors enter into the calcu lation these include 1 thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34359crs7 medicare economic index mei which meas ures inflation in the inputs needed to produce physicians services 2 the sustainable growth rate sgr which is essentially target for medicare spending growth for physicians services and 3 an adjustment that modifies the update whic h would otherwise be allowed by the mei to bring spending in line with the sgr target the sgr target is not limit on expenditures rather the fee schedule update reflects the success or failure in meeting the target if expenditures exceed th target the update for future year is reduced as result payments to phy sicians were reduced in 2002 physician payments have been slated for reductions in each year since 2002 but congressional actions have prevented thes reductions through june 2008 on december 29 2007 the president signed into law the medicare medicaid and schip extension act of 2007 pl 110173 this law sets minimum update of 05 for januaryjune 2008 in the absence of further legislation the reduced conversion factor slated to go into eff ect january 1 2008 will go into effect on july 1 2008 with further reductions taken in subsequent years presidents proposal the presidents proposal does not address the physician payment update thus the cut in the conversion factor slated to go into effect in july 2008 and the further re duction slated for january 2009 would be allowed to go into effect with new budgetary savings or costs outpatient hospital update current law hospital outpatient department hopd services are paid based on an outpatient prospective payment system opps the unit of payment is the individual service or procedure as assigned to an ambulatory payment classification apc medicares payment for hopd services is calculated by multiplying the relative weight associated w ith an apc by conversion factor the conversion factor is updated on calendar year schedule these annual updates are based on the hospital mb starting in cy2009 however the outpatient update for hospitals that do not submit required quality data will be the mb minus 2 percentage points the reduction for not submitting quality data would apply for the applicable year and would not be taken in to account in subsequent years presidents proposal hospitals would receive zero percent update for outpatient services provided in fy2009 th rough fy2011 regardless of whether the required quality data is s ubmitted the hopd update

later th an january 1 2008 the new asc payment system implemented on phased in basi s starting january 1 2008 is based on the opps used to pay for hopd services as established by the trhca starting in cy2009 the annual increase for ascs that do not submit require d quality data may be the required update nus 2 percentage points presidents proposal the asc conversion factor would be frozen in cy2010

amounts the portion of the blend based on national rates is 80 for 20072009 in 2010 and subsequently the payments in all areas will be based on the national fee schedule amount the payment for service equals base rate for the level of service plus payment for mileage geographic adjustments are made to portion of the base rate additionally the base rate is increased for air ambulance trips originating in rural areas and mileage payments are increased for all trips originating in rural areas there is 25 bonus on the mileage rate for trips of 51 miles and more the fee schedule amounts are
