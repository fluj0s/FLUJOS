system but it often goes unnoticed until it becomes prohibitively expensive or its availability is curtailed such problems reportedly occurred recently in the medical malpractice insurance market many physicians experienced substantial increases in insurance premiums and there have been reports of problems with availability of physician services due to doctors retiring or relocating from areas that have seen high premium increases this was not the first time such crisis has been proclaimed similar events occurred in the latter half of both the 1970s and 1980s the fundamental purpose of insurance is to transfer an indefinite risk from one party to another for definite premium the pricing of this premium is critical but determining this price is uncertain because it depends on estimates of the chance of future loss as well as the estimated value of that loss the premium will also depend on estimates of future investment gains or losses because an insurer also acts as financial inte rmediary and invests the capital that is held in reserve against future losses offering liability insurance for medical malpractice has proven difficult market for insurance companies for variety of reasons and the market has been unstable during the past three decades the recurring market problems have provoked various policy reactions in both state legislatures and in congress assessing the effect iveness of particular policy changes is however complex and strong conclusions have typically been equally strongly disputed in the 109 th congress the house passed bill hr 5 whose centerpiece was limitation on tort claims for medical malpractice similar bills pa ssed the house in the previous two congresses the senate however did not act on any of these house bills and failed to invoke cloture on the senate bills addressing medical malpractice there has been floor or committee action on bills addressing medical malpractice issues in the 110 th congress this report examines the economic issues and historical experience surrounding medical malpractice insurance it includes an explanation of the fundamentals of insurance and how these fundamentals relate specifically to medical malpractice insurance it also includes discussion of the evolution of the medical malpractice insurance market since the 1970s and policy changes over this time including an assessment of these

malpractice insurance market recently many physicians experienced substantial increases in insurance premiums and there have been reports of problems with the availability of physician services due to doctors retiring or relocating from areas that have seen high premium increases there have also been protests and job actions in some locations with hospitals finding it necessary to curtail services and send patients to more distant facilities 1 such crisis has been proclaimed in the past as well similar events occurred in the latter half of both the 1970s and 1980s these recurring problems have provoked various reactions in the insurance marketplace and in legislatures both at the state level where insurance law and tort law are normally shaped and in congress in the 107th hr 4600 the 108th hr 5 and hr 4279 and 109th hr 5 congresses the house passed bills whose centra l thrust was to limit damages for medical malpractice tort claims the senate however did not act on any of these house

insurance is to allow person or corporation facing some risk such as the risk that physician will be sued for medica l malpractice to transfer this risk to another economic entity typically the entity accepting the risk will be company resulting in this risk then being spread across the owners of the insurer either the stock holders in normal incorporated insurance company or other policy holders in the case of mutual insurance company3 risk is also spread from one insurer to others through reinsurance transferring risk however is not the only role that insurance plays in the course of receiving payment for accepting risk large amounts of capital are generated this capital is then invested allowing for its productive use to generate jobs and economic growth in addition to providing reserve against future losses although the risk transfer and sharing aspect of insurance is the most obvious the financial intermediation aspect is an equally integral part of the modern operations of insurance companies the gains from investment of capital typically allow an insurer to offer lower rates to the insured than would be the case if the insured was paying completely for the transfer of risk this also means however that the insured face some of the 1 see eg joelle babula desert springs hospital emergency surgeons unavailable vegas reviewjournal march 26 2003 sec b p 1b 2 see crs

investment returns this can be seen in the alternating market cycles that are discussed below g11g151g156g158g155g138g151g140g142g561g17g153g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g138g151g141g561g18g155g146g140g146g151g144g561 insurance involves highly complex calculations regarding uncertain outcomes of future events although the basic operations can be simply explained company begins with certain amount of capital stock to allow it to credibly promise to provide insurance in the future as well as enough to satisfy regulators that it will be able to fulfill this promise it offers insurance policies against whichever risks it is willing to assume money flows into an insurer primarily from two sources premiums from customers of insurance and investment income from the companys reserves money flows out of an insurer primarily to pay for claims made for events for which the insurer has agreed to bear the risk including costs such as defending against lawsuits in the case of medical liability insurance 4 the ability of insurance to fulfill its role as financial intermediary as well as the solvency of individual insurers rests critically on keeping th inflows and outflows balanced over time this means estimating the future return on investments as well as estimating future losses from claims the accuracy of these estimates can vary widely and insurers have relatively little direct control over what either actual value will turn out to be insurers can affect their returns somewhat by varying the mix of their investments but this mix is subject to state regulation in the united states most investments are relatively stable investments such as bonds but even bonds are subject to the vagaries of the marketplace many insurers also try to minimize claims through sharing information with policy holders on reducing risks and offering incentives to policy holders who take action to minimize risks the one variable that an insurer does directly cont rol subject to the pressures of the marketplace and sometimes state insurance regulators 5 is the price or premium that it charges for certain amount of insurance this price should cover the value in todays dollars the present value of any future loss multiplied by the expected probability of this loss if physician wants to insure against the risk of paying 1 million malpractice claim today and the insurance company believes that there is 1 chance that this claim will occur today then it will charge approximately 10000 for this insurance if the insurance extends for length of time further into the future then the future amounts of money to be paid out would be adjusted based on the expected inflation rate or the expected rate of return that the insurer foresees over the period of time the insurance is in place because insurance pricing is theoretically based on the risk that is being transferred this implies charging different premium to people or companies with different inherent levels of risk without the ability to segment different risks into different categories and charge these different categories different rates the price charged to everyone will be relatively high reflecting the 4 there are of course other substantial payments that an insurer makes such as operational expenses and profits returned to stockholders that are critical in differentiating among companies but not as critical in discussing industry wide issues 5 laws in many states require preapproval by the state before an insurer can change the rates charged for insurance the justification for this regulation is generally twofold 1 to prevent insurance companies from charging too much and gouging their customers and 2 to prevent insurance comp anies from charging too little and risking insolvency when their losses are greater then their reserves

would tend to lead those who believe their own risks are low not to buy insurance or to underinsure whereas those who believe their risks are high would tend to continue to buy insurance or even to overinsure this tendency is known as adverse selection and usually results from the insured having more information regarding their own risk than the insurer adverse selection results in higher overall level of risk in the pool of those who buy insurance and thus results in higher than expected claims higher claims must ultimately be followed by higher prices which is then followed by lower risks not buying insurance and so on the extreme result of this would be situation where an insurance market essentially ceases to exist

of which medical malpractice is part in particular has experienced alternating periods of soft markets and hard markets this cycle is usually ascribed to changes in the investment climate although it may be more accurate to think about it as due to changes in the comparison between insurers financial inflows and outflows soft market typically occurs when the investment climate is good and insurers make returns on the capital that they are holding in reserve that are high relative to expected insurance payouts these high investment returns allow insurers to offer lower prices on insurance sometimes selling insurance at premium that they know will result in losses and then offsetting these losses by the gains from investing the premium soft markets are usually marked by increases in the number of insurers and by the expansion in the geographic area or types of insurance offered by existing insurers hard market typically occurs when the investment climate worsens and returns drop low investment returns imply that the premium paid fo r insurance must cover more of the actual loss that is expected from this insurance this ans higher premiums and can lead to withdrawals from poorly performing lines of insurance or from particular geographic areas that remain unprofitable for an insurer offering only one type of coverage in specific geographic area such withdrawal is not an option such companies must either raise rates or eventually withdraw from the business of insurance if the investment returns do not increase or if costs are not somehow lowered at the beginning of hard market especially when it is preceded by long soft market very large increases in premiums might be expected as the premium level comes closer to the value of the actual losses due to the risk that is being transferred because of high capital mobility and interdependence in financial markets hard markets would be expected to be nationwide or even international phenomenon the experience within the united states however has been that periods of market hardening have disparate impact among the various states this suggests that when market problems develop there may be more at work than simply general hard market due to lower investment returns g15g142g141g146g140g138g149g561g15g138g149g153g155g138g140g157g146g140g142g561g11g151g156g158g155g138g151g140g142g561 different insurance markets have very different characteristics life insurance for example tends to be very stable because the amounts that are to be paid out are clearly known and the estimates that are used for life

where they might hit and how much damage they might do with enough historical and other data however insurance can operate effectively even in such uncertain environments insuring against medical malpractice liability offers some particular difficulties as compared to other lines of insurance and it has proven challenging for companies to operate in this field over time among the difficulties are the longer time frames inherent in malpractice claims high and uncertain claim amounts and uncertainty in recognizing and segmenting hi ghrisk from lowrisk healthcare providers g15g142g141g146g140g138g149g561g15g138g149g153g155g138g140g157g146g140g142g514g156g561g14g152g151g144g561g515g22g138g146g149g516g561 medical malpractice liability insurance has what is known in the insurance industry as long tail liability policies in general are often written to cover the claims arising from certain period of time in fire insurance for example this is relatively unproblematic whether fire has occurred is generally straightforward and uncomplicated there may be disputes arising about the extent of damage that should be paid but at minimum company will know at the end of the insurance period or shortly thereafter whether claim will be made in contrast injuries from medical malpractice and thus the claims that arise from them can take longer time to manifest themselves as many as several years in some cases even after injuries are noticed the time before full amount an insurer must pay is known and actually paid out is often measured in years because litigation can be complex and demand long discovery processes with various medical experts examining the case to address the tail problem many insurers have changed their policies from an occurrence policy which covers claims resulting from an action that occurred during the period that the insurance was in effect to claims made policy which covers only claims actually made during the insured period such shift has an immediate impact in reducing the uncertainty for the insurer but the effect is largely one time phenomenon as claims made policy stays in effect for several years the total risk to the in surer under this type of policy converges with the risk that the insurer would bear under an occurrence policy g11g150g153g138g140g157g561g152g143g561g22g152g155g157g561g21g162g156g157g142g150g561 the claim amounts that medical malpractice insurers pay out are generally determined either through the tort system or by threats to use the tort system the details of tort law vary from state to state but compensatory damages under tort law are often separated into two types economic damages and noneconomic damages economic damages are generally intended to redress direct economic loss such as lost wages and costs for medical care noneconomic damages are not tied to direct outofpocket expenses and include damages due to pain and suffering another primary type of damages is punitive damages punitive damages are noncompensatory damages that are intended to punish defendant for egregious conduct 6 economic damages generally have the greatest impact on medical malpractice claims through the medical cost component unsurprisingly the damage from medical malpractice usually requires 6 see crs report rl31692 medical malpractice liability reform legal i ssues and fiftystate survey of caps on

medical treatment as result medical costs tend to be higher component of medical malpractice claims than most other types of insurance claims coupled with this is the experience that medical costs have typically risen faster than the general rate of inflation7 sometimes much faster all other things being equal this implies that the rates for medical malp ractice insurance are going to rise faster than most other types of insurance although the medical cost component of economic damages tends to drive medical malpractice insurance generally higher than other insurance noneconomic and punitive damages add another aspect to malpractice claims unpredictability by definition noneconomic and punitive damages are more subjective and difficult to quantify than economic damages different juries in the same town or city can and do come to different conclusions as to the monetary value of plaintiffs pain and suffering or the amount of punitive damages warranted to punish willful misconduct for example jury awards are even more variable when comparisons are made involving different parts of the country 8 the conclusions reached on such damages can also be difficult to dispute in contrast to damages that are specifically related to concrete economic factors this unpredictability can make it very difficult to form the accurate estimations of expected losses that are at the heart of insurance pricing g20g146g156g148g561g21g142g144g150g142g151g157g138g157g146g152g151g561 risk segmentation and adverse selection in the health care field are particularly problematic because information to accurately judge the quality of provider and thus ostensibly to accurately estimate his or her risk of malpractice claim is sparse some of this is due to past public policy choices which have resulted in few mechanisms to track the quality of health care but some is also due to the inherent difficulties in doing this tracking it can be very difficult to distinguish physician with higher malpractice liability due to poor skills from one with high skills but sicker patients and more difficult cases both may have poor patient outcomes but without careful examination of the incoming patient population which is rarely practicable to undertake an insurer is likely to charge both physicians similar rates risk segmentation in medical malpractice insurance is generally based on geographic area and specialty type but relatively little is based on some measure of provider quality or on malpractice claims history one of the particular aspects of the historical evolution of the medical malpractice insurance market which is discussed in greater detail be low has been the growth in small insurers particularly providerowned companies this success runs contrary to one of the theoretical fundamentals of insurance namely spreading risk across as wide base as possible small providerowned company transfers risk away from individual physicians or other health care providers but still leaves the risk to the company itself more concentrated relative to bigger shareholderowned company smaller companies however may do better job at reducing the risk that they choose to bear rather than just spreading it this risk reduction could come for example if smaller insurers were more able to persuade physicians to adopt lower risk practices or if they could better identify 7 according to the bureau of labor statistics at the end of the 30year period from 1973 to 2002 medical prices were nearly seven and half 74 times greater than the beginning while prices generally were slightly more than four 41 times greater 8 see eg malpractice crisis not here medical economics july 12 2002 pp 8696

invite malpractice claims and either charge them higher premium or choose not to insure such doctors another advantage of mutual insurers particularly small ones may be reduced moral hazard9 because the insured are also the owners of the company smaller companies can also reduce the concentration of risk that they take on by purchasing reinsurance and this device is used often by insurers10

g11g151g156g158g155g138g151g140g142g561 particular problems in medical malpractice insurance have been observed for many years as far back as 1969 report of senate subcommittee11 concluded the following 1 the number of malpractice suits and claims is rising sharply in certain regions of the country the size of judgments and settlements is increasing rapidly 2 most malpractice suits are the direct result of injuries suffered by patients during medical treatment or surgery the majority have proved justifiable these suits are the indirect result of the deterioration of the traditional physicianpatient relationship 3 the publicity given to the higher malpractice judgments and settlements based frequently on new legal precedents is likely to trigger increased litigation in other states the situation threatens to become national crisis 4 already higher judgments and settlements are having the following direct results companies providing malpractice insurance are increasing the cost of coverage b these costsin the form of higher chargesare being passed on to patients their health care insurance companies and federal health care programs 5 the rising number of malpractice suits is forcing physicians to practice what they call defensive medicine viewing each patient as potential malpractice claimant physicians often order excessive diagnostic procedures for patients thereby increasing the cost of care moreover they are declining to perfor m other procedures which in themselves may entail some risk of patient injury 6 at present it appears one affected by th rise in malpractice suits and claims has been able to deal with this problem in manner that promises to alleviate this situation 7 the lions share of the total cost to the insurance companies of malpractice suits and claims goes to the legal community 9 moral hazard is the term used for the increased chance of loss actually due to the existence of insurance for example those insured against loss from fire may be more careless in fireproofing their property 10 the reinsurance association of america reports that in 2003 approximately 15 of medical malpractice occurrence policy premiums and

dominated by traditional insurers who offered it as one of several different lines of insurance list of the top 10 companies in 1976 was composed of primarily diversified shareholderowned insurers with 61 of the market among them with the market hardening in the mid to late 1970s many of these diversified insurers pulled back from offering medical malpractice insurance leaving void in the market in response to this void numerous new companies were created specifically focusing on insuring medical malpractice liability not only were these companies specialized they also were largely owned by small groups of medical providers or by the entire group of their policy holders these companies were also usually focused on geographic area often serving only one state some were and still are affiliated with particular states medical society with addition of capacity to the market and the aforementioned shift to claimsmade policies the difficulties of the 1970s abated and was replaced by soft market for the first half of the 1980s the shift in market structure away from larger di versified insurers however seems to have been permanent by 1986 six of the top 10 medical malpractice insurers were providerowned and market concentration was somewhat less with the top 10 companies holding 56 one exception to this shift was the st paul companies inc the st paul is diversified shareholderowned insurance company and grew from 11 of the nationwide market in 1976 to 21 in 1986 12 taking this company out of the situation gives view of more pronounced splintering of the market the total market share of numbers two through 10 on the list of top insurers dropped from 51 of the market in 1976 to only 36 of the market in 1986 the market cycle turned again in 19851986 and prob lems arose that bear many of the hallmarks of the current situation including reports of physician work stoppages and problems with access to care this situation was broader than just physicians or healthcare liability insurance and included difficulties in access to many other forms of liability insurance in healthcare larger providers such as hospitals and nursing homes were more severely affected than individual physicians the market response was again the formation of new smaller insurance companies to serve the market these new companies however were not just more traditional mutual insurance companies but also large number of captive insurers 13 many of these captive insurers were located offshore in such locales as the cayman islands and thus operated outside of the us tax and regulatory system the offshore nature of these entities makes it difficult to develop exact information about the size and scope of this market but overall growth has been significant one of the captives that is not offshore health care indemnity captive of the hca hospital chain grew over sevenfold from 1993 to 1994 to become the fourth largest medical malpractice insurer at the time 14 12

fueling low rates and strong competition across various insurance lines medical malpractice insurance followed this trend with an increase in competition in many forms some traditional shareholderowned insurers entered or reentered the market whereas some captives and mutuals converted to stock companies or expanded their geographic base into areas beyond their initial ones this increased competition can be seen in the total number of companies directly underwriting medical malpractice premiums as reported by the national association of insurance commissioners naic 15 there were 398 of such companies in 1991 but by 1995 the number had jumped to 623 and it reached high of 666 in 199716 this soft market began to harden in the late 1990s and this trend was exacerbated by the losses from the september 11 2001 attacks since 1999 the malpractice insurance market has seen increasing premiums along with both general wit hdrawals from the market and contractions in the geographical areas covered by companies the insurance rating firm am best reports that total medical malpractice premiums increased 156 in 2001 17 225 in 200218 and 135 in 200319 perhaps the most striking occurrence in this latest hard market was the decision in december 2001 by the st paul to completely withdraw from writing medical malpractice insurance as part of an effort to improve profitability20 withdrawal typically occurs gradually through nonrenewal of policies but because some states in the st pauls market share approached 50 the impact of even gradual withdrawal is significant the hard market in medical malpractice insurance seems to have peaked in 2002 statistics from am best show 55 increase in premiums in 2004 and only 05 in 2005 21 medical liability

given the importance of insurance when problems of availability or affordability have arisen the situations have been met with more than just marketplace evolution various policy changes have been made as well some of these changes have been intended to facilitate market supply such as the creation of alternative sources of insurance whereas others have addressed the problem from the cost side through various changes in the tort system in addition there have been attempts to address the problem through direct regulation of insurance with californias proposition 103 being the primary example as discussed below g7g161g153g138g151g141g146g151g144g561g15g138g155g148g142g157g561g21g158g153g153g149g162g561 the basic legal structures for the mutual insurers that arose in response to the market difficulties in the 1970s have been in place for some time mutual insurers have long history going back essentially as long as insurance has existed in some cases however states went beyond the existing mutual framework to allow for medical ma lpractice insurance for example in florida particular statutes were passed in the 1970s specifically allowing for medical malpractice self insurance trusts 23 this statute was amended in 1992 to disallow its future use but governors task force recommended rescinding this action given the difficulties in floridas medical malpractice market24 states also created nonstandard entities such as joint underwriting associations jua juas are nonprofit pooling arrangements intended to provide an insurer of last resort for healthcare providers who are unable to find insurance elsewhere the federal government although not the primary regulator in the insurance markets has also taken an interest in the market supply of liability insurance the liability risk retention act of 198625 allows for the establishment of risk retention groups and risk purchasing groups risk retention groups operate much like mutual insurer they are made up of groups of entities involved in similar business who wish to spread the risk among group participants such groups can be formed under state law but the federal law allowed for reduced regulation because under federal law these groups are regulated only in the state where they are chartered rather than in every state where they write insurance risk purchasing groups essentially allow for group purchasing of insurance with the expectation that such purchase will be lower cost than individual purchase the initial 1981 act was limited to manufacturers and was not widely used because of the soft market that prevailed at its time of passage the 1986 law however amended the availability to include nearly all types of liability insurance including medical malpractice companies offering medical malpractice liability insurance under the act began as early as 1987 with the ophthalmic mutual insurance company the acts usage has continued to the current day for example at the beginning of 2003 10 risk retention groups that had been formed in the previous year were offering insurance in pennsylvania 26 one of the states experiencing serious market difficulties 23 section 627357 fs 24

by the tort system the tort system has thus been primary focus of attempts to reduce insurer costs it is beyond the scope of this report to discuss proposed tort changes in detail27 but it should be noted that cap on noneconomic damages for medical malpractice claims which has been the center of attention during the recent debate in congress is not the only change that has been implemented at the state level there have also been limits on other damages lawyers fees and joint and several liability some states have implemented patient compensation funds which limit insurer liability to certain amount or allow or encourage arbitration in place of litigation to resolve medical malpractice disputes there have even been states such as florida and virginia where very limited nofault system has been installed bypassing the question of liability altogether the most cited example of tort reform as well as the expressed model for the previous bills considered by congress such as hr 5 in the 109 th congress was passed by california in 1975 the medical injury compensation reform act micra micra placed 250000 limit on noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering forced disclosure of other sources of payment to injured parties limited lawyer fees and strengthened the system that disciplines doctors after passage in 1975 micra was challenged in the courts over several years before finally being upheld in 1984 and 1985 28 g21g157g155g142g151g144g157g145g142g151g146g151g144g561g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 the first two policy responses implicitly treat an insurance crisis as the result of what might be described as normal market forces an alternative explanation however is that the increasing prices and reduced availability that have marked the medical malpractice crises are the result of improper market manipulation rather than conflu ence of market forces this concern has been raised at the federal level where the mccarranferguson act 29 gives limited antitrust exemption to the insurance industry it is not clear what the impact of removing this exemption might be since some observers believe the information sharing facilitated by the exemption helps the industry operate more efficiently and leads to lower rates30 previous bills such as senator patrick leahys medical malpractice insurance antitrust act of 2003 and of 2005 108th congress s 352 and 109th congress s 1525 were narrowly aimed at the exemption as it relates to medical malpractice insurance in the 110th congress senator leahy has introduced broader bill s 618 that would repeal the antitrust exemption for all insurance representative peter defazio has introduced companion bill hr 1081 in the house continued january 2003 27 see the aforementioned crs report

individual states have done or might do the insurance industry is highly regulated at the state level with many states for example requiring prior approval before company can adjust rates change policy forms or even withdraw from writing certain lines of insurance the most dramatic action taken on the insurance regulatory front since the recurring market problems began was proposition 103 ballot initiative approved by california voters in 1988 proposition 103 was broad change that was not specifically aimed at medical malpractice insurance but affected all propertycasualty insurers in california it created an elected not appointed insurance commissioner forced insurers to justify their rate increases to the insurance commissioner required insurance companies to open their books so regulators could determine if they needed rate increases and allowed citizens to challenge proposed rate increases

various policy changes over the past three decades is empirically difficult and strong conclusions are often equally strongly disputed for example after the liability risk retention act of 1986 the us department of commerce issued report concluding that the 1981 and 1986 acts were effective in reducing problems with the availability of liability insurance citing among other things the numbers of insured then covered by risk retention groups 31 in contrast the naic saw improvement from the formation these groups indicating that the market cycle would have inevit ably turned and that these insureds would have been able to find insurance in the commercial market32 as noted before risk retention groups are still being formed to deal with the current medi cal malpractice market situation but this alone does not prove conclusively that either of the previous department of commerce or naic positions were correct coming to this or any conclusion requires assessing both what has happened and what would have happened in the absence of the law the most voluminous debate has been over the effect of californias experience california has experienced significantly lower medical malpractice premium growth over the 28 years since the passage of micra in 1975 this is cited by some as proof that tort reforms work and should be more widely adopted 33 countering this others have argued that most of the slow growth or even declines in california premiums have come since proposition 103 in 1988 indicating that the answer should be strengthened regulation34 major difficulty in economic analysis of the two arguments stems largely from the relative closeness of the two policy changes particularly because micra was not finally upheld in court until 1985 as was discussed earlier the pricing of insurance is longterm economic enterprise fraught with many uncertainties in such an endeav or it would not be surprising that underwriters may wait to see what definite effect policy change has on their losses before making dramatic moves in insurance pricing another difficulty in judging the california experience is the fact that 31 us department of commerce liability risk

malpractice insurance are due in part to cyclical hard market that was experienced generally in the propertycasualty insurance industry however because significant differences in experiences are observed among the various states other factors such as tort laws and insurance regulations seem also to be playing significant role the responsibility for these two areas has traditionally been left to the individual states during previous experiences with insurance market difficulties congress acted laws encroaching to minor degree on state insurance regulation the current congressional focus is largely on intervening in the tort system although proposals have been made to alter the insurance exemption from federal antitrust laws as well given the large amount of federal spending dedicated to medicare and medicaid as well as the public sensitivities raised when health care services are curtailed strong congressional interest in this issue seems likely to continue

the general economic analysis regarding californias experience seems inconclusive there is at least one specific case where the stronger regulatory structure introduced by proposition 103 directly resulted in lower medical malpractice premiums in 2002 an insurer the scpie companies filed for 156 rate increase for 2003 that was then approved by the california department of insurance following
