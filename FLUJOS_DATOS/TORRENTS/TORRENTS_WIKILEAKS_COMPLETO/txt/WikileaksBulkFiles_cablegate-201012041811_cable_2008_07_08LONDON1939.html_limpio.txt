political body blow to gordon brown as labour loses scottish byelection ref london 1913 classified by political counselor rick mills for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary the scottish national partys 365 vote victory in yesterdays glasgow east byelection over labour is another body blow to gordon browns political fortunes and in the immediate aftermath has fueled speculation that brown could face leadership challenge this fall when mps return to the westminster village from the summer break labour mp and close advisor to brown told us the morning after the vote that brown will be hunkering down with his allies over the summer to fend off labour party opponents which brown can successfully do for now but the glasgow result cannot be explained away as anything other than referendum on labour and brown must react this advisor said brown has to use the summer vacation period with mps out of london to develop new political strategy for now in part because of the parliamentary recess challenge to browns leadership is not imminent but the glasgow defeat the third labour byelection loss since brown took power might embolden his opponents to act in the fall if brown cannot turn around labours dismal political standing end summary political earthquake 2 u in what the winning scottish national party candidate called political earthquake labour went down to an unanticipated defeat in yesterdays glasgow east byelection coming in second to the snp 11277 to 10912 with higher than expected voter turn out of 42 percent snp candidate john masons victory over labours margaret curran represents an astonishing 22 percent swing from the last general election in 2005 in what had been the labour partys 25th safest seat the conservatives came in third with 1639 with the liberal democrats distant fourth at 915 votes 3 c forsaking its traditional soapbox issue of scottish independence snp leader and scottish first minister alex salmond personally spearheaded the partys campaign turning the byelection into referendum on brown and the labour party although labour sent collection of party heavyweights and cabinet ministers to campaign for curran she could not overcome what appears to have been lethal mix of browns unpopularity strong snp which benefited from alex salmonds frequent appearances in the constituency and voter frustration that the impoverished district has not benefited more from ten years of labour rule in london labours attempts to market the byelection as local in order to keep the focus off the prime minister went unnoticed nick brown mp close advisor to brown and his deputy labour whip in the commons told poloff the morning after the vote that there are quirks we can use to explain this defeat away and the party has to see the vote as referendum on labour that we lost for now labour party spokesmen sent out to speak publicly on the defeat like dfid secretary douglas alexander scotsman himself are repeating the now oftheard labor refrain that the party will have to reflect long and hard on the results and try to understand the message voters have sent the winners 4 c the winner in yesterdays election is clearly the snp the vote is an enormous boost for the party and its leader alex salmond who staked considerable amount of personal prestige on the outcome visiting the district ten times during the campaign the snp presented the election as chance to register referendum on two governments the snpled government in hollyrood or the labour government in westminster and the snp can now claim victory the party will have to be careful about not becoming too cocky however as the snps signature issue scottish independence was not highlighted during the campaign and most observers agree that for most voters their vote was more antilabour than strong embrace of the snp 5 c the other winner the morning after are the conservatives despite their third place finish the conservatives are pleased to have done better than expected in this constituency conservative leader david cameron had traveled to the district before the election and delivered speech on the social causes of poverty and deprivation stressing need for personal responsibility rather than london 00001939 002 of 002 government action many conservatives thought making the speech in the district was mistake but it appears not to have harmed the conservative vote michael fabricant tory mp told poloff that the third place finish is important to the tories because it indicates that camerons appeal and message is making inroads even in traditionally toryhostile scotland cameron himself reacted to the vote by calling for the prime minister to hold an immediate general election call which the prime ministers office termed ridiculous whats next for gordon brown 6 c nick brown labours deputy chief whip told poloff that gordon brown will use the summer months to hunker down and keep his party allies close and his party opponents in line nick brown who is one of the prime minsters closest political advisors said that as terrible as the election outcome was it would not spark an immediate leadership challenge to the prime minister within the labour party the prime minister however has to use the summer parliamentary recess now underway to develop new political message and consider cabinet shakeup in order to stop his political freefall nick brown reported that there are unconfirmed rumors of small number of labour party members considering whether to gather signatures for letter to the prime minister asking that he step down supposedly the plotters intend to present the letter on september 5 to the prime minister the date in 2006 on which labour party rebels presented similar letter to then prime minister tony blair but nick brown said the prime minister and his allies would be able to slap down the effort if it got off the ground at all 7 c nick brown acknowledged that many labour members were hoping that an election victory in the glasgow byelection matter how narrow would cauterize labours political wounds but with labours loss many labour members will be panicked that the partys political decline has not yet bottomed out and willing to consider drastic action as deputy whip nick brown will be speaking to many mps over the weekend to keep their heads about them ultimately nick brown claimed leadership challenge to the prime minister is highly unlikely for the practical reason that were the labour party to change its leader and give the uk third prime minister in three or four years it would be politically impossible for the party not to call general election shortly afterwards it would be historically unheard of to have two unelected prime ministers back to back labour mps understand brown continued that they would still go down to defeat in such case so many will be willing to stick with the prime minister in the hope he can turn the partys fortunes around before spring 2010 when general election must be called comment 8 cnf with parliament on recess on until october 6 labour will have time for long and hard reflection attention now turns to the september party conventions where labour and possibly more importantly brown will have another and possibly final opportunity to convince voters that labour has listened and learned however unless brown takes dramatic action whether leadership shuffle or new bold policy direction he may not be able to fend off grumbles from an increasingly anxious party and though still unlikely possible challenge to his
