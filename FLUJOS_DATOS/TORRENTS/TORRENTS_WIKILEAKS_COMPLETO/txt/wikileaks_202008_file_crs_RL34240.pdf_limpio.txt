numerous and serious political crises culminating in the december 27 assassination of former prime minster and leading opposition figure benazir bhutto who had returned to pakistan from selfim posed exile in october bhuttos killing in an apparent gun and bomb attack the circumstances remain controversial has been called national tragedy for pakistan and does immense damage to already troubled efforts to democratize the country the assassination came just 12 days after pakistani president pervez musharraf had lifted 6weekold emergency order on novemb er 3 some eight years after he overthrew the elected government in bloodless 1999 military coup musharraf had suspended the countrys constitution and assumed emergency powers in his role as both president and army chief the move came as security circumstances deteriorated sharply across the country but was widely viewed as being an effort by musharraf to ma intain his own power his government placed numerous supreme court justices under house arrest and jailed thousands of opposition figures and lawyers who opposed the abrogation of rule of law it also cracked down on independent media outlets many of which temporarily were shut down completely president musharraf sought to justify his second coup as being necessary to save pakistan from islamist extremism and from political paralysis he blamed largely on the countrys supreme court the united states which had exerted diplomatic pressure on musharraf to refrain from imposing state of emergency views pakistan as vital ally in global and regional counterterrorism efforts and it has provided considerable foreign assistance to pakistan since 2001 in part with the goal of facilitating transition to democracy in islamabad washington and other world capitals pressured musharraf to return pakistan to its prenovember 3 political circumstances relinquish his status as army chief and hold free and fair elections in january 2008 musharraf vowed to hold such elections whi ch following the bhutto assassination were rescheduled for february 18 and he finally resigned his military commission in late november while thousands of previously detained political activists have been released most of the approximately 100 high court judges who refused to take new oath of office remain under house arrest in the months preceding the emergency declaration bhutto had engaged negotiations toward powersharing arrangement with musharraf the us government supported such accommodation as being in the best interests of both pakistan and the united states bhuttos catastrophic removal from pakistans political equation thus dealt serious blow to us interests in light of this and other developments that constitute major setbacks for us policy toward pakistan us officials are reevaluating their approach and many in congress have called for cutting or halting certain types of us assistance to pakistan several bills condemning the emergency declaration were

troubled efforts to democratize the country bhutto was chairperson for life of what arguably is pakistans most popular party the pakistan peoples party ppp which won the most total votes in the 2002 national election the assassination came just 12 days after pakistani president pervez musharraf had lifted 6week old emergency order the ppp named her young bilawal and her husband asif zardari to succeed her as party leaders bhuttos long time party deputy makhdoom amin fahim is expected to be the put forward as the ppps prime ministerial candidate on november 3 2007 pakistani president general pervez musharraf issued proclamation of emergency suspending the countrys constitution 1 the proclamation justified the suspension as necessary due to the countrys rapidly deteriorating security circumstances an unprecedented level of violent intensity posing grave threat to the life and property of the citizens of pakistan and to the allegedly negative role being played by the countrys judiciary which was claimed to be working at cross purposes with the executive and legislature in the fight against terrorism and extremism thereby weakening the government and the nations resolve and diluting the efficacy of its actions to control this menace according to the proclamation the situation required emergent and extraordinary measures provisional constitution order pco was issued by musharraf in his role as army chief on the same day pursuant to the emergency proclamation the pco requires inter alia that the countrys judiciary take new oath of office and it bars the judiciary from making any orders against the pco or from taking any action against the president the prime minister or anyone acting under their authority it also suspends number of fundamental rights listed in chapter one of the pakistani constitution these include freedom from unlawful arrest and detention and freedoms of movement assembly association and speech 2 seven supreme court justices including the chief justice and scores of high court judges refused to take new oath of office under the pco and were summarily dismissed top us officials repeatedly have urged president musharraf to make more energetic efforts to restore civilian government and rule of law in islamabad by respecting the independence of the countrys judiciary and by holding free and fair parliamentary elections in early 2008 these admonitions continued following bhuttos demise despite seemingly undemocratic developments in islamabad the united states has since 2001 provided billions of dollars in foreign assistance

question the bush administrations largely uncritical support for president musharraf3 news of the november emergency decree and pco elicited immediate criticism from washington according to the state department musharrafs move was setback we had hoped to see this transition unfold differently it is our fervent hope that scheduled elections will be free fair transp arent and credible we are working closely with pakistani officials and us pakistani and international civil society organizations to ensure that these elections are as transparent as possible 4 secretary of state condoleezza rice said she had communicated very clearly to the pakistanis that the holding of free and fair elections is an absolute necessity and later said us aid to pakistan would come under review the pentagon announced postponement of scheduled high level bilateral defense consultations in his first public comments on the issue president george w bush said the united states expects elections in pakistan as soon as possible and that musharraf should resign his military post president bush later telephoned musharraf for very frank discussion on the strong us belief that the pakistani leader should resign from the military and hold elections islamabad characterized president bush as showing understanding of the difficult circumstances being faced by musharraf and of the pakistani leaders commitment to full democracy and civilian rule 5 several bills condemning the emergency declaration were introduced in congress sres 372 hres 810 and hres 823 but none has moved out of committee to date on november 17 deputy secretary of state john negroponte met with president musharraf in islamabad reportedly delivering strong message on the need to heed us advice or face possible reduction in military assistance islamabad rejected us calls to end the emergency and dismissed the deputy secretarys admonitions as nothing new6 the under secretary also met with musharraf ally and national security advisor tariq aziz and vice army chief gen ashfaq pervez kiyani and spoke by phone with benazir bhutto musharrafs second coup appeared to many observers to be desperate power grab by badly discredited military ruler while musharraf insisted the emergency decree was meant to deal with the countrys security crisis and spreading islamist militancy most analysts believe it was preemptive assault on the countrys judiciary in light of signs that the supreme court was set to invalidate musharrafs october 6 2007 reelection as president one international human rights group issued report making this

emboldened islamist militants while further alienating pakistani civil society it also brought surge in unwanted attention to the pakistani militarys failure to defeat the countrys militant extremist elements as well as to its major and hugely profitable role in the countrys economy the security of pakistans nuclear weapons and materials becomes an especially crucial issue during period of political instability in islamabad moreover pakistans western allies find themselves in the awkward position of supporting an increasingly unpopular musharraf who has twice used force to obtain or maintain power 8 the islamabad governments harsh crackdown on political opposition apparently spurred former prime minister and opposition leader benazir bhutto to end what had been ongoing

from considerable political uncertainty as the tenuous governance structure put in place by president musharraf came under strain among ordinary pakistanis criticism of the militarytypically among the most respected institutions in the countryand its role in governance has become much more common especially as the army has proven unable to ensure security and stability in both major cities and in the western provinces of baluchistan and the north west frontier many among the pakistani public appear increasingly put off by seemingly arbitrary electoral process that preserves the power of corrupt elite that demonstrates little meaningful concern with the problems of ordinary citizens moreover there has been an accompanying and widespread dismay among pakistanis at the appearance of unabashed us interference in their political system interference that from their perspective serves only to perpetuate the corruption 9 g12g158g141g146g140g146g138g149g561g5g155g146g156g146g156g561 judicial crisis began with president musharrafs summary march 2007 dismissal of the countrys chief justice iftikhar chaudhry on charges of nepotism and misconduct analysts widely believe the action was an attempt by musharraf to remove potential impediment to his continued roles as president and army chief given chaudhrys rulings that exhibited independence and went contrary to government expectations the move triggered immediate outrage among pakistani lawyers ensuing street pr otests by opposition activists grew in scale by providing platform upon which antimusharraf sentiments could

may tens of thousands of supporters lined the streets as chaudhry drove from islamabad to lahore to address the high court there chaudhry later flew to karachi but was blocked from leaving the citys airport reportedly by activists of the regional governmentallied muttahida qaumi movement mqm party ensuing street battles between mqm cadres and opposition activists left at least 40 people dead on may 12 most of them ppp members reports had local police and security forces standing by without intervening while the mqm attacked antimusharraf protesters leading many observers to charge the government with complicity in the bloody rioting 10 in july in what was widely seen as major political defeat for musharraf the supreme court unanimously cleared chaudhry of any wrongdoing and reinstated him to office when in august musharraf reportedly came close to declaring state of emergency secretary of state rice placed latenight telephone call to islamabad by some accounts in successful effort to dissuade him august brought further indications that the supreme court would not be subservient to military rule and could derail president musharrafs political plans most significantly the court ruled that former prime minister nawaz sharif could return to pakistan after seven years in exile when sharif attempted to return on september 10 the government immediately arrested him on corruption charges and deported him on october 24 pakistans chief justice stated that sharif still has an inalienable right to return to pakistan and he accused thenprime minister shaukat aziz of violating supreme court order by arranging for sharifs most recent deportation in september the islamabad government arrested hundreds of opposition political leaders and activists many of them deputies of nawaz sharif including some sitting members of parliament statement from the us embassy called the development extremely disturbing and confusing and secretary rice called the arrests troubling 11 at years end pakistans judicial crisis was far from fully resolved changes made by musharraf under the emergency remain controversial perhaps most especially the questionable dismissal of many supreme court justices some of whom remain under house arrest in 2008 aitzaz ahsan the lawyer who lead the successful effort to have former chief justice chaudhry reseated earlier in 2007 has been at the forefront of the current effort to have the supreme court reconstituted by musharraf restored to its prenovember status in early december he proposed requiring all parliamentary candidates to sign an oath pledging to restore the judiciary but this tack was rejected by bhutto and other opposition leaders as unrealistic ahsan himself accused the us government of not seeming to care about musharrafs crackdown on the supreme court and making mention of the issue in various agency briefings 12 10 the human rights commission of pakistan called the riots the result of calculated

twofifths of the body had either abstained members of the bhuttoled ppp or resigned in protest mostly members of the islamist party coalition musharraf vowed to resign his military commission following reelection even knowing he would become even more politically vulnerable as civilian president controversy had arisen over musharrafs intention to seek reelection by the current assemblies as well as his candidacy while still serving as army chief 2002 and 2005 supreme court rulings allowed for his dualrole until nove mber 15 opposition parties called such moves unconstitutional and they petitioned the supreme court to block this course on october 5 the court ruled the election could take place as scheduled but that official results would be withheld until after the court rules on such legal challenges while few observers predicted the court would void the result musharraf was to some degree left in political limbo he was not expected to doff his army uniform until his reelection was confirmed some analysts feared that state of emergency would be declared were the court to rule against musharraf us and other western officials including secretary rice urged musharraf to refrain from any such move on november 19 the new supreme court as reconstituted under the pco struck down legal challenges to the validity of the reelection thus paving the way for musharrafs

president musharraf and former prime minister benazir bhutto in 2007 had negotiations on powersharing arrangement that could facilitate musharrafs continued national political role while also allowing bhutto to return to pakistan from selfimposed exile potentially to serve as prime minister for third time the bush administration reportedly encouraged such an arrangement as the best means of both sustaining musharrafs role and of strengthening moderate political forces in islamabad pakistans deputy information minister reportedly claimed that the united states essentially forced reluctant islamabad to allow bhuttos return from exile 13 some analysts took cynical view of bhuttos motives in the negotiations believing her central goal was personal power and removal of standing corruption cases against her14 bhutto insisted that she engaged musharraf so as to facilitate an effective and peaceful transition to democracy on october 4 president musharraf and bhutto agreed to an accord that could have paved the way for powersharing deal the national reconcilia tion ordinance nro provides amnesty for all politicians who served in pakistan between 1988 and 1999 thus essentially clearing bhutto of pending and potential corruption charges officials said the amnesty would not apply to former prime minister sharif in return bhutto reportedly agreed tacitly to accept musharrafs

former prime minister and key opposition leader benazir bhutto was assassinated in gun and suicide bomb attack following political rally in the city of rawalpindi president bush and the state department offered deep sympathy and sincere condolences strongly condemning the cowardly attack the killing elicited widespread condemnation from around the world the next day bhuttos body was interred in her ancestral village in sindh as the pakistani government ordered nearly total shutdown of services in anticipation of spreading violence serious rioting occurred in the sindhi capi tal of karachi as well as at numerous other sites the circumstances of bhuttos death remain controversial early reports about the cause were conflicting government official claimed that neither bullets nor shrapnel caused her death and that she was killed after her head hit latch on the vehicles sunroof more senior official later withdrew the claim but the government has cont inued to maintain that gunshots played role emergency room doctors who tried to revive bhutto may have been pressured to conform to the governments accounts and later sought to distance themselves from such accounts calling for an autopsy 34 video and photographs of the event appear to show gunman firing three shots at bhutto from close range closely followed by an explosion which left more than 20 bystanders dead in blow to subsequent investigations city fire trucks used highpressure hoses to clear the crime scene of debris likely destroying what could be vital forensic evidence many observers have criticized the musharraf government for providing insufficient security for bhutto questions about how she was killed become more relevant in this context as death from gunshots fired at close range would be more damning of existing security than would suicide bombing which is more difficult to defend against with pakistanis widely skeptical of their governments capacity and intention in launchi ng probeand many holding the government directly or indirectly responsible for bhuttos deathdemands soon came for an international investigation into the assassination as articulated by one pakistani daily only

hussain is viewed as close ally of musharrafs who would likely bolster the presidents continued influence 55 sharifs electoral plans met major obstacle when on december 3 his nomination papers were rejected making him ineligible to compete in the elections because of criminal convictions related to his 1999 ouster from power his brother shabaz former punjab chief minister and political

time become weakened by the increasingly divergent approa ches taken by its two main figuresjamaate islami ji chief qazi hussain ahmed vehement critic of the militaryled government and jamiat ulemaepakistan chief fazl urrehman who largely has accommodated the musharraf regime with its two major constituents holding directly opposing views on the wisdom of participating in upcoming elections the mma has all but formally split diminishing its prospects for holding power in pakistans two western provincial assemblies 56 opposition parties were placed in the difficult position of choosing whether to participate in elections that were perceived as manipulated by the incumbent government or to boycott the process in protest sharif along with qazi hussains jamaateislami party member of the islamist mma coalition was for time clear in his intention to keep his party out of the planned elections he calls farce but bhutto was less direct about her own intentions this left the opposition divided until bhutto announced her intention to participate which spurred sharif to reverse course on december 9 sharif announced that his party would participate in elections after he failed to convince bhutto to join boyco tt bhutto welcomed the decision some analysts insisted that an election boycott would only serve the interests of the ruling pmlq and they urged full poll participation while stressing the need to minimize any rigging or manipulation of the process 57 upon bhuttos assassination nationwide debate was launched over the issue of postponing the election date both zardari the new ppp leader and sharif demanded that the election be held as scheduled the bush administration appeared to support their demands58 zardaris calculation likely was rooted in expectations of significant sympathy vote for the ppp the ruling pmlq appeared to seek and later welcome decision to postpone the polls sharif for his part has maintained hardline stand against musharrafs continued rule demanding that broadbased national unity government be put in place 59 while conceding that the pakistanis must determine whether or not to make changes to the election schedule state department spokesman offered that the best way to honor bhuttos memory was for the democratic process to continue and he opined that polls should by all means go ahead as scheduled if an election can be held safely and smoothly on january 8 when asked about the issue secretary rice said its just very important that the democratic process go forward 60 some analysts believe the us governments apparent push for january elections may have been part of an eagerness to graft legitimacy onto musharraf by anointing successor to bhutto in fact bhuttos death appears to leave the united states even more dependent on an increasingly embattled musharraf as the only major prous leader in pakistan 61 56 jill mcgivering pakistan islamic bloc suspended bbc news december 12 2007 griff witte

pakistani officials to use the interim period to ensure that an independent media is able to operate and that all restrictions on political parties are lifted62 even nongovernmental american commentators had urged delay arguing that musharraf can maintain his status only by allowing for genuine national reconciliation involving all major political parties and that this can come about only after pause and then bold regrouping 63 musharraf defended the postponement as necessary given the scale of destruction in sindh it is as yet unclear if opposition parties will organize largescale

islamist extremism and militancy has been menace to pakistani society throughout the post2001 period and became especially prevalent in 2007 in the months since an early july commando raid on radical islamabad mosque religious militants have perpetrated more than three dozen suicide bomb attacksmost of them against security personneltaking more than 700 lives and neotaliban militants have controlled western regions such as waziristan and swat where government troops have engaged costly and in the former case losing battles despite recent apparent successes in swat pakistan was plagued by at least ten suicide bombings in december alone despite musharrafs ostensible motives the imposition of state of emergency further inflamed antimusharraf sentiment among the pakistani public and aggravated already considerable civil military tensions moreover by redirecting resources toward subduing pakistani civil society the move may even have hindered the militarys ability to combat religious extremists who many argue are strengthened by authoritarian rule that weakens the countrys moderate political forces 64 on the other hand it is possible that musharraf and the new army chief gen kiyani are dividing their responsibilities so that the former will retain political management of the country while the latter oversees the militarys counterinsurgency efforts this might serve to make more effective pakistans antiextremism efforts over time in both their political and their militarized aspects 65 an international crisis group report on winding back martial law in pakistan warned that martial law will only bring more violence and instability to pakistan the imprisonment of secular leaders of civil society boosts jihadi groups the targeting of moderate political parties

rule of law opens the door wider to extremism66 indeed musharrafs imposition of emergency did not lead to any immediately noticeable improvement in his governments battle with the militants as pakistan troops continued to appear on the defensive in provincial conflict regions 67 by one account islamist militants in the swat valley more than doubled the territory under their control in the weeks after november 368 by early december however following the apparent launch of major pakistan army offensives in the region most militant elements in the swat were reported to be in retreat on december 15 the pakistani government claimed victory there saying fighters loyal to the radical islamist mullah fazlullah had been routed and driven into the hills69 many western diplomats including those from the united states have expressed dismay with president musharrafs november fixation on the pakistani judiciary and on his arrest of civil society elements considered unthreatening to state security musharraf has to many observers appeared more interested in battling his domestic political adversaries than in taking on the countrys religious militants when asked about this apparent contradiction white house spokeswoman said we do not believe that any extraconstitutional means were necessary in order to help prevent terrorism in the region 70 bhuttos killing at years end led to countrywide rioting some 60 people were killed and the caretaker government called the damage from ensuing violence colossal saying manufacturing revenue exports have all suffered badly whether deserving or not musharraf himself took the brunt of the blame for ensuing instability71 the developments fueled already considerable concerns that in focusing on civil strife in the cities pakistans

house arrest however the only figures who could potentially unseat musharrafintelligence chiefs and corps commandersall were handpicked by musharraf on the assumption that they would remain loyal to

emergency they may be much less approving of powersha ring arrangement that would include bhutto given its collective interest in maintaining unified chain of command however most analysts see the armys top leadership staying united and thus maintaining relative degree of order in the country the probability of musharraf being removed from office by force is therefore considered to be quite low should major outpouring of public protest occur however it is possible that musharrafs powerful military subordinates could seek his resignation in the national interest 74

musharrafs emergency decree and its attendant developments along with widespread violence and the assassination of bhutto have led to widespread concerns that the bush administrations pakistan policyand perhaps its broader antiextremism efforthad become fragile and ineffective79 the bush administration generally has not ranked democracy at the top of its list of priorities with pakistan at december 2007 senate foreign relations committee hearing on pakistan one senior analyst offered that overall us policy toward pakistan until very recently gave serious attention to encouraging democracy in pakistan 80 on november 9 five us senatorsincluding the majority leader and the chairman of the senate foreign relations committeesigned letter to president bush which said musharrafs assumption of emergency rule raised very troubling questions not only about the administrations pakistan policy but also about its overall national security strategy the senators called for broad review of washingtons pakistan policy including adjustments to aid programs and new steps to enhance security along the afghanistanpakistan border and to defeat qaeda the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee sfrc senator joe biden warned president musharraf in december there will be consequences if upcoming elections are not fair and open saying us aid levels could be decreased 81 following bhuttos death the speaker of the house representative nancy pelosi said washington should address troubling questions about the probe into bhuttos murder and consider withholding further foreign assistance to pakistan unless islamabad allowed international investigators to participate82 an array of former us government officials has insisted that military dictatorship in pakistan is

signs that it may be making firmer contingency plans in case musharraf does not long survive in power86 still and despite sense among many independent analysts that continued us support for musharraf

aid to pakistan until antidemocratic developments there are reversed89 in discussing the potential implications of new governance issues in pakistan administration officials have emphasized the importance of not allowing islamabads continuing cooperation in antiterrorism efforts to be undermined thus the administration likely will continue to see the demands of what it terms the war on terror as trumping concerns about pakistans system of governance as it has appeared to do since 2001 many observers viewed president bushs initial and overall reaction to the emergency decree and ensuing crackdown as somewhat subdued some see developments in pakistan and the administrations allegedly tepid response as evidence that president bushs socalled freedom agenda is applied selectively and without principle 90 this perception may contribute to increased antiamerican sentiments in pakistan91 foreign policy magazine offered november 2007 exchange between two senior pakistan experts which captures the main arguments of those who believe the united states must continue to support musharrafs flawed leadership in islamaba d so as to maintain continuity in the face of political instability there and those who be lieve musharraf has become liability whose rejection by the united states would signal to the pakistani military that it must start negotiating with the countrys political parties and civil society instead of dictating to them 92 many commentators continue to view musharraf himself as the primary obstacle to both pakistani democratization and to more effective
