multilateral nd bilateral donors saw th need to develop an international strategy for assistance to address haitis shortterm needs in between the collapse of the government of president jeanbertrand aristide and the installation of new elected government haiti experienced socioeconomic crisis surrounding aristides departure in februa ry 2004 followed by disastrous floods in may 2004 armed violence and the absen ce or further deterioration of public services further exacerbated these conditions international donors agreed that all of these factors made the needs for humanitarian aid and protection extremely urgent in response to these urgent needs haiti s interim government and international agencies developed strategy for international assistance entitled the interim cooperation framework the authors of this framework presented it at an international donors confer ence on haiti in july 2004 bilateral nd multilateral donors made pledges of fi nancial and other support at the conference the interim cooperation framework establis hes priority needs and projects that fall under four broad categories or axes the first axis strengthen political governance and national dial

sector and providing jobs and access to microfina nce economic recovery programs also aim to help farmers meet their needs improve roads and transport and rehabilitate and protect the environment improve access to basic services is the fourth axis because basic services are so scarce in haiti the priorities in this category are many they range from immediate goals such as providing emergency humanitarian aid to more longterm goals health related goals include increasing the availability of potable water and lavatories extending minimal health services and improving access to them improving the ability to address food security and improving solid waste management programs also include improving the quality of and access to education at all levels engaging disa dvantaged youth

governance and institu tional development economic recovery and access to basic services for each of these four strategic axes the framework provides strategy priority objectives and monitoring indi cators each axis of the framework its priorities and the projects designed to address them are discussed below axis 1 strengthen political governance and national dialogue politics in haiti have generally been violent and authoritarian ever since haiti became an independent republic in 1804 haiti was headed by some 30 despotic rulers from independence to the collapse of the 30year duvalier dictatorship in 1986 in the late 1980s strong democratic movement emerged leading to new constitution that guaranteed personal liberties distributed power among president prime minister and two legislative chambe rs and created an i ndependent judiciary and an electoral council to ove rsee democratic elections th first elections that were generally considered free and fair were held in 1990 bringing aristide to power nascent democratic institutions were frail however and authoritarian traditions strong succumbing to long tradition in haiti president aristide was ousted by violent means in this case military coup in 1991 after he was restored to office by usled military force in 1994 neither he nor his successor rene preval was able to maintain fully functioning govern ments or hold fully credible elections httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33156crs5 2 see for example international cr isis group spoiling security in haiti latin americacaribbean report 13 may 31 2005although the 1987 constitution remains in fo rce many of its provisions are not respected in practice parliament has been regarded by the international community or the opposition as fully leg itimate since 1997 the partment of state human rights report for 2004 calls haitis judicial syst em largely moribund and subject to significant influence by the executive and legislative branches political parties are mostly vehicles for individual ambitions haitian society has become increasingly polarized some observe rs have criticized successive haitian governments for tolerating and in some cases facilitating violence against members of the opposition at the same time observers cr iticize th oppos ition for also employing violent means and for limiting themselves to strategy of rejection rather than negotiation2 the priorities under this axis in clude programs directed at security police and demobilization disarmament and reintegration priorities include enhancing security by professionalizing the haitian national police and disarming the numerous illegal armed groups in the country the police force became politicized under aristide armed groups include aristide supporters and rebels who contributed to aristides ouster violence increased during the months preceding that ouster and part of minustahs mission is to help the government demobilize and disarm these groups and try to rein tegrate them into haitain society justice penitentiary institutions and human rights priorities include taking measures agains t impunity and promoting judicial independence and capacity throug h training of judicial and penitentiary personnel and rehabilitation of physical infrastructure promoting respect for human rights and basic freedoms by strengthening government institu tions responsible for protecting citizens from abuse by the govern ment and promo ting cooperation between the government and nong overnmental organizations that promote and protect human rights electoral process priorities include holding free credible elections with the mission minustah and the organization of american st ates oas supporting haitis provisional electoral council in organizing the elections and ensuring security for them presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for fall of 2005 with the transfer of power to take place on february 7 2006 but the dates ve been changed several times and may be postponed yet again promotion of national dialogue priorities include encouraging political dialogue among all sectors of haitian society to promote national reconciliation nd solutions to local and national problemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33156crs6 3 conference on trade and developm ent the least developed countries 1997 report ny and geneva 1997 pp127128based on consensus the in terim cooperation framework is considered part of this process by involving many sectors of society in creating national plans of development such as the icf poverty reduction strategy paper and millennium development goals the interim government and the international community hope to establish framework for national dialogue revolving around development priorities axis 2 strengthen economic governance and institutional development use of public coffers for persona l wealth has gone on for much of haitis history it became so rampant under the duvalier reg ime 19571986 that it became known as kleptocracy acco rding to the icf p18 weaknesses in economic governance have been one of the most serious impediments to economic growth and poverty reduction in haiti and the current state of economic governance is dismal the priorities under this axis in clude programs directed at economic governance priorities include making the budget process transparent and efficient by implementing state accounting system strengthening control m echanisms for use of public funds and procurement and other reforms the icf also calls for better management of public finances by expanding the tax base and improving the allocation and ma nagement of public funds by attacking corruption strengthening of institutional capacities priorities include improving human resources in public administration by recruiting qualified young officials from th haitian diaspora as well as from within haiti providing massive training and significantly improving compensation regional urban and local development and decentralization priorities include implementing structures at the local level which will prepare strategies for development based on needs as identified by the community the icf also calls for the interim government to prepare policies for decentraliza tion and regional urban and local development to submit to the next government axis 3 promote economic recovery haiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere and one of the poores t countries in the world ranking 150th among 175 countries in the uns huma n development inde x in 1997 the described haiti as having an economy in regress meaning that the living standards and conditions of th majority or large part of the population have fallen substantially3 and its economy has mostly tinued to decline since then the tasks that must be undertaken to promot economic recovery and create jobs arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33156crs7 enormous haiti must establish macroec onomic stab ility rehabilitate infrastructures such as electricity and roads and develop the private sector in addition agricultural production must be improved while protecting the envir onment which has greatly deteriorated the priorities under this axis in clude programs directed at macroeconomic stability in conjunction with the international monetary fund the interim govern ment designed macroeconomic program whose purpose is to contain inflation at 14 rehabilitate key public facilities and provide essential services according to the icf this will be difficult to ach ieve without budgetary discipline on the part of the government electricity priorities include impr oving the production and distribution of electricity by attacking corruption and mismanagement of the independent public co rporation electricity of haiti which has the monopoly on electricity according to the icf about 90 percent of haitians have access to electricity development of private sector and small and mediumsize enterprisesindustries priorities include helping to revive the private sector by making various funds available to small businesses combating corruption developi ng commercial code and encouraging integration of haiti into regional and international markets rapid job creation and microfinance priorities include creating jobs through labor intensive work programs especially in public programs to improve infrastructure according to the icf p 25 almost 1 out of every 2 haitians between the ages of 20 and 45 does not have lucrative occupa tion the framework calls for creating about 687000 jobs from 20042006 and increasing access to microcredit especially for women agriculture priorities include improving the capacity of agricultural workers to meet their needs in the short term by supplying vaccinations conducting di sease control repairing farm equipment and distributing tool s and seed various sorts of technical assistance in agricultural techniques are called for in the medium term the report recommends rehabilitation of part of the ministry of agriculture to restore its minimal intervention capability and training of ministry of agriculture staff farmers organizations and others to maximize the effectiveness of such interventions although 45 to 50 of haitis working population is engaged in agriculture 80 of farmers cannot meet the basic food needs of their families icf p 26 roads and transportation transportation infrastructure which includes roads airports airstrips and harbors are in great need ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33156crs8 investment and maintenance as they are in state of very advanced dilapidation according to the icf p 27 priorities include making roads that are necessary for development usable at all times by quickly conducting road rehab ilitation work and then setting up financial and institutional mechanisms for managing and maintaining them currently only 5 of 3400 kilometers of roads are in good condition the strategy also calls for identifying and quickly investing in whatever is necessary to maintain continuity of port and aviation activity and improving port management environmental protect ion and rehabilitation priorities include promoting sustainable use of na tural resources through reduced reliance on wood fuel planning nd carrying out of activities aimed at halting degradation of land nd natural resources and supporting the development and imp lementation of disast er management plans haiti is caught in vicious cycle that makes the land unable to sustain the needs of its inhab itants and vulnerable to natural disasters because farmers lack the means to invest in more efficient technology they employ unsustainable methods such as cutting down trees for wood fuel which cont ributes to deforestation which leads to soil erosion which leads to inadequate agricultural production and continued povert the program focuses on supporting local initiatives and the development of national plans to manage natural res ources effectively axis 4 improve access to basic services much of haitis population lacks access to basic services accordin g to the world health organization only 28 of haitians have access to sanitation and 46 have access to improved water sources there are only 25 doctors per 100000 people these conditions leave the majority of the population vulnerable to disease and malnutrition without educational resources or social safety nets the priorities under this axis in clude programs directed at emergency humanitarian aid and postdisaster relief priorities include responding to the various crises in 2004 with emergency humanitarian aid haiti experi enced socioeconomic crisis surrounding the collapse of the ar istide government in february 2004 followed by the disastrous floods of may 2004 armed violence including looting of st ockpiles of humanitarian assistance for much of the population already limited access to basic social services and food and the absence of many public services or further deterioration of what few services existed made conditions worse all of these factors according to the icf p 30 make the needs for humanitarian aid and prot ection extremely urgent furthermore haiti has become increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters haiti is scribed by the undp as being one of the most vulnerable countries in the worl d for natural catastrophes due tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33156crs9 4 undp reducing disaster risk challenge for development 2004 pp 3640cyclones and floods4 therefore another element of this component of the icf takes longer view of postdisaster relief calling for strengthening governmental authorities ability to identify vulnerable groups and provide them assistance and identifying humanitarian needs not met by current initiatives such as longterm reconstruction and restoration of areas most affected by the 2004 floods the icf also notes that while some humanitarian assistance is provided for in the plan it is esse ntial for the government and the international community to velop means of periodically assessing humanitarian needs it also calls on the government to develop rehabilitation and reconstruction program with preventative approach fo r floodaffected areas water and sanitation priorities include increasing the production and delivery of potable water by strengthening institutional capacity and conducting studies for further improvement in the longterm more than half 54 of all itians lack access to improved water sources according to the icf p 31 almost 60 of rural households and almost 40 of urban households outside major metropolitan areas do not have lavatory inside or outside of their homes about 9 of homes in tropolitan areas have lavatory on positive note the icf states that where beneficiary communities have been actively involved in water projects there has been some improvement in access to potable water health and nutrition priorities include extending minimal health services by restarting the operation of the principal hospitals and strengthening the ability of th public health and population ministry to manage and coordina health care and coordinate its activities with inte rnational and nong overnmental health organizations the icf also ca lls for the renewal of priority programs such as systematic vaccinations and for improved access to health care for both the gene ral population and vulnerable groups the latter includes children preg nant women handicapped and hivaidsinfected people and indi gents the icfs strategy for improving access and restarting priority programs entails regulating and lowering prices for generic dr ugs and for essential supplies and services and establishing nati onal system for their purchase and distribution education youth and sports this component of the icf addresses three levels of education basic pr ofessional training and university the programs are aimed at improving access to and conditions of basic primary and secondary education by rehabilitating schools improving school environments and reducinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33156crs10 the costs of sc hool for vulne rable groups other programs aim to raise the level of instruction by restoring and improving teacher training remobilizing educati onal personnel and revising and distributing literacy and other programs designed to improve the quality of education currently about half million children lack access to basic education and mere 35 of children complete the 5th grade the icf also calls on the government to improve communication with the private s ector which currently provides about 80 of the primary education available for professional training the pr ograms are aimed at increasing access to and the relevance and qua lity of training the programs will strive to accomplish these goals by strengthening the capacity of the government institution for professional training and identifying the training needs of the workforce and then recruiting the personnel to meet those needs currently only 6 out of every 1000 workers in the workforce have diploma or certificate in technical or professi onal field icf p 34 for higher education the initiativ are aimed at reducing the dropout rate by providing services such as scholarships and food services initiating reform to improve access and quality of educational programs and in the short term repa iring damage done to universities during the political violence of 2004 the number of students in higher education almost doubled from 1986 to 1996 but the dropout rate is extremely hig h some observers believe that because the government saw university students as part of an opposition movement university fac ilities were targeted during the political upheaval and damaged iversities also have inadequate educational and physical materials icf p34 because itian youth cons titute key factor in the process of creating democratic system nd promoting economic development and social progress the icf calls on the haitian institution responsible for youth sports nd civics to focus on vulnerable sectors of the youth such as disadvantaged youth or those with substance abuse problems and to emphasize sports as an activity that stimulates social cohesion icf p34 culture media and communications priorities include reinforcing the role of culture and media in the promotion of pluralist and democratic society by strengthening haitian broadcast capacities especially to be able to support the 2005 election process and integrating women and other excluded or disadvantaged groups other projects include preparing public policy for the protection and diffusion of haitian cultura l heritage and funding and supporting haitian artsa ndcrafts artisans food security priorities include reinforcing and creating institutions that are capable of collecting information on andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33156crs11 5 ambassador juan gabriel valdes head of minustah congressional staff discussion hosted by interamerican dialogue march 24 2005implementing plans for addressing food insecurity according to the world food program 40 of itis population is food insecure and 16 is precariously food secure slum upgrading priorities include improving slums by strengthening national institu tions and community councils responsible for urban planning and various public works and by carrying out physical improvements the icf notes that although haiti is still predominantly rura l the urban popul ation grew at almost 5 annually compared to general population growth of about 2 from 1982 to 2003 icf p37 the head of minustah has said that allowing conditions in the slums to continue as they are is intolerable and that improving the quality of life in the slums would do much to reduce violence nd bolster confidence in both the international community and the haitian government5 solid waste management priorities include ensuring effective collection and removal of solid waste by actively including the private sector and private citizens in waste management efforts and providing waste treatment and dis posal sites that protect the environment the icf also calls for existing institutions to be strengthened and new ones to be created that can create and support solid waste management plans at the national and local level the icf estimates that under 30 of solid waste is removed in metropolitan portauprince that in other cities most waste is dumped in rivers and that ma ny neighborhoods have waste removal services at all icf p 37 safety nets and social protection priorities include laying the foundation for the respect of fundamental human rights by conducting largescale awareness campaigns and issuing identity documents reducing malnutrition by providing food and services especially to vulnerable groups increasing access to health care through microinsurance encouraging communities to identify their development needs and providing international and private sector funding offering social assistance services to the most vulnerable sectors of society and improving the capacity of the ministry responsible for social services ccording to the icf any assistance provided by the haitian government is very fragmented scattered and without significant impact wh ile most of the social protection services available are provided by nongovernmental organizations these groups only have resources sufficient to meet small percentage of the populations needshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33156crs12 6 see for example don bohni ng nation

and impl ementation of projectsstrengths and weaknesses of the interim cooperation framework authors of the interim cooperation fram ework cite as one of the strategys strengths its inclusive and participatory nature they consulted members of haitian civil society the private sector and political parties in drawing up the plan in addition the icf is designed to be li nk between short medium and longterm haitian development efforts some of its programs are meant to provide immediate results such as emergency humanitarian ai d the creation of jobs and the provision of some basic services the entire strategy was designed to continue for six months beyond the interim government so that th newly elected government scheduled to be inaugurated in february 2006 would have financ ial resources at its disposal and programs already underway other progra ms lay the foundation for more longterm results the interim government is using the icf as basis for poverty reduction strategy for 2006 to 2009 whic h it is supposed to have ready in time for the next government generations of corrupt haitian rulers have used the government as means of personal enrichment neglecting the development of state institutions in addition observers have critic ized past interventions for failing to build institutions or train haitians to perform government functions after inte rnational actors have departed priority of the icf is to strengthen the capacity of national institutions so that the haitian government can design and provide public services and manage its resources more effectively and transparently haitian ins titutions have limited capacity the haitian g overnment is small and has few physical resources and skille d personnel to desi gn and implement development programs the icf authors themselves warn that absorptive capacity can only be improved in gradual manner and must be taken into consideration otherwise the system will collapse icf p 6 the plan therefore emphasizes strengthening haitian government structures building up fragile institutions and in some cases creating entirely new ones some observers argue that until those institutions are made more capable howev er international act ors should take stronger role in implementing the in terim cooperation fr amework and other development plans in light of haitis chronic po litical instability some have suggested making haiti an international protectorate others suggest that multilateral donor commission should be formed to oversee and ensure accountability of international fina ncial assistance still others propose that the donor community assume greater responsibility for planning and implementing velopment projects so that donor funds could be better absorbed6 some

arrears where necessary with aid from donors see table 1 previous haitian administra tions were limited in the aid they could receive in part because they lacked parliament to authorize spending and

some of these improvements can be maintained for example electricity service was restored initially but after us subsidies ended in march 2005 service fell again the interim government increased tax collection but donors are uncertain that will be sustained many of the reforms such as implementing fiscal discipline nd fighting corruption require political will to carry them out observers note that political will to devise and implement reform has been difficult to maintain in haiti congressional concerns many congressional concerns regarding development in haiti are addressed by the priorities and programs outlined in the interim cooperative framework promotion of democratic governance and political stability effective and transparent use of domestic and intern ational funds and economic developm ent and reduction of poverty the main congressional c oncerns expressed regarding the donors conference strategy is the rate at wh ich funds are being disbursed and the effectiveness of th aid being provided the interim government nongovernmental organiza tions and some members complained of slow initial disbursement five months after the donors conference was held interim itian president boniface alexandr urged the release of funds complaining of irritating deadlines and the slow procedures and saying that haiti was virtually on the brink of the abyss12 this initial slowness has been acknowledged by some donors according to the world bank however the rate of disbursement has impr oved since then near the midpoint of the donors conference timeframe little less than lf of the pledged funding had been disbursed an estimated 400 million as of may and tentative estimate of 500 million as of july 200513 the rate of disbursement is affected by several factor s pledges were made to be disbursed not all at once but over peri od of just more than two years from july 2004 through september 2006 the end of haiti s fiscal year and eight months into new administration if elections proceed according to schedule on the part of many of the donors it took veral months to get progra ms designed and authorized through their own governmental processes furthermore disbursements have been uneven among donors at the halfway mar k the united states has disbursed about half of its pledged funds nd canada more than half japan has disbursed more than it pledged some other donors have been slower to disburse funds however so program development is very uneven also in the case of international financial institutions such as the world bank and the interamerican development ba nk the intention was to commit to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33156crs22 14 operation deep pockets op cit 15 us dept of state travel warning haiti may 26 2005designated amount of funding during the two year period with the assumption that disbursing funds and carrying out programs would take longer than that because successive haitian governments have not had transparent accounting of their spending donors are also wary of transfe rring funds to the current government therefore much of the funding is still going through nongovernmental organizations the interim government of haiti also shares some res ponsibility for the difficulties in disbursing the pledged funds early in the process as of december 2004 the interim government had still not developed plan for spending 800 million in donors funds and had just tablished commission to oversee bidding for public contracts as it was complainin g that international funds were not being disbursed the interim govern ment was apparently unaware that it had funds in its own coffers that were not being spent until made aware of them by world bank officials14 the haitian governments capacity to absorb assistance and execute development plans remains problem as well as described bove one of the major goals of the interim cooperation fr amework is promoting good economic governance and institutional development by building up fragile institutions and in some cases creating entirely new ones the frameworks authors hope that as haitian institutions are strengthened donor confidence will increase as well currently observers say one of the great est obstacles to continued disbursement of donor conference funds and execution of icf programs is political instability ongoing violence makes delivery of assistance and services difficult in recent months kidnaping has become frequent and often deadly occurrence adding to the hostile environment for aid workers in may 2005 the us state department ordered nonessential us personnel to leave warned us citizens against traveling to haiti and urged those in haiti to leave due to the volatile security situation the peace corps withdrew its volunteers from haiti in june the travel warning remains in effect15 the violence obviously creates hostile environment for ordinary haitian citizens interrupting their ability to work or attend school and increasing their needs for social and health services in its travel advisory the state department further says that both visitors and residents must remain vigilant due to the absence of an effective police force in much of haiti many observers including some member s of congress also express concern that there is an uncertain and intimidating atmosphere that threatens the nations ability to hold elections that will be considered free fair and inclusive they point to the detention of members of former president aristides party the lavalas family in prison for months without being char ged as evidence of political persecution by the interim haitian government some observers argue that haiti needs process ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33156crs23 16 see for example icf p 1718

consensus on governance and development16 there is also congressional concern about how much has been accomplished with donors funds to date some might be cautious about further funding because not much progress has been made in the past despite massive amounts of aid and more progress needs to be made in terms of government accountability and transparency some members argue that the united states should provide more funds to have greater impact on reducin g poverty to enable more sustained development effort and in turn to prev ent massive migration from the country and help reduce instability some observers believe that the international community must be prepared to make longterm commitment to make the changes begun under the icf sustainable and longlasting donors have held
