suspected of having an animal origin made its first appearance in china chinese leaders at first minimized the effects of the new virus and covered up the extent of its spread but the disease moved rapidly to other countries prompting the world health organization in 2003 to label the virus g lobal health threat under intense public scrutiny chinese leaders in april 2003 eventually acknowledged that people were sickening and dying apologized for their leadership failures in addressing the problem and launched series of initiatives to try to contain the disease limit its economic damage nd protect public health by july 2003 the initial sars outbreak had ended but global disease speci alists expressed concern that the virus could recur like influenza or that other similarly mutating viruses could leap from the animal to the human world on janua ry 5 2004 china confirmed the first new case of sars in guangdong province where the 2003 outbreak had occurred on january 27 2004 prc officials acknowledged th at several flocks of birds in china were infected with the same deadly strain of avian flu that in recent weeks had ravaged bird populations and killed humans in other asian countries the emergence of sars and other new vi ruses has posed steep learning curve for new generation of chinese official s who had assumed office in november 2002 only weeks before the original sars outbr eak in suppressing information early in the crisis the government lost credibility and public confidence more reliable information was available from foreign media sources the internet and cellphone text messages as many as 40 million day during the 2003 sars crisis according to one report in the 2003 crisis chinese l eaders were forced to adjust their strategy by publicly embracing two radical concep ts the public has right to know about information directly concerning their daily lives and government officials need to be accountable to the public for their perform ance officials began issuing regular briefings in 2003 about sars cases and seve ral top officials were fired for covering up the crisis since then the governme nt has revamped emergency procedures issued rules requiring greater government transparency and worked to reduce the deficiencies and prohibitive costs of public health care some observers suggested that lessons learned from the 2003 sars outbreak could permanently influence prc governance some change can be seen in the more open and aggressive way officials have handled sars cases in 2004 officials ve publicly announced both confirmed and suspected cases ordered the extermination of many civet cats culinary delicacy in china but suspected source of animal tohuman transfer of the disease and begun human trials of new sars vaccine

provincial cities of foshan heyuan and zhongshan spreading then to guangzhou the provinces capital city although beijing sent delegation of medi cal experts to guangdong on january 20 2003 to help provincial officials investigat the illness government authorities made official mention of the mysterious cas nor did official prc media sources when provincial government official s finally acknowledged the mysterious pneumonia outbreak publicly in early februa ry 2003 they continued to be secretive and duplicitous about the extent of the illn ess only periodically making reluctant further disclosures about the outbreak the guangdong provincial health bur eau made the first official prc announcement about the mysterious illne ss on february 11 2003 after the outbreak had become obvious in the city according to senior guangdong health official2 taking the then unusual step of holding press conference provincial health authorities reported that 5 in guangdong had died and more than 300 had become sick numbers that proved much understate d by later calculations having revealed the problem the following day on february 12 2003 the official xinhua news agency announced that the mysterious pneumonia had been brought under controland new cases had been reported this remained the official story from the prc government through midmarch 2003 even as the world health

disclosed that the government was continuing seriously to underreport cases of sars in beijing and that the number actually was far more than the statistics of 22 existing cases in the city that the government had released that same day by mid april 2003 persistent rumors international inquiries and foreign press reports were bringing enormous pressure to bear on government officials who were still reporting that sars had been contained in guang dong and that only 15 more cases had been reported in beijing for total of 37 who investigators publicly announced on april 16 2003 that the in ternational community did not trust the beijing city governments figures and that the num bers beijing was reporting did not include patients in military hospitals or those with suspected but unconfirmed cases the new york times quoted one who infectious disease expert as saying that the real number of cases in beijing more likely was in the 100to200 range now5 on april 18 2003 chinas new premier wen jiab ao threatened dire consequences for any government official who did not ma ke full and timely di sclosure about sars cases on april 19 2003 the washington post reported that prc doctors were disclosing that the previous week on orders from the beijing city government authorities had physically moved more than 70 sars patients out of hospitals to prevent visiting who medical teams from finding them on their inspections the real official turnaround in the crisis came on april 20 2003 when prc leaders made an evident decision to be mo re forthcoming about the sars crisis in series of steps that many observers desc ribed as unprecedented in the history of the chinese communist government prc official s that day held nationally televised press conference in which they admitted that sars cases in beijing actually were more than ten times the 37 cases officially reported up to that point and that there were 339 confirmed cases and 402 suspect ed cases offici als offered public apology for their leadership failure in addressing the sars crisis later that day both the minister of health zhang wenkang and the mayor of beijing meng xuenong were removed from their

hundred people in guangdong had been brought under control sars outbreak s had been reported in 26 of the prcs 31 provinces the number of confirmed cas in beijing alone had passed 1100 and the central

strongly that the internal decisionmaking process now is more continuedquarantine further the government can celled the weeklong celebrations for the may 1st holiday of 2003 to discourage widespread travel in china and ordered the emergency closure of movie theaters discos churches and other public places in beijing6 outside the capital villages and towns with recorded sars cases began to put up roadblocks to isolate themselves from potentially infected travelers although new daily prc announcements show ed that confirmed sars cases were now increasing on daily basis who offi cials on april 29 2003 again criticized the government for failure to provide more detailed info rmation many c itizens of beijing refused to venture outside their homes often wearing protective face masks when they did so according to press re ports streets and public squares in the city were virtually deserted nd those businesses and stores that remained open had virtually customers by july 2003 the global transmission of sars had virtually disappeared on july 15 2003 the us cdc discontinued the distribution of its health alert notices and lifted the last of its travel advisories reflecting that new cases of sars had appeared in more than 30 days7 nevertheless the international medical community warned that sars may duplicate the pattern of other respiratory diseases and recur seasonally like the flu many pointed out that the sars outbreak of late 2002early 2003 highlighted number of serious w eaknesses in the prcs political and economic systems that prc leaders were for ced to address par ticularly given the potential for other national health crises some felt that the act of addressing these weaknesses could have lasting impact on governance in the prc political and governance issues since 1978 the pressures and demands of modernization have forced the authoritarian chinese communist political system to change in important ways these changes have been incremental and selective so that the political arena in the prc today has an oddly chimerical quality about it for example while much in prc society is increasingly open the pr ocess by which government and party decisions are made is still murky matter small number of senior leaders continues to make most major policy decisions in closed sessions they give little rationale to the public about why they make given decision and information about whether some leaders ve dissenting views open and direct criticism even when justifiable or wellintentioned is of ten treated harshly as threat to some greater good such as social stability or public safety8 what one observer hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32227crs5 8 continued democratic than that found in earlier communi st history under mao tsetung within this narrow

in the prc extends also into the broader sociopolitical arena9 on the other hand while the party still re serves ultimate power to itself the levers for exercising that power have weakened combined with the forces of globalization the partys institution of ec onomic market mechanisms since 1978 has required more political flexibility and th acceptance of great er local autonomy more decisionmaking authority has devol ved to various government bureaucracies and to provincial and local authorities but this shift in power has not been accompanied by the creation of supporting institutional infrastructure sufficient to regulate commerce control corruption nd coordinate laws and responsibilities at all levels of governance consequently the universe of what effectively can be controlled by the core central elite today is seen to be shrinking while the capacity of noncentral actors to mana ge influence and interfere in daytoday activities is seen to be expanding the struggle of d ealing with sars highlighted these strains and contradictions in the prc political system transparency and accountability one of the most evident consequences of the 2003 sars crisis for prc leaders was the harsh light it threw on the lack of transparency and accountability in government sars demonstrated that much of the prc governments standard operating procedure is illequi pped to respond to widespr ead public health crisis under prc law for example the governme nt has extensive power to determine what information is state secret and can impose severe punishments against those who reveal state secrets the definition of what are state secrets and who is entitled to know them is vague and arbitrary as evidenced by the general description contained in article 2 of the state secrets law state secrets shall be matters that have vital bearing on state security and na tional interests and as specified by legal procedure are entrusted to limited number of people for given period of time10 further according to some reports 1996 w the text of which does not appear to be available specifically states that seri ous infectious diseases shall be considered state secrets unless and until the governme nt makes an official public announcement about the disease11 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32227crs6 12 the company the shanghai roche pharmaceuticals ltd was reported in the

information secret ostensibly for the purpose of prot ecting public safety pr oved damaging and counterproductive strategy in the case of the sars health crisis it was in fact the governments failure to provide informa tion about the initial outbreak that ultimately endangered public safety in addition as the disease began to spread and more information about it became available govern ment efforts to spin the sars story began to appear clumsy and incompetent the party made many early missteps in 2003 that damaged its credibility one early prc staterun media account reported that the in itial reports of pneumonia outbreak were false spread by pharmaceutical company trying to create market for one of its antiflu drugs12 officials publicly insisted that mild pneumonialike epidemic had occurred but had been br ought under control authorities arrested and charged some people for spreading ru mors that mysterious pneumonia had broken out in southern china but confr onted daily with demonstrable evidence of the diseases spread the governments official line ultimately became untenable government leaders were confronted with the fact that more prc citizens believed foreign pronouncements about the spread of sars in china than they did their own governments in part to resuscitate the partys and the governments iling credibility prc officials opted for fuller disclosure according to some news reports in addition to the minister of health and the mayor of beijing dozens of other officials were fired suspended moted or otherwise disciplined for non performance for what one account referred to as their slack reactions against sars13 role of public pressure public pressure played crucial role in finally forcing the governments hand the very nature of the crisis helped serve this public pressure since threat posed by disease is less responsive to political interpretation by the government than are other problems one is either sick with mysterious pneumonialike illness or one is not still it took pervasive pressure from multiple sources to change the way the government responded to sars and at each step observers noted ongoing contradictions in the prc political system international community as contagious di sease sars was not problem that could be confined to limited physical area so that the prc government could shield it from public view in the age of global travel sars transcended geographic borders making it harder to hide from the international community for example in february and march 2003 wh ile prc officials continued publicly to deny that china was having health cris is travelers to sing apore canada hong kong and other countries were gettin g sick with the mysterious illness epidemiologists from the who and from affected

to international organizations and governments pressure arose from what might be called an international community of experts meaning in this case dical personnel in the prc who were in consultation

ountries exchanged information with who investigative teams various national ce nters for disease c ontrol and others reporting on what they were seeing in th eir own hospital wards these avenues of nongovernmental communication allowed dical investigators to make further independent assessments about the veracity of pronouncements from prc government officials the most influential example of this reporting by medical experts involved the case of dr jiang yanyong prominent surgeon in beijing who disclosed on april 9 2003 that based on what he and his coll eagues were seeing the government was seriously underreporting cases of sars in be ijing14 it was this and other information that allowed who and other in ternational medical experts to question the beijing governments official repor ting on sars medical expertise became more believable than the correct political line being circulated by the government technology and communications domestic pressure on officials in beijing was significantly enhanced by the rapid spread in recent years of communications technology in the prc according to industry sources 545 million prc citizens had access to the internet by late 2002 while onefifth of the prc population of 128 billion or approx imately 250 million people had access to cellular phone service by early 200315 during the months of the 20022003 sars outbreak then more prc

in its early years power and authority both within the communist part and within the government bureaucracy face new limits today having been fo rced into greater transparency by acknowledging the extent of the 20022003 sars crisis beijing seemed unable to respond with the pervasive power and control that once had been possible government officials appeared unable to prevent mass migrations from sars affected areas unable to reconstruct the r oute the virus was taking across provincial borders and unable to contro l effectively the way the medical community in china was treating sars patients when it became apparent that some hospitals were turning away potential sars victims who were too poor to afford treatment the beijing health department re portedly promised to pay all

prc media enjoys greater freedom and vitality today than it has in the past the sars crisis demonstrated that the party and government still were capable of reasserting control when the occasion

authorization21 at one point the ban on reporting appeared to be lifted resulting in flood of reporting in the official media only to be reinstated later the sars crisis demonstrated the degree to which the media still does not perform the function of disi nterested observer to keep government honest the style of investigative journalism common in th west while not unknown in the prc is in its infant stages but the sars crisis also highlighted the fact that this may be changing the prc media increasingly are confronted with contradictory priorities they must compete against more widely

readership and funds an increasing pe rcentage of which are from advertising revenue rather than from the government as new member of the world trade organization wto the prc also has committed to

the lack of comprehensive health care system would allow sars and other diseases to spread throughout the country unchecked this was especially of concern when millions of migrant workers returned

2002when the chinese communist party took control of china in 1949 it sought to establish comprehensive health care sy stem for the entire nation during this period most sectors of the economy were taken over by the government workers were provided basic health insurance by thei r employer the government in urban areas medical bills were paid for by their work units while in farming communities collectives helped pay for medical expens government control over the countrys medical system through subsides and price controls kept medical costs low for most workers one major initiative by the government was to send an army of barefoot doctors individuals with basic medical tr aining to rural areas in order to provide health care to peasants as result of these policies nearly 90 of the population nearly all urban residents and 85 of the rural popula tion received basic health care52 according to the world bank prior to 1949 chinas population was among the least healthy in the world but after significant investment in heath care had been made the prc experienced dramatic imp rovements in health conditions such as increased life expectancy which rose from 40 years in 1950 to 69 years in 198253 the stage was set for the decline of the health care system in 1979 when the prc launched severa l economic reforms the central government gradually dissolved the collective farming system and initiated price and ownership incentives for farmers additional reforms followed in stages that sought to decentralize economic policymaking in several economic sectors economic control of various enterprises was given to pr ovincial and local governme nts which were generally allowed to operate and compete on free ma rket principles rather than under the direction and guidance of state planning stateowned enterprises were restructured and reformed laying off millions of workers54 since 1979 major objective of prc leader s has been to reduce the financial burden posed by chinas iron

to privatize health care or make it the re sponsibility of local governments to run programs on their own workers are now couraged to obtain health care insurance on their own and many hospita ls clinics and health care workers operate on for profit basis this policy has led to severe decline in the availability of affordable health care for large portion of chinas popul ation particularly those living in rural areas it is estimated that in 1978 about 20 of the national health budget was spent on rural areas but this figure had been slashed to 4 by the mid 1990s55 today it is estimated

the chinese ministry of health found that in 1993 59 of patients in rural areas refused to be hospitalized for proper treatment because th eir families could not afford to pay for the service by 1998 that rate climbed to 6557 the central government has sought to control rising medical costs by putting mandatory price controls on certain procedures however in order to make up for financial losses resulting from these controls and to earn profit hospitals and clinics often order expensive dical tests and drugs for their patients these conditions became particularly tr oublesome to prc policymakers in their efforts to contain the spread of sars they feared that individuals infected with sars would avoid seeking medical care because of concerns over costs and therefore would quickly spread the diseas across the country as result the government pledged to provide free medical care to all those infected with sars who could not afford it the sars epid emic ultimately may gi ve an

attracting funding and trained personne l for medical care facilities in rural areas58 sars and avian flu in 2004 some policy observers suggest that number of prc actions and decisions in the past

governments reaction to emerging health crises could offer clues to future governance and policy in the prc for the prc in previous years there have been other known crises involving leadership

concepts they had not addressed before the right of the public to know about information that directly concerns their daily lives and the need for government to hold officials accountable for their mistakes and failings neither concept has been an endemic feature of prc governance some observers have speculated that because of this sars has sewn the seeds for longerlasting changes in the way prc officials operate they point out for example that prior to the sars outbreak public officials and party members lost their jobs generally for reasons of political ri valry or if they were involved in widely known corruption scandals in contrast during the sars outbreak two relatively senior officials were sack ed for what amounted to poor job performance for covering up sars cases or mishandling th consequences of the outbreak in some way and some reports suggested that hundreds of other lowlevel officials were fired68 the implication is that public exp ectations for competence and accountability in government may have been raised to new level by the sars crisis and that the government will be forced by those expectations to be more forthcoming in the future they see an example of this greater accountability in the public announcement by beijing in may 2003 that 70 sa ilors had died in an accident aboard prc submarine the previous month at th height of the sars outbreak in the words of one prc scholar commenting on the governments response to the submarine accident this whole submarine affair has been breakthrough for openness69 the incident was the worst pub licly acknowledged military accident in prc history according to this viewpoint there also is evidence that sars may put pressure on prc officials in the future to rethink the current restrictive definition of state secret that criminalizes the sharing of in formation about serious health epidemics already some point out the government ppears to have realized that the system now in place provides key disincentives for sharing unpleasant information to address this in the wake of sars prc judicial organs reinterpreted existing laws to make more explicit the requirement that public health officials should immediately disclose the existence of health threats70 according to reports the central government also has been working on freedom of information act expected to be enacted later in 2004 that

senior official s have been sacked before in the prc for political reasons72 some dismiss the publicity surrounding the submarine accident as matter of official selfdefense judging that prc leaders may have felt they could not afford to be scooped second time by the international media further some observers maintain that while the sars experience might prompt some prc leaders to argue for more political transparency it may reinforce for others the utility of more heavyhanded tactics such as quarantines and arrests for rumormongering they say that officials appear less likely to have opted for openness in addressing the current avian flu outbreak in 2004 perhaps because the outbreaks are still isolated nough as to lead officials to expect they can control information flow critics also are especially troubled that in the immediate aftermath of the 2002 2003 sars outbreak official prc media re vealed that there were 107 cases in which public security organs investig ated and punished people for spreading rumors about sars through the inte rnet and mobile phone text messages73 in addition critics say that anot her judicial rei nterpretation in may 2003 contains one of the more draconian measures to come out of the sars crisis provision that anyone intentionally spreading danger ous disease could be subject to life imprisonment or to the death penalty in the future74 these observers see this as evidence that the offici response to crises was not changed all that much by sars and they fear that such punitive responses will also prevail in the avian flu case and in other potentially dire public health threats finally the sars epidemic appears to have focused new attention on domestic political debate in the prc over the wisdom of longstanding basic policy begun by deng xiaoping and closely associated with the jiang zemin faction that economic growth is the highest national prio rity and must be pursued at any cost the weaknesses that sars revealed about the

struggled with its own deadly sars outbreak in the first half of 2003 and it has considerable experi ence with the avian flu virus75 under sinobritish agreements reached in the 1980s hong k ong was granted autonomy to run its own affairs without prc interference76 while the initial political transition has gone smoothly hong kongs relationship with its new sovereign remains uneasy cynics about the prcs promises of autonomy cla im that beijing is subtly interfering in hong kongs affairs mainly by assuring that political pluralism is artificially restricted such views combined with hong kongs unique political situation place special strains on hong kong and prc gove rnment officials the addition of sars to hong kongs political and economy troubl in 2003 for instance worsened the already low approval rating of c h tung hong kongs beijingapproved chief executive which then reflected poorly on beijing some say these hong kong sentiments were key factor prompting massive numbers of hong kong citizens to become more politically active in mid2003 and into 200477 many felt that the sars crisis emphasized the different pproaches of the two governments the prcs secretiveness and hong kongs openness and claimed that this emphasized the importance of hong kong autonomy other hong kong observers attributed the early lack of information on sars directly to hong kongs special political circumstances saying that contact has been deliberately kept to minimum mostly to protect hong kongs political independence78 these restrictions made it easier for prc officials to not communicate with hong kong on the extent of the sars outbreak the remedy they claimed would be to facilitate communications and lower barriers to bring beijing and hong kong closer together for taiwan with its

recurrence of the disease in 2004 and the implications of the 2004 avian flu outbreak appear likely to rein force the already strong support of us members of congress for taiwans who membership implications for us policy us foreign policy specialists are confronting the lingering political and economic consequences that global health crises in th prc could have for us policy and for uschina relations the 2003 sars outbreak and the emerging 2004 avian flu outbreak demonstrate that increasing pressures are working on the authoritarian prc system pressures involving greater public demand for information increasing government vulnerability to domestic and international opinion the prcs growing buyin into the international system and the continually closer link between all these things and the prcs predominant goal of rapid economic growth some american observers believe that new public demands in the prc are likely to emphasize funding for domestic so cial services public health the quality of medical care education and other pr ograms and could lead to lesser emphasis on military spending some in th is group also see the crisis as having reinforced for prc leaders the impor tance of communication cooperation andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32227crs23 transparency in confronting issues that transcend national borders and they view these reinforcements to be in us inte rests they suggest that new opportunities have arisen for governmental and privat esector sinous cooperation in areas such as medical research public health rvices technological database creation and that the us government should enc ourage and facilitate these exchanges as matter of policy for these observers the glass is half full for another group of observers the glass is half empty this group points out that the initial inclination of prc leaders both in the sars crisis and the emerging avian flu outbreak was to be secretiv and heavyhanded and that only by combination of extraordinary circumstances and pressures did the prc opt for greater openness they focus on the hars h aspects of the prcs response the arrests for disseminating information the imprisonments for rumormongering the central governments swift crackdown on the media they also find concern in the more fragile aspects of the prcs re sponse the inability to inspire public confidence or limit the diseases spread by more effective control of population movements they find fault with the prc governments instinct for selfprotection and nondisclosure which they say increased the risk to other countries and proved that the prc is not good neighbor th united states they say should remain wary of prc motivations and cautious in dealing with prc leaders chronology 012003 team of health experts from beijing arrived
