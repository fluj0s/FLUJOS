subject judge bruguiere discusses ongoing terrorism challenges ref 04 paris 8760 and previous classified by political minister counselor josiah rosenblatt for reas ons 14 bd 1 s summary during january 24 lunch hosted by the ambassador top terrorism investigating judge jeanlouis bruguiere discussed number of ongoing investigations he was leading and also commented on variety of terrorismrelated issues he believed that 2005 would be dangerous year given the expertise demonstrated during terrorist attacks in 2004 and thought in particular that europe and asia would be targeted end summary 2 sbu bruguiere heads the parisbased section of investigating judges that focus on terrorism issues he and fellow investigating judge jeanfrancois ricard concentrate on international and islamic terrorism while the other investigating judges examine basque corsican and bretonrelated terrorism bruguiere is by far the most visible and mediasavvy of the terrorism investigating judges just in the past month he has been the subject of extensive profiles in monde french centerleft daily newspaper and the financial times international threats 3 s bruguiere said he believed both europe and asia were frontline targets for terrorism in 2005 one essential problem with the european union response said bruguiere was that different countries had different institutional approaches to dealing with terrorist threats despite the fact that many eu states had open borders via the schengen agreement he cited germany and the netherlands as two countries whose legal and administrative institutions made them difficult partners despite their political will bruguiere speculated that those countries with direct experience of terrorism such as the us spain france and the uk had more fully developed their counterterrorism capabilities potential terrorists knew which countries offered comparatively greater protections and they took advantage of these opportunities within the eu said bruguiere 4 s alqaidalinked terrorists demonstrated their ability to strike within europe not only during the madrid bombings but also during the 2004 istanbul bombings said bruguiere he noted that british financial and diplomatic institutions were targeted in istanbul at the exact time that president bush was in the uk bruguiere also mentioned his ongoing concern with the caucasus and chechnya he believes that alqaida terrorist abu musab alzarqawi has an extensive network in the region the caucasus said bruguiere are only threehour flight to paris in order to combat this mosaic of threats bruguiere said european countries needed to undertake two key actions further sensitize their populations and strengthen the crackdown on informal financial networks especially neighborhood storefronts and pakistaniorigin hawalas 5 s bruguiere also cited asia as particular area of concern he and ricard had discovered japanbased network after arresting and interrogating french citizen and longtime japanese resident lionel dumont bruguiere said he believed terrorism in asia would target financial centers he was particularly concerned by the pakistanibased terrorist organization lashkaritayyiba domestic investigations 6 s bruguiere and ricards investigation into french nationals going to fight in iraq reftel led to several arrests in the morning of january 24 bruguiere said additional reporting septel he said their investigation had found juveniles as young as 13 trying to reach iraq their investigation had not revealed formal recruitment networks said bruguiere but rather number of autonomous attempts to go on jihad to iraq the most common route for those trying to reach iraq was through syria and its many madrasas and other prayer centers he noted that the conflict in iraq has emerged as powerful recruitment tool for terrorism 7 s responding to question regarding false documents bruguiere said that the market for french passports was quite strong but that french police were increasingly able to detect false papers when they came across them passports from maghreb countries were also in demand said bruguiere because holders of such passports were given visafree entry rights to middle east countries especially syria bruguiere said he remained confident regarding the ongoing trial of djamel beghal and four of beghals associates the beghal network is accused of plotting to bomb the us embassy in paris bruguiere said he had heard from prosecutorial sources that beghals defense was not going well 8 c bruguiere praised usfrench
