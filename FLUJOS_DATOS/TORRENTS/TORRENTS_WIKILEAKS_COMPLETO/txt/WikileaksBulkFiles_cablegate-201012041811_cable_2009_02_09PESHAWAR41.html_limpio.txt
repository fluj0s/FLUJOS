pter subject security environment profile questionnaire sepqpeshawar ref state 33533 classified by david j hazarian regional security officer rso state reason 14 d the following responses are provided for the security environment profile questionnaire sepq responses are keyed to questions in reftel u demonstrations yes there are numerous religious communities and organizations within the nwfp and fata including high volume of violent islamist islamaci radical groups that are fully capable of carrying out antiamerican demonstrations in addition political parties at times include antiamerican sentiments in their demonstrations on domestic political issues i in peshawar yes there were eleven medium to large demonstrations following friday prayers relating to counter terrorism efforts in the tribal areas there was also one large demonstration where locals were protesting against the nato supply shipments transiting peshawar onward to afghanistan ii consulate peshawar is located within the confines of military cantonment and is marginally insulated from demonstrations iii the one demonstration stated in ai consisted of approximately 3500 individuals iv all three are possible pakistani military operations in the fata are perceived as initiated by the us or policies viewed by some as antiislamic are often blamed on us influence b demonstrations are generally peaceful but have the potential to become violent i ii c peshawar has not witnessed large volume of antigovernment demonstrations over the past year i ii 250700 iii demonstrations are generally peaceful but have the potential to become violent iv ii s macro conflict conditions yes elements of the taliban and alqaida fighting in afghanistan use sites in the nwfp and the fata for training rest and recuperation the taliban have used the nwfp and the fata to stage attacks into afghanistan and have also initiated attacks on the pakistan military and government in both the settled areas and the tribal areas elements sympathetic to the taliban have attacked gop buildings officials citizens and westernassociated enterprises and personnel inside peshawar often as retaliation for gop efforts to stop taliban and qaeda activities the pakistani military has engaged in clashes with taliban elements inside the fata and nwfp and local police have engaged with militants within the confines of downtown peshawar the nwfp and the fata have seen frequent instances of sectarian violence between shia and sunni elements most notably in peshawar two bombings of shia mosques in the old city during the muharram holiday sectarian violence has taken place in swat bannu kurram tribal area and the nwfps di khan area b the conflicts mentioned above have taken place mostly in the fata and nwfp to include the settled areas which are adjacent to the fata almost every fata agency has been effected by the above mentioned conflicts heavily effected areas include tank di khan bannu swat mohmand hangu and north and south waziristan however recently significant number of attacks have occurred in the settled areas c us consulate peshawar d yes the taliban qaeda and extremist militants are antius in nature and express this in their actions and demonstrated capabilities iii s host country capabilities the peshawar police are poor at deterring crime and responses to emergency calls by local citizens often go unattended the police have generally responded effectively to consulate peshawars requests when assistance has been needed the police have limited resources such as shortage of vehicles and criminal lab facilities their police force is geared toward security force work ie protecting street corner than investigative work or proactive procedures as result of crime concerns number of wealthier citizens in peshawar have hired contract security companies to provide armed personnel at their residences b the police forces in the nwfp have received significant training and support from the us state department diplomatic security antiterrorism training assistance ata program and the department of justices international criminal investigative training assistance program icitap the training is first rate but it has not had major effect on police capabilities in the province their ability to conduct effective investigations whether it be postblast homicide or kidnappings is extremely limited c yes corruption tends to be wide spread and pervasive at all ranks of law enforcement there are also reports of highlevel corruption in the province d yes pakistans interservices intelligence isi is professional and capable of deterring terrorist actions however they do face resource challenges which sometimes affects their ability to effectively conduct counterterrorism operations yes isi for the most part is cooperative with us consulate requests for information and support they are an important us ally in the global war on terrorism gwot however there is divided loyalty within isi ranks which may cause inaction or assistance to taliban and anti us groups f yes number of alqaeda and taliban members have been killed or apprehended g yes pakistani officials have been very responsive at the consulate in peshawar we have platoon of capital city police and platoon of frontier constabulary augmenting security at the consulate h the airport security is belowaverage i the customs and immigration control at airports is adequate but at border crossings along the border with afghanistan and iran it is ineffective j ineffective the borders are porous taliban and militant extremists are constantly crossing the border with afghanistan and engaging in terrorist and smuggling activity the rugged terrain makes it difficult to patrol and control the border 6 s indigenous terrorism i s antiamerican terrorist groups yespakistan has significant number of islamic extremist militants jaishimuhammad banned by the gop aka khudamulislam lashkaritayyiba banned by the gop jamaatulfurqaan harakat uljihadiislami harakat ulmujahideen aka jamiat ulansar harakat ulmujahideen alalami albadr mujahideen hizbul mujahideen harakat ul ansar lashkar ijhangvi banned by the gop

ranks d yes some islamic charities include alrashid trust alakhtar trust idara khidmatekhalq also madrassas support some of these groups both sunni and shia with extremist views support these groups f the hostile third country intelligence services in pakistan include russia iran cuba and china there is corroborated information at this time to suggest that these intelligence services are directly targeting us interests in pakistan or are engaged in antiamerican terrorist acts g the availability of weapons and explosives is high in the nwfp and fata as well in neighboring afghanistan with the border area being so porous on routine basis pakistani security forces and police are uncovering sizeable numbers of weapons and explosives from suspected terrorist locations throught downtown peshawar fata and the nwfp 8 u point of contact of contact for this information rso peshawar david j hazarian
