order code rl34772 proposals to merge the forest service and the bureau of land management issues and approaches may 5 2008 ross w gorte specialist in natural resources policy resources science and industry divisionproposals to merge the forest service and the bureau of land management issues and approaches summary the forest service fs in the department of agriculture and the bureau of land management blm in the department of the interior are both directed to manage lands for multiple uses and sustained yields but their unique histories have led to different laws regula tions practices and procedur in managing resources the similar missions and neighboring and inte rmingled lands in separate cabinet departments have d to frequent proposals dating back to 1911 to transfer one agency to the other department or to consolidate them into one agency proponents and critics c ite various benefits and problems to transfer or merger of the agencies general questions over th nature of the change which agency if either would remain and in which department would affect the ramifications of transfer or merger commonly cited benefits of merger are possibly improved service to users and the public and greater efficiency in fede ral land management however such benefits are likely only if the legal authorities governing blm and fs management and planning were consolidated and this c ould be daunting challenge furthermore institutional differences congressional committee jurisdictions and compensation to state and local governments for the taxexempt status of federal lands would complicate merger in some locations the agencies are implementing service first program of joint facilities and cooperative management efforts as step toward more efficient federal land management the possibility of merging the blm and fs has arisen most recently because of concerns that high and growing expenditu res on wildfire suppression are affecting other land and resource management activities distinct combined federal fire suppression agency separate from both the fs and the blm would reduce the impact of wildfire costs on blm and fs budgets but wildfire is integral to most wildland ecosystems and parate fire agency would likely emphasize suppression rather than management to reduce wildfire damages this report is an update of outofprint crs report 951117 the forest

administer bout 95 of the pproximately 653 million acres of federal land in the united states the forest service fs in the department of agriculture usda and the bureau of land management blm national park service and fish and wildlife service in the department of the interior doi1 these agencies manage the federal lands for variety of purposes related to preserving conserving and veloping natural resources each agency has specific statutory mandates and re sponsibilities for the lands it administers see appendix for historical back ground on the agencies the fs and blm are both directed to manage their lands for multiple uses and for sustained yields of resource output s without impairing resource productivity both agencies sell timber permit or lease lands for livestock grazing allow mineral exploration and development in many ar eas protect watersheds manage wildlife habitats administer recrea tion uses and preserve wilderness areas although they often have different rules and regulations governing these activities the similarity of their missions the proximity of many of their lands and offices and the existence of only one major federal re source land manager outside of doi the fs have led to frequent proposals to transfer fs lands to doi and to merge the blm and fs see appendix b for chronological descri ption of these proposals the possibility of transferring the fs to doi andor merging the fs and blm has gained some congressional attention at an oversight hearing on wildfire suppression costs on february 12 2008 veral members of the house committee on appropriations subcommittee on interior environment and related agencies questioned whether reorganizing the wild fire and land manage ment responsibilities might be more costeffective the subcommittee also has asked the government accountability office gao to assess the be nefits and limitations of consolidating the fs in doi news stories and other public commentaries have since raised the possibility of merger2 in addition some assert that wildfire suppression has become such an overwhelming influence that the agencies are longer effective atcrs2 3 see randal otoole reforming the

the fs and the blm and assesses the ramifications of separate us fire service appendixes provide historical background on the two agencies and on historical transfer and merger proposals the fs and blm have similar manageme nt responsibilities and many issues affect both agencies lands however each agency also has unique emphases and functions for instance most federal rang elands are administered by the blm and the blm oversees mineral development on all federal lands most federal forests are managed by the fs and only the fs has pr ograms to assist nonfederal landowners also development of the two agencies has differed and hist orically they have focused on different issues nonetheless there are also many management parallels the lands are often intermingled and the agencies sometimes have offices in the same towns these factors have led to sporadic discussions of consolidating the agencies transfer or merger options and consequences the historical efforts to move one of the agencies and possibly to merge the fs and blm suggest that numerous possibilities exist the simplest option would be to expand efforts to increase the number of offices and employees shared by the two agencies the agencies as authorized in 331 of th fy1998 interior appropriations act pl 10583 and subsequently exte nded have initiated cooperative program known as service first it allows pilot sts of joint permitting and leasing programs reciprocal delegations of duties and re sponsibilities eg having blm employee conduct the cultural resource assessment for an fs timber sale and colocating facilities one advantage of this idea is that it is currently feasible new law would be required to implement th option although its authorization would need to be extended beyond fy2008 and legislative s upport or direction could expand the program another advantage is its simp licity for users one office and one person onestop shopping for dealing with gr azing or recreation permits regardless of the history of the lands however havi ng individuals imple menting two different sets of laws depending on th history of the land could so confuse users and would likely make the job more complex for empl oyees for example rancher with both blm and fs grazing permits could meet with one range conservationist but have different laws applied to the different permits it could also increase contractual difficulties and litigation if for example blm grazing regulations were unintentionally applied to national forest grazing permit agency transfers fs to doi or blm to usda have been proposed in the past such transfer would presumably place both agencies under the purview of single deputy or under secretary of agri culture or of interior the principal advantage of transfer would likely be greater interagency coordination andcrs3 4 us dept of agriculture fy 2009 budget summary and annual performance plan washington dc 2008 pp 89 93 5 this includes wildfire

o1consistency in annual pla nning and budgeting and in implementing common laws and regulations eg the healthy forests restorati on act and the federal lands recreation enhancement act however ch transfer could only be effected by enacting law making the transfer congressional committee jurisdictions could remain unaffected by transfer jurisdicti on over fs lands and programs is already split between the agriculture and natura l resources committees and fs funding is under the jurisdiction of the appropriations subcommittees on interior environment and related agencies however the depa rtments might be less sanguine about the possible loss of major agency the fs accounted for 6 of the fy2007 usda budget authority 57 billion out of 936 billion and 36 of fy2007 usda staff years 33912 out of 948184 the blm accounted for 14 of the fy2007 doi budget authority 23 billion out of 158 billion and 16 of fy2007 doi staff years 10577 out of 674295 presuming that transfer would entail change in the legal mandates for administering the nds such transfer would probably have relatively limited impact on land management or users except through increased interagency coordina tion and consistency howeve r whether or not the legal mandates are retained consolidated or merged and simplified is critical issue discussed below merging the agencies has also b een proposed several times see appendix b the consequences of merger depend partly on the nature of the merger would the fs and blm both be merged into new agency or would one agency be absorbed by the other would the merged agency be in doi or in usda or would it be in new cabinet departme nt possibly with energy and or environmental agencies because the ramifications of merger would be more significant than transfer or some joint operations the rest of this section discusses the possible impacts of merger on users on the agencies on the federal budget and on political structures service to the public merger of the fs and the blm possibly could improve the quality of the agencies performance the existence of two agencies each managing federal lands for multiple uses has been regarded by some as inefficient and duplicative two agencies with two sets of laws policies and regulations are seen as leading to public confusion and poor service differences be tween the agencies ar especially graphic when they promulgate different regulati ons under one law that applies to both such as the federal lands recreation enhancement act or the healthy forests restoration act merging the agencies would likely lead to common set of laws policies and regulations that might enhance service and reduce duplication or at least the appearance of duplication for certain resources leasable and locatable minerals merger seems likely to at least improve consistency in management decisions blm currentlycrs4 6 see for example jonathan halls organ izational environment does it prevent or promote innovation at h ttpwwwicecrea tivitycomleadinginnoorgenvironmenthtmadministers the mineral activities on all federal lands including the national forests fs responsibility in minerals management is limited to administering access and surface land use merger would eliminat the current situation in which two different agencies manage different asp ects of the same resource on the national forests finally merger proponents have asserted that consolidating federal multipleuse land management in one agency could lead to greater focus and higher priority for land and resource management such an agency would have more comprehensive authority and responsibility nd its proponents have argued that this would lead to more effective control and more consistent direction according to merger supporters concentrating fede ral multipleuse land management in one agency would lead to formulation and implementation of more comprehensive effective national natural resources policy improvements in public service and re source management have long been argued to be the principal benefits of ch merger this has been principal motivation behind the service first initiativ described above on the other hand some of the benefits of coordinated service and mana gement efforts clearly do not require agency merger since these benef its are already occurri ng without merger it is unclear how many dditional benefits c ould result from expanding the service first initiative and how many further benefits could only result from merger opponents however might maintain that merger could reduce agency responsivene ss to public concerns merger would create larger agency this could arguably stifle creativity and policy debates because larger organization typically establish uniform standardized policies that inhibit individual worker responsibility and creativity6 critics argue that the agencies are already unresponsive to public interests and that merger would create larger and even less responsive bureaucracy furthermore it is argued that the ag encies should focus their efforts on improving management and public service within their current structures rather than waste time trying to design the perfect bureaucracy institutional effects the nature of the potential merger has particularly important ramifications for the institutions and employees the fs may well dominate combined agency since it has more than three times as many employees as the blm 33912 to 10577 in fy2007 and more than double the budget 572 billion to 227 billion in fy2007 the fs administers more land in calif ornia colorado idaho montana and washington while the blm manages more land in alaska nevada new mexico utah and wyoming in arizona and oreg on the acres managed by each agency are about the same in the great plains and eastward the fs is clearly dominant furthermore the fs was traditionally seen as more active land manager because timber management was more active the fs initiates timber sales than was minerals management the blm typica lly responds to claim or l ease activities this maycrs5 7 see herbert kaufman the forest ranger study in administrative behavior resources for the

salvo new name and mission for the blmhave changed in the past decade with the decline in timber sales and increased emphasis on energy produc tion from federal lands the fs also historically had vibrant esprit corps 7 however the fs image has been tarnished by internal conflicts best illustrated by the creation of the independent association of forest service employees fo r environmental ethics in 1989 the successor organization forest service employees for environmental ethics fseee representin g only current and retired fs employees is an active litigant on fs policies and programs sugges ting continuing internal dispute about appropriate nati onal forest management furthe rmore various observers have questioned whether the steep decline in fs timber sales has undercut agency support with the wood products i ndustry and on capitol hill8 the blms history contrasts with this pattern two observe rs have stated9 the bureau of land management blm does not get much respect unfortunately the blm was not nickna med the bureau of large mistakes bureau of livestock and mining nd bureau of lumbering and mining without justification it still shows its parentage as either partner or handmaiden to exploiter interests the blm started from 1 the demise of the us grazing service at the hands of the ranchers and their congressional allies10 and 2 the nonmanagerial public domain overseer the general land office building coherent effective agency from such beginnings would have been di fficult challenge at best nonetheless critics recognize that the blm has built an effective organization for its role as federal land manager11 blmfs merger might disrupt programs offsetting the possibly enhanced services discussed above in the short run employees would need to learn the new laws regulations and policies as well as new operating procedures and practices if the blm were merged into the fs blm em ployees would have to learn fs laws regulations policies procedur and practices the revers would be true if the fs were merged into the blm and if new agency were created everybody would have to learn the new laws regulations policies procedur and practices merger could lead to internal conflicts between previouslyfs and previouslyblm staff because of differing views over federal polic ies and obligations with respect to users however the agencies have become less disparate over time probably making merger less disruptive today than it might have been decades agocrs6 12 tom fryers work identity and health clinical practice and epidemiology in mental

identity since many workers sense of worth is linked to their organizations12 retirements transfers reassignments job losses and the like might result from merger as the postmerger employees may not match the postmerger agency requirements such actions could exacerbate the possible morale problems13 alternatively creating new agency may offer new opportunities for agency employees to help shape the future of natural resource management retirement of longterm employees that help maintain traditional agency cultures could allow newer younger employees often with di fferent education and experience greater prospects for creating new future new agency with revised legal authorities and guidance as discussed below might provide chance to blend differences into coherent cohesive orga nization with common vision of the future fiscal impacts reducing costs by eliminating duplicative personnel and offices is one of the primary benefits cited in most merger proposals the carter administration had estimated the benefits of its department of natura l resources proposal at 100 million annually but did not provide deta ils about how these savings would be achieved14 in 1984 the general accounting ffice now government accountab ility office reported that 64 locations had both blm and fs offices and estimated that combining these offices could save 335 million nnually15 inflation over the intervening years would likely lead to high er estimates today lthough some of those savings might already have been ach ieved under the service first initiative another benefit commonly cited by proponents is the creation of more efficient and effective structure for managi ng federal lands and resources by merging duplicative efforts the two agencies have nearly identical missions each inventories its lands and resources plan s and then acts to provide for use and protection of the lands and re sources and monitors the c onsequences of actions and uses especially in areas with intermin gled adjoining or neighboring lands these functions arguably could be more efficien tly conducted by larger single entity than by separate agencies merger could lead to some higher costs at least in the shortterm there would be implementation costs associated with changing signs logos letterheadcrs7 16 see for example lester c thurow the zerosum society distribution and the

row 1982 360 p 17 us dept of agriculture forest service the principal laws relating to forest service activities washington dc gpouniforms and the like creating new agency would have greater shortterm implementation costs than moving one agen cy into the other there may be some personnel and planning cost s from eliminating redundant positions and from the transfers necessary to have the right people in the right locations buildings and other facilities and equipment might be redundant and need to be sold which would generate revenues but mig ht require expenditures to be prepared for sale others argue that reducing duplication does not necessarily lead to greater efficiency duplication may appear cos tly but both economic theory and business practice suggest that the competition drives efficiency16 this explains why firms develop several products for the same market to compete internally as well as against other firms if blmfs merger reduced duplication it also might eliminate the potential competition that could be used to improve efficiency this presumes of course that the agencies feel that they are competing against each other and that analysts external and internal compare different agency practices and procedures to assess their relative effici ency and propose improvements legal and political considerations numerous legal and political ramifications could complicate blmfs merger these considerations include consolida ting the laws congressional jurisdictions agency structures and compensation for th taxexempt status of federal lands consolidating the laws merging the fs and the blm would probably provide few benefits if the combined agency continued to administer two different sets of laws applying to different of ten adjacent landholdings thus an agency merger necessarily raises the question of consolidating the legal authorities for the agencies merging fs and blm legal authorities could be difficult task the public land law review commission took six years to complete its review producing its recommendations in 342page volum plus 39 separatelybound background documents and it only addressed the pub lic domain lands the fs publishes volume with

recreation management area and scenic recreation area19 plus few more congressionally designated areas not listed in the agencys lands report20 consolidation of federal land law could result in tw possible outcomes one is that existing laws could be largely retained extended to the additional lands and where duplicative or contradict ory revised to provide consis tent direction the result would likely be tome on federal multipleuse laws larger than the current fs volume alternatively federal multipleuse land law could be completely revised to simplify management guidance that has evolved piecemeal over century or more for the two existing agencies the latter might be more difficult task as simpler legislative direction often yields greater agency discretion which could lead to more objections and disputes among interest groups differences in federal water rights between the national forests and the blms public lands would further complicate merg er federal reserved water rights are associated with reserves such as the nati onal forests dating from the creation of the reservation21 in contrast blm often does not ve federal reserved water rights because the lands were never reserved presuming that merger would retain such historical reservations issues regarding federal reserved wate r rights on which lands they exist and with what priority dates could complicate any blmfs merger proposal or subsequent merged agency management congressional jurisdictions congressional jurisd ictional issues could complicate merging the fs and blm legal authorities the natural resources committees have jurisdiction over the blm and the public lands and over the forest reservesnational forests created from the public domain however the agriculture committees have jurisdiction over acquired forest lands and over forest management generally as well as over forestry ssistance and forest research which committees gets jurisdiction over particular bill depends in large measure on how the bill is drafted is it public lands legislation or fo rest management b ill furthermore the referrals are not always consistent for example the secure rural schools and community selfdetermina tion act of 2000 hr 2389 pl 106393crs9 22 the regions are numbered 1 through 10 but region 7 was terminated in 1966 with the forests being reorganized between regions 8 and 9was reported by the house agriculture committee and discharged from the house resources committee before passage but was not even referred to the senate agriculture committee an agency transfer does not necessitate change in congressional jurisdiction and committee jurisdictions can change without any change in the structure of the executive branch the thenpublic lands committees retained jurisdiction over the forest reserves after they were transferre d to usda to create the fs jurisdiction over fs funding was transferred fro m the appropriations subcommittee on agriculture to the subcommittee on interior and related agencies now interior environment and related agencies in 1955 with members including the speaker of the house noting that the change wa s for the convenience of congress and was not intended to suggest an executive restructuring however an agency merger would be more significant than transfer and keeping committee jurisdictions distinct could be difficult at minimum both the agriculture and natural resources committees would be involved in any modification of fs andor blm authorizations to effect merger agency structure not surprisingly since they were created at different times by different people the fs and the blm are organized differently the fs is organized around the 156 national forests as proclaimed by the various presidents and modified for administrative simplicity each forest has one to seven or more ranger districts administered by district ranger for implementing activities on the ground the national forests administered by forest supervisors are organized into nine regional offices22 two regions are composed substantially or entirely of the forests in one state region 5 california and hawaii and region 10 alaska two more are substantially composed of the forests in two states region 3 arizona and new mexico nd region 6 washington and oregon in addition two states are divided between regions idaho in region 1 and region 4 and wyoming in region 2 and region 4 in contrast blm is organized into 12 st ate offices blm lands in the state of washington are administered by the oregon state office blm lands and federal minerals in the other 38 states are administered by single eastern states office blm lands are organized into resource ar eas administered by field offices some field offices in arizona idaho and oregon report to district offices which report to the blm state offices other field offices in colo rado montana nevada utah and wyoming report directly to the state office in the other states alaska california and new mexico some field offices report directly to the state office and others report to dist rict office that reports to the state office the statebased blm organizational stru cture has provided the agency with simple and direct means of responding to and working with governors and state congressional delegations this has probably made the blm more sensitive to state level issues than the fs but this could be at the cost of relatively less sensitivity to local and national issues merger likely would lead to consistent regional andcrs10 23 act of may 23 1908 16 usc 500 24 see crs report

grant see appendix for more detailslocal organizational structure but it is uncl ear what that structure would be and the choice of structure and the terminology fo r the units and administrators could have significant effect on the effectiveness of the postmerger agency compensation for taxexempt federal lands federal lands are exempt from taxation by state and local gove rnments if the lands were privately owned the landowners would pa various types of taxes sales property income severance yield or other taxes to stat and local governments depending on the state and local tax structures the federal government however is exempt from such taxation variety of programs have been enacted to compensate units of government primarily counties for taxexempt fe deral lands the oldest compensation program is the fs payment of 25 of gross receipts from timber sales and other revenue sources to the states for use on roads and schools in the counties where the national forests are located23 this program was temporarily fy2001fy2006 replaced by the secure rural schools nd community selfdetermination act of 2000 pl 106393 at the discretion of each county24 the program expired at the end of fy2006 but one additional years payments were enacted in the fy2007 emergency appropriations act pl 11028 and possible reauthorization continues to be debated if the program expires payments return the 1908 formula of 25 of gross receipts because the pl 106393 pr ogram was based on historical payments the decline from returning to 25 of receipts will likely vary widely other compensation programs vary wi dely depending on the history and location of the lands the source of the receipts and the specific legal authority involved25 for example states and counties get 50 of mineral receipts from public domain lands except in alaska which receives 90 but only 4 of land and materials receipts eg land or timber sales and 12½ of grazing receipts within grazing districts 3 lands under the taylor grazing act and 50 of grazing receipts outside grazing districts 15 lands except in alaska which receives 100 of grazing receipts in excess of administrativ costs the counties are allocated 75 of receipts from the oc lands26 except that up to third is used by the blm for roads and reforestation so the counties actually get 50 of receipts except that the oc counties received payments under the secure rural schools and community selfdetermination act of 2000 for fy2001fy2007 the counties containing the coos bay wagon road lands similarly are allocated 75 with thirdcrs11 27

or ders comptroller generals decision and doi solicitors opinion states and counties containing bureau of reclamation lands and the na val petroleum and oil shale reserve get payments several other special land desi gnations eg state select ed lands except alaska coos bay wagon road lands town sites on recl amation lands south half of red river oklahoma and more provide varying pa yments generally ranging from 050 of receipts in addition to these mandatory spendi ng compensation programs for specific lands congress enacted the payments in lieu of taxes pilt act27 to compensate counties for most taxexempt federal lands pilt paymen ts to counties are based on complicated formula basically based on the acreage of entitlement lands in the county most but not all federal lands and annually inflationadjusted peracre payments but limited by county population and reduced by payments under many other county compensation programs suc h as fs 25 receiptsharing oc 50 receiptsharing and secure rural schools payments28 however pilt requires annual appropriations for the program since pilt appr opriations have been less than the calculated total payments in r ecent years counties have been receiving proportionally less than th calculated payments in theory few object to fair and cons istent compensation to state and local governments for the taxexempt status of federal lands the political difficulty lies in determining what is fair and consiste nt consistent could have two different meanings in this context to some it would mean guaranteed payments mandatory spending rega rdless of federal budget di fficulties or appropriations shortfalls this has been sought in reauthorizing the secure rural schools legislation but is difficult because the budget act requires bills with mandatory spending to be offset with additional revenues or reductions in other mandatory spending neither has been found in the ong oing reauthorizati on debate and would likely not be any easier for new consis tent compensation program consistent also could mean predictable compensation programs based on receipts can cause annual payments to fluctuate widely plus or minus 50 from year to year is not unheard of for fs payments some have proposed basing payments on 5 or 10 year rolling average of receipts to moderate payment fluctuations such change in approach would likely be easier to enact than mandatory spending fair compensation is difficult to determine because different states and local governments rely on different funding m echanisms sales taxes based on gross receipts property taxes based on land values income taxes based on net receipts and more choosing any one compensation system would be inherently unfair to some jurisdictions because it would lik ely under or overcompensate compared to taxation of private landowners similarly choosing any one rate be it fixedcrs12 29 see crs report rl33990 wildfire funding by ross w gorteamount per acre like pilt or fixed rate per unit of value would also be unfair to some jurisdictions because tax rates differ if for example the citizens of michigan willingly tax their own properties at higher rate than the citizens of oregon should they not also be compensate d at higher rate for the taxexempt federal lands in their state an agency merger could be effected without modifying the current complex systems for compensating state and local governments for the taxexempt status of federal lands given the political difficulties in determining fair and consistent compensation trying to rationalize the compensation system effectively might prevent merger from occurring howeve r revising the laws guiding federal multipleuse resource manageme nt would be an opportunity to consider revising the laws

since 2000 have led some to consider whether separate independe nt wildland fire management agency might be more efficient and effective for wildfire tasks while leaving the fs and blm to their traditional multipleuse resource management roles total fs and doi appropriations for w ildland fire management have averaged 310 billion annually since fy2003 with th highest appropriations ever 355 billion for fy200829 this is substantial rise from the 109 billion averaged annually for fy1994fy1999 also the share of the total budget allo cated to wildfire management has increased substantially for fy1994fy2000 wildfire suppression accounted for 31 of fs discretionary funding since fy2001 fire suppression costs have accounted for 44 of fs discre tionary funding rising to 48 in fy2007 more importantly rising wildfire s uppression costs are affecting other fs programs both agencies have the disc retion to borrow unobligated funds from other accounts for emergency wildfire suppression ex penditures this effectively provides them with openended appropriation reprogramming authority for limited purposes before fy2000 such borrowing authority had little impact on fs programs the blm can borrow from any doi accounts while fire was 42 of blm discretionary appropriations in fy2007 it was only 5 of total doi disc retionary funding thus borrowing has had and still has relatively minor impacts on doi programs the fs situation is different histor ically the fs borrowed funds primarily from its mandatory spending accounts par ticularly the knutsonvandenberg kv fund this account accumulated deposits from timber purchasers to reforest and otherwise improve timber in timber sale areas because of the lag between timber payments and reforestation the kv f und often had balan ce of about 500 million more than enough to borrow for emer gency fire suppression without impinging on one seasons tree planting efforts however since fy2000 emergency wildfirecrs13 suppression costs have risen while the k v fund is much smaller because of much lower timber sales since 1990 thus the fs has had to borrow funds from other fs accounts land and easement purchases r ecreation and wildlife management and more these rising borrowings even wh repaid in subsequent supplemental or interior appropriations acts affect pr ogram implementation because they create uncertainty in the availab ility of funds hence legi slation to in sulate agency appropriations from emergency fire suppre ssion funding has been introduced in the 110th congress eg hr 5541 hr 5648 s 1770 some suggest that the fire suppression funding issue is sufficiently severe to warrant separate agency for wildfire management they maintain that this would allow the fs and blm to focus on res ource management and prevent wildfire emergencies from infringing on funding for other programs in sense doi has taken step in this direction in hi s fy2009 budget request the president proposed moving wildland fire management funding from the blm budget to doi departmentwide programs this reflects the current s ituation where about 40 of blm wildfire funding is transferred to ot her doi agencies national park service fish and wildlife service and bureau of indian affairs and would help blm to preserve funding for other programs ch shift separating the funding without separating the program is less feasible for the fs separate federal wildfire agency c ould have some significant drawbacks most important separating fire management from nd and resource management would make coordinating w ildfire with the resources that depend on fire more difficult wildfire is an integral element in most temperate ecosystems some resources eg certain plant and animal species rely on wildfire and burned areas for regeneration and habitat in addition wildfire agency would likely focus on fire control largely because acres burned are the most readily measureable performance standard and because actively burning w ildfires draw congre ssional public and media attention wildfire management activities that s eek to reduce damages such as protecting individual structures and re ducing biomass fuels are less likely to be emphasized by wildfire suppression agency the fs and blm have been responding to wildfire ecological and cost concerns by developing appropriate management response and wildland fire use practices appropriate management re sponse is an approach that treats each wildfire individually using broad array of tactical responses from monitoring fire behavior and progress to aggressive s uppression efforts considering the wildfires threat to lives and property and the management go als for the area wildland fire use is managing naturally occurring wildfires within predetermined areas to provide resource benefits and reduce suppression costs while assuring minimal threats to people and property summary and observations the forest service fs in the us partment of agriculture usda and the bureau of land management blm in the partment of the interior doi are both directed to manage their lands for multiple uses and for sustained yields of resourcecrs14 outputs without impairing resource productiv ity both agencies sell timber permit or lease lands for livestock grazing allow mineral exploration and development in many areas protect watersheds manage w ildlife habitats administer recreation uses and preserve wilderness areas although they have diffe rent rules and regulations governing these activities the similarity of missions the proximity of lands and offices and their existence in separate cabinet departments have led to frequent proposals to transfer one agency to the ot her department andor to merge the blm and the fs the fs was created in 1905 when cong ress transferred the forest reserves renamed national forests in 1907 from doi to usda and merged the forestry division of dois general land office with usdas larger bureau of forestry the blm was created in 1946 by merger of the doi grazing service and the general land office despite the similarity of their missions the agencies have developed independently because of their substan tially different creations and evolution proposals to transfer the fs to doi or the blm to usda or to merge the fs and blm or its pr edecessor date back to 1911 and have been made under presidents taft harding hoover roos evelt truman eisenhower nixon carter and clinton in an attempt to improve ad ministration of the fe deral lands president reagan proposed an substantial exchange consolidation of lands and personnel between the agencies but even this more limited reorganization was prevented by congress proponents and critics ve cited various be nefits and problems associated with transferring the agencies or merging the blm and the fs general questions involve the nature of the merger would one ag ency absorb the other or would new agency be created would the agency be in usda doi or new department or possibly be an independent agency answers to these questions affect the likely consequences of merger improved service to the public has been touted as reason for merging the agencies proponents argue that single federal multipleuse resource agency could provide uniform practices and procedures reduce public confusion and establish comprehensive federal natural resources policy critics c ounter that merger could stifle creativity and public policy debates by creatin g larger less responsive bureaucracy merger would necessarily have substantial effects on the institutions the fs might well dominate since it has three times as many employees and three times as large budget while administering nearly as much land outside alaska the fs was historically perceived to be more active manager with greater espirit corps because it initiates timber activities where the blm often responds to minerals activities initiated by others however the blm has been improving in these areas while the fs image has become tarnished by internal conflict furthermore the decline in timber sales and increased emphasis on energy production from federal lands in the past decade has brought the management styles of the two agencies closer together thus merger might be less disruptive than it might have been few decades ago however the necessary transfers and adjustments might disrupt programs and hurt employee mo rale while varying practi ces and procedures couldcrs15 prove difficult to merge on the other hand new agency could offer an opportunity for employees to help shape the future of federal natural res ources management and policy lower costs are commonly cited as reasons for merger costs would allegedly be reduced by eliminating duplicative pe rsonnel and offices leading to greater management efficiency however there would be shortterm implementation costs for altering signs and letterheads for transferring people to where they are needed and more furthermore economic theo ry and business practice suggest that competition drives efficiency eliminatin g duplication might also eliminate the potential efficiencyproducing interagenc competition assuming the agencies and analysts compared agency practices to unc over efficiencies in addition the agencies may already be achieving some of these efficiencies through the service first initiative merger would probably provide limited benefits if the legal authorities governing fs and blm management and pla nning were not also merged however merger of legal authorities could be difficult the plethora of laws and regulations governing agency processes and practices w ould have to be consolidated the laws could be extended to add itional areas with modifica tions to eliminate redundancy and contradictions or coul d be simplified to provide direct coordinated legal guidance to replace the incremental legislative direction of the past century the former would likely be easier the latter would be shorter and clearer but probably more difficult to achieve because of cerns among the various interest groups federal reserved water rights for some areas could complicate the legal consolidation jurisdictional issues within congress the natural resources committees have had jurisdiction over the blm and public lands but the agriculture committees have been the principal actors in fs and nati onal forest issues could complicate the issue differing agency organizational st ructures with the key fs organization by national forests and the blm largely st ructured around state offices could also constrain consolidation finally the comple x array of programs to compensate state and local governments for the taxexempt st atus of federal lands might impede efforts to create one consistent federal multipleuse resource management agency recent questions about possi ble merger have been raised because of concerns that wildfire suppression costs are impedin g federal multipleuse management one newly suggested option would be creating parate federal wildfire agency from the wildland fire management organizations within the fs and the blm this would allow the agencies to refocus management efforts on nonfire activities and would insulate program budgets from emergenc borrowing to suppress wildfires however it would also sepa rate wildfire management from other land and resource management even though wildfire is integr to most temperate ecosystems the agencies are responding to cost and ecolo gical concerns by veloping appropriate management responses

was upgraded to the bureau of forestry in 1901 forest reserves in 1891 congress granted the president the authority to establish forest reserves from th existing public domain lands under doi

timber sales were made in 1898 gifford pinchot became chief of the usda division of forestry he argued that usdas forestry expertise warra nted control over the forest reserves but instead was directed to consult with the doi division of forestry however pinchots influence on federal forestry increased when his close personal friend theodore roosevelt became the us pr esident in 1901 it

seen as precurs or to transferring the agency35 senate interior appropriations subcommittee chair carl hayden opened the 1955 hearings on the fs budget by noting that the fs transfer from the agriculture to the interior subcommittee in the senate was simply following the jurisdiction realignment in the house and was not intended to suggest an agency transfer national forest management in

administration of the public rangela nds was subject to substantial debate some felt that the fs should oversee the nds as it had relatively extensive staff and had shown capacity for administering ra

strength of the ranching i ndustry and lack of support for the services conservation efforts50 others maintained that agency efforts to allocate grazing permits and raise grazing fees led to

of agriculture this proposal was only offered afte r an attempt to transfer the public domain land to the states was widely rejected and president hoover had been defeated in his reelection bid however this attempt to reorga nize federal land ma nagement and other reorganization recommendations was di sapproved by hres 350 on january 19 1933 roosevelt administration transfer of the fs to doi was debated for several years under president franklin roosevelt doi secretary harold ickes was at the center of the controversy that bega n in 1933 with the transfer of 16 national monuments from the fs to the national park service fs concerns were exacerbated in 1934 when the natural resources board chaired by ickes recommended creating additional national park system units from existing national forest lands69 in 1936 the brownlow committee on executive reor ganization recommended transferring the fs to interior however the open dispute between ickes and the fs delayed action and events leading to world war ii distracted the president from internal affairs in addition bills to establish department of conserva tion and works using doi and the fs as foundation were introdu ced in the senate in 1935 and in the house in 1936 the senate passed its bill on may 13 1936 but not until it had been amended to only change the name of the in terior department to the department of conservation the house bill was repor ted by the public lands committee on march 9 1936 but objections were raised and it did not come to floor vote truman administration in 1947 during the truman

advisory committee on government organization conc urred with the hoover commission recommendation for combining forest and range management in the department of agriculture72 the committee asserted that this transfer could be done without separate legislation under thenexisting reorganization authority but that the proposal would be highly controversial the senate committee on interior and insular affairs and house committee on government operations held joint hearings in november 1955 and february 1956 the former issued report recommending consolidation of all federal forestry functions within the fs73 following responses to the committee recommendations on federal timber sale policies the senate interior committee issued report in 1958 reconfirming its recommendation for consolidating federal forestry within the fs74 we recommend the consolidation in the fore st service of the forestry functions and the surface resource management responsibilities for commercial forest land under the jurisdiction of the bureau of land management and the bureau of indian affairs doi and the bureau of the budget predecessor to the office of management and budget opposed the recommendation in letter to the co mmittee chairman75 despite this opposition president eisenhower proposed reorganization plan 1 of 1959 to transfer certain doi functions specifically responsibilities with respect to certain land or timber exchanges and nd sales and the use and disposal of mineral materials to the secretary of agriculture upon further study however the president decided not to transmit the reorganization plan to congress because of differing agriculture and interior timber sale practices and the possibility for disrupting the timber sales programs senate interior committee chairman james murray concurred with the presidents deci sion but suggested that the problem was from not following the committees recommendations76 mr president the administration

letter to the president known as the treaty of the potomac proposing greater cooperation and an end to proposals to transfer lands among agencies77 nonetheless in 1964 congress established the public land law review commission to review management of the remaining public domain lands administered by the blm the commission submitted its report to president nixon and to congress in june 197078 one recommendation was to transfer the fs to doi to be renamed the department of natural resources the similar land uses and management objectives for the blm and fs were cited as supporting rationale but merger of these two agencies was not explicitly proposed legislative proposals were presen ted to effect this recommendation nixon administration while the public land law review commission was completing its report president nixons advisory council on executive organization under roy ash considered two options establishing department of environment and natural res ources denr or depar tment of natural resources dnr79 these would have created cabine tlevel department combining the fs the soil conservation service and certain other usda functions all doi agencies certain functions of the army corps of engineers the national oceanic and atmospheric administration of the depar tment of commerce and other agencies the proposed denr would also have in cluded the 44 federal agencies involved in monitoring research standardsetting and enforcement of pollution abatement programs the dnr proposal with separa environmental protection agency for the pollution functions was considered fallback position from the full denr proposal80 president nixon issued reorganization plan 3 in 1970 which established the environmen tal protection agency and in march 1971 presented his dnr proposal to congress and the public81 several bills were introduced in the 92nd congress to establish department of natural resources or natural resources and environment the house committee on government operations and senate committee on government affairs held hearings on the proposals problems of di srupting agency operations and pros and cons of disrupting current interest groupag ency relationships were discussed by the witnesses it was variously argued that dnr could facilitate the implementation of national policies but might stifle national discussions of policies by keeping the

june 1973 during the 93rd congress president nixon presented revised reorganization proposal with department of energy and natural resources howev er the natural resources portion of the revised proposal was substantially the same as the previous proposal legislation was introduced but bills that would establish new department with natural resource focus were reported by committee in the 93rd congress in 1976 congress moved away from merging the blm and fs by enacting flpma and nfma separate major management laws for the two agencies signed into law on consecutive days congress explicitly retained and amended the separate management functions of the blm in flpma while much of the guidance for multipleuse sustainedyield management in flpma was based on fs experience with the laws governing the national forests substantial differences were enacted for blm management of the public lands carter administration president carter established comprehensive government reorganization project soon after he came to office and one study centered on restructuring federal manageme nt of natural resources on march 1 1979 president carter announced reorgani zation plan to create department of natural resources from the existing doi plus the usda fs and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration from the department of commerce the fs blm and the conservation division of the us geological survey were to be combined into national forest and land administration this reorganization was proposed under th authority of the reorganization act of 1946 which delegated certain restructur ing authority to the president and was thus deemed not to require legislation however members of congress objected arguing that the proposal exceeded presid ential authority the substance of the reorganization also raised congressional c oncerns both the house and the senate agriculture committees held hearings on president carters reorganization plan many points supporting and opposing the reor ganization were raised but recurrent theme was the potential dilution andor degradation of fs expertise and professionalism if the agency were to be merged with the blm whose smaller staff managed more acreage the substan tial congressional op position and other legislative priorities led carter to withdraw the dnr proposal before any substantive congressional action had occurred82 reagan administration on january 30 1985 the reagan administration announced pr oposal to exchange certain federal lands between the fs and blm this proposal did not involve merger of the two agencies as did the previous reorganizations instead it was considered land consolidation with more than 25crs29 83 it appears that such land consolidationre organization had not been suggested
