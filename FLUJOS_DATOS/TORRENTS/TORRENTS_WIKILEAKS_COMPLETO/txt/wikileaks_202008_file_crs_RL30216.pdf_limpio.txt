sbir program summary congress has demonstrated an ongoing interest in the small business sector addressing issues related to economic growth and competitiveness specia l consideration has been given to small high tech firms for several reasons includin g data that indicate such companies tend to be highly innovative play an important role in technol ogical advancement and contribute to the high standard of living in th united states such was the rationale behind legislation creating the small business innovation research sbir program an effor t to increase that portion of the federal research and development rd budget provided to small enterprises for wor k associated with the mission respo nsibilities of government departments and agencies this activity is due to sunset on october 1 2000 technological advancement is key element of economic growth entrepreneurial sm all firms often are important to technological progress because of their role in the commercialization of rd results they also are instrumental i n allowing economic benefits to remain w ithin region such companies create wealth through value added jobs that are longter m and require highly skilled employees that subsequently generate additional income spen ding and growth as well as more jobs however it appears that the ability of small firms to be innovative varies b industry and is dependent on the relationship between small and large companies in each industrial sector ac cess to information sources also affects the contribution of these small businesses to technological progress despite little or rd smal l firms can generate new products and processes by relying on work performe d elsewhere the importance of shared information is evident in the expansion f cooperative rd among small enterprises and between small and large companies review of legislative initiatives over the past 20 years indicates th implementation of programs and policies to provide both dir ect and indirect

business innovation sbir program introduction congress has demonstrated an ongoing interest in the small business sector there are many reasons for this approach including data indicating that small firm s represent over 99 of all employers and employ 52 of all private workers certain1 studies while the subject of professional disagreement purport to show that thes establishments are responsible for the majority of new jobs created in the unite d states in addition it has als been argued that small businesses are more innovative than large firms such claims have led to various legislative initiatives intended t address the needs of the small business sector among the legislatively mandated activities in this arena is program designed to insure that small high technology firms receive spe cified share of federal research and development rd funding the small business innovation research sbir program requires that each federal department with rd budget of 100 million or more set

entrepreneurial firms and economic growth technological advancement is key element of economic growth expert s widely accept that technical progress is responsible for up to onehalf the growth of the us economy and is one principal driving force for increases in our standard of living historically industrial expansion was based on the use of technology t exploit natural resources and early federal support of those fledgling industries was extensive today such growth tends to be founded on scientific discoveries an d engineering knowledge eg electronics biomedical applications and is even more

growth however there is ongoing debate over the parameters of thi s contribution and the extent to which small companies innovate relative to large r businesses studies supported by several federal

s contribute to the proc ess of economic growth and industrial competitiveness there are experts who subscribe to the idea that most successful innovations are born bred and brought to market entirely within wellestab lished organisations sic mainly large companies two prominent analysts in this area zoltan acs and davi d9 audretsch argue that the relationship between company size and innovation capacity varies by industry they note that the evidence also suggests that there tends to be10 more innovative activity in industries consisting of larger and not smaller firms 11 others maintain that there is conclusive evidence that firm size affects th success of rd 12 what appears t be an important factor affecting the ability of small companies to effect technological advance is the relationship between these firms and larg corporati ons the globalization of the economy has changed the busines s environment such that operating in large foreign markets may be necessary for firms to remain competitive big corporations have an advantage in delivering an d marketing innov ations in the international marketplace while small companies may serve as the source of new products and processes they often cannot tak advantage of their initial technological lead to establish secure foothold in the key markets and they will inevitably be ground down as the technology is diffused and the importance of scale grows 13 to meet the global challenge many large companies are merging with othe r firms and concentrating financial manufacturing and marketing resources at th same time they are decentralizing their research and development activities as well as their manufacturing operations thereby creating external technologica l relationships with suppliers and outsourcing work to small companies large r corporations spend onehalf of each sales dollar on purchases from suppliers often small firms while possibly lacking the critical mass needed to move from hot14 boutique to

standalone businesses per account for most of th us industr ial jobs sales and output per year in and year out in both mature an d hightech sectors 17 however it appears evident that small hightech companies play critical and diverse role in creati ng new products and services in developing new industries and in driving t echnological change and growth in the us economy as concluded by study conducted under the auspices of the national academy of engineering18 the reasons for this include the ability of these firms to rapidly develop markets generate new goods and rvices and offer product diversity small businesses tend to be willing to take technological risks that may not b amenable to large established corporations they also may be in positi on to quickly exploit market opportunities opportunities that may b determined by large companies as result of spinoff from corporate rd or by university research as result small businesses which are often start up firms tend to generate incremental innovations that respond to market needs rather than produce breakthrough innovations that develop entirely ne w markets19 small technicallyorie nted companies are found more commonly and in greater numbers in industries that have fragmented fast growing and technologicall changing markets offer few obstacles to entry and have history and culture f entrepreneurship in addition the availability of v enture capital customer access and developed tech nical and business infrastructure provide an environment conducive to the establishment of such firms thus according to the national academy f20 engineering the specific contr ibutions of small technically oriented companies in an industry depend on the following factors the size of markets current and prospective that make up the industry the degree of technical uncertainty in current or prospective markets the economies of scale and scope in production for market the dominance or lack thereof of larger companies

will explore the reauthorization of the sbi rth program now scheduled to sunset on october 1 2000 future discussion coul d involve identification of program goals and examination of their relevance within the broad context of fede ral efforts to promote technology development the following issues might be reviewed and considered the small business innovation research program was originally mandated t increase the participation of small high technology firms in the federal r d endeavor congressional support was predicated upon several conclusions whil technologybased companies under 500 employees tend to be highly innovative and innovation is essential to the economic wellbeing of the united states sponsors of the original legislation believed these businesses were not receiving sufficient share of government research support it was neces sary therefore to guarantee this sector predet ermined portion of the federal budget to achieve this each applicabl agency was instructed to create an sbir program to ensure expanded research and development fund ing for small businesses and to facilitate commercialization of new products and proc esses by these firms the efforts are financed by mandatory set aside provision considered necessary due to what was viewed as federa l preference for financing rd in large corporations the legislatively mandated goals of the sbir program include stimulation f technological innovation in the small business sector increased use of this community to meet the rd needs of the government and expanded commercialization of the results of federally funded rd these objectives were developed at time whe nhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30216crs9 many of the current government policies and programs to assist small high tec h companies in pursuit of innovation were not available this raises questions as t whether or not the goals of the sbir program remain valid is the rationale behind the effort still sound given other ongoing federal activities should the sbi r program be continued andor expanded should changes be made in the activity to reflect the changes brought abou t by other congressional initiatives in the technology development arena there is agreement among experts that small high tech companies play n important role in innovation and economic growth one issue is whether or not the sbir program as presently constituted contributes to th creation of an environment conducive to the formation and advancement of high value added entrepreneuria l firms as dis cussed previously these types of businesses flourish in areas that have certain char acteristics including knowledge source access to capital skilled labor and critical mass of similar firms that both cooperate and compete federa l initiatives to facilitate technology transfer collaborative rd and technica l assistance as well as to provide matched government funding can be seen s supportive of technology development promoting this environment the smal l business innovation research program offers financial support while the associated small business technology transfer program encourages joint rd activities with government laboratories or universities within the context of ongoing federa l efforts is this sufficient to achieve the programs g oals if not are there changes that can and should be made to build upon other government activities and furthe r strengthen the impact of the sbir program on technological advancement several studi indicate that the ability of small firms to be innovative varies by industry and is dependent on the relationship between small and large firms in each industria l sector thus question may be raised as to whether or not the sbi r activity as it now operates promotes the development of productive interaction s between companies of different sizes is the structure of the agencywide sbir effort reflective of the current knowledge on the interaction between small and large firms in the development of new products and processes and their commercialization and marketing might alterations be made to the current sbir program to augmen t opportunities for increased innovation if this is considered desirable how might it best be achieved rec ognizing that each agency operates an sbir program consistent with its operating procedures and mission requirements legis lation promoting innovation often includes statement of preferentia l consideration for small companies ho wever these laws for the most part also apply to large firm s thus concerns have been expressed as to whether or not thes initiatives provide the small business community with extra assistance or in effec t increase competitive pressures with respect to larger domestic firms if larg companies are also encouraged to undertake research development an d commerci alization of the results questions may be raised as to the role and position of small firms will they be hamper ed in rd activities due to their size and resource constraints in evaluating the possible reauthorization of the sbir program n understanding of the role f small firms in economic growth can provide information on which to decide whether or not continued special conside ration of these companieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30216crs10 is warranted however it remains difficult to determine how current legislativ initiatives affect the competitiveness of small firms both in terms of comparisons to larger companies and in international activities limited measures of innovation and competi tiveness impede assessment of such efforts research and development ar often but two activities in generally long and costly process of bringing product process or service to the marketplace recen t efforts to increase rd in small firms will not nece ssarily show commercial results if any for many years in many cases lag time of 5 to 15 years between idea and marketable good is commonplace although this is beginning to d ecrease and in some cases particularly biotechnology tends to be less while the majori ty of federal programs to facilitate increased private sector investments in rd leading to economic growth were not in existence when the sbir activit was initiated some analysts believe that an assessment of the total environment w ithin which small high tech firms operate might be the most effective means to insure that congressional action achieves its intended objectives
