adjustment under executive order 13282 issued by president bush on december 31 2002 and localitybased comparability payment averaging about 10 of the general schedule payroll under executive order 13291 issued by the president on march 21 2003 the locality pay adjustment is retr oactive to january 2003 the december 31 2002 executive order had frozen the locality based comparability payments at the levels authorized for january 2002 the cost of the combined pay adjustments is about 38 billion dollars although the federal pay adjus tments are sometimes referred to as costofliving adjustments neither the annual adjustment nor the locality payment is based on measures of the cost of living the annual pay adjustment is based on the employment cost index eci which measures change in privatesector wages and salaries the index showed that the annual acrosstheboard increase would be 31 in january 2003 the size of the locality payment is determined by the president and is based on comparison of nonfederal and general schedule gs salaries in 32 pa areas nationwide by law the disparity between nonfedera l and federal salaries was to be gradually reduced to 5 over the years 1994 through 2002 fepc requires that amounts payable may not be less than the full amount necessary to reduce the pay disparity to 5 in january 2003 the federal salary council and the pay agent recommend that the 2003 locality payments range from 2241 in the rest of the united states rus pay area to 4679 in the san francisco pay area the payment recommended for the washington dc pay area was 2893 because the new locality rate replaces the existing locality rate the change in cality rates is derived by comparing 2002 locality payments with those recomme nded for 2003 this comparison resulted in recommended increases in locality ra tes from 2002 to 2003 ranging from 1617 in the rus pay area to 2713 in the san fran cisco pay area with rise of 1924 in the washington dc pay area the nationwid

united states receive cost ofliving cola allowance rather than locality pay the localitybased comparability payments procedure was established by fepca it provides that payments are to be made within each locality determined to have nonfederalfederal pay disparity greater than 5 when uniformly applied to gs employees within locality the adjustment is intended to make their pay rates substantially equal in the aggregate to those of nonfederal workers for the same levels of work in the same locality fepca provides the president with the authority to fix an alternative level of localitybased comparability payments if because of national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare he considers the level that would otherwise be payable to be inappropria at least one month before those comparability payments would be payabl by november 30 2002 he would have to prepare and transmit to congress report describing the alternative level of payments he intended to

are then aggregated and compared to determine an overall average pe rcentage pay gap for each area by law the disparity between nonfede ral and federal salaries is to be reduced to 5 therefore the overall average percentage pay gap for each pay area is adjusted to this level each year by opm this adjusted gap is called the target gap fepca also stipulates that certain percentage of the target gap between gs average salaries and nonfederal average sala ries in each pay area is to be closed each year twenty percent of the gap was closed in 1994 the first year of locality pay as authorized by fepca an additional 10 of the gap was to be closed each year thereafter meaning that 30 of the ga p was to be closed in 1995 40 in 1996 50 in 1997 60 in 1998 70 in 1999 80 in 2000 and 90 in 2001 in

in 2000 381 in 2001 and 423 in 2002 these percentages represent the gap as recalculated after each adjustment by january 2002 fepca specified that amounts pa yable could not be less than the full amount necessary to reduce the pay dispar ity of the target gap to 5 this percentage is applied to the target gap in each pay area to determine the locality rates recommended by the pay agent to the president after receiving advice from the federal salary council14 the pay gaps on which the locality payments are based are 22 months old by the effective date of the adju stment thus march 2001 gaps determine the january 2003 locality payments due to the fact that the ncs surveys were not approved for use in determining the january 2000 january 2001 and january 2002 locality payments and are not recommended for use in january 2003 the march 2001 gaps were determined by using the most recent ocsp survey data for each pay area since the bls had discontinued the oc sp program in october 1996 th pay survey data for some of the largest pay areas were at least 6 years old specifically the new york data were as of july 1995 the washingt on dc data were as of october 1995 and the angeles data were as of november 1995 survey data for each of the other 28 pay areas varied from january 1996 to n ovember 1996 half of the data for the rest of the united states pa area were as of 1994 in its report to the pay agent on the 2003 locality payments the federal sa lary council reiterate d its explanation of how the pay gaps were determined stating that the method uses the methods employed to calculate pay gaps for the locality pay program since 1995 but involves aging the nonfederal salary data ove r an increasingly extended time period specifically the data were aged by using the change in the nationwide eci from the reference date of the survey to march 2001 the pay gaps were then recalculatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31291crs6 15memorandum for the presidents pay agent from the

been implemented and that this will be the last year we must use the old ocsp data15 report of the fede ral salary council the council reported the following results from the application of this met hodology as of march 2001 the overall gap between gs average salaries excluding existing locality payments special rates and certain other payments and nonfederal average salaries was 3397 the amount needed to reduce this disparity to 5 as mandated by fepca averages 2759 for 2003 in order to meet the target for closing the pay gap the council recommended locality pay raises ranging from 2241 in th rest of the unite d states rus pay area to 4679 in the san francisco pay area the payment recommended for the washington dc pay area is 2893 because the new locality rate replaces the existing locality rate the change in cality rates is derived by comparing 2002 locality payments with those recommende d for 2003 this comparison results in recommended increases in locality rates from 2002 to 2003 of 1617 in the rus pay area to 2713 in the san francisco pay area and 1924 in the washington dc pay area the nationwide average net pay increase if the eci and localitybased comparability payments were granted as required by law would be 1856 in 2003 as in previous years the council reco mmended that areas with pay gaps below the pay gap in rus receive the same adju stment as rus under the methodology which has been used since locality pay wa s first implemented in 1994 areas with low publishability and pay gaps that were two tenths of percentage point 02 or more below rus for three surveys were to be dropped as surveyed discrete pay areas and the resources used to conduct those surv eys were to be redirected to new survey locations the council as it has done th last 3 years concluded however that since surveys conducted under the ncs prog ram as currently configured are not suitable for use in the locality pay program reallocating survey resources to cover new cities is not feasible furthermore the council termined that using nationwide rate of change to adjust th rus salary data ma have overstated non federal pay levels in rus and that pa rt of the relative drop in the pay gaps in huntsville indianapolis and kansas city is probably due to federal workforce adjustments instead of changes in nonfederal pay16 therefore the council recommended that these pay areas ag ain be included with rus in 2003 basic criteria used to determine whet her county or installation would be included as part of pay area for purposes of applying locality pay were established by the council in 1993 in its report th council notes that it has reviewed the criteria each year since 1993 and recomme nded only three modifications affectinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31291crs7 17ibid pp 56 18ibid p 3about 10000 employees during the past 8 years those modi fications involved partialc ounty criteria in the case of new london fullstate criteria in the case of rhode island and reducing the percentage of population liv ing in urbanized areas in the case of monterey other criteria wh ich would remain unchanged are that county be contiguous to pay area c ontain at least 2000 gs employees and demonstrate some economic li nkage with the pay area the council stated that the criteria were intentionally made di fficult to pass because the use of ombs msa metropolitan statistical area definiti ons as the basis for pay areas already results in very large pay areas it is th nature of locality program that there be borders once borders are established there will always be employees near the borders and if we change the borde rs there are always new employees just on the other side while we understand the concerns of federal managers employees and employee groups in all these locations we believe the pay law provides other flexibilities for agencies to deal with any recruitment or retention problems in these areas without the nece ssity of making exceptions to the pay area boundaries these flexibilities include the use of special salary rates up to 60 percent above the base general schedule recruitment and relocation bonuses of up to 25 percent of basic pay and re tention allowances of up to 25 percent of basic pay17 since 1994 st marys county md has been included in the washington dc baltimore md pay area it continues to meet the c ounty criteria and the council recommended that it be included with this pay area for 2003 santa barbara county ca has been included in the an geles pay area since 1994 and new london ct has been included in the hartford ct pay area since 1998 employment in new london ct and santa barbara county ca again has fallen below the threshold of 2000 employees that one cr iterion requires th council recommended in 1997 however that once an area of pplication has been approved it should not be removed for the duration of fepcas 9year phasein for the locality pay program 1994 through 2002 therefore the council recommended that new london and santa barbara be areas of application for th eir respective pay areas at the very least until the new census data are available fo r evaluation and the new metropolitan areas are defined in 200318 monterey county ca which became an area of application to the san francisco pay area in 2001 meet s the criteria and is recommended to be included with this pay area in 2003 the state of rhode island was designated as an area of application to the boston pay area beginning in 2001 because c ounties in rhode island are small in comparison to counties in other states r hode island cannot meet the requirement that county contain at least 2000 gs employees therefore the council recommended that full state criteria be adopted in this case under the recommended criteria

it would be fair and appropriate at time when many other americans have seen their pay go to zero and in the private sector estim ates for increases range from about 18 to maybe 3 for those who are employed we thought giving back 1 percent or lets say taking 1 percent less than this sort of rule of thumb index was something that federal employees would feel is fair nd i hope many will feel its an appropriate thing to do let just remind ou this is an increase at time when the economy is in recession and many americans are seeing zero increase or even drop in pay29 the statutory annual pay adjustment re quired in january 2003 was 31 if the president wanted to change the required ra of the annual adju stment he would have had to submit an alternative plan for the annual adjustment to
