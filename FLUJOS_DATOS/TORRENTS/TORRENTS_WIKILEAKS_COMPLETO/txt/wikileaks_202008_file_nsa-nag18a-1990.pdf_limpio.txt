the completion of entering an amendment requiring the removal andor insertion of pages prior to destruction prior to shipment to another comsec account and upon return from an authorized hand receipt user page checks must be accomplished within two work days after receipt of the material immediately after entering an amendment and two work days prior to shipment or destruction 5005 procedures for handling keying material keying material must be stored in containers approved for the classification level of the key access to the container storing future editions of classified keying material marked crypto however must be rest ricted to the comsec custodian and alternate custodians where this restriction cannot be applied because others must have access to the container for either current editions of keying material or other material contained therein future editions of keyi ng material must be stored separately in locked strongbox which can be opened only by the comsec custodian and alternate custodians the strongbox must be kept in the security container the strongbox should be permanently mounted where possible with out causing damage to the safe exceptions may be made in operational areas to allow shift supervisors access to the next edition of keying material but not to later editions destruction of keying material is addressed in chapter vii 50051 when it is necessary for the custodian to relinquish physical control of operational key cards to user the protectively packaged key card book will be issued on hand receipt basis when card is removed from the book for use the hand receipt user will place h is initials and the date in the used column of the usage record on the inner front cover of the book by the appropriate card number handling instructions may contain details applicable to particular short title if in the opinion of the custodian issue of individual cards is warranted the hand receipt users initials in the used column of

disposition record on the inside front cover of the publication this will serve in lieu of hand receipt b key listskey tapes packaged in plastic protective canisters do not require page check upon receipt of this material the comsec custodian will annotate the accompanying record of usage card with the short title edition and register number of the material labels will not be affixed to key ing material canisters or any other implemented protective technology since it may hamper laboratory inspections should additional identification of the classification be necessary beyond that visible through the window of the canister itself the preferr ed means is to mark or affix label or tag to the ziploc bag if available or mark the classification on the plastic canister using grease pencil the comsec custodian should issue the entire canister to user on hand receipt basis the hand receipt user however must not remove more tape segments from the canister than are required for current use as each segment is removed the hand receipt user will place his initials and the date in the used column of the usage record card applicable to the material 5006 transfer of comsec material 50061 general comsec material may be transferred from one comsec account to another only as prescribed by the procedures in this manual prior to transferring accountable comsec material it is the responsib ility of the custodian to verify the receiving activitys official address comsec account number and authorization to hold the material being shipped when the validity of shipping address or authority for shipment is in question the custodian should contact the cor before making the shipment accountable comsec material regardless of accounting legend code assigned will not be shipped unless comsec

7001 importance of secure destruction the security achieved through the proper use of contemporary cryp tosystems is heavily dependent upon the physical protection that is afforded the associated keying material current and superseded keying materials are extremely sensitive since their compromise potentially exposes to compromise all traffic encrypted wit h them for this reason keying material other than defective or faulty key which must be held pending instructions from the cor must be destroyed as soon as possible after it has been superseded or otherwise served its intended purpose destruction of superseded or obsolete crypto equipment and supporting documentation is also essential to the maintenance of satisfactory national comsec posture since these materials may be of significant long term benefit to hostile interests desiring to exploit comm unications for intelligence purposes only nationally owned crypto equipment is destroyed borrowed equipment must be returned when it becomes excess or unserviceable unclassifiedfor official use only nag 18atsec 31 unclassifiedfor official use only 7002 training of destruction personnel supervisors must ensure that destruction perso nnel have been properly trained prior to performing destruction the personnel involved must be instructed on the proper usehandling of the destruction devices and the proper destruction procedures 7003 procedures for routine destruction routine destru ction should normally be done by the comsec custodian and the alternate comsec custodian however this restriction should not be enforced at the cost of delaying destruction granting the authority to destroy superseded material to additional appropriatel cleared people who then certify the destruction to the comsec custodian is preferable to delaying destruction even for short time one individual should read the accounting data from the destruction report with the other individual reading back the accounting data from the material to ensure the correct material is being destroyed then both individuals should reverse the process as double check the following paragraphs indicate various procedures that might be followed in representative situation s with an emphasis on keying material 70031 in large facility cleared hand receipt users may be granted authority to destroy keying material they use in the presence of cleared witness as soon as the material is used if more than one key settin g is available replaced or superseded hand receipt users may accomplish destruction by placing the material in an approved destruction device if one is available in the immediate vicinity the individual performing keying material destruction and the w itness shall initial an appropriate record eg the usage disposition record showing the material that is being destroyed this record shall be provided to the comsec custodian who shall review and consolidate similar information and use it to prepare formal destruction reports 70032 in small facility with only few comsec equipments the comsec custodian may personally collect used or superseded keying material replace it with new material and effect timely destruction of used or superseded mat erial in the presence of cleared witness 70033 in mobile situations routine destruction may be accomplished by the hand receipt user and an appropriately cleared witness the issuing comsec custodian must be advised by the user either verbally or in writing that the hand receipt user has destroyed the material verbal notification must be followed up with written confirmation of destruction as soon as possible for accounting purposes the comsec custodian will then consider the material destroyed in such cases the comsec custodian must brief the hand receipt user on the necessity for prompt and complete destruction of used or superseded keying material and for prompt reporting of any loss of control of material before destruction could be accompli shed 7004 scheduling routine destruction certain keying material designated crypto that has been issued for use must be destroyed as soon as possible after use or supersession and may not be held longer than 12 hours following supersession however where special circumstances prevent compliance with the 12 hour standard eg facility unmanned over weekend or holiday period an extension to maximum of 72 hours is authorized where communications activity is suspended for extended periods unuse d keying material need not be destroyed as it is superseded but may be retained in secure storage in the comsec account until communications activity resumes at which time uncla ssifiedfor official use only nag 18atsec 32 unclassifiedfor official use only unused superseded key must be

destroyed within five days after supersession c maintenance and sample keying material not designated crypto are not regularly superseded and need only be destroyed when physically unserviceable d superseded classified comsec publications held by comsec account must be destroyed within 15 days after supersession the residue of entered amendments to class ified comsec publications must be destroyed within five days after entry of the amendment 7005 routine destruction methods the authorized methods for routinely destroying paper comsec material are burning pulverizing or chopping crosscut shredding an d pulping non paper comsec material authorized for routine destruction must be destroyed by burning chopping or pulverizing or chemical alteration 70051 the criteria given below apply to classified comsec keying material and media in paper form which embody describe or implement classified cryptographic logic such media include full maintenance manuals cryptographic descriptions drawings of cryptographic logics specifications describing cryptographic logic and cryptographic software other paper comsec material may be destroyed by any means approved for the destruction of other paper material of equal classification or sensitivity when destroying paper comsec material by burning the combustion must be complete so that all material is re duced to white ash and contained so that unburned pieces escape ashes must be inspected and if necessary broken up or reduced to sludge b when pulping pulverizing or chopping devices are used to destroy paper comsec material they must reduce th material to bits larger than 5mm in any dimension note do not pulp paper mylar paper key tape or high wet strength paper map stock and durable medium paper substitute eg tyvec olefin polyethylene fiber the material will not reduce to pulp and must be destroyed by burning pulverizing or chopping or crosscut shredding this type of material should be cut into pieces and burned c when crosscut double cut shredders are used to destroy paper comsec material they must reduce the material t shreds not more than 364 inch 12mm in width and not more than 12 inch l3mm in length or not more than 135 inch 073mm in width and not more than 78inch 222mm in length when small amounts of material are destroyed eg ten or fewer cards keying material must be mixed with at least an equal amount of other material of similar composition prior to shredding or pulverizing so that secure destruction will take place and the residue will be unclassified unclassifiedfor official use

the material must be destroyed to the extent that there is possibility of reconstructing classified information by physical chemical electrical optical or other means microforms microfilm microfiche or other reduced image photo negatives may be destroyed by burning or chemical means such as immersion in household bleach for silver film masters or acetone or methylene chlori for diazo reproductions for approximately 5 five minutes when destroying by chemical means film sheets must be separated and roll film must be unrolled note caution should be exercised to prevent potential hazards when using chemical means for d estruction b magnetic or electronic storage or recording media are handled on an individual basis magnetic tapes may be destroyed by disintegration or incineration magnetic cores may be destroyed by incineration or smelting magnetic discs disc packs and drums may be destroyed by incineration or removal of the entire recording surface by means of an

will not be destroyed without the approval of the cor d the objective in destroying plastic canisters is to disfigure the two large flat surfaces of the canister comsec custodians are to dispose of em pty tape canisters after first fracturing the flat surfaces recommended single canister mutilation or after smashing the empty tape canister suggested multiple canister destruction custodians must be aware that an empty tape canister will shatter if smashed with blunt instrument and should not attempt to smash an empty canister without following the safety precautions listed below to protect personnel from possible injury from flying fragments while fracturing the empty canister first place the ca nister inside ziploc plastic bag then with wide bladed screwdriver and hammer fracture one flat side of the canister approximately 34 from the rounded edge avoiding the exact center turn the canister over and repeat dispose of the fractured cani ster as unclassified trash 70053 routine
