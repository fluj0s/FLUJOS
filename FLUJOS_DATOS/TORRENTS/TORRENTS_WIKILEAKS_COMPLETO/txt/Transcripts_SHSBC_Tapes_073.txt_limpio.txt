shsbc 73 question and answer period flows lecture given on 19 october 1961 how are you today what is this the 19th guess it is the 19th okay 19 october ad 11 special briefing course saint hill and today i have nearly one and all who is busy wrestling with the gruesome problems of problems if youre having trouble doing problems intensive then i could say offhand that youre simply qandaing with the title of it and if youre having too much trouble with problems intensive why call it the solution intensive or something i could absolutely count on labeling something difficult procedure and then have the comm lines jam it isnt quite that bad im in snide and sarcastic mood today mean all right now it is unfair to release new procedure without giving you an opportunity to ask intelligent questions concerning its application so this is your opportunity to let us all in on the fact that you havent quite surrounded this one if you have any question about problems intensive its administration its expected result or anything else speak up yes male voice there used to be process spot change in your life and when you um told us to list changes i was reminded of that is there anything we can do wrong to pc by sort of having their kind of change process unflat as it were sort of change list is there anything wrong with theres an old process spot change in your life and is there anything that we might be doing wrong by doing the assessment which then leaves an unflat process male voice yes dont worry about it because in the first place if you are doing your assessment properly it will come out at the other end as simply list such as terminals list or goals list and itd be more restimulative than making somebody go over the goals you see there used to be an old process called recall goal youve had or something like that there was an old process like that and that could be completely unflat and we would still be able to get the same goals assessment that we got before i wouldnt say in any way the only reason changes have been difficult for the individual lies squarely on the fact that there is one that has tremendous problem behind it the changes were never the difficulty that would not by the way be very good process it wasnt very good process it was abandoned long time ago and the reason it isnt very good process is it turns out in this particular case that it changes solution thats wild one isnt it the change is solution and therefore in this particular instance youre running solutions because youre only asking for selfdetermined changes and if you ask for selfdetermined changes youre asking for the same thing as how many times have you solved problems in your life by changing your activities that would have to be the auditing command what change have you brought about in your life in order to resolve your activities that is really if youre going to run process on the thing that would be the process you were running okay does that answer your question male voice yes that does thank you all right yes reg male voice on assessing for change should that be done in session as it does come under section which we were told to do out of session out of model session yeah well its out of session male voice you assess out of session then yes thats theres there is particular reason to do any part of the preclear assessment form up through and including in session theres particular reason to do it i dont know how some people manage to miss goals and terminals with the rudiments out but evidently rudiments out they miss goals and terminals it might work out that with rudiments very far out in doing this out of session it might work out that the individual is unable to give you the number of selfdetermined changes that he might he might not be able to find the change but if that condition ever occurred why you should let know about it but in case of doubt and where you feel absolutely the pc is insufficiently insession to give you proper list well its your pc go ahead and do it in model session okay right yes male voice ron in doing the command what is unknown about the problem what is unknown doing the command what is unknown about the problem male voice right the pc scans the whole track when hes doing this is that correct the pc scans the whole track when he is doing it male voice or can do this well he doesnt scan it thats an old technical term male voice i mean hes hes hes looking at the whole track well he picks up pieces of the whole track that is absolutely right you want that answered male voice well what i want to know is what whats the whats happening here i mean with problem thats reoccurring many many times what is happening here with problem reoccurring many many times male voice thats right you mean how much track are you running on this pc male voice this is true i dont all right well you get this ill try to straighten it out for you you get an auditing command any auditing command any which is statement that the pc is to do something unless you modify the command itself there can be understood about it in other words everything in an auditing command is implicit in the auditing command if you want something in the auditing command you have to put it in the auditing command we cannot arrange before we run the auditing command that the pc is only to recall that particular zone or instance of his life while we are running this process see wed go back to this and we would say well heres this is dead wrong all right now you and i understand that were only running this lifetime is that correct so none of your auditing replies are to be outside of this lifetime fine you see that violates the rule of the understood auditing command because then he is always running the first command you gave him and of course youve set up problem in the session and you wont get very much result in the running of it every time you have the pc understanding something about an auditing command which is not stated in the auditing command you are running the pc on perpetual problem he has to come back to the beginning of the session every time and remember this you see and then he does the auditing command youre actually processing on time via so that you get this rule this inexorable auditing rule that everything you want the pc to do must be implicit in the auditing command you must say so every time all right the reason im going into that is one has to cover these points now and then not that you dont know it bob but heres what it amounts to this particular problem that the pc has is located by you as prior to change the pc has had and therefore must have come immediately after confusion the pc has had and we are apparently at first glance only addressing this small section of track well now if we wanted him to stay in that section of track wed have to give him command like this what is unknown about that problem you had in 1955 something like that about your father and mother and wanting to leave them see now it would have to be terribly implicit itd not only have to date itd have to have the substance of the command itd have to have everything in it all right now if you ran that just that way you would get an interesting result you would get the problem out of that section of track you would get it out of that section of track but theres the old rule about basicbasics that the first time something occurred has more weight and is more easily run than any other time it occurred thats the basicbasic on the chain any similar circumstance repetitive through persons whole track has first time it occurred and that first time that it occurred we called basicbasic you see thats basicbasic on this chain of occurrences we have guarantee this is the first time he thought of this problem so it is perfectly not only feasible but it is best that the pc wander all over the track on that problem because we will actually go picking it up anywhere and everywhere it not only is riding back then but is riding up in present theres another reason for this he will get the illusion of wandering all over the track because problems are timeless and if you tried to run problem with an imposition of time on top of it you would have trouble so it basically resolves down to this that it doesnt much matter whether its best that he stay in 1955 the moment of the problem or not your ability to make him do so is almost well you just couldnt do it thats all so youd have to let him do it he would do it inevitably because this problem probably isnt resident in 1955 but has been coasting on forward now since 1720 and although youre apparently running change of 1955 you find yourself suddenly running 1720 and youve already run into this well he will try tend to wander to the beginning of the cchain he will tend to go backwards on the beginning of the chain and the only reason were running it is to knock the chain out now we want to get the chain out so that when you get the confusion out of that particular zone and area immediately before it the problem isnt hanging up so what were actually doing is running the problem so as to get him all over the track so we can get the prior confusion but we only want the prior confusion of 1955 if we didnt run the problem off we would have chance of getting only the prior 1955 confusion hes going to go all over the track while youre doing sec check and you dont want him going all over the track you want to know what he did do to his schoolmates or whoever it is thats in that zone so by running the problem permissively and letting him wander all over the track with the problem which he has stated you then are able more or less to keep him in that space of time immediately before that first time he says the problem occurred because the problem always occurred earlier okay you get two types of run out of this thing its quite interesting you get whole track run and then you get present lifetime run and it wasnt basically i wont pretend bunch of knowingness here it wasnt basically designed this way i just knew you had to get the problem out of the road and then in running it its obvious that people go all over the track to run the problem and thats fine and if you find if you try to get the security check done before you get the problem run i think youll find youre going to have trouble and the reason why is the problem is prior to the zone of confusion see its going way back so you wouldnt have much of chance getting out the zone of confusion apparently from what fragmentary data is to hand it is much much harder on the pc to run the zone of prior confusion if the problem isnt well run something thats quite interesting i dont know if youve noticed this you havent maybe you havent tried to do the prior confusion oh yes you have yes some of you have done the prior confusion you had hard time slugging at it well if you had any hard time getting the prior confusion that was because there was this lousy problem hidden in there see and the problem wasnt about to surrender does that answer your question male voice yes yes it does all right theres another point ive got to make here about problems there is something else theres always something else but you have permissive type of auditing command on the problem run in problems intensive is sometimes not feasible on pc who is poorly who is rather introverted on the subject if the pc is too introverted on subject in general or if its an apathetic sort of problem or if it is problem which seems to take in or could easily take in many people onecommand problems process is not good enough ill give you direct idea this has turned up several times here but problem something on the order of what am i going to do with myself this is not this is not strange problem you see what am i going to do with myself this has turned up well you what dont you know about doing something with yourself or some such command as that comes out of it and the pc has been so introverted on the subject that it is not permissive command what is unknown about doing something with yourself and he just runs it from his side he just says i i i i and the next thing you know hes in stuck flow he never thinks of it being unknown to anybody else his ideas never extend into that zone and he already has spent years of saying to himself what am i going to do what am i going to do what am i going to do what am i going to do and hes on stuck flow of i dont you see heres your stuck flow here are flows lifting their ugly heads and it just never occurs to him that when you ask him the problems question what is unknown about doing something with your life to say well it was unknown to my father see he never says that he always says it was unknown to it was unknown to it was unknown to it was unknown to and hes just going on running the stuck flow its already stuck now all hes got to have to do is invent couple there and hes really in bad shape promptly see hes got stuck flow and youre compounding the stuck flow so in such case it is actually necessary to put second leg on the auditing command what didnt you know about doing something with your life or what was unknown to you about doing something your with your life what was unknown to others about doing something with your life not terrifically model command but it gives you the idea you see what didnt you know about doing something with your life what didnt others know about doing something with your life and if this is an introvertive type thing such as that particular type of problem youll rip up an automaticity on what did others know all right we give you an example heres this girl and she wanted to be painter and her parents said well that is just fine and the thing which you really ought to be in life is housekeeper and were going to teach you to be housekeeper and she says i really want to be painter and they say housekeeper housekeeper housekeeper housekeeper so she finally says well all right housekeeper and then they say well dear we have been very very mean to you and you wanted to go into the field of the arts so we will let you study millinery and she said well uh all right uh uh all right yes yes ill study millinery and so forth well so she goes ahead and she goes and gets book on millinery and shes all set and shes getting herself briefed up and then her mother says to her well you know theres nice opening over here someplace theres nice opening over here on drill press operator and i really think you ought to study drill press operating and what it is actually ask yourself this what would happen to pc that every time he gave you goal on an assessment you said oh here is much nicer one if you did it in the most pleasant tone of voice there would be small splash heard and that would be the pc going into the soup well now person who is has one of these occupational particularly problems you see what am i going to do with my life something like that has really only got problem because other people had an opinion and their idea of what they should do with their lives was directly contrary to the mores that other people were expressing and the other people of course being many and not it wasnt their life gave them varied things to do and all kinds of alternates and lots of contradictions and it made ridge see here was ridge pc wants to go that way the other people all sort of want to go another way dont you see so we ask this pc the question what didnt others know about doing something with your life and he gets up brrrrrrrt and he thinks oh yeah and he thinks of one person he thinks of another person he thinks of another person and they all had different ideas or maybe none of them had any idea at all so any time he tried to get any answer to this what to do something with your life he ran into i dont know well you just make up your own mind about it and of course they could surround some youngster with that and you would get the immediate result of nobody knowing what to do with his life hed not know what to do with his life and others wouldnt know what to do with his life and anything to do with his life was unknown to others and was unknown to him youd get the same result if you had fifteen other people with fifteen other ideas about what he should do with his life all of them in contradistinction to what he wanted to do with his life and you see what kind of nonsense youre building up one is youre asking him to go into valence of other peoples unknowingness they didnt know what to do with his life and two youre asking terrific conflict to occur which would build up ridge its ridge of disagreement you see what im talking about so you get twosided auditing command then and it dispels this any auditing command may have inherent in it i will make it very plain and state it for the ten thousandth time has inherent in it flows theres potentiality of flows you run girl on the subject of jewelry and well lets say that shes been successful on the stage or something was always getting jewelry presents you see jewelry presents jewelry presents jewelry presents jewelry presents jewelry presents jewelry presents jewelry presents jewelry presents jewelry presents and you know one day she cant have any jewelry if you ask her to hand you ring for its inspection also shes liable to start screaming you see the jewelry has only gone in one way see theres oneway flow of jewelry from out there to in here you got the idea and its always gone from out there to in here and its never gone from in here to out there shell eventually wind up with boxes of jewelry under her pillow and she wont be able to separate herself from jewelry and she also wont be able to wear jewelry lot of rich women have tremendous quantities of jewelry all locked up in safe and you say well why dont you wear it to party or something of this sort oh they never think of wearing it you know but theyve got jewelry but it has to be hidden well its some kind of stuck flow now to resolve that youd have to say recall being given some jewelry and how far away from you could you move piece of jewelry this it wouldnt matter you wouldnt ask them how could you give away some jewelry you see this is this is an antisurvival action to them its counter to games condition which is why it wont run and youll start an avalanche of jewelry you start asking this and youll unlock the ridge on which its held up on and youll get brrrrrrrt and all of sudden jewelry just starts flying in from everyplace youd have to be pretty clever auditor to get one of these avalanches triggered but you can sometimes trigger an avalanche and itll be an avalanche of jewelry or an avalanche of cars or an avalanche of mountains or an avalanche of something the persons had too much of it dont you see and they have its been stuck flow and its kept coming in and then pretty soon it just stacked up and when you start to run it again why all the facsimiles of the inflow all turn on on automatic and you have avalanches and thats what an avalanche is you can also get an outavalanche on some item well take person is lecturing if hes lecturing and hes pretty aberrated and so forth why you just get the idea of lecturing get the idea of lecturing get the idea of lecturing and all of sudden he gets visual manifestations of words pouring away from him toward others you get the idea but because its across games condition you wouldnt audit it flows flows are part and parcel of every auditing command and if the pc is running an auditing command up from to b and the next time he answers it the flow is from to b and the next time he answers it the flow is from to b and the next time he answers it the flow is from to b all of sudden he can go into black occlusion everything will turn black his pictures turn off all kinds of odd things can occur simply by having this oneway flow and thats why we call it stuck flow now if you have him answer the auditing command from b to b to b to all of sudden the occlusion goes off and he isnt occluded now suddenly its quite mysterious stuck flows youll see these things register on your emeter stuck flow starts sticking the needle in fact all needle sticks are stuck flows when your needle sticks up why youve got stuck flow now youll see this in fellows withhold this individual is withholding hes got something hes done something minor hes shot the king of france or something and hes withholding it well that is nonpermitted flow so of course everything that goes in against it sticks because there must be backflow on it of any kind whatsoever he regrets the backflow he should not have ever backflowed the bullet in the first place so hes withholding it now so he holds this fact in now everything you offer him about the king of france flows in and but nothing can come out on the subject of the king of france dont you see and youll see that needle go up stick youll see the tone arm rise and not go back down again hes got withhold he wont you know and the more you make him conscious of it the more he becomes conscious that he had better withhold it so the more you flow in any question toward him why the more he holds the question in see and he keeps packing himself up finally and hes squashing and you can just see it register right over here on the tone arm he just squashes himself with the withhold got the idea now all of sudden he says gives up because youre clever and you ask the right questions and you say suddenly you say well did you ever murder king oooooooohhoooh he cant withhold it see you triggered it and well um and you say whats that you know in an authoritative voice oh that has to do something about which king was it oh well i murdered the king of france and youll see him go down see the tone arm go down well youve reversed the flow that is why you see that manifestation occur the most that an emeter registers is stuck flows now an oscilloscope stuck flows or not stuck flows an oscilloscope properly rigged up on somebody shows the direction of flow this is really weird you can set up an oscilloscope onehand electrode and you can set up an oscilloscope and you can ask this fellow to get the idea of getting of receiving some candy thank you receiving some candy get the idea of receiving some candy thank you get the idea of receiving some candy thank you get the idea of receiving some candy thank you and youll see the oscilloscope start moving in one direction zzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzz youll see the sine wave move move move you see from left to right left to right left to right left to right left to right left to right and you say get the idea of receiving some candy good get the idea of receiving some candy and the oscilloscope is moving over from left to right left to right left to right and then slower as you keep asking to get this idea and slower and slower and stick and the sine wave will be right there on stuck and it wont move in any direction and you say get the idea of receiving some candy and it just kind of gets little more rigid now you say to him now get the idea of throwing away some candy and youll see this thing still stuck get the idea of throwing away some candy still stuck get the idea of throwing away some candy tremble see on your oscilloscope all right now get the idea of throwing away some candy and youll see the sine wave start drifting from right to left the opposite direction and youll see it going from right to left very slowly get the idea of throwing away some candy okay and then itll speed up and the sine wave will go from right over to left faster and faster and faster and faster and finally its just whizzing and then as you keep asking get the idea of throwing away some candy it will slow down and it will stick and now you have to say to him get the idea of receiving some candy and now youll get it going from left to right again and that is stuck flow and its one of the weirdest things you ever cared to watch the reason we dont use an oscilloscope 1 theyre terribly expensive and 2 they register all those formed up so far reg was good enough to get some experimental scopes and we had lot of work done in this particular direction but they register terrific body phenomena the pc wiggles his nose and oh the oscilloscope just goes crazy you see and somebody four feet away from the pc moves his shoulder and the oscilloscope moves you see but you can have the pcs case right in your lap you know you can say ah you could big withhold is the fact thaat just yesterday you robbed bank or something and you could say well ah did you ever rob bank and you get the tiniest faintest tremble see its very very faint its extremely faint but the pc just wiggling his ears causes the thing to go mad the emeters quite valuable it doesnt do this it registers the mind before it registered body motion body motion is registered much less than the mental reaction on the way this emeter is built but on an oscilloscope those that we have so far worked with why the body reaction the movement of the pcs finger or anything of this character registers wildly on the scope and yeah nobody could read it i can read it but with microscope you know i mean what are these little vibrations thats the difficulty but youd set up an oscilloscope anyway in spite of these limitations and tell the pc not to breathe anymore than necessary and you can watch these flow phenomena now you dont see them on the emeter an emeter goes up whether the pc is flowing in or flowing out the stick occurs the emeter does not tell you the direction of flow whether it is in or out now if you draw map around pc you will figure out how many kinds of flow there could be how many directions of flow could there be oh you get lots then dont you you get not only in and out and to another in and out from another you get all these various patterns but youd also get up and down and back of you and away from you and on your right side and away from you and to you and on your left side and away from you and to you you get all these things and if you were putting up mockups you would use these things but the basic 5 bracket that you use is the most common and the most important flow directions and thats why you use that 5way bracket thats whats known as bracket its 5way flow pattern its from the pc out to somebody else from the somebody else in to the pc now theres another little one of the other persons flow pattern is more important to the bank you see than many other directions there could be around the pc its important to the bank that the pc flows in and out this is most important but next in importance is another persons outflow and inflow and then next to that is somebody elses outflow and inflow to the other person and then theres of course the internal flows and ridges inside the person the pc is confronting and then the flows and ridges internally inside the pc so youve got these various patterns you could work them out theyre the most important patterns and if you only run twoways of flow you could sooner or later run into one of these the third one you go too long on the thing such as you run on long prehav run you can start running into the third one youll see the interchange in flows around the person the pc is confronting in the bank and that persons flows can jam and you will get jammed emeter in other words if you dont run enough flows and directions youll get stuck up meter now this applies of course in running any process but what do you care doing limited process very limited you are only going to run it for few minutes something like this you cant get anybody in very serious trouble but is there anything that you could get somebody in trouble with yes you can overrun flow and now you get stick and kind of of breakup that is known as blowdown you can run flow too long in one direction and eventually itll blow up something will happen its not necessarily good for the pc but you can overrun flow and thats why i say when youre running prehav level youre overrunning all flows you know you can run them too long theres nothing left there to run and therefore your tone arm is longer moving and you know you better come off of it because the more you run it the more stuck its going to get and youre not now doing the fellow any good all flows are exhausted out of certain zone or area or on certain subject so therefore you get off of it so all flows can run out and leave something else there well youre running mean to mother see and youre saying now when have you been mean to mother when has mother been mean to you when have you been mean to yourself when has mother been mean to herself when has somebody else been mean to mother when has mother been mean to somebody else see youre just heres lots of flows dont you see when has mother been mean to others when have others been mean to mother you see it can go on and on out oh i dont know you can get it up to thirtytwo commands without half trying and then you could make all these positive and negative you can really get complicated when have you been mean to mother when have you not been mean to mother when has mother been mean to you when have when has mother not been mean to you get the idea when has mother not been mean to somebody else when has mother been mean to somebody else when has another been mean to mother when has another not been mean to mother well you get what were doing here you see youre getting the negative flow and the positive flow at the same time and youre getting all available flows that might stick up the case at the same time and you can just get well its something like the ensign goes out and he takes his sextant you see and he takes the eyepiece of the sextant and he polishes it all up with dirty handkerchief he cant see through it you know and ruins the glass on that you see and then he takes the shades that go across it and he sees there are about ten shades in this particular sextant so he pulls them all down across the eyepiece you see so that you cant see anything through it and then he takes the thing and he adjusts it to on the backwards limb of the sun you see so hes got to shoot over his head toward the sun you know and then as hes fishing around its evening you see so he can see the horizon and the sun and the stars suns going down you know and all this sort of thing the sun is too low on the horizon he finds thats very difficult but there is some position that he can get into that he can see it very very well and he gets beautiful shot and he marks it all down and he reads the vernier with magnifying glass you see reads it down to the last second he takes his time greenwich mean time he takes it on the finest stopwatch you ever heard he takes that down to the chronometer you see compares it exactly then he starts looking up in his mathematical tables you know and he gets dozens and dozens of figures and then he crosscorrects these things and he figures everything down absolutely perfectly he scorns the air almanac because its too crude hes got to have the nautical almanac you see with everything and he figures it out down to the last second of the day the exact geographical position puts all these figures down hes filled up the whole table full of figures you see and hes all set you see and he takes he takes very sharp pencil you see and he takes it and puts it right down exactly on the chart and he says we are exactly right there and he says well thats job well done and pats himself on the back and the only difficulty was he didnt shoot the sun he shot the truck light now you can very easily do that you see you can very easily do something beyond the necessity to do it you see or beyond the need of the situation you can figure out the mathematics of it you see and you could figure out the mathematics of these flows down to thirtytwo command flows see thirtytwo flows thirtytwo commands and then positive and negative on each one of these flow lines you see and that would give you sixtyfour consecutive commands that you would have to give before you go around the next time you get the idea well thats just opening up book after book and figuring out the nautical almanac you see and getting it all figured tight tight and all perfect you see and you spend so much time doing this you dont notice the pc has long since been out of session and has forgotten what the terminal was and has longer any interest in it and so forth you get the idea the you see the mind is actually capable of considerable resurgence and you cash in on that all the time you give the mind free look at present time the mind is free in present time that is to say the person hasnt got present time problem out in the society someplace he hasnt got an arc break with the auditor hes freed up as far as present time is concerned his auditing room is okay and hes being audited all right he gets with that freedom an ability to asis he does have certain ability dont you see and this takes care of tremendous number of rough spots he can take care of lot of omitted lines for instance you can run 5way bracket and you wind up just fine hell get all of it see it will all come loose you get the level as flat as is necessary in order to resolve his case you get the present time problem resolved you see sufficiently so that he can be insession all of these things are sufficiencies theyre not absolutes and auditing is not an absolute practice if it were an absolute practice you would really be in the soup well if every bad experience he had ever had in the last two hundred trillion years had to be audited out as an engram it would take you the next two hundred trillion years of course because fifteen minute engram quite ordinarily if its not on the goalsterminal line takes 4 or 5 hours to audit so you get your multiple so if you want to audit him two hundred trillion years then assume that it has to be the absolute of everything ever bad that has ever happened to him has to be audited out well this makes an impossible look dont you see so auditing becomes impractical but nearly everything bad that has ever happened to him is going to blow if you pull out certain pins well now that is the cushion on which youre operating you see that if we get this and this and this adjusted with the mind then the mind is capable of readjusting and its the capability of the mind to resurge which is your biggest stock in trade and the mind resurges to the degree that the rudiments are in and that the pc is insession in other words you get somebody who is not quite insession and you will notice that he wont asis things easily you grind and grind and grind and grind and grind and grind and grind and he just doesnt seem to be running anything and nothing seems much to be happening and so forth well thats because you actually arent operating now with the ability of the mind to resurge this has been cut down to nothing by what well by some present time problem and so on the reason youre running problems intensive is to make the mind resurge sufficiently so that when you run the goals chain you will you will do ten times as much work in the same amount of auditing ordinarily you see you save time by freeing the mind up so that it can do these things you got the idea i notice some of you looking little blank about this but flows flows are pretty hard to get across to an auditor ill tell you that this has not been easy to do so i give talk on it every once in awhile but its usually not too well telegraphed best thing you can do is go out and play with garden hose for while you know have somebody squirt it on you and you squirt it on somebody else and then have them squirt it on tree and youll eventually get the idea then youll be hung up on this one probably well what is it that is flowing well the reason youre having hard time with it is you dont realize the mind is full of particles you think the mind is full of thoughts well if there was anything wrong with the thoughts of the mind there would be nothing wrong with the mind how do you think these thoughts ever connect up with anything well the thought gets connected with the particles and the particles get connected with solids and the pc tries to think and runs into solids and you audit him and you run into particles and if you think theres nothing in the mind put away your copy of mary baker eddy and start studying scientology youre actually noth theres nothing wrong with the pcs thinkingness theres nothing wrong with his thoughts its the fact that his thinkingness gets joined up with the creation of energy space time manifestations and these things get all mixed up with thinkingness so that he cant think thought without getting mass or he cant think of mass without getting particle and he cant think of time without getting space these things are all mixed up and he cannot differentiate amongst these things he cant differentiate amongst most of the dynamics when he gets to thinking in the reactive bank and the reactive bank of course is all dynamics associated with or identified with all dynamics and the sixth dynamic in particular identified with all dynamics and the seventh dynamic then identified with all of the reactive mind and if you wanted to draw map of the reactive mind that would be the identifications in it you see thinkingness only goes haywire when an individual is longer able to differentiate where he should or associate where he should hes longer in control of differentiation or association he gets identification mama is monster house is jail horses beds and then hell get up into verbal identification youll find out there are lot of people around who still have these semantic identifications that dianetics the modern science of mental health was built on had so many of them around that i specialized on it semantics of it are quite interesting he rowed boat he road boat he rode boat what did he dod with the boat these are identifications and he we found an airline pilot one time you can do some interesting things with semantics but they are either not very lasting or very very pervasive but they are terribly interesting and you can produce very fast phenomena with semantics over here in england if wed specialized more with semantics than we have hasi london would do better but hasi london has to suffer along because its compared with the rest of the world dont you see and you find more semantic identification probably in hasi london than elsewhere but you get some kind of situation like this an airline pilot came in i think he was national or american airlines came in we audited him for little while all we did was look for the phrase that gave him compulsion to have accidents or why he was flying and this is what finally turned up is statement of his mothers well actually he had run garage and hed failed and hed run this and hed failed and hed run that and hed failed and hed finally gone back to flying and he hated it and he just couldnt figure out any part of this but it was one phrase of his mother and the phrase was identified with many things you see with pain and so forth but it then became identified with all things and the phrase was he was earthly good so reactively this worked out that he ought to fly we cured case that had leukemia one time it was just one phrase in the bank that was causing the leukemia just one phrase was all that was identified and that is it would turn your blood to water he was little kid sick and his mother just said this all the time and the auditor heard the mother saying this sort of thing and simply got the kid to repeat it and repeat it and repeat it and repeat it and repeat it and repeat it that was the end of the leukemia blood was water and that is leukemia but you could make some interesting stunts this way old semantic auditing identifications of words with words there these things are very very interesting but an auditor has to be very clever and he very often isnt successful and he fails many times and some people just impossible to drill into their heads and find out what it is that is associated if you could run engrams on everybody with semantic association wed probably still be doing it but you cant so wed have to look for more basic things you see dianetics ends right about there doesnt go much further than that it has to do with the engram identifications that are associated with the engram and an understanding of semantics and then it takes off from there and the first real departure is the discovery of overt acts 1950 end of 51 that everybody was running motivators motivators motivators and the only thing that made it come free was getting the overt off thats as early as 1951 i dont know if you knew it was quite that old but just exactly how to apply all that and how to get it simple and how much importance it had in the mind and so forth it took many years to level this thing out so that it was functional but this flow situation can be overdone by the auditor you see positive negative thirtytwo directions of flow get the idea of giving something to somebody behind you get the idea of somebody behind you giving something to you you know there well thats flow line get the idea of not giving something to somebody behind you get the idea of somebody behind you not giving something to you get the idea of somebody under you giving you something get the idea of you giving you somethi giving something to somebody under you well were just getting its getting ridiculous you see weve over weve over enumerated the whole problem you see the mind is more capable than that the mind could actually take care of many of these things if you get the pins straightened up somewhat the rest of them will straighten up dont you see so you can use 5way bracket and get there well the only real mistake you can make of course then is having so many flows that you really never get chance to get down to the root of the problem its all goes into the mechanics and then youll find youve shot the truck light the pc isnt even insession and you can make mistake the other way and that is to undercut that is to under number the flows you find the pc always runs something from out there in always runs something from out there in always runs something from out there in your emeter is going to start getting sticky needle your tone arm is going to start going up you wont know what in the name of common sense is happening now of course he has withholds so crudely you could get off withhold and stop him from doing this but you should understand why the emeter acted that way the emeter acted that way because he was running everything as motivator everything as motivator everything as motivator oh well yes yes i did have trouble with my family youll find in the problems intensive yes they beat and they beat and then my mother beat great deal and when she got tired my father would beat then they would both beat and then my older sister beat and then they all beat and that was that was times of course when they werent swearing at they used to swear at awful badly and uh and uh then i had an uncle george and he kicked he kicked well after long sad dissertation somewhere down along this line youre going to find this emeter will keep going up tone arm keeps going up the needle starts getting sticky and so on well hes just going motivatormotivatormotivatormotivatormotivator well of course thats just one flow them out there was hitting in toward him here you got the idea and youve got an inflow an inflow an inflow an inflow an inflow well hes been going on like this for years its not just in the auditing session youre just going on letting him do what he has been doing for years and years and years hes told everybody about how they beat him and how they kicked him and of course this is just more in more in more in well in view of the fact they didnt do half of these things or didnt do them at all hes not going to run anything out that really isnt there because in the first place whats holding it pinned is the fact theres never any flow going the other way theres reverse flow of any kind he never mentions what he did well he did he did outflow in fact the outflow is basic on the chain so until you trigger this outflow none of the inflow will release its quite mysterious you trigger it looks to him like well it was what he did and he really should have been guilty in the first place or something it looks it looks moral to him but in actual fact it is not moral its the fact that he started an outflow along certain tone scale level you see he decided to be mean and nasty and he gave out heck of lot of overts and he opened the gates wide open because he made line on which an interchange could occur and having made this line on which an interchange could occur now he can be inflowed upon on misemotional levels well for some reason or other every time he starts to get off his outflow line the inflow line attracts his attention and he can only pay attention to the motivators so he says motivatormotivatormotivatormotivatormotivator and he never gets well now you say what did you do what did you do and he says well not very much in fact ive never done anything and your needle gets little higher and it gets little stickier and you finally say well at one time the actual fact is when my father was beating he had down on the floor and he was beating with twoinchthick stick and he was beating very hard and i did i had an overt i frowned slightly and we and we move upstairs on that gradient and we eventually get his overts off and the beatings disappear which is all quite mysterious and that is simply based on this one horrible fact that thetan was never inflowed on until he himself had outflowed that is basic rule thetan was never inflowed on until he himself had outflowed and that you can mark your stars is right ill give you an example well you come along to this new planet now how is anybody going to know how to shoot at you figure it out how is anybody going to know how to shoot at you they dont even know youre there till you outflow see youre totally invisible till you outflow so you have to outflow in order to get an inflow so basic on the chain is always the outflow you arent visible until you outflow therefore you get an awful lot of social codes of the best and safest thing to do never say anything and never be anywhere thats safe see thats good and safe of course you never do anything and youll never see anything and nothing will ever happen thats true too nothing will ever happen nothing ever not for millions of years nothing will ever happen you see how it would be you would at never at any time outflow in any direction well the police evidently in many areas think this is just the thing because the only two things that are ever punished in this universe is communicating and being there if you will be there or communicate these things can be punished if you want to evade punishment and if there mustnt ever be any punishment of any character of course obviously if those are the two things that are punished just never communicate and never be there you wont live either but thats all right many people solve it this way somebody that you think of as being in apathy simply has solved the thing that way hes got life solved its all taped its all taped hell get along just fine if hes never there and he never speaks and he goes around and he gets reputation for being good listener and he gets reputation for this and he gets reputation for that and after while they know hes there and then they find out that hes inoffensive and hes very easy to inflow on so they kick him and that invalidates his solution his solution only applied to while he was out here in space someplace you see but where he adopts this as halfhearted modus operandi for existence it wont work yet youll see it taught as social code youll see in schools theyre always teaching some young boy or theyre teaching some young girl lot of girls wandering around have this down pat all you have to do is listen to man and not quite be there and never really be on time for appointments you know be little little bit late joggle it somehow that keeps man anxious they have ways and means of explaining why they do this you see theres lots of rationale about it actually all theyre doing is solving life by not communicating and not being there and then one day somebody gets mad at them and knocks their head off well why does somebody get mad at them well they get mad at them because theyre not there and theyre not communicating of course all right well i just wanted to go over this with flows because here you are going into problems intensives and all of sudden youre having to put together auditing commands and you find that these auditing commands are somewhat dependent on the subject of flows and being so dependent you must pay some attention to it this is something an auditor should always pay some attention to when hes putting together an auditing command one is clear the auditing command make it sure that the pc understands it make sure that the pc can answer it or get the thing squared around or spoken or worded so that it can be answered so that it can be understood thats clearing the auditing command the next is registering the auditing command on the meter which is almost clearing the auditing command but not quite lets make sure that this is something that makes the needle move lets not just dream up some oddball version of an auditing command then never inspect it on meter you should always look over your meter with regard to an auditing command youre going to run and the next thing is is every time you give command get it answered now those are the things to know about commands basically that youve got to get it answered get it understood get it runnable make sure that it registers and make sure that when you speak the command finally it is all set all squared away you know whats going to happen and when you speak the command you do get that question answered yeah its pretty hard one but part of putting together the auditing command is making sure that you dont set up stuck flow situation youre not going to run thing like think of beating your wife thank you think of beating your wife thank you think of beating your wife thank you think of beating your wife thank you think of beating your wife thank you think of beating your wife thank you after while the tone arm is going to rise the needle is going to stick and youre going to say well thats flat yeah well far as it went its flat its flat into ridge thats what it is youve made ridge hes out out out out out out the games condition of it is violated of course because beating your wife actually is giving her something it really is you know youd be surprised thats why war is degrading soldiers are always giving each other things you start to run it and you test it out and youll find out that itll run just that way be nice to the enemy give them some bullets now if you could run war if you could run war so that it was total inflow war that is to say that probably wouldnt work either but so that you never gave the enemy anything if you could run war so that you never gave the enemy anything never any bullets never any mockups never any signs of soldiers or anything like that why thatd be fine thatd probably work out all right but youd have to itd be peculiar kind of war youd have to figure out in order to make that come about but otherwise there sits the machine gunner holy cats you ever figure out the amount of weight of belt of machine gun bullets well hes just handed them gratuitously to the enemy hes giving them away and eventually will feel degraded then he explains it all to himself on religious basis he says well actually thou shalt not kill and here i am out killing and therefore because im doing that and these actually are this and so on and that and figures it all out and actually its the most fundamental of it is is hes giving something away while in games condition so he must be losing if he is giving away and he figures it out that hes losing the war if hes fighting the war if he fires any bullets during the war cause its total nonsense but thats the kind of the way this flow thing figures out then hell have thoughts about it and it is contrary to certain mores and then that gives him efforts to withhold so he is firing bullets while trying to withhold them and then hes got lot of things explained to himself as to why hes fighting the war and they have nothing to do with him so hes fighting the whole war on an irresponsibility if he kills any man thats not his fault its the war you see all of these things start adding up and you get so many lies and so many curves and so many vias that the whole thing becomes quite degrading after while but the an auditor shouldnt run countergamescondition process if he can possibly avoid it if its all give its contrary game conditions you can have it all receive and not be contrary games condition but its contrary to flows so these things you have to keep in mind in putting an auditing command together so you want to get some kind of grasp of exactly what they are and put the auditing command together so that flows will balance and the pc can understand it and so that when you finally haul back and let go with the auditing command it can be answered it will be answered and you are going to see that its answered and thats it and then dont wind up at the end of the session finding out that only 25 percent of your auditing commands were answered you gave twentyfive questions you must have twentyfive answers if question is missed you could even go back on this basis this is important enough so that you can ask pc you know the out the end rudiments are out see and during this session is there one auditing command you failed to answer almost important enough you see to be an end rudiment is there one auditing command or more that you failed to answer to your satisfaction and so forth in this session and all of sudden he tells you yes there was yes there was and your end rudiments go in you see its as magical as that but we count on the auditor making sure that those auditing questions are answered so we havent added it into the end rudiments yet but its actually important enough that if i were recomposing end rudiments i would probably put it in there all right well ive talked lot here tried to give you some answering of that you woke up something but ive had to hand out couple of twoway flows on problems already twoway flows you know i had to have double question for the problem because the problem was so gauged that the pc never would have reached the other side of flow it never would have balanced itself up in the run you see you can use an auditing command wording that the pc will run all sides of the auditing command like what was happening during that period well youve now asked him any flow that comes up he will tell you about dont you see what was happening during that period but now you say what were people doing during that period youve probably got him out of it see so youve deleted it down so if you said what were people doing youd also have to say what are you doing see what were you doing during that period you know youd have to balance it up but there are wordings of auditing commands which go as total you get wording of the auditing command so that it will take up any flow that comes up and there are quite few of them what is happening well or what was happening what was unknown should be one of them if it isnt such an introvertive problem also i should mention to you before i forget it that ow also runs that problem you know you could you could assess it out for some people and run ow on the people youd still run the problem you could say what part of that problem were you responsible for or have you been responsible for that would run that problem any one of the old problems processes would run on the problems intensive problem were just running the best one which is unknown you see pc couldnt get an idea of unknown you always have forget thats the lower harmonic of unknown what has been forgotten about that problem what have others forgotten what have you forgotten if you wanted to broaden it out forgotten is always the lower harmonic of unknown what didnt you know what didnt others know what shouldnt have been known about that you any theres lots of versions you remember all the versions i gave you on how to run an engram with notknow theres lot of them theres all the versions of unknown notknow forgotten they forgot shouldnt have known all of these things all these types of wordings actually could be run on that problem in trying to clear it with pc you see and the pc cant get the idea of unknown well you have other choices it isnt good enough to just leave the problem unrun youve got other choices there are many types of wordings and flows and so forth you could run problem with because i pointed out that in problems intensive your basic goal is to run the problem not to word it your basic goal is to run it you see and the reason you have that goal is you wish to clear it so therefore if youre going to run the problem you should run it in such way that it will clear and if you run it on stuck flow of course it wont and if you run it with the pc unable to do anything about it you wont yes female voice on this running problem do you use the terminal hm or the terminals name oh you use the terminal terminals name when you get problem now in that particular bracket you arent doing an assessment you shouldnt be assessing for any terminal or terminals name in the problem but if there is terminal inherent in the problem you just use that the whole question of getting the problem in problems intensive is getting the pcs statement of the problem its rather limited run you get the pcs statement of the problem now try to make an auditing command out of it as close to it as you possibly can that is an intelligible auditing command its very simple what evades you is the simplicity of it that is what will evade you female voice he wanted to please person hm female voice he wanted the problem was how to please person particular person well what did he say how to please i wa female voice how to please how to please joe female voice yeah all right but now the way you would apply this the person gave you the problem how to please joe all right now the way you apply this rule is the simplicity always go in the direction of the simplicity what was unknown about pleasing joe but we make sure that the pc understands that that it registers on the meter that it is answerable and that it doesnt violate too much of twoway flow now that doesnt necessarily violate because you havent said what is unknown about you pleasing joe you all you ask is what is unknown about pleasing joe well the flows will come into it but itll still clear probably but you hear the pc say giving him this giving him that giving him something else giving him something else giving him something else and you know right away now whats going to happen here his tone arm is going to go up up up up and then the needle is going to stick so youre running actually running into stuck flow in some fashion now you could simply stop the thing you know just casually just end the process momentarily without upsetting the pc i do that i do that very wordy theres theres whole ritual that i use connected with this i have whole boxedin ritual its very its done with surplice you know and you get this surplice on and you do this big ritual see and after youve burned the incense and everything else and interrupted the pc and gotten him out of session utterly you go through this ritual it has to do with wardrum chants and so forth now i say i say im now going to add another side to this and give him the other command and he usually never notices it he just answers it were going along how would you please joe how would you please joe and how whats unknown about pleasing joe whats unknown about pleasing joe i wouldnt know what to give him i wouldnt know what to give him i wouldnt know what to do to him i wouldnt know what to do for him i wouldnt know what and you say well if its all right with you now what were going to do is just add this other command and what isnt known about joe pleasing you and what isnt known about you pleasing joe thank you thats good and the pc thinks its all right and it goes along i did it so it must be all right you dont get him out of session either i it curls my hair sometimes when somebody uses piece of ritual to blast pc out of session get him totally disoriented get his agreement on something new clear brandnew auditing command with the pc use the next twenty minutes or so something like that getting it all straight what pc what session when all he had to do was just add the other leg of the command what in essence is he trying to do he sees his tone arm is going up and the thing is going to go stick and he says oh oh yes oh yes the flows are out yeah well and he just adds the other flow says well im going to add this other command all right here it is and bang or something on the order it wont upset you now if i add another command you know subtle youd be surprised how often pc settles right down when they know you mean business and youre getting auditing done if your intention is to get auditing done not to follow ritual or go into nonsense boy youd be surprised what you can do with pc you just tell them this is the session this is what were trying to do man and give them the auditing command and they stay right with it bang bang bang and the pc tries to give you bunch of this and he gives you bunch of that and so forth and you go around and you run an arc break and you go on and run another arc break and then you give him another command and then you run another arc break and you give him another command well if youre going that way with pc sometimes try this one try this one you give him an auditing command and the pc has an arc break give him the next auditing command the pc has an arc break give him the next auditing command make sure it gets answered and he has an arc break and give him the next auditing command make sure that it gets answered the pc says well all right and goes on and runs it to the end of the session you can hardly find trace of it in the end rudiments because youre sitting there giving the pc session the pc is insession clank hes in good solid control and the pc is really worried because he doesnt think youre going to give him session thats really why hes worried thats what worries him and when you go plow straight on giving the pc session the arc breaks vanish under the realization that hes having session thats always the better way to go about it pc blows session leaps out of the chair if youre not smart enough to be between the door and the pc always as standard practice you should get different ideas about pcs if the pc is nearer the door than you are what chance have you got of stopping pc who blows session none on several occasions pcs have blown session on and have always found between them and the door they never ever found getting up they never had chance to get out of their chair usually if they did get out of their chair id whirl them around put them back in their chair and give them the next auditing command and theyd say yow yow yow yow yowl and id say and the next auditing command is answer it oh oh well if thats the way youre going to be about it bang that was the end of that arc break and by george on the end rudiments you sometimes will look in vain for the incident its not buried its not occluded it just didnt bother em but this would have bothered em well did you have an arc break what did i say that upset you there what were you thinking of at the time you tried to blow well the pc will keep on blowing why because the pc is short of auditing the pc has an arc break because he is short of auditing the pc is having difficulty having auditing anything that goes wrong to pc in session is registered on the basis of scarcity of auditing just mark that down i dont care how complicated you want to make the statement it adds up to that and of course is best remedied then by giving the pc auditing all protests by the pc are from the basis of not receiving auditing he doesnt think hes receiving auditing and you just think over the number of protests youve made as pc the number of protests that youve heard as an auditor and they all add up to this youre not auditing see thats all they add up to or basically more fundamentally on the raw public or something like that is you couldnt do any good in other words youre not auditing boy scarcity of auditing is fantastic on people who dont know anything about it but do you know its just scarcity of auditing thats whats odd its scarcity some guy goes on and on and on about how terrible the central organization is and how awful it all is and how terrible the hgc is and so forth and how the auditors never audit anybody and he goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and then he winds up and says besides they charge too much and i cant afford to have any auditing there interesting fascinating but there is your basic protest and in handling all such commands or handling any auditing situation the best answer is always to give auditing now i lost your question in the run i hope i did answer it in passing okay female voice thank you ron all right okay we got time for one more question i did want to talk to you about flows again and about commands putting them together because youre getting into this strata of the problems intensive and youre going to have to have some oddball commands believe youre trying to security check somebody and they never security check on doing anything doing something to uncle harry oh i never did anything to uncle harry well what did you do really to uncle harry or what do you think you do or what was bad thing to do to uncle harry and so forth and you find out well i had an unkind thought about him and that is hell of an overt and this is the pcs level of overt to uncle harry so you have to right that moment start its actually you start kind of an auditing question what unkind thought have you had about uncle harry you see and this will run and run and run and all of sudden youll find out that this doesnt run anymore although they have more unkind thoughts about uncle harry or what is this all about and then youll find the other side of it is youve run into stuck flow youre running stuck flow see unkind thought that he didnt tell didnt tell didnt tell didnt tell didnt tell you get the idea didnt tell didnt say didnt say and youre just ripe for one did you ever do anything to uncle harry oh i never did anything to uncle harry i just broke his golf clubs one time and stuffed mud down the barrel of his shotgun and of course that was reasonable in view of all of the things he used to think about oh yes and uh oh yes and broke his razor and uh yes as matter of fact ran his car oh that one oh well wait minute now we find it see they wrecked uncle harrys car they ran it into telegraph pole and that was it and it wasnt even insured and he couldnt even buy another car and it was fantastic situation this is all buried under the unkind thought but you could overrun one dont you see you could overrun an auditing flow line and you have to pay some attention to that because theres ritual i can write up thatll get you over it because sometimes it runs and sometimes it doesnt run pc you can sit there on black and white on pc who has field and if you run exactly the right flow the field will go white and then you reverse the flow the field will go black its the most mysterious thing you ever saw its easy to do you you should see some of these phenomena that associate themselves with flows it all goes together with putting together auditing commands you have to be doing it thats it okay time for one more question what is it yes reg male voice what uh would be the criteria for the length of problems inten of uh of this problems intensive the criterion of what now male voice of how long to run it how long to run problems intensive male voice yes thats total tone arm tone arm now tone arm going flat can go flat from two sources thats why im being so insistent here about flows tone arm can stop moving because the flow is out but if youre running proper auditing command getting it answered and so on the tone arm will move normally and you just run it with the twenty minute test on the problem its good thing to get that problem out of the road and to get that real good and flat before you go into your check and how long to run it you run it exactly against the tone arm does that answer your question male voice well i was wondering is there another problem going to come up when you flatten the first one oh but you never run the second problem male voice you dont run it oh male voice you cant run the confusion uh with the with the uh change stuff well youre going to run the one problem youre going to run that flat on the tone arm when the tone arm is longer moving then youre going to do an assessment of people in the confusion immediately prior to that situation all right now having done an assessment on all these people youre going to wind up there with one person and youre going to run some security check on that person youre not going to admit of anything else happening nothing else can happen the pc thinks of eightyfive more problems thats just tough theyre simply under the heading of cognitions you say fine the pc says he has problem with that person you say fine thats dandy and you just go ahead and run your security check on that person as soon as that person longer reacts on the needle you run another assessment on that list and you run that person flat be prepared about that time to find an unknown personnel suddenly leaping into view who is the central character of the whole ruddy lot put that person down and that person assesses this time and run the security check against that person and youll wind up at the other end with this list here in state where you can read off these names and you dont get wild needle reaction in other words its not charge situation now its not charge situation and so you just leave it you just leave it and now you go back you take you file that p section and you get another completely new p section if you have done very poor section which is to say the changes on are not selfdetermined changes but otherdetermined changes something like this and you just got whole bunch of occurrences operations and that sort of thing you have trouble getting new assessment that will make any sense to you so make sure that section is okay but then you just reassess the section and do brandnew p form right straight across you only want one problem you only want one set of people you can add to that set of people you cant add to the problem does that answer your question male voice well yes ron except for there i am asking how it will be intensive how will we keep running problems on this individual uh ive got the one incident run right through and all right all right how long do you want to run this male voice yes okay male voice whats the criterion there the criterion far as its concerned is the pc has many difficulties as you assess these one after the other and go down the line of his section and you dont get anything in the way of an assessment youre through in other words these things are longer troubling the pc these changes which you have assessed are longer troubling the pc then you are through with that intensive thats how long you would run it now how many hours that would take to run would be too difficult an estimate i originally planned this as twelveandahalfhour run thats how long it would take to run one i dont know what its going to get into because ive seen three sessions to do an list just done at the end of the third complete session all of which should have been done at the end of the first session see so i wouldnt say i dare say that on rather difficult pc an auditor auditing fairly rapidly id say twentyfive hours should cover it fairly well but that isnt the last youre going to see of this problems intensive you see you this isnt the last youre going to see of this youre going to do after that youre going to run the prehav level on the terminal and youre going to run those terminal the terminal on those levels and youre going to get some of those out of the road youre going to straighten up some of the engrams that you run into youre going to run some more levels and then youre going to do this thing on the whole track its almost identical with the form and its not much change after youve opened the fellows track up one way or the other you say well now what selfdetermined changes have you had in your lives and you do an session section on that and so on probably have to be some other wrinkles connected with it but that isnt the last you will see of that and it never pays to use up too much time on persons present life one it doesnt pay actually to audit pc too long who can only remember their present life and who has never seen past track facsimile and so forth your problems intensive will actually blast that open get goal get terminal do problems intensive and i guarantee you that he will be looking at the past track all right now to open up that past track level runs and then engram runs and some more levels now youre going to have lot of past track open and then you could do much more effective problems intensive you think this first one here is effective and produces wows on the pc well wait till you do one of these whole track ones yeah thats pretty wild for instance i dont know i ought to get somebody to do one of these present life problems intensives on see how it goes because in the first place i havent been able to stay in that zone and area i cant think of single problem ive had in this lifetime they all all are somewhere else theyre old friends these problems does that answer your question reg male voice yes thank you you bet yes female voice how does this new rundown affect the routines what new rundown here female voice this and p were doing this on uh this time lifetime and were going to do it on whole track as well what female voice this and p section you mean this new this problems intensive were doing now female voice yes has nothing to do with whole track female voice yes you said were going to do it against the whole track problems intensive ahhh you come on come on come on twist your brains around here listen eventually means when pc is ready for it we will do whole track problems intensive but if pc isnt ready for it and youre just at the beginning well do present life problems intensive this doesnt mean that eventually were going to change our minds and on all pcs we do whole track problems intensives see theres difference here what weve got essentially is progressive opening up of track and youll find that the pc somewhere on down the line after you think hes going to go clear and everything is very nice will all of sudden jam well this mystery of his jamming is the fact hes run into new problems chain of some kind or another and you have opened up new circuit and youre running through new series of hidden standards and therefore the pc doesnt go clear but ive been studying here the barriers to clear that doesnt influence it at all okay female voice doesnt influence the routines 1 2 and 3 at all what routine female voice routines 1 2 and 3 another female voice were only doing routine 3 and problems intensive now female voice okay thank you that answers it routines are routines this doesnt influence any of those routines routine 3 is exactly what it is which is actually goals and terminal assessment with security checking and prehav level runs that is exactly what routine 3 is its never been anything else and its not going to be problems intensive problems intensive is actually broad method of doing rudiments and security checks and you shouldnt look at it as anything else but method of doing broad rudiments and broad security checking and thats all it is it looks like brandnew package but if you investigate it very carefully it gets the rudiments in and gets the security checking done where itll do the most good okay female voice thank you ron okay now by next tuesday i trust that some of you will have finished this problems intensive and you will have that all straightened out and thatll all be going on swimmingly and youll be getting on to your prehav level runs by next tuesday i have certain impatience about this and i have news for you the number of problems person has is in direct proportion to the slowness that he audits the number of problems person has tells you exactly how fast he will work in life if he has quite few problems he may get hectic and work hysterically fast but then he will eventually slow down hell tire out but the number of problems person has determines his speed of accomplishment and if you want anybody to speed up in life in general just care take care of his problems get his stuck problems out of the way and get those things all squared up and you will find that the individual speeds up in doingness in life that works by the way thats quite handy thing to know you see that workman or an executive or something like that just cant ever seem to accomplish anything well he has problems
