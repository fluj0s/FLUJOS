for additional information about the medicare funding warning see crs report rs22796 medicare trigger by hinda chaikind and christopher m davis crs2 finally the program management budget account request for 2009 is 331 billion of that 331 billion 70 or 234 billion would be directed towards medicare administrative operations activities such as processing and paying claims responding to beneficiary questions and conducting appeals the remaining 30 of the 331 billion would be directed towards compensating individuals employed at cms performing surveys and inspections of medicare provider facilities and conducting research the presidents budget also includes legislative proposal to collect 35 million in revisit user fees from health care facilities found to be deficient during an initial medicare inspection or recertification enactment of the revisit fee proposal is contingent upon authorizing legislation the rest of this report includes brief discussions of current and proposed law for each of the 2009 medicare program proposals along with table 1 which details the administrations estimates of the costs and savings for each proposal the presidents budget reflects the passage of the medicare medicaid and schip extension act of 2007 pl 110173 table 2 provides list of crs staff contacts for this report medicare part inpatient acute care hospital update current law inpatient services provided by acute care hospitals are reimbursed based on the inpatient prospective payment system ipps on the basis of their medicare discharges each year medicares ipps per discharge payment amount is increased annually by an update factor that is determined in part by the projected increase in the hospital market basket mb index the mb is fixed price index that measures the change in the price of goods and services purchased by hospitals to create one unit of output typically hospitals have received less than the mb index as an annual update for fy2007 and beyond however hospitals that submit required quality data will receive the full mb update for inpatient services those that do not submit the data will receive reduction so that the inpatient update will be mb minus 2 percentage points starting in fy2007 the reduction for not submitting quality data would apply for the applicable year and would not be taken into account in subsequent years presidents proposal acute care hospitals would receive zero percent update for inpatient services provided in fy2009 through fy2011 regardless of whether inpatient quality data is submitted the inpatient hospital update would be set at mb minus 065 percentage points for subsequent years the presidents budget estimates that the proposal would save 399 billion in fy2009 and 642 billion over the fiveyear budget period skilled nursing facility update current law skilled nursing facility snf care is reimbursed based on prospective payment system pps the pps payments are based on daily per diem urban or rural base payment amount that is adjusted for case mix and area crs3 wages using the hospital wage index the urban and rural federal per diem payment rates are increased annually by an update factor that is determined by the projected increase in the snf market basket index this index measures changes in the costs of goods and services purchased by snfs medicare law requires that the snf base payments be adjusted each year by the snf market basket mb update the measure of inflation of goods and services used by snfs for fy2008 the snf payment update is the full market basket increase of 33 the update for future years without changes to current law is also the full market basket increase presidents proposal under the presidents proposal snf payments would be frozen in fy2009 through fy2011 and annually updated by the mb minus 065 in fy2012 and beyond the presidents budget estimates that the proposal would save 990 million in fy2009 and 1703 billion over the fiveyear budget period between fy2009 and fy2013 hospice payment update current law payments for hospice care are based on one of four prospectively determined rates which correspond to four different levels of care for each day beneficiary is under the care of the hospice the four rate categories are routine home care continuous home care inpatient respite care and general inpatient care the prospective payment rates are updated annually by the increase in the hospital market basket the fy2008 payment rates are updated by the market basket increase of 33 without changes to medicare law the update will grow by the market basket for fy2009 and beyond presidents proposal hospice payments would be frozen in fy2009 through fy2011 and annually updated by the mb minus 065 percentage points in fy2012 and beyond the presidents budget estimates that the proposal would save 350 million in fy2009 and 514 billion over the fiveyear budget period between fy2009 and fy2013 inpatient rehabilitation facility irf update current law inpatient rehabilitation facilities irfs are paid based upon the inpatient rehabilitation facilities prospective payment system irfpps and paid fixed amount per discharge the annual update to the payment is based on the mb for rehabilitation psychiatric and longterm care presidents proposal the irf per discharge payment amount would be frozen in fy2010 and fy2011 and increased by the mb minus 065 percentage points in subsequent years the presidents budget estimates that the proposal would save 510 million in fy2009 and 482 billion over the fiveyear budget period according to the presidents budget documents these savings include the impact of repealing certain provisions of sections 114 and 115 of the extension act of 2007 however further details are provided crs4 longterm care hospital ltch update current law longterm care hospitals ltchs are paid based upon the ltchpps and paid fixed amount per discharge the annual update to the payment is based on the mb for rehabilitation psychiatric and longterm care presidents proposal the ltchs per discharge payment amount would be frozen in fy2009 and fy2011 and increased by the mb minus 065 percentage points in subsequent years the presidents budget estimates that the proposal would save 320 million in fy2009 and 294 billion over the fiveyear budget period according to the presidents budget documents these savings include the impact of repealing certain provisions of sections 114 and 115 of the extension act of 2007 however further details are provided reduce acute care hospital capital payments current law medicare pays the capital related costs of inpatient hospital services using prospective payment system that is similar to that used to reimburse hospitals for their operating costs presidents proposal the proposal would reduce capital payments made to acute care hospitals by 5 in fy2009 the budget includes estimated savings of 490 million in fy2009 and 305 billion over the fiveyear budget period for this proposal reduce disproportionate share hospital dsh payments made to acute care hospitals current law medicare provides additional funds to hospitals that qualify for disproportionate share hospital dsh adjustment approximately 2700 hospitals receive the additional payments for each medicare discharge based on formula which incorporates the number of patient days provided to lowincome medicare beneficiaries those who receive supplemental security income ssi and medicaid recipients few urban hospitals known as pickle hospitals receive dsh payments under an alternative formula that considers the proportion of hospitals patient care revenues that are received from state and local indigent care funds the percentage addon for which hospital will qualify varies according to the hospitals bed size or urban or rural location presidents proposal the proposal would phase in 30 reduction in dsh payments made to acute care hospitals over two years starting in fy2009 the budget includes estimated savings of 175 billion in fy2009 and 2069 billion over the fiveyear budget period for this proposal change the budget neutrality requirement for hospital geographic reclassifications current law medicare payments to acute care hospitals are adjusted by the wage index of the area where hospital is located in certain circumstances crs5 hospital can apply for and receive reclassification to an area with higher wage index geographic reclassifications established by decisions of the medicare geographic classification review board are required by statute to be budget neutral accordingly the per discharge amount used to pay all hospitals is reduced presidents proposal under this proposal the budget neutrality offset for all the reclassified hospitals within state would be achieved by adjusting the wage index values for hospitals within that state rather than reducing the per discharge amount for all hospitals in the nation the budget includes savings for this proposal rationalize postacute hospital payments current law patients receiving treatment for certain conditions such as hip and knee replacements can receive rehabilitative care in variety of postacute care settings including skilled nursing facility snf and an inpatient rehabilitation facility irf generally care provided in an irf is paid at higher rate than care provided in snf presidents proposal the proposal would encourage development of site neutral reimbursement rates for conditions that overlap in the different postacute care settings the proposal would limit payment differentials for the following five conditions 1 knee replacements 2 hip replacements 3 hip fractures 4 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 5 other pulmonary diseases the base irf payments for these service would begin with the snf rate increased by 1 25 of the difference between the snf and irf overhead amount and 2 33 of the difference between snf and irf patient care costs the budget includes estimated savings of 250 million in fy2009 and 165 billion over the fiveyear budget period for this proposal establish hospital valuebased purchasing program current law section 501b of the mma provided an incentive for an eligible hospital to submit quality data for ten quality measures known as the starter set in order to avoid 04 percentage point reduction in its annual payment update from cms for fy2005 2006 and 2007 section 5001a of the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 dra required hospitals to report additional quality measures to receive the full market basket increase to their payment rates payment rates were reduced by 2 percentage points for any hospital that did not submit certain quality data in form and manner and at time specified by the secretary the dra required cms to develop and implement method for hospital valuebased purchasing in 2009 the valuebased purchasing system must be budget neutral while creating incentives for highquality hospitals and minimum benchmarks for lowquality hospitals the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109432 trhca requires hospital outpatient departments to submit data on quality measures in order to avert 2 percentage point reduction in their annual payments starting in 2009 crs6 presidents proposal the presidents budget mentions valuebased purchasing programs for hospitals but does not include specifics however the proposals are expected to achieve 165 billion in savings over the fiveyear window from 2009 to 2013 adjust hospital payment for never events current law the trhca directs the inspector general in the department of health and human services to study and report to congress on 1 the incidences of never events those listed and endorsed as serious reportable events by the national quality forum nqf as of november 16 2006 for medicare beneficiaries 2 the extent to which the medicare program paid denied payment or recouped payment for services furnished in connection with such events and the extent to which beneficiaries paid for them and 3 the administrative processes of cms to detect such events and to deny or recoup payments for related services according to nqf never events are errors in medical care that are clearly identifiable preventable and serious in their consequences for patients and indicate real problem in the safety and credibility of health care facility examples of never events include surgery on the wrong body part foreign body left in patient after surgery mismatched blood transfusion major medication error severe pressure ulcer acquired in the hospital and preventable postoperative deaths presidents proposal the proposal would prohibit medicare payment for never event hospitals would also be required to report occurrences of never events or receive reduced annual update the presidents budget does not include savings in fy2009 but does include estimated savings of 190 million over the fiveyear budget period medicare part b physicians services current law medicare payments for services of physicians and certain non physician practitioners are made on the basis of fee schedule the fee schedule is intended to relate payments for given service to the actual resources used in providing that service the fee schedule assigns relative values to services that reflect physician work ie the time skill and intensity it takes to provide the service practice expenses and malpractice costs the relative values are adjusted for geographic variations in costs the adjusted relative values are then converted into dollar payment amount by conversion factor the conversion factor for the first half of 2008 is 380870 05 above the 2007 level the fee schedule places limit on payment per service but not on overall volume of services the formula for calculating the annual update to the conversion factor responds to changes in volume if the overall volume of services increases the update is lower if the overall volume is reduced the update is higher the intent of the formula is to place restraint on overall increases in medicare spending for physicians services several factors enter into the calculation these include 1 the crs7 medicare economic index mei which measures inflation in the inputs needed to produce physicians services 2 the sustainable growth rate sgr which is essentially target for medicare spending growth for physicians services and 3 an adjustment that modifies the update which would otherwise be allowed by the mei to bring spending in line with the sgr target the sgr target is not limit on expenditures rather the fee schedule update reflects the success or failure in meeting the target if expenditures exceed the target the update for future year is reduced as result payments to physicians were reduced in 2002 physician payments have been slated for reductions in each year since 2002 but congressional actions have prevented these reductions through june 2008 on december 29 2007 the president signed into law the medicare medicaid and schip extension act of 2007 pl 110173 this law sets minimum update of 05 for januaryjune 2008 in the absence of further legislation the reduced conversion factor slated to go into effect january 1 2008 will go into effect on july 1 2008 with further reductions taken in subsequent years presidents proposal the presidents proposal does not address the physician payment update thus the cut in the conversion factor slated to go into effect in july 2008 and the further reduction slated for january 2009 would be allowed to go into effect with new budgetary savings or costs outpatient hospital update current law hospital outpatient department hopd services are paid based on an outpatient prospective payment system opps the unit of payment is the individual service or procedure as assigned to an ambulatory payment classification apc medicares payment for hopd services is calculated by multiplying the relative weight associated with an apc by conversion factor the conversion factor is updated on calendar year schedule these annual updates are based on the hospital mb starting in cy2009 however the outpatient update for hospitals that do not submit required quality data will be the mb minus 2 percentage points the reduction for not submitting quality data would apply for the applicable year and would not be taken into account in subsequent years presidents proposal hospitals would receive zero percent update for outpatient services provided in fy2009 through fy2011 regardless of whether the required quality data is submitted the hopd update would be set at mb minus 065 percentage points for subsequent years the presidents budget estimates that the proposal would save 580 million in fy2009 and 605 billion over the fiveyear budget period ambulatory surgery center update current law until january 1 2008 medicare used fee schedule to pay for the facility services related to surgery provided in an ambulatory surgery center asc the associated physician services surgery and anesthesia are reimbursed under the physician fee schedule the asc fee schedule was periodically increased by the consumer price index for all urban consumers cpiu the medicare crs8 prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 pl 108173 mma changed the update cycle from fiscal year to calendar year and eliminated updates for calendar years 2006 though 2009 mma also established that revised payment system for surgical services furnished in an asc will be implemented on or after january 1 2006 and not later than january 1 2008 the new asc payment system implemented on phased in basis starting january 1 2008 is based on the opps used to pay for hopd services as established by the trhca starting in cy2009 the annual increase for ascs that do not submit required quality data may be the required update minus 2 percentage points presidents proposal the asc conversion factor would be frozen in cy2010 and cy2011 and would be established at the cpi minus 065 percentage points in subsequent years if applicable ascs that do not submit quality data will receive the additional 2percentagepoint reduction the presidents budget does not include savings in fy2009 but does include estimated savings of 450 million over the fiveyear budget period ambulance services current law ambulance services are paid on the basis of fee schedule the fee schedule establishes seven categories of ground ambulance services and two categories of air ambulance services the national fee schedule is fully phased in for air ambulance services for ground ambulance services payments through 2009 are equal to the greater of the national fee schedule or blend of the national and regional fee schedule amounts the portion of the blend based on national rates is 80 for 20072009 in 2010 and subsequently the payments in all areas will be based on the national fee schedule amount the payment for service equals base rate for the level of service plus payment for mileage geographic adjustments are made to portion of the base rate additionally the base rate is increased for air ambulance trips originating in rural areas and mileage payments are increased for all trips originating in rural areas there is 25 bonus on the mileage rate for trips of 51 miles and more the fee schedule amounts are updated each year by the cpiu the update for 2008 is 27 presidents proposal payments for ambulance services would be frozen for the threeyear period 2009 2011 thereafter they would be annually updated by the cpiu minus 065 percentage points the budget includes estimated savings of 60 million in fy2009 and 127 billion over the fiveyear budget period for this proposal competitive bidding for laboratory services current law section 302b of the mma required cms to conduct demonstration project on the application of competitive acquisition for payment of most clinical laboratory services that would otherwise be payable under the medicare crs9 part b fee schedule pap smears and colorectal cancer screening tests are excluded from this demonstration cms has outlined how the competitive bidding process will work when the demonstration program begins operation certain laboratories will be required to bid in the demonstration these are laboratory firms with 100000 or more in annual medicare part b feeforservice payments for tests covered in the demonstration provided to beneficiaries residing in the competitive bidding areas cbas regardless of where the laboratory firm is located small laboratories or laboratory firms with less than 100000 in annual medicare part b feeforservice payments for demonstration tests provided to beneficiaries residing in the cbas would not be required to bid the competitively set demonstration fee schedule will be used to pay for laboratory services in the cba for the duration of the demonstration multiple winners are expected in each cba beneficiaries will only be able to receive services from winning bidders and entities not required to and did not bid cms has stated that the demonstration will apply in two metropolitan statistical areas msas the san diego metropolitan area has been selected as the first location the project has not yet begun presidents proposal the proposal would extend the use of competitive bidding to all laboratory services the budget includes estimated savings of 110 million in fy2009 and 229 billion over the fiveyear budget period for this proposal shortterm power wheelchair rentals current law in general medicare pays for certain durable medical equipment dme items such as hospital beds nebulizers and powerdriven wheelchairs under the capped rental category suppliers are required to transfer the title of dme equipment in the capped rental category to the beneficiary after 13 month rental period beneficiaries have the option to purchase powerdriven wheelchairs when they are initially furnished presidents proposal the proposal would establish 13month rental period for power wheelchairs to ensure that chair is not purchased if the period of medical need is less than 13 months the budget includes estimated savings of 80 million in fy2009 and 720 million over the fiveyear budget period for this proposal limit oxygen rental period current law rental payments for oxygen equipment including portable oxygen equipment are converted to ownership at 36 months the supplier is required to transfer the title of the equipment to the beneficiary at that time medicare will continue to make payments for oxygen contents in the case of gaseous and liquid oxygen for the period of medical need crs10 presidents proposal the proposal would move oxygen and oxygen equipment from 36month rental period to 13month period the same as the capped rental category medicare would continue to pay for refills of gaseous and liquid oxygen as medically necessary the budget includes estimated savings of 210 million in fy2009 and 300 billion over the fiveyear budget period for this proposal medicare parts and b home health update current law home health agencies hhas are paid under prospective payment system payment is based on 60day episodes of care for beneficiaries subject to several adjustments with unlimited episodes of care in year the payment covers skilled nursing therapy medical social services aide visits and medical supplies the base payment amount or national standardized 60day episode rate is increased annually by an update factor that is determined in part by the projected increase in the home health market basket index this index measures changes in the costs of goods and services purchased by hhas for hhas that submit the required quality data the home health mb update is the full 3 for fy2008 for hhas that do not submit this quality data their increase will be reduced by 2 percentage points to 1 for cy 2008 without changes to current law payments for fy2009 and future years would continue to be updated by the market basket presidents proposal payments for hhas would be frozen in fy2009 through 2013 and thereafter they would be annually updated by the mb minus 065 percentage points for this proposal the hhs budget includes an estimated savings of 440 million in fy2009 and 1103 billion over the fiveyear budget period of fy2009 through fy2013 endstage renal disease payment modernization current law medicare reimbursement for dialysis services is paid based on basic casemix adjusted prospective payment system for dialysis services furnished either at facility or in patients home the basic casemix adjusted system has two components 1 the composite rate which covers services including dialysis and 2 drug payment adjustment for the difference between the payment amounts for separately billable drugs and biologicals and their acquisition costs as determined by inspector general reports additionally certain drugs biologicals and laboratory tests are billed separately the secretary is required to update the basic casemix adjusted payment amounts annually beginning with 2006 but only for that portion of the casemix adjusted system that is represented by the addon adjustment and not for the portion represented by the composite rate dialysis services are offered in three outpatient settings hospitalbased facilities independent facilities and the patients home there are two methods for crs11 payment under method i facilities are paid prospectively set amount known as the composite rate for each dialysis session regardless of whether services are provided at the facility or in the patients home the composite rate is derived from audited cost data and adjusted for the national proportion of patients dialyzing at home versus in facility and for area wage differences hospitalbased dialysis facilities receive an upwards adjustment to the composite rate beneficiaries electing home dialysis may choose not to be associated with facility and may make independent arrangements with supplier for equipment supplies and support services payment to these suppliers known as method ii is made on the basis of reasonable charges limited to 100 of the median hospital composite rate except for patients on continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis when the limit is 130 of the median hospital composite rate presidents proposal beginning cy2009 the payment for providers of dialysis services furnished by hospitalbased facilities would be the same as the rate for such services furnished by renal dialysis facilities that are not hospital based bundled payment system under which single payment would be made for medicare renal dialysis services would be implemented and rebased beginning cy2011 the budget includes estimated savings of 10 million in fy2009 and 106 billion over the fiveyear budget period for this proposal extend medicare secondary payer status for end stage renal disease current law under medicare secondary payer msp rules medicare is prohibited from making payments for any item or service when payment has been made or can reasonably be expected to be made by third party payer for individuals with medicare entitlement based solely on endstage renal disease esrd msp rules apply for those covered by an employersponsored group plan regardless of the employer size or current employment status medicare entitlement based on esrd usually begins with the third month after the month in which the beneficiary starts regular course of dialysis referred to as the threemonth waiting period in addition to the waiting period for individuals whose medicare eligibility is based solely on esrd any group health plan coverage they receive through their employer or their spouses employer is the primary payer for the first 30 months of esrd benefit eligibility referred to as the 30month coordination period after 30 months medicare becomes the primary insurer medicare coverage ends 12 months after the month the beneficiary stops dialysis treatment or 36 months after the month the beneficiary has successful kidney transplant however if medicare coverage ends and then begins again based on esrd the 30month coordination period will also begin again large group health plan is plan offered by an employer that normally employed at least 100 employees on typical business day during the preceding calendar year this also applies to certain smaller plans that are part of multiple or multiemployer plan crs12 presidents proposal beginning in 2009 the coordination period for esrd msp would be extended to from 30 months to 60 months but only for those individuals who receive group coverage through large group health plan the budget includes estimated savings of 110 million in fy2009 and 111 billion over the fiveyear budget period for this proposal eliminate indirect medical education payments for managed care enrollees current law as established by the balanced budget act of 1997 bba97 medicare makes separate additional direct graduate medical education and indirect medical education ime payments to teaching hospitals to account for the inpatient care provided to medicares managed care enrollees in addition the value of ime is also included in the maximum amount medicare is willing to pay part c plans for services to medicare enrollees in certain locations and in certain years presidents proposal the proposal would eliminate separate ime payments to teaching hospitals for the medicare managed care enrollees that they serve it would not reduce payments made directly to medicare advantage plans the budget includes estimated savings of 101 billion in fy2009 and 885 billion over the fiveyear budget period for this proposal reduce indirect medical education ime adjustment current law teaching hospitals that train physicians in approved residency programs have higher medicare inpatient costs per discharge than nonteaching hospitals these hospitals receive an indirect medical education adjustment ime based on statutory formula that increases payments by about 55 for each 10 increase in teaching intensity in fy2008 medpac has found that the ime adjustment is set higher than the empirically estimated increase in hospitals cost per case due to teaching presidents proposal the proposal would lower the ime add on payment from 55 to 22 over threeyear transition period starting in fy2009 the budget includes estimated savings of 890 million in fy2009 and 129 billion over the fiveyear budget period for this proposal premiums and interactions part b premiums current law medicare part b is financed through combination of beneficiary premiums and federal general revenues in general beneficiary premiums equal 25 of estimated program costs for the aged the disabled pay the same premium as the aged federal general revenues account for the remaining 75 the 2008 premium is 9640 crs13 beginning in 2007 higherincome enrollees pay higher percentage of part b costs the increase is phased in over three years in 2008 they pay total premiums ranging from 317 to 617 of the value of part b when fully phasedin during 2009 higher income individuals will pay total premiums ranging from 35 to 80 of the value of part b cms estimates that 5 of enrollees will pay the higher premiums in 2008 for singles the higher monthly premium amounts are 12220 for beneficiaries with incomes in 2006 over 82000 and less than or equal to 102000 16090 for incomes over 102000 and less than or equal to 153000 19970 for incomes greater than 153000 and less than or equal to 205000 and 23840 for incomes greater than 205000 for couples filing joint tax returns the premium amounts are 12220 for beneficiaries with incomes over 164000 and less than or equal to 204000 16090 for incomes over 204000 and less than or equal to 306000 19970 for incomes greater than 306000 and less than or equal to 410000 and 23840 for incomes greater than 410000 the income thresholds for higher part b premiums are increased each year by the percentage increase in the cpiu presidents proposal the proposal would eliminate the annual cpiu adjustments consequently each year the number of beneficiaries subject to the higher premium would increase the budget includes estimated savings of 110 million in fy2009 and 257 billion over the fiveyear budget period for this proposal part d premiums current law in 2006 medicare part d began providing coverage for outpatient prescription drugs for medicare beneficiaries coverage is provided through private prescription drug plans pdps or medicare advantage prescription drug mapd plans the program relies on these private plans to provide coverage and to bear some of the financial risk for drug costs federal subsidies covering the bulk of the risk is provided to encourage participation unlike other medicare services the benefits can only be obtained through private plans further while all plans have to meet certain minimum requirements there are significant differences among them in terms of benefit design drugs included on plan formularies ie list of covered drugs and costsharing applicable for particular drugs medicare part d is financed through combination of beneficiary premiums and federal general revenues in addition certain transfers are made from the states beneficiaries pay different premiums depending on the plan they have selected on average beneficiary premiums account for 255 of expected total part d costs for basic coverage except for persons entitled to lowincome subsidies all persons selecting particular part d plan pay the same monthly premium amount crs14 presidents proposal the proposal would establish incomerelated premiums for part d3 under the proposal the income thresholds would be the same as those established for incomerelating part b premiums see above further as proposed for part b the income thresholds would not be updated in future years consequently each year the number of beneficiaries subject to the higher premium would increase the budget includes estimated savings of 350 million in fy2009 and 318 billion over the fiveyear budget period for this proposal interaction with medicaid current law medicaid provides coverage for medicare part b premiums for certain lowincome persons one coverage group is known as qualifying individuals 1 qi1s individuals are eligible as qi1s if they are entitled to medicare part their incomes are at least 120 of the federal poverty level but less than 135 and they have limited assets the benefit for the qi1 group was originally set to expire in december 2002 however congress has extended the provision on several occasions most recently pl 110173 extended the coverage through june 2008 presidents proposal the presidents medicaid proposals include an extension of the qi program through september 30 2009 the medicare costs reflect program expenditures for this group of individuals the budget includes estimated costs of 270 million in fy2009 and 270 million over the fiveyear budget period for this proposal use and release of medicare claims data current law the president has proposed healthcare transparency initiative with the stated goals of making quality and price and cost information available to allow consumers employers and payers to choose better value in healthcare the presidents corresponding executive order emphasized the sharing of information on health care quality and cost promoting interoperable health information technology hit systems and providing incentives for consumers to choose efficient high quality providers presidents proposal the presidents proposal would seek broader authority to release medicare feeforservice claims and other data for purposes of quality improvement performance measurement and public reporting this proposal aims to improve the transparency and availability of comparative health care cost and quality data for beneficiaries the budget includes savings associated with this proposal premium interactions the savings for the individual proposals listed in table 1 are the gross savings however there is an offsetting cost associated with part b benefit savings 3 though specifics are not provided it is expected that the percentage increases would be tied to benchmark premium for basic coverage crs15 that occurs because any savings to the program are shared between the medicare program and beneficiaries as beneficiaries pay share generally 25 of program costs or for certain higher income beneficiaries larger share of program costs for example for those beneficiaries paying 25 of premiums for every dollar saved the medicare outlays will be reduced by about 075 and beneficiaries will save about 025 the estimated offsetting costs are shown in the interaction line of the table 692 million in fy2009 and 6474 billion over the fiveyear budget period fortyfive percent rule the medicare trigger the mma amended the social security act adding an additional responsibility that requires the medicare board of trustees to examine and make determination if general revenue medicare funding is expected to exceed 45 of medicare outlays for the current fiscal year or any of the next six fiscal years an affirmative determination in two consecutive annual reports is considered to be medicare funding warning in the year in which the second report is made4 because the medicare trustees issued such warning in 2007 mma requires that the president submit legislation to congress responding to the warning within the 15day period beginning on the date of the budget submission to congress this year the presidents budget proposal would reduce medicare provider payments by 04 in beginning in any year that the general revenue medicare funding is expected to exceed 45 of medicare outlays this reduction would increase each year until the percentage falls below the 45 trigger level quality improvement organization qio proposals funding for the ninth sow current law medicare contracts with private organizations called quality improvement organizations qios to monitor and improve the quality of care provided to medicare beneficiaries to fulfill this responsibility qios perform diverse mix of activities for the medicare program including providing technical assistance to providers on quality improvement investigating beneficiary complaints related to the quality of care and reviewing the necessity of medical services delivered to medicare beneficiaries operating under threeyear contracts called statements of work sows cms contracts with 41 organizations to provide services to medicare beneficiaries in all 50 states puerto rico the district of columbia and the virgin islands with an estimated budget of 123 billion the 41 qios are scheduled to complete the eighth sow in july 2008 presidents proposal the presidents budget provides 11 billion to the qios for the ninth sow set to begin in august 2008 for the ninth sow the qios 4 for additional information about the medicare funding warning see crs report rs22796 medicare trigger by hinda chaikind and christopher m davis crs16 will provide technical assistance and quality improvement assistance to providers in support of three themes 1 prevention of chronic illness 2 reducing unnecessary hospitalizations and 3 patient safety the presidents budget also proposes changes to qio oversight and management such as requiring ongoing performance management reviews financial penalties for qios that do not meet certain performance thresholds and targeted funding to areas with low performing providers allowing the secretary to determine geographic scope of qio contracts current law the secretary is required to establish geographic areas throughout the united states with respect to qio contracts each state must be designated as geographic area the secretary has the authority to establish local or regional areas as geographic areas only when the volume of medical necessity reviews or other factors warrant such an establishment if the secretary does decide to establish local or regional area as geographic area the secretary must establish that review activity can be conducted more efficiently at the local or regional level rather than the state level presidents proposal the presidents proposal would allow the secretary to negotiate local regional or national qio contracts the presidents budget does not include savings in fy2009 for this proposal but does include estimated savings of 50 million over the fiveyear budget period fy2009fy2013 expand pool of contractors eligible for qio work current law to become qio entities must meet certain requirements entities must be either physiciansponsored or physicianaccess organizations physiciansponsored organization is defined as an entity that is composed of substantial number of licensed doctors practicing medicine in the area and who are representative of the physicians practicing in the area physicianaccess organization is one that has available to it the services of sufficient number of doctors practicing medicine in the area the secretary is prohibited from entering into qio contracts with health care facility health care facility association health care facility affiliate or payer organization presidents proposal the presidents proposal would expand the pool of quality organizations eligible to become qio contractors the presidents budget does not include savings in fy2009 but does include estimated savings of 30 million over the fiveyear budget period fy2009fy2013 allow for early termination of contracts without panel review current law if the secretary determines that qio is not meeting its contractual requirements the secretary is required to notify the qio that its contract may not be renewed at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the contract upon informing the qio of its notice of intent to terminate the contract the secretary is required to provide the qio with the opportunity to present data and other crs17 information pertinent to its performance under the contract such information must be reviewed in timely manner by panel appointed by the secretary the panel is required to submit report of its findings to the secretary in timely manner the secretary is not required to accept the findings of the panel and has the authority to amend the contract to modify the qios functions if the secretary decides to terminate qios contract after the panel has submitted its report it must provide the qio with 90 days notice presidents proposal the presidents proposal would allow for early termination of contracts without panel review for poor performing qios the presidents budget does not include any estimated savings associated with this proposal establish stricter standards for reviewing beneficiary complaints to address perceived conflicts of interest current law in addition to providing technical assistance to providers on quality improvement qios are required to investigate and respond to beneficiary complaints about the quality of health care services specifically qios review the services provided to the beneficiary to ensure that they meet professionally recognized standards of care if after investigating the complaint the qio identifies potential quality of care concern they are required to inform the beneficiary of the outcome of the investigation and provide the practitioner with reasonable notice and opportunity for discussion qios are also required to implement quality improvement interventions with the provider in response to quality concerns identified during complaint investigations presidents proposal the presidents proposal would eliminate perceived conflict of interest between qios beneficiary protection and quality improvement activities by establishing stricter contractual standards for reviewing beneficiary complaints the presidents budget does not include any estimated savings associated with this proposal make qio authority to conduct quality improvement activities more explicit current law section 1154 of the social security act describes the functions of medicare qios the law directs qios to review some or all of the professional activities of medicare providers to ensure that the services provided to medicare beneficiaries are reasonable and medically necessary that the quality of services meets professionally recognized standards of care and that the services provided could not be provided more effectively and economically in another health care setting the statute does not make reference to the quality improvement activities qios undertake in conducting these medical review functions presidents proposal the presidents proposal would expand the statutory authority of qios to include quality improvement activities the presidents budget does not include any estimated savings associated with this proposal crs18 program integrity proposals health care fraud and abuse control program current law the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa of 1996 pl 104191 established the health care fraud and abuse control program hcfac and medicare integrity program mip to conduct health care fraud and abuse activities to fund these activities hipaa established within the hospital insurance trust fund an expenditure account called the hcfac account monies are to be appropriated from the trust fund to the hcfac account in amounts that the department of health and human services dhhs and the department of justice doj jointly certify as necessary to finance antifraud activities hcfac funds enforcement and prosecution efforts impacting all federal health care programs mip however funds activities to prevent and investigate fraud in medicare hcfac supports antifraud activities performed by the dhhs the hhs office of the inspector general oig the doj and the federal bureau of investigation fbi mip funds are allocated to cms for activities such as medical reviews of claims provider audits investigations and physician education hipaa capped mandatory funding for the hcfac and mip programs at the fy2003 level of 355 million for hcfac and 720 million for mip the dra appropriated additional mandatory funds for mip 36 million in fy2008 and 48 million in fy2009 for the establishment of medicaremedicaid data matching program the trhca increased the mandatory annual appropriation for hcfac by the percentage increase in the consumer price index through 2010 in fy2008 mandatory hcfac and mip funding for health care fraud activities totaled 11 billion the law currently mandates that hhs and the doj submit an annual report to congress on hcfac activities the law does not require that mip activities be included in this report presidents proposal the presidents fy2009 budget includes discretionary request of 198 million to augment the mandatory funding for health care fraud activities of this 198 million 147 million would be allocated to mip to conduct oversight activities related to the medicare prescription drug benefit and medicare advantage plans the remaining 51 million would support antifraud activities conducted by the oig and doj to ensure funding for this proposal the administration proposes to fund them as contingent appropriations and would employ budget enforcement mechanism to allow for adjustments by the budget committees statutory spending limits would also be established the presidents budget also includes proposal to change the structure of the hcfac account by separating the unified funding stream provided to the dhhs and doj into two separate funding streams the annual negotiations process between the two agencies would be eliminated further mip would be required to contribute results of its activities to the annual hcfac report crs19 medicare bad debt current law medicare pays the costs of certain items on reasonable cost basis outside the applicable prospective payment system including the unpaid debt for beneficiaries coinsurance and deductible amounts while some providers receive 100 reimbursement for allowable bad debt since 2001 acute care hospitals receive 70 of the reasonable costs snfs also receive 70 for only those beneficiaries who are not dually eligible for medicare and medicaid for the dual eligibles the bad debt reimbursement will remain at 100 other providers currently receiving reimbursement for bad debt include critical access hospitals rural health clinics esrd facilities federally qualified health clinics community mental health clinics and certain health maintenance organizations among others presidents proposal this proposal would phase out bad debt reimbursements over four years for all medicare providers fy2009fy2012 the presidents budget expects to save 250 million in 2009 with this proposal and 85 billion over the five year budget period limit use of mandamus jurisdiction current law mandamus jurisdiction involves plaintiff going to court to seek injunctive relief in the form of writ of mandamus to compel governmental agency or officer of an agency to comply with statutory obligation such as issuing fee schedule that is required in statutory provision mandamus is only available where 1 the plaintiff has clear right to relief 2 the defendant has clear duty to act and 3 there is other adequate remedy available to the plaintiff the supreme court has stated that the common law writ of mandamus as codified in 28 uscs 1361 is intended to provide remedy for plaintiff only if he has exhausted all other avenues of relief and only if the defendant owes him clear nondiscretionary duty heckler v ringer 466 us 602 us 1984 presidents proposal the presidents budget would limit mandamus jurisdiction as basis for obtaining judicial review and clarify the secretarys authority to resolve appeals of medicare determination the presidents budget does not include savings in fy2009 but does include estimated savings of 60 million over the fiveyear budget period fy2009fy2013 these savings are for existing cases only and do not include projected savings from future cases include providers in federal payment levy program current law the federal payment levy program fplp authorizes the internal revenue service irs to collect overdue taxes through continuous levy on federal payments made to delinquent taxpayers the fplp is implemented in coordination with the department of the treasurys financial management service fms fms may reduce any federal payments subject to the levy by 15 or the exact amount of tax owed if it is less than 15 of the payment the department of health and human services dhhs does not participate in this program which would enable it to collect tax debt from physicians and other part b providers crs20 presidents proposal this proposal would allow medicare provider payments to be included in the fplp the presidents budget does not include any estimated savings associated with this proposal reducing erroneous medicare payments current law cms developed the comprehensive error rate testing cert program to assess how well medicare claims administration contractors process medicare claims the cert program measures the accuracy of medicare claims processing activities by calculating national contractorspecific and provider specific claims error rates to reduce the volume of improper payments medicare contractors are expected to educate providers on how to correct billing mistakes and identify potential fraud medicare feeforservice error rates in 2007 and 2008 were 39 and 38 respectively presidents proposal the president estimates that efforts to improve payment accuracy will result in further reduction of the medicare feeforservice claims error rate from 38 in 2008 to 37 in 2009 the presidents budget does not include any estimated savings associated with this proposal medicare administrative proposals these five provisions propose to strengthen program integrity correct for inappropriate provider payments and adjust payments to encourage efficiency and productivity the budget includes estimated savings of 645 million in fy2009 and 474 billion over the fiveyear budget period from these proposal in aggregate payment for conditions not present on admission current law as required by the dra starting october 1 2008 acute care hospitals will not receive additional payment when one of the identified conditions is acquired during hospitalization for patients where the specified condition was not present on admission the hospital would be paid as though the secondary diagnosis was not present presidents proposal the budget proposal would expand the policy and withhold medicare payment for certain conditions if they were not present at the time of the hospital admission increase inpatient length of stay threshold current law under ipps medicare reduces payment to an acute care hospital if patient in given diagnostic related category drg is admitted to post acute setting and receives clinically related care within three days of discharge from the hospital the post acute settings covered by the transfer policy include ltchs irfs inpatient psychiatric or skilled nursing facilities and home health care crs21 presidents proposal the budget proposal would increase the inpatient length of stay threshold that would trigger the transfer payment adjustment change hospice wage index current law payments for hospice care are adjusted to reflect local differences in area wage levels by the hospice wage index the hospice wage index has been developed using the most current hospital wage data including any changes to the metropolitan statistical areas msas definitions the original hospice wage index was based on the 1981 bureau of labor statistics hospital data and had not been updated since 1983 on april 13 1995 the hospice wage index negotiated rulemaking committee signed an agreement for the methodology to be used for updating the hospice wage index in the august 8 1997 federal register 62 fr 42860 cms published final rule implementing new methodology for calculating the hospice wage index based on the recommendations of the negotiated rulemaking committee the hospice wage index is updated annually and is published in the federal register it is based on the most current available hospital wage data as well as any changes by the office of management and budget omb to the definitions of msas presidents proposal this proposal would phaseout the hospicespecific wage index adjustment over three years

perdiem urban or rural base payment amount that is adjusted for case mix using resident classification system resource utilization groups iii based on data from resident assessments and relative weights developed from staff time data the pps payments are also adjusted by area wages using the hospital wage index presidents proposal the president proposes to correct for case mix distribution in the skilled nursing payment system but the budget does not include any specifics strengthen program integrity current law the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa of 1996 established the medicare integrity program mip to reduce improper payments and conduct activities to prevent health care fraud and abuse in the medicare program the types of fraud prevention
