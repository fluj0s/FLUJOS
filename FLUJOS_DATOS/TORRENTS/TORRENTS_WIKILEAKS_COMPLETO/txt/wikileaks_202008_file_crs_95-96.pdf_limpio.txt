services it uses its 178 billion budget to support more than 50000 scientists working at 2000 institutions across the united states as well as to conduct biomedical and behavioral research and research training at its own facilities components of the agency include 25 institutes and centers each with focus on particular diseases or research areas in human health recent budget growth has been significant despite caps on discretionary spending for fy2000 congress gave nih an increase of 22 billion its second consecutive increase of over 14 the president requested 1 billion 56 increase for fy2001 and congress is poised to approve 27 billion 152 increase several bills relating to authorization issues are pending in the 106th congress nihs internet home page is at httpwwwnihgov this report will be updated periodically background nih is the primary agency of the federal government charged with the conduct and support of biomedical and behavioral research it also has major roles in research training and health information dissemination in both budget and personnel it is the largest of the eight healthrelated agencies that make up the public health service phs within the department of health and human services dhhs1 for fy2000 it has total budget of 178 billion and total employment of about 17000 people nih derives its statutory authority from the public health service act of 1944 as amended numerous times in the last half century 42 usc 201300gg section 301 of the phs act grants the secretary of dhhs broad permanent authority to conduct

specific timeanddollar authorizations that require periodic renewal by congress as do such other programs as training grants and facilities construction awards authorizing committees with jurisdiction over nih are the senate health education labor and pensions committee and the house commerce committee appropriations are handled by the house and senate appropriations subcommittees on departments of labor health and human services and education and related agencies organization begun in 1887 as oneroom marine hospital laboratory nih spent its first half century operating as an intramural research lab for the public health service it became the national institute of health in 1930 and the national institutes of health in 1948 today nih comprises 18 institutes 3 centers and the national library of medicine see table 1 each has specialized focus on particular diseases areas of human health and development or aspects of research support and each receives separate appropriation2 nih has 78 buildings on 300acre main campus in bethesda maryland and also occupies offcampus sites in maryland north carolina montana and other locations activities two categories of research are sponsored by the institutes and centers ics extramural research performed by scientists working in universities academic health centers hospitals and independent research institutions using nih grant or contract money and intramural research performed in the nih laboratories and clinical center by nih scientists in both programs the research projects are largely investigatorinitiated and span all fields of basic and clinical medical research basic research is research in the fundamental medical sciences sometimes called lab or bench research while clinical research involves patients nih also supports both extramural and intramural research training programs to prepare young investigators for research careers about 82 of the overall nih budget goes for extramural awards in the form of research grants research and development contracts training awards and few smaller categories such as construction grants facilities renovation grants and medical library grants3 the research grants category by far the largest includes traditional research project grants to individual investigators as well as grants to groups of researchers who work in collaborative programs or in multidisciplinary

over 40 of federal civilian ie nondefense spending for research and development rd the agency has enjoyed strong bipartisan support from congress reflecting the interest of the american public in promoting medical research even in the face of pressure to reduce the deficit congress approximat ely doubled nihs appropriation over the last decade with the budget staying well ahead of inflation in real terms with the fy1999 and fy2000 appropriations congress started increasing nihs budget at an even faster rate approaching pace to double in 5 years from the fy1998 level of 136 billion the budget increased by 2 billion or 145 to total of 156 billion in fy1999 for fy2000 the increase was 22 billion or 142 to total of 178 billion the president requested 1 billion 56 increase to 188 billion for fy2001 the house and senate have passed their respective versions of hr 4577 the laborhhs education appropriations bill for fy2001 which is awaiting final conference action included in both versions is total of 205 billion for nih 27 billion or 152 over the fy2000 level although the house bill contains provision limiting fy2001 obligations to the level of the presidents request the tentative conference agreement described on the house appropriations committee website accepts the 205 billion figure for further details seehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9596crs5 the nih section of crs issue brief ib10051 research and development funding fiscal year 2001 issues for congress congressional attention to nih in the 106th congress has focused on budgetary and appropriations issues accompanied by some authorizing and oversight activity in appropriations activity for fy1999 fy2000 and thus far for fy2001 congress has pushed forward with an agenda to double the agencys budget in 5 years from the fy1998 level of 136 billion to approximately 27 billion in fy2003 that pace is about twice as fast as the clinton administration has recommended the administration has sought to balance the substantial increases received by health research with support for its other priorities within the laborhhseducation appropriations bill and also with funding for other areas of science since progress in health research relies in part on advances in chemistry physics mathematics and computational sciences the biomedical research community acknowledges the need for adequate support of these other fields it warns howeve r against large fluctuations in nihs grants budget because of the detrimental effects to new investigators as the nih budget has increased concerns have been raised in and out of congress about the agencys continued ability to spend the money responsibly in support of good science and the ability of the research community to absorb additional large increases in addition as disease advocacy groups continue to pressure congress to direct funds to their areas of research interest nihs processes for priority setting and resource allocation have come under scrutiny see crs report rl30483 medical research funding summary of crs seminar on challenges and opportunities of proposed large increases for the national institutes of health july 1998 congressionallymandated study by the institute of medicine scientific opportunities and public needs improving priority setting and public input at nih httpwwwnapedureadingroombooksnih generally supported the criteria that nih uses for priority setting it recommended additional mechanisms for public involvement including council of public representatives which nih has created and also recommended that congress provide more funding for research management and support so nih can implement additional improvements in the priority setting process including stronger analytical planning and public interface capacities reauthorization legislation for various nih programs was last enacted in 1993 pl 10343 with authorizations expiring in fy1996 few of the expired authorities were extended in health bills passed at the end of the 105th congress and two new authorizations for parkinsons disease research and for complementary alternative medicine were attached to 105th congress appropriations bills new authorizations have been enacted by the 106th congress several bills addressing authorization issues have been introduced this congress but few have received action senatepassed bills include s 1243 to extend prostate cancer preventive health programs s 1268 to support construction of biomedical and behavioral research facilities and s 1813 to expand clinical research programs the house has passed hr 4365

of new institutes or centers at nih dr harold varmus former nih director has recommended that congress commission an indepth study of the agencys organization and the role of the director because of
