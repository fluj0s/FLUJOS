fisheries restoration and water management and how to addr ess concerns of stakeholders not party to the settlement without disrupting the negotiated agreement the region may benefit from increased recreational expenditures and investment in river restoration activities under the settlement for example some communities and interests believe restoration will bring other benefits to the river and river communities such as improved surface water quality in lower san joaquin river reaches and enhanced recreation benefits on the other hand some studies suggest the settlement would have negative economic impact on the agriculture industry at least in the short term in addition downstream interests not party to the settlement have been concerned about increased flooding groundwater infiltration and competition with existing federal financial commitments nearby communities fear harm to groundwater quantity and quality some of these concerns have been addressed in the newest

proceeding to trial on remedy regarding the courts ruling in september 2006 settlement agreement was reached concerning operation of friant dam one of the largest federal dams operated as part of reclamations central valley project cvp in california the settlement calls for new releases of water from friant dam to restore fisheries in the san joaquin river and for efforts to mitigate water supply losses due to the new releases full implementation of the settlement would require congressional authorization and appropriations title x of s 22 contains san joaquin river restoration settlement implementation provision under the settlement and implementing legislation increased water flows for restoring fisheries would reduce diversions of water for offstream purposes such as irrigation hydropower and municipal and industrial uses the quantity of water used for restoration flows and the quantity by which water deliveries would be reduced are related but the relationship would not necessarily be oneforone for instance in some of the wettest years flood water releases could provide significant amount of the restoration flows th ereby lowering the reduction in deliveries to agricultural and municipal users under the settlement water would be released for restoration purposes in the driest of years thus reductions in deliveries to friant contractors would be made due to the settlement in those years additionally in some years the restoration flows released in late winter and early spring may free up space for additional runoff in millerton lake potentially minimizing reductions in deliveries later in the yearassuming millerton lake storage is replenished consequently how deliveries to friant water contractors might be reduced in any given year would depend on many factors regardless of the specifics of how much water might be released for fisheries restoration visàvis water diverted for offstream purposes there will be impacts to existing surface and groundwater supplies in and around the friant division service area and adjustments in local economies although some opposition to the settlement and its implementing legislation remains the largest and most directly affected stakeholders ie the majority of friant water contractor organizations and environmental fisheries and community groups support proceeding with the settlement agreement in lieu of going to trial for some groups going to trial risks considerable uncertainty and expense others may be more willing to take such risks 1 nrdc v patterson 333 f supp 2d

project administered by the bureau of reclamation reclamation under federal law including the reclamation act of 1902 and amendatory acts known as reclamation law the federal endangered species act various other federal environmental and administrative laws and various state laws the friant dam was built on the san joaquin river by reclamation in the early 1940s it stores the san joaquin rivers flow in millerton lake the reservoir behind the dam from which water for irrigation and other purposes is diverted into two canals reclamation delivers the impounded water to 28 irrigation and water districts in the friant division pursuant to various types of water service contracts many of which originated in the 1940s the friant division serves irrigation and water districts in the fresno kern madera merced and tulare counties figure 2 unlike most reclamation projects the friant division dam and distribution facilities is operated in way that diverts nearly all the san joaquin rivers flow away from the river 3 by the late 3 1950 court ruling on the diversion of san joaquin river flows noted that the court could find other instance in which reclamation was proposing to divert the entire flow of river the case involved rights of individuals downstream to continue to receive water from the river as well as water for downstream fisheries and recreation eventually water rights holders below the dam were granted water annually however water was allocated to in stream uses below the dam even though retaining water for instream uses recreation ecosystem health fish and wildlife and scenic values is relatively modern concept or value there were local and vocal opponents of the proposed diversion of the river by the courts count there were some 1000 farmers and ranchers below the dam who might be negatively affected rank v krug 90 f supp 773 sd cal 1950 some years later reclamation built the trinity project which diverted significant portion of the trinity river to other cvp

dry today except during flood events reclamations operation of friant dam largely destroyed numerous species of native fish from the upper san joaquin river including spring and fallrun chinook

fisheries have declined since the 1940sparticularly commercial salmon fisheriesdue to water diversions and other factors historically central valley springrun chinook were found throughout the central valleyfrom the northern sacramento river drainage area to the southern portions of the san joaquin drainage the middle and upper san joaquin river historically supported two or more independent populations of springrun chinook salmon most sp awning by springrun chinook salmon in the san joaquin river occurred upstream of the curren t location of friant dam historical spawning runs may have exceeded 200000 fish annually ascending the river as far as mammoth pool about 1000 meters elevation which lies about 50 miles above friant dam today central valley springrun chinook salmon are listed as threatened under the 5 however central valley springrun chinook salmon have been entirely extirpated from the san joaquin river drainage and currently inhabit only the sacramento river drainage6 native fall and latefallrun chinook salmon continue to spawn in small numbers in the san joaquin river tributaries such as the mokelumne stanislaus tuolumne and merced rivers these fish spawn at lower elevations in these tributaries and have been less affected by dam construction than were springrun chinook salmon in addition there is significant artificial production of fallrun chinook salmon by california department of fish and game hatcheries on the tuolumne mokelumne and merced rivers7 fallrun chinook salmon are not listed under the but are identified as species of concern8 continued flows have also been very contentious and per administrative actions recently upheld by court ruling are also to be increased to support and restore dwindling fisheries 4 san joaquin river flows are needed to allow adult salmon to swim upstream to their spawning grounds to provide habitat for juvenile salmon to allow ju venile salmon to swim downstream in the spring through the lower river and to dilute toxic and saline drainage to ma intain minimum level of water quality 5 70 fed reg 37160 june 28 2005 6 j m myers et status review of chinook salmon from washington idaho oregon and california us dept

1980s the friant division water users sought renewal of their longterm water service contracts with reclamation beginning in 1988 coalition of environmental groups and anglers led by the natural resources defense coun cil nrdc challenged the contract renewals in federal court on number of environmental grounds in addition to claims that the process under which reclamation had begun contract renewals violated the national environmental policy act nepa 42 usc 4321 et seq and that the lack of water in the river violated the 16 usc 15311544 the plaintiffs argued that reclamation had violated section 8 of the reclamation act of 1902 43 u sc 383 that section provides that reclamation will act in conformity with state laws relating to the control appropriation use or distribution of water used in irrigation the state law that is at issue here is california fish and game code 5937 section 5937 provides as follows the owner of any dam shall allow sufficient water to pass over around or through the dam to keep in good condition any fish that may be planted or exist below the dam the claims have been litigated in the us district court for the eastern district of california the district court has reviewed the application of 5937 to the problem at hand on several occasions since 1988 and has issued several decisions in 2004 the district court issued another decision regarding the application of 5937 to the san joaquin river finding that reclamation had violated the state law it stated there can be genuine dispute that many miles of the san joaquin river are now entirely dry except during extremely wet periods and that the historical fish populations have been destroyed 9 the court did not declare what amount of water was necessary to satisfy the law or declare any other type of relief rather it set 2006 trial date to determine proper remedy g22g145g142g561g21g142g157g157g149g142g150g142g151g157g561g3g144g155g142g142g150g142g151g157g561 faced with the prospect

appropriations authorization is needed to finance settlement implementation as envisioned under the settlement the settlement states that if legislation is not enacted by december 31 2006 the settlement may become void at the election of party at which point litigation might resume while implementation legislation was considered in the 110th congress hr 4074 hr 24 and s 27 it was not

proposal to various members of congress the parties hoped implementing legislation would be enacted prior to adjournment of the 109 th congress however numerous entities who were not party to the settlement ie third parties objected to the legislative proposal included in the settlement as well as the swift time line imposed by the settlement agreement10 shortly thereafter many third parties met with the settlement parties and certain members of the california delegation an agreement was reached to address certain third party interests in exchange these third parties agreed to support new legislation although many parties who had opposed the draft legislation in september 2006 supported the new legislation other parties emerged that were not part of the new agreement resulting in further opposition to settlement legislation 11 san joaquin river restoration settlement legislation was first introduced in early december 2006 hr 6377 and s 4084 however action was taken on the bills before adjournment of the 109 th congress the settlement bills were reintroduced in the 110th congress as hr 24 and s 27 hearings were held in both houses of congress however the legislation was not enacted one of the primary hurdles facing the legislation has been its budgetary impact and financing mechanisms implementation of the settlement calls for construction of numerous projects and other activities that could cost between 250 million and 11 billion federal funding for these projects and activities is sought by the parties and is contemplated under the settlement direct spending funding mechanisms included in the legislation would typically require budgetary offset under congressional paygo rulesaccording to some difficult task in todays budget climate while shortterm 10 year direct spending in s 22 has been reduced substantially compared with earlier versions of the legislation the budget effects of the legislation in its entirety are still at issue for some an overall complication for congress in considering san joaquin settlement legislation is that although the settlement aims to end 19year lawsuit and comports with court ruling the settlement would affect others

another complication is the prospect that funding for the san joaquin ri ver settlement may divert funds from salmon restoration projects in other river basins lastly other recent events potentially limiting water exports from the sacramento and san joaquin rivers delta confluence could significantly affect implementation of the recirculation portion of the water management goal and has caused increased concern among some stakeholders if congress does not act on the legislation some fear that the court will order remedy which may differ from the settlement and which may have more severe consequences for some area water users and third parties

the settlement agreement and subsequent implementing legislation are the culmination of nearly two decades of discussion argument and study on whether and how to restore fisheries below friant dam federally owned and operated facility on the san joaquin river the most recent actions relate to court decision that reclamation is operating the dam in violation of california state fish and game code the implications of this decision are far reaching for california water management and for both the directly affected water users and the indirectly affected communities landowners and water users several broad policy issues are raised by the settlement these issues partially derive from constraints imposed by the pressure to react to settlement responding to judicial ruling as opposed to managing or legislating on an issue prior to or absent such settlement another overarching issue is how san joaquin river management ties into other cvp management decisions as well as state and local water systems both the cvp and state water project swpa largely parallel state water supply system south of the baydeltaare operating under regulations that limit the amount and timing of water that can be exported south out of the baydelta recent court decisions regarding the health of threatened delta smelt have constrained water exports and may constrain future exports the degree to which some of the water management goals identified in the settlement might rely on moving water in and out of the baydelta could affect the ultimate ability to recapture recirculate andor reuse san joaquin river restoration flows at minimum it appears th restoration effort will necessitate multiyear water planning and investments including having the funding on hand and infrastructure in place to buy and put to use surplus water eg for groundwater recharge and to buy water in dry years for those without sufficient access to groundwater t hose with primarily class ii supplies or in the driest of years therefore the future of water resource management in the central valley is not just conjunctive water management but multiyear conjunctive management with the financial resources to make it happen in addition to integration of federal state local and private infrastructure projects whether congress addresses this issuein california and elsewhere given current water resource authorization and appropriations practices and restrictive budgetary climate remains to be seen while the issues discussed here have confronted prior administrations and congresses settlement agreement was not reached until the us district court acted ultimately resulting in the difficult choices facing congress today eg budgetary water delivery and ecosystem health tradeoffs this is common dilemma for resource agencies implementing projects and programs which are based on societal and political tradeoffs made decades ago eg agricultural industry over commercial and sport fishing industries or timber harvest over species habitat it is hard to say what is fair or just when such significant tradeoffs were made decades ago causing harm to

fisheries economic and ecological damage begun 60 years ago for others the potential of reduced water supplies for offstream use is breach of promises made 60 years ago for the court it is matter of
