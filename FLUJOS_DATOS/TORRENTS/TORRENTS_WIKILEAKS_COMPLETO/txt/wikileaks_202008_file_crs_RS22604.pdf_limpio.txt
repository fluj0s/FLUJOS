jickling government and finance division alison raab knowledge services group november 29 2007 abstract supporters of current ceo pay levels argue that executive compensation is determined by normal private market bargaining that rising pay reﬂects competition for limited number of qualiﬁed candidates and that even the richest pay packages are bargain compared with the billions in shareholder wealth that successful ceos create others however view executive pay as excessive some see social equity problem taking ceo pay as symptomatic of troublesome rise in income and wealth inequality others see excessive pay as form of shareholder abuse made possible by weak corporate governance structures and lack of clear comprehensive disclosure of the various components of executive compensation this report describes the major legislative and regulatory proposals that have sought to remedy these perceived problems including hr 1257 representative frank which the house passed on april 19 2007 and would require that ceo pay packages be put to non binding shareholder vote s 1181 senator obama companion bill was subsequently introduced in the

corporationsthose required to file financial statements with the securities and exchange commission secmust in their nnual proxy statements disclose the total compensation of the five highestpaid executives these data as compiled by various publications consultants and information vendors comprise the basis for all public statistics on executive compensation other than the top five individuals corporations generally provide information about management pay most accounts of executive compensation are not based on comprehensive statistics but on samples for example business week for many years published tables of ceo pay at 300 or 400 large corporations these figures which are presented in crs report 96187 comparison of the pay of top executives and other workers by linda levine show that the ratio of average ceo pay to average nonmanagement worker pay rose from 501 in 1980 to 3491 in 2004 this raises the question of whether public shareholders who are ceos employers get their moneys worth the results of the numerous academic studies of the relationship between ceo pay and corporate performance are mixed few would dispute warren buffetts claim that its difficult to overpay the truly extraordinary ceo of giant enterprise but this species is rare 1 more controversial but not without support in the empirical literature is his additional observation getting fired can produce particularly bountiful payday for ceo forget the old maxim about nothing succeeding like success today in the executive suite nothing succeeds like failure 2 this may be why ceos attract more resentment and criticism than wealthy athletes movie stars or entrepreneurstheir pay often goes up even when their performance is mediocre or worse and they preside over organizations created and maintained by others where their personal contributions are not always easy to discern the pe rception that many if not all top executives are overpaid raises issues about the compensation process ceos serve at the pleasure of the board of directors who represent the interests ofand are elected byshareholders executive pay is set by the board in principle boards should bargain on the shareholders behalf creating competitive market for executive services however there are several reasons why this might not happen directors are elected by shareholders but usually nominated by management and it is extremely rare for managements slate of directors to be voted down according to various observers once on the board directors are reluctant to press managers on pay because unless cordial relationships prevail the board will find it difficult to function3 rather than haggle they often hire compensation consultants who recommend best practices approach which generally means 1 to the shareholders of berkshire hathaway inc berkshire hathaway 2005 annual report p 16 2 ibid 3 this would help explain why ceo pay never seems to fall even though polls show that significant numbers of directors believe ceos are overpaid one wants to be the first to cut pay httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22604g7g161g140g142g156g156g146g159g142g561g5g7g17g561g18g138g162g497g561g4g138g140g148g144g155g152

many directors are themselves serving or retired ceos thus there is widespread belief that the market for chief executives is economically inefficient and that market discipline weakens as one nears the top of the corporate pyramid as consequence many argue that ceos have been the beneficiaries of substantial pay packages at the expense of the 54 million american families who own corporate stock4 in turn fueled by recurrent publicity over especially lucrative salaries stock windfalls retirement benefits or severance payments these concerns have prompted range of legislative and regulatory responses g13g142g162g561g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g152g155g162g561g138g151g141g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g159g142g561g6g142g159g142g149g152g153g150g142g151g157g156g561 there have been two general approaches to executive pay reform first changes to securities laws and regulations have attempted to strengthen the bargaining position of shareholders by 1 requiring more complete and comprehensible disclosure of ceo pay 2 making boards more responsive to shareholder interests or 3 requiring shareholder vote on executive pay packages second congress has tried to restrain the grow th of executive pay by eliminating the tax deduction for compensation paid in excess of specified caps

dates from the 1930s the sec has modified the disclosure format several times as the forms of ceo pay have become more various and complex in 1992 the sec required that proxy statements include tables setting out several categories of pay for the top five executives these included base salaries bonuses deferred and incentivebased compensation including stocks and stock options

christopher cox out of date they havent kept pace with changes in the marketplace and in some cases disclosure obfuscates rather than illuminates the true picture of compensation we want investors to have better information including one numbera single bottom line figurefor total annual compensation in addition the sec called for changes that would require firms to use plain english in l their proxy statements information statements and annual reports 5 to this end the sec amended its disclosure rules in 2006 to combine what it called broader based tabular presentation with improved narrativ disclosure supplementing the tables in order to give shareholders and board members fuller and more useful picture of executive 4 the federal reserves survey of consumer finances reports that

on july 22 2006 further amended on december 22 2006 and currently under consideration the revisions would apply to disclosure in proxy and information statements periodic reports current reports and other filings under the securities exchange act of 1934 and registration statements under the exchange act and the securities act of 19337 the new and revised tables in the 2006 rules include revised summary compensation table which was changed to include total column aggregating the total dollar value of each form of compensation quantified in the other columns new director compensation table which resembles the new summary compensation table but differs in that it requires companies to present information only with respect to the last completed fiscal year and new grants of planbased awards table which requires companies to disclose information on the fair value of the awards on the grant day for stock awards and option awards reported in the summary compensation table and director compensation table the sec initially required in its july 2006 rules that companies report the total value of an award made in given year the december amendments revised that requirement specifying that companies had to repo rt in the tables only the portions of the awards that vest in the year to which the proxy applies8 in addition the december 2006 amendments require companies to include footnotes in its director compensation table corresponding to the grants of planbased awards table fair value disclosures in addition to the new and revised tables the sec introduced new rules for narrative disclosure the narrative disclosure is intended to aid in the understanding of the tabular information for example with the summary compensation table companies must provide information on the material terms of each grant including but not limited to the date of exercisability any conditions to exercisability any tandem feature any reload feature any taxreimbursement feature and any provision that could cause the exercise price to be lowered 9

in company proxy statements briefly known as proxy access10 the proposal which the agency eventually adopted in late november appears to have been response to the uncertainty that prevailed in the agency after 2006 second circuit court of appeals decision afscme v aig that charged that sec policy on shareholder proxy access had been historically inconsistent the second proposal which the agency did not adopt would have allowed shareholders or shareholder coalitions with greater than 5 of outstanding shares to propose binding bylaw provisions that could permit specified shareholders to nominate directors and require the company to include the nominees in the companys proxy statement generally business interests applauded the decision while shareholder interests derided it commissioner cox however has indicated that the agency will probably revisit the subject in 2008 when the commission is back to full size

writes accounting standards under the authority of the sec released accounting directive fas 123r which requires companies to recognize the value of employee stock option grants in their income statements previously most companies had simply noted the value of options grants in the footnotes to the financial statements recognition of the cost of options has the effect of reducing reported earnings companies may reduce this impact by granting fewer stock options to their officers and employees thus fas 123r may have constrained executive pay even though that was not its primary intent

to ceo pay reform is to discourage excessive compensation through the tax code by limiting the deductions available to either the firm or the employee when certain caps are exceeded while companies may generally deduct all employee compensation from taxable income various legislative proposals and enacted legislation place limits on the tax deductibility of certain forms and amounts of pay some
