senate committee funding requests and authorizations for senate committees in the 110th congress senate committee funding rules the senate biennial committee funding process applies to all senate committees except appropriations4 and ethics5 which have permanent authorizations for their staff and operating expenses the senate committee on rules and administration has jurisdiction over committee funding resolutions and issues regulations governing committee funding and staff committee funding and staff are also regulated by senate rules especially rule xxvi paragraph 9 and rule xxvii as well as by statute the funds authorized and allocated by resolution are appropriated in legislative branch appropriations acts under senate rule xxvi clause 9 each senate committee except appropriations and ethics is required to report funding resolution providing for its expenses for march 1 of that year through february 28 of the following year by january 31 of the first session in which new congress convenes the rule also allows the committee on rules and administration to mandate process by which funds may be authorized for twoyear period the senate took several steps in 1999 to move to biennial funding process that more clearly reflects fiscal year 2 oral comments of senator dianne feinstein at the committee on rules and administration markup on committee funding feb 28

79601 legislative reorganization act of 1946 section 202b 80 stat 834 5 sres 290 96th congress adopted nov 29 1979 and sres 425 97th congress adopted aug 12 1982 crs3 orientation in the funding resolution agreed to in at the beginning of each subsequent congress the aggregate authorization for each committee is apportioned among three calendar periods from march 1 to september 30 of the first year of congress from october 1 to september 30 of the following year and from october 1 to the following february 28 this permits the senate to identify more precisely the amounts authorized for each fiscal year and the subsequent appropriations required each committee supports its request by submitting supplementary materials including those specified by the rules and administration committee in recent congresses that panel has advised committees on the permissible increase or required decreases it hopes to impose on senate committees compared to the funding level in the previous congress committees requesting funds in excess of these guidelines have been asked to include justification in their budget submissions6 the rules and administration committee may then hold hearings at which committee chairs ranking minority members and other senators may testify in recent congresses however the committee has held hearings only on certain requests or has not held hearings the rules and administration committee chair will normally introduce an omnibus resolution incorporating the amounts requested by each of the senate committees in their individual resolutions the rules and administration committee will then usually meet to mark up the resolution and after final approval by the committee report it to the senate and issue an accompanying written report on occasions where both parties have been in agreement on the funding resolution it has been discharged by unanimous consent from the committee without formal markup or written report in the 105th109th congresses the senate has agreed to the funding resolution by unanimous consent with little if any floor discussion if committee requires additional funds after the omnibus resolution has been agreed to funds may be requested essentially in the same way as they were for its twoyear budget the senate has minimized the need for supplemental funding however by allowing committees to use unspent funds from one period specified in the omnibus resolution during the next funding period since the 106th congress the omnibus funding resolution has also contained special reserve from which unexpected funding needs by any senate committee could be met upon the request of its chair and ranking member and the approval of the chair and ranking member of the rules and administration committee senate rule xxvii requires that each committees staff reflect the ratio of majority and minority committee members and that the minority receive fair consideration in the appointment of staff majority of the minority party members of committee may request at least onethird of the personnel funds for hiring minority staff this ratio is calculated after excluding funds for staff who perform administrative and clerical functions for the committee as whole if any as agreed to by the chair and ranking minority member committee staff may be supplemented 6 the guidelines the committee on rules and administration provides to other senate committees are not publicly available crs4 by consultants and staff detailed to the committee from federal agencies subject to such restrictions as the
