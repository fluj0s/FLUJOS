6205c24 shspec148 emeter data instant reads i if pc has stuck picture dont try to run it get the session where it was found and get the missed withhold off that session lrh has simple plan use the emeter we had breakdown in 1961 where everybody was misreading meters now it is happening again see pp1456 for discussion of observing the needle auditors are ignoring reads on ruds questions and auditing over outruds they are not seeing instant reads for some reason the ford foundation was founded the same day as the hubbard research foundation and for the same purpose to find out about life however their idea of scientific research is looking on via through symbols in contrast when lrh observed the generally crummy appearance of students few weeks ago he looked for the reason without presuming what he would find this is good way to do research he found out that if ruds were out there would be ta so he had old prepchecks cleaned see p 229 above people thought the meter wasnt reacting because the auditors tr1 was out however that was not the reason auditors just failed to see reactions that were there if with modern processes the pc isnt looking better and doing better someone isnt reading the meter an auditor can get into not reading the meter by invalidating the meter this comes about because he has been audited by someone who missed reads on him which caused him to lose confidence in the meter he feels it should have read on and it didnt read this is lie and hangs up like any other lie if it had read the auditor would have seen it so the meter doesnt work so i wont pay attention to it when im auditing this neednt happen lot meters get invalidated the inval of the missed read gets suppressed it hangs up and builds whole chain you clean it up by prepchecking has any auditor failed to find meter read on you that you thought should have reacted that gets the unknowns out of it it has unknowns in it because it occurred in midsession when the pcs attention was on something else the mechanism of enchantment is similar to this it could work something like this at time when thetans could mock up their own bodies one thetan could put in command phrase on another thetan in the middle of subjecting him to severe secondary or engram the command phrase could be you are now deer and the enchantee would cease to mock up the prince or whatever he was mocking up and mock up deer and he would be an enchanted deer so you lay in an inval of the meter at time when the pcs attention is on his withholds or something he gets further withhold on top of it thereafter he distrusts meters and cant read them it would take more than that motivator however it would take some overt that is actually motivator also the pc is at the auditors mercy being out of pt etc you have to audit in way that doesnt impede the pc from going clear you avoid restimulation of the gpm until the pc is ready to go clear and you can then blow the gpm to bits auditing roughly can create inadvertent implants incomprehensible people are people who wouldnt want your goal see p 259 the individuals goal line is important things that cross against his goal to get clear are all auditing errors smooth auditing is designed not to bat his goal back not to impede him making him think the meter doesnt work is very upsetting to him even if analytically he is relieved not to have been found out of course once the pc is utterly arc broken the meter doesnt read so the auditor can get to the point where he doesnt see or believe the reads that he gets you can get random reads on the words in the question or on some stray thought but if you recheck it it drops out or at least doesnt appear in the same place an instant read is instant it is not contained in the body of the question those are prior reads the lag in an instant read is essentially nonexistent the auditor is actually talking to thought in the bank auditors often mistakenly think the pc can analytically influence the meter but he cant the pc cant even influence the meter on via as an instant read he can do it by thinking of something that he knows there is unknownness about but in this case the read will be latent since there is time in the reactive mind only nowness you get instant reads from the reactive mind furthermore the pc doesnt know what produced the instant read at least he doesnt know all about it or it wouldnt read reading item contains unknowns the reactive mind is cauldron of unknowns that always exist in now consistency of needle action is determined by consistency of unknown and its immediacy in pt so use the questions in hcob 23may62 very important emeter reads prepchecking how meters get invalidated this contains questions about invalidation of meter reads both from the point of being an auditor and from the point of view of being pc to clean up meter inval it is important to get this straightened out for the sake of pcs if you see the pcs instant embarrassment it is as good as an instant meter read you do have to observe however and it is tough to get people to to this note lrh first mentions routine 3ga at the end of this tape routine 3dxx is mentioned in the confidential tape 6204c26 shspec139 rundown on routine 3 routine 3dxx routine 3g is mentioned in 6205c01 shspec141 routine 3g this is routine 3 employing goals it is possible that the tape 6206c12 shspec160 how to do goals assessment contains the basic data about routine 3ga and that routine 3ga means routine 3 goals assessment routine 3ga is also mentioned in several other shsbc tapes 6206c19 shspec158 dos and donts of r3ga and shspec176 177 178 180 181 all appear to contain basic data on routine 3ga see also pp 259262 below above tapes are confidential
