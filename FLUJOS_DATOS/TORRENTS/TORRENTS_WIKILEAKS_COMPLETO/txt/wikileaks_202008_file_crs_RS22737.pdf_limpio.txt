jurisdiction or the particular institution targeted among the factors to be considered are involvement with organized crime or terrorists bank secrecy laws and regulations the existence of mutual legal assistance treaty with the united states and level of official corruption of the five types of special measures four of the five impose informationgathering and record keeping requirements on us financial institutions dealing either directly with the jurisdiction designated as one of primary money laundering concern or dealing with those having direct dealings with the designated jurisdiction under the fifth special measure us financial institution may be prohibited from opening or maintaining in the united states correspondent or payablethrough account 2 for foreign financial institution

correspondent or payable through account in the united states for any foreign bank if the account is used by the foreign bank to provide banking services to burmese banking institution however the special measure applied to burmese banks does not prohibit us financial institutions from maintaining correspondent accounts otherwise prohibited by this rule if such accounts are permitted to be

imposition of section 311 on banco delta asia in the chinese territory of macau for money laundering for north korea section 311 measures have arguably had their largest success in this designation of macaubased banco delta asia in september 2005 and the full imposition of section 311 in march 2007 the north korean government had used banco delta for the majority of its international transac tions reportedly following the us proposed designation over two dozen financial institutions ceased their transactions with north korea 3 most importantly china froze north korean accounts in the macau branch of the bank of china and reportedly cracked down on north korean efforts to circulate counterfeit us dollars in china near the north korean border4 reports of third country banks that do business with burmese banks or individuals connected to the burmese government including drug traffickers are sparse past reports have cited banks in thailand singapore and china burmese accounts in chinese banks were confirmed in january 2006 when the bank of china ordered chinese banks to terminate all us dollar business with the myanmar foreign trade bank and the myanmar investment and commercial bank 5 3 press reports indicate that some two dozen financial institutions across the globe have voluntarily cut back or terminated their business with north korea notably including institutions in china japan vietnam mongolia and singapore the result of these voluntary actions is that it is becoming very difficult for the kim jongil regime to benefit from its criminal conduct
