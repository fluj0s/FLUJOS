reasons suggested to explain this perceived lack of success is that ai d programs often have objectives other than pure development such as national s ecurity environmental or human rights

be low proponents of the mca view it as way to reform foreign aid programs by rewarding good performers and by focusing on the objectives of poverty reduction with limited considerati on of strategic or political objectives critics raise concerns that by creating new aid programs including the hivaids initiative which coexist with traditional aid programs there is fragmentation of resources and poten tially lack of coordination among the various entities administering the programs14 aid reform in response to the evolution of an aid pr ogram that has been criticized for being fragmented
