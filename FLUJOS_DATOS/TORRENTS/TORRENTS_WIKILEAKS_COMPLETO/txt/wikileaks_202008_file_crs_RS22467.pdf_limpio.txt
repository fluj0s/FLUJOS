projects in louisiana louisiana wetland protection and restoration proponents largely view the program as an established success in enhancing coastal wetlands by implementing numerous relatively inexpensive and smallerscale projects at the same time many of these proponents also have worked to develop and seek administration and congressional support for more substantial multibilliondollar coastal louisiana restoration program consisting of far larger projects their eﬀorts have intensiﬁed in the aftermath of two highly destructive hurricanes that struck louisiana in 2005 both because the scale of the cwppra program is insuﬃcient to counter the large wetlands losses that resulted and because wetlands restoration could play more prominent role in reducing the impacts of future

amending cwppra to redirect or expand it as response to these hurricanes introduction the coastal wetlands planning protecti on and restoration act cwppra also called the breaux act after an initial sponsor wa s enacted to respond to the loss of coastal wetlands especially in louisiana1 it authorizes funds for three purposes 70 is for restoration of louisiana coasta l wetlands 15 is for coastal wetlands restoration in other states and 15 is to support the north amer ican wildlife habitat management programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22467crs2 2 the other two components are administered by the

restoration act cwppra response to louisianas land loss 2006 16 pp an abridged summary of these arguments is presented on pages 13 under the subtitles of energy scarcity navigation security and fisheries and flywaythis report is limited to the louisiana component2 the louisiana effort is administered by task force that includes five federal agencies and the state of louisiana and is chaired by the us army corps of engineers th 164 projects that have been funded through cwppra generally have not generated much controversy perhaps because they are products of the programs ex tensive collaborative planning process and because they are limited in scale congress has not made major amendments to cwppra since the initial enactment other than extending the authoriz ation period however in the aftermath of the 2005 hurricanes it may consider changes for more information on how the states coastal wetlands were affected by the hurricanes see crs report rs22276 coastal louisiana ecosystem restoration after hurricanes katrina and rita by jeffrey zinn the law and program congress authorized cwppra to create and restore coastal wetlands in louisiana as response to rapid rates of land loss as wetlands were converted to open water the human and natural causes geographic patte rns and rapid rates of loss had been documented in numerous studies and repor ts since the 1960s this documentation continues to be used by restoration advo cates to argue that wetlands protection and restoration is an immediate need it is also used to argue that restoration is national issue deserving federal funding nd involvement because of the many roles that coastal louisiana plays in the national economy3 for general overvie w of the rates and causes of wetland loss activities to document those losses and identify possible solutions and efforts to authorize and fund more extensiv federal restoration effort see crs report rl32673 coastal louisiana attempting to restore an ecosystem by jeffrey zinn cwppra created task force to guide the program the task force is chaired by the us army corps of engineers and includes representatives from the us fish and wildlife service department of the interior natural resources conservation service department of agriculture environm ental protection agency national marine fisheries service national oceanic and atmospheric administr ation department of commerce and the governors office from the state the task force annually identifies list of possible projects and uses priorities that it has set to select the projects to be funded the list of selected projects is submitted to congress with each corps budget submission the corps also provides adminis trative support for the program and tracks the status of each project the task force issues status report to congress evaluating each project every three years the most recent such report was issued in 2003 the next report like the 2003 report repor tedly will be relatively s hort overview of the program rather than detailed projectbyproj ect review like the 2000 report the task force is at the center of broadbased collaborative effort to identify and establish priorities for projects this effort ttempts to involve all in terested parties andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22467crs3 4 detailed presentations of the process by whic h the projects are identified and selected can be found at http wwwlacoastgov pplindexhtm visited may 18 2006 5 in november 2005 louisiana enacted legisl ation to replace the wetland conservation and restoration authority with coastal protection and restoration authority which has broader mandate to combine flood control efforts with co astal restoration initiatives the new authority issued its initial report annual coastal protection and rest oration plan fiscal year 2007 in april 2006 the report includes chapter on cwppr and other federal matching projects and programs and chapter on projects and programs that involve only the state each program discussion includes activities in fy2006 needs in fy2007 and the funding amount to be provided by the state in fy2007 serves to generate st rong local endorsement4 the effort emphasizes the local benefits that will result from projects especially those benefits that result from improved habitat as result of this effort most of the f unded projects possess widespread support and engender little controversy however the length of this process has meant that the projects selected in 2006 were being consider ed before the hurricanes struck in 2005 and the ongoing selection process for 2007 is th first one in which the effects of the hurricanes are part of the d ecisionmaking process the task force also seeks to apply wi range of both tr aditional and innovative restoration techniques includi ng river diversions marsh cr eation sediment trapping and barrier island stabilization cwppra proj ects can be initiated relatively rapidly compared to more substantial corps projects because of their small scope and the nature of the cwppra process the typical amount of time from start of design through construction is three to five years which contrasts with the much longer time frames typically associated with traditional corps projects operating projects are monitored and the feedback is used to improve project design and performance cwppra legislation also requires the stat to prepare and periodically update coastal wetlands conservation plan5 the state can receive grant for up to 75 of the cost of preparing the plan and federal agen cies corps epa and fws are to provide technical support for the plan velopment the goal as specified in the legislation is to reach net loss of coastal wetlands as result of implementing the actions in the plan eight program elements are specified in the statute terms of plan approval by federal officials are specified the th ree federal agencies that suppor ted state efforts to prepare this plan are supposed to periodically repor t to congress on the status of the plan including an evaluation of the effectiveness and accomplishments of projects carried out under it funding is provided primarily by the fede ral government which pays 85 of the project costs the state of louisiana pays the remainder the state has strong financial incentive to prepare and maintain the wetlands conservation plan described in the previous paragraph if it does not its cost share for all proj ects rises to 25 the state through its department of na tural resources must pay at least 20 of its portion that is 3 of the total project costs in cash nd the remainder can be inkind contributions such as lands easements or rightsofw ay cwppra places several limits on how funds may be spent for example almost all f unds go to construction as more than 5 million can be spent on studies and planning associated with ma intaining and updatinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22467crs4 6 the state will have considerably more funds to devote to wetland restoration as result of section 384 of the energy policy act of 2005pl 10958 which creates new program to assist coastal states to mitigate the impacts of offs hore energy activities and the gulf mexico energy security act pl 109432 which will share 375 of certain federal revenues from offshore oil and gas activities with affected coastal states 7 louisiana coastal wetlands conserva tion and restoration task force coastal wetlands planning protection and restoration act cwppra response to louisianas wetland loss 2006 16 p most of the information in the remai nder of this paragraph comes from this report 8 other usgs studies concl uded that the average annual loss rate was more than 28000 acres between 1956 and 1978 and about 22000 acres between 1978 and 1990the project list each year in addition th state may not receive more than 25 million annually or 10 million in total to prepare its conservation plan6 cwppra is funded from revenue s accumulated in the sports fish restoration and boating safety trust fund which derives revenues from veral sources the largest sources are the sale of gas for motor boats and the sale of fishing equipment income into the fund has been increasing it has grown from 263 million in fy1991 to just over 500 million in fy2005 the allocation for the louisiana portion of the program appropriated to the corps from the us fish and wildlife service which maintains the fund started at 33 million in fy1992 and has generally increased from year to year reaching just over 76 million in fy2007 the louisiana experience the cwppra program has been very active in louisiana currently 164 high priority projects have been identified in the 2007 selection process three projects were approved for construction and four projects were approved for engineering and design the task force reported that 78 projects have been constructed ar under construction or have been approved for construction7 these projects are cated throughout coastal louisiana with the largest number in the calcasieusabine area in the western part of the state 18 and in terrebonne parish in the centr part of the state 14 the task force credits these projects with having reesta blished more than 32000 acres protected more than 38000 acres and enhanced specific functi ons have been intensifiedimproved more than 320000 acres the total cost of these projects is 625 million an additional 47 projects with an estimated cost of mo re than 913 million are in some stage of engineering or design and will be seeking approval for construction these projects when completed would establish or protect almost 33000 acres and enhance almost 195000 acres however more funds will be needed before these additional projects can all be constructed coastal wetlands in louisiana were being converted to open water at declining annual rate on average before the 2005 hurri canes according to the us geological survey usgs8 cwppra projects could be factor contributing to this decline as they continue to partially offset the losses other factors contributing to this declining loss rate may include reduced levels of some human activity especially the declining intensity of additional oil and gas drilling and pipeline installations and the fact that so many acres of wetlands have been lost already httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22467crs5 9 loss estimates have been calculated by u s geological surveys national wetland research center which has published number of reports describing past and predicted loss rates 10 national research council ocean studies board committee on restoration and protection of coastal louisiana drawing louisianas ne w map addressing land loss in coastal louisiana 2005 204 p this study was prepared at the request of louisianas office of the governor which asked the council to review the corps louisiana coastal area lca louisiana ecosyste m restoration study released in november 2004 to examine its effectiveness for longterm comprehensive re storation development and implementation 11 for more information on wrda see crs report rl33504 water resources development act wrda corps of engin eers authorization issues coordinated by nicole t carterthe usgs estimates that hurricanes katrina and rita caused almost 140000 acres of wetlands to be converted to open water between oct ober 2004 and october 2005 this is larger acreage than had been and will be reestablished and protected under all the completed active and planned pr ojects as summarized in the da ta above it is also equal to more than nine years of wetland loss at the average annual ra of 15300 acres that usgs documented between 1990 and 20009 the losses from these hurricanes are not uniformly distributed across louisianas co ast where the storm damage was most concentrated usgs reports that the amount of loss is greater than total predicted losses over the next 50 years however the cw ppra projects are more evenly distributed throughout coastal louisiana it is possibl that in some areas where damage was limited and annual loss rates ve been small these projects ma be largely offsetting losses interest in thinking about coastal louisian as larger integrated landscape or system rather than large number of individual sites and projects is growing this theme was at the heart of 2005 report from the nati onal research council which recommended that detailed map depicting the expected future landscape of coastal louisiana be developed from set of goals to which all interests can agree this map would then serve as basis to guide more specific decisions and choices about the restoration effort10 planning at landscape scale would help decision makers determine the interrelated benefits of projects with such vast expanse of wetlands it seems highly likely that many projects would not provide these benefits without this ty pe of planning effort this recommendation from the nrc was endorsed in at least one subsequent report and is recognized less directly in the recent task fo rce report cited in footnote 3 although the cwppra program follows state and federal plans to set priorities and select projects it does not appear to take an overarching approach that considers the entire landscape after the hurricanes options for cwppra cwppra is widely viewed by wetland prot ection advocates as successful program for several reasons including 1 projects can move relatively quickly through planning design and construction 2 projects can include wide range of restoration and protection techniques and 3 project development is collaborative process involving many federal state and local interests th at tends to result in strong support for the projects that are approved the 2006 task fo rce report describes it as program for holding the line against the continuing loss of wetlands while awaiting legislation and engineering work to implement the larger projects that would most likely be authorized in water resources developm ent act wrda legislation11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22467crs6 12 as the demand for more projects grows the funding does not go as far because project costs reportedly have risen an estimated 25 on aver age since the hurricanes and much of the funding this year is paying for higher costs of existing projects rather than new ones according to us fish and wildlife service staff who work with this programin the wake of the 2005 hurricanes some advocates may see cwppra as already established and having potential if expanded to play more significant part by using natural features to protect s outh louisiana from the full brunt of future storms the most recent cwppra task force report cited earlier and written in the spring of 2006 after the hurricane sums up the current situation as follows in some areas the losses incurred from these two hurricanes katrina and rita exceeded estimates of future land loss over the next 50 years the land loss crisis will not wait while details of large restoration projects are developed in this context the task force iden tifies and endorses many qualities of the cwppra progra m which include responsiv interagency approach predictable funding fiscally responsible complementary sciencebased and community involvement the destruction caused by the hurricanes has greatly increased the demand primarily from louisiana for an accelerated restora tion for coastal louisiana wetlands this expanded need could be par tially met by the cwppra pr ogram although some may believe that other approaches would result in more effective wetland restoration effort if the program were expanded by increasing the authorized funding ceiling it could lead to larger number or size of the projects and therefore have the potential to result in greater accomplishments12 an advantage for restor ing wetlands through cwppra is that the program is already operating alt hough the implications of scaling it up such as pressures on staff resources nd how an expanded effort might alter the project selection process have not been wide ly discussed in congress another question is whether changes in this program might include giving greater consideration to making decisions about projects at th landscape scale
