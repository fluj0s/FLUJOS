organizational location within doj the issue and the debate that occurred in the 107th congress is summarized below permanency of vawo because the office originally was created at the behest of the attorney general some feared th at vawo could be abolished or subsumed by another part of doj at any time for example they charged that vawo as formerly established was vulnerable to changing political winds1 for this reason they contended that vawo must be permanently authorized in law doj spokespersons pointed out that the vawo di rector was currently pres idential appointee who had the full support of the president attorney genera l and others within doj and would continue to have that support they noted vawos status within ojp pointing out that the director was counselor to the attorney genera l further at the direction of the attorney general the associate attorney general chairs coordinating committee on violence against women comprised of the head s of relevant components in doj2 vawo and the reorganization of ojp various plans for the reorganization of ojp had fueled further concerns about how vawo would be affected reasons given by doj for reorganizing ojp were to improve responsiveness assistance and accountability to all customers eliminate dup lication and overlap ensure measurable grant and program outcomes citing the att acks of september 11 nd consequently the shift in the primary responsibility of doj to protecting the country against terrorist attacks doj stated that it was even more important for ojp to maximize efficiency and improve service to its customers the reor ganization of ojp was directed at improving management of current programs and funding str eams not at changing the essence of those underlying statutes3 ojps organizational structure was the re sult of authorizing statutes and funding mandates by congress and of doj management decisions it consisted of five bureaus six program offices and seve n administrative offices each bureau was headed by presidential appointee with the approval of the senate th is ojp structure was replaced with what doj described as comprehensive integrated approach that assists state and local communities in addressing crime and juvenile delinquency the restructured ojp included research institute statistical office two programmatic offices two program support offices and six administrative offices the national institute of justice the bureau of justice statistics the office of juvenile justice nd delinquency prevention programs the office of criminal

development4 although doj stated that the latest re organization proposal would leave vawo as presently constructed except for renaming it the office on violence against women5 some remained unconvinced for example opponents argued that dojs proposal for restructuring ojp would reduce vawo to ju st an office for administering grants further they stated that vawo would not provide the policy leadership necessary to effectively promote and serve victims of dom estic violence in the words of bonnie campbell former director of vawo there is world of difference between full participation in the highest levels of decision making and being buried in satellite grant office in the department6 before the reorganization vawo provided individuals and state and local law enforcement with information on formula and discretionary grants and programs that provided legal and technical assistance and training to combat domestic violence donna f edwards of the national network to end domes tic violence testified that vawos communication with experts in the field law enforcement victims services prosecution and the judiciary and community and state leaders enabled it to establish grantmaking process that integrat ed grants policy development training and technical assistance arguing that creating sepa rate departmental func tions to serve across different programs would fragment and unde rmine the progress that vawo has made in implementing its programs she oppos ed the reorganization of ojp7 those pleased with vawo offered exampl of its policy leadership such as vawos role in the enforcement of protective orders when battered woman complains that her husband has followed her across state lin if protective orders exist in the new jurisdiction where the woman resides th experience authority and resources may be lacking at the local or state level to protect her in timely manner vawo in responding quickly to reconcile the differences between st ates in addressing domestic violence provides national presence another example given was the assistance vawo provides states in creating public and private partnerships to combat domestic violence according to thurbert baker attorney general of georgia employers especially multistate corporations can be vital ally in fighting domestic violence he testified that employers ofte n inquire about

feels that vaw endorsement sends powerful message to corporations8 placement of vawo hearing testimony diane stuart th current director of vawo contended that vawo should remain within ojp with budget of nearly 400 million she argued that vawo needs ojp s infrastructure which supplies support structure and resources further she st ated that much of vawos work such as developing solicitation applica tions managing grants providing technical assistance and communicating with the field involves clos collaboration and coor dination with other ojp offices and bureaus offices within ojp that vawo consults in carrying out its legislative mandates include the office of the comptroller for financial management the office of budget and management serv ice for budget anal ysis the office of congressional and public affa irs for grant notifications and the office of general counsel for legal advice9 casey gwinn san diego city attorney opposed moving vawo out of ojp stating that ojps current structure was consistent with the movement to combat domestic violence through more interdisciplinary c oordination with law enforcement the medical community juven ile justice programs and social service agencies10 according to stuart another reason to continue ojps and vawos relationship is that ojps major goal of providing tools to enhance the ability of communities to address local crime problems complements the goal s of vawo much progress has occurred since the establishment of vawo unlike in the past she maintained there are now proficient knowledgeable professionals and groups in the criminal justice system at the state and local levels who can and do train law enforcement prosecutors judges advocates and others on how to respond to dom estic violence and more persons are being trained to stay in touch with these individuals and groups vawo uses number of means including the administration of grant programs the national advisory committee on violence against women which is compri sed of experts in the fields of domestic violence sexual assault and stalking technical assistance initiatives and interaction with grantees in the field at c onference or by phone and othe r experts throughout the nation conversely lynn rosenthal director of the national network to end domestic violence argued that vawo had more clout be fore it was transferred to ojp under ojp she charged vawo emphasizes technical aspects of grant making over policy issues that surface when establishing prog rams to address vic tim safety and offender accountability she considered these policy issues cornerstones of vawa providing services to diverse population of victims of violence calls for coordination and collaboration with federal stat local and tribal entities as well as secular and nonsecular private groups it is complex undertaking th at requires establishi ng baseline standardshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21259crs6 11 rosenthal lynn executive di rector

that the statute on this issue is unequivocal doj reportedly insists that the attorney general has authority to organize doj in the manner that he judged most efficacious for carrying out its important duties12 further doj reportedly interprets the statutes language separate and distinct office to mean that vawo must have recognizable status as an organizational entity not that it may not be part of another department component according to doj officials however vawo will be moved but the details are still being determined
