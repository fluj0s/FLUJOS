local educational agencies leas provide special educati on and related services idea requires the provision of free appropriate public education fape for children with disabilities specifying in some detail the provision of services for these children3 and grants certain procedural rights to these children and their parents one of the major changes to idea resulting from the 1997 amendments pl 10517 involved series of additions to th act aimed at improving the education of children with disabilities as well as c ontinuing to ensure their access to free appropriate public edu cation at the child level th is involved various requirements in the individualized education program linki ng each childs education to the general curriculum and to statewide and districtwide achievement test pr

quantity of those who teach children with disabilities pl 108446 continued this approach and added provisions to align idea with nclb requirements the child left behind act of 2001 pl 107110 reauthorized the elementary and secondary education act esea and in doing so added requirements aimed at improving the ducation of all public elementary and secondary school children including those w

that receives title ia funds4 and apply to all children served by such states or leas in addition nclb continues title i schoolwide projects for schools serving relatively high percentages of children from lowincome families these projects allow for consolidation of federal educa tion funds including title ia and idea funds to serve all children in qualifying school thus some nclb requirements that

the requirements of the statewide system based on alternate ach ievement standards that is their scores of proficient or advanced based on alternate assessments and alternate achievement st andards may be counted as such in adequate yearly progress determination as disc ussed below in april 2005 the secretary of education announced new policy that would per mit other children with disabilities who experience persistent academic difficulties an additiona l 2 of those tested to meet achievement requireme nts based on modified achie vement standards all other children with disabilities must be assessed based the same achievement standards that nondisabled children are ssessed on although some of these children with disabilities may be assessed with alternate assessments final regulations to implement this policy were published in the federal register on april 9 2007 nclb assessment and accountability requirements6 nclb requires that all states receiving title ia funds c urrently all states must have implemented standardsbased ssessments in reading and mathematics for all students in grades 38 school year 20 052006 and mu st implement standardsbased assessments in science by school year 20072008 for childre n with disabilities for whom these tests even with accommodations are inappropriate states must provide one or more alternate assessments nclb requires that states have in pl ace statewide accountability system based on standards of adequate early progress ayp aimed at reducing achievement gaps between highachieving and lowachieving students these standards must be applied to specified groups incl uding children with disabilities7 as well as to all students in each public school lea and state as whole the ultimate goal of these state systems is that all students reach prof icient or advanced levels of achievement by school year 20132014httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32913crs4 8 school must assess at least 95 of releva nt pupils both all pupils and those in each identified subgroup in order to meet ayp standards 9 large majority of leas receive funding under title ia only those leas with very few poor children fewer than 10 or very low poverty rates under 2 do not qualify however even in leas receiving title ia funding approximately 60 of all public schools qualify for title ia funding 10 ed comments with respect to final nclb regulations specify the following regarding public school choice for children with disabilities under the idea change in the location of delivery of services in and of itself does not trigger the change of placemen t procedures of the idea the lea can allow the school of choice either to implement the iep that the prior school developed for the new school year or convene an iep team meeting and develop new iep that meets the students ne eds if the lea adopts the students existing iep none of the change of placem ent procedures apply however the school district must comply with the c hange of placement requirements of the idea if the new iep will change either th services in the iep or the extent to which the student will participate with nondisabled students in academic and nonacademic activities similar rules apply to students who are covered only by section 504 and title ii of the ada the americans with disabilities act leas are not required to offer students with disabilities the same choices of schools as are offered to nondisabled students but may match the abilities and needs of student with disability as indicated on the students iep to those schools that have the ability to provide fape to the student however school districts must offer students with disa bilities and those eligible under section 504 and title ii of the ada the opportun ity to be educated in an eligible school namely school that has not been identified for school improvement corrective action or restructuring and that has not been identified by the state as persistently dangerous like other stude nts students with disabilities and those covered by section 504 and title ii of the ada must have the opportunity to express preference among at least two eligible schools and that preference must be considered by the school district in making their assignment 67 federal register 71756 december 2 2002 see also the nonregulatory guidan ce issued by ed regarding public sc hool choice discussed belowayp standards must be ap plied to all public schools8 and leas in states receiving esea title ia funds however certain actions particularly the corrective actions described in the remainder of this paragraph have to be applied only to schools and leas receiving title ia funds9 applicable schools that fail to meet ayp standards over two consecutive years must be identified as requiring improvement technical assistance is pr ovided to those schools and public school choice must be offered to pupils of such schools for the next school year choice of schools must only include those not

see below for discussion of nonregulatory guidance regarding how public school choice and supplementary services apply to children with disabilities 13 in states that set minimal group size at re

failure the school must be subject to restructuring for example sta ff could be replaced or the school could be converted to charter school similar procedures apply to leas that fail to meet ayp standards in addition to these co rrective actions states may reward schools that significantly close achievement gaps among various groups or exceed ayp for two or more consecutive years12 with respect to children with disa bilities and other sp ecified groups each group must meet or exceed the states annual measurable objectives unless particular group is of insufficient size sometimes referred to as the n size to produce statistically valid results or if privacy rights would be violated13 in addition school or lea may still meet ayp standard s even if some groups such as children with disabilities do not if th percentage of the group th at is below the proficient level declines by 10 or more compared to the previous years percentage and the group makes sufficient progress on at least one other indicator ed nclb regulatory requireme nts regarding children with disabilities since the enactment of nclb ed has issued two sets of regulations regarding the assessment of certain children with disabilities served under idea one group is those with the most significant cognitive disabilities for whom alternate assessments based on alternate achie vement standards may be used to assess whether they meet ayp the other group includes students who may be making progress toward gradelevel achievement but are not likely to do so as quickly as other students the ayp of these students may be asse ssed by alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards regulations regarding children with the most significant cognitive disabilities on december 9 2003

states could have used for the 20052006 continuedsignificant cognitive disabilities14 the rule emphasizes that all students including all children with disabilities are to be assessed in relationship to the states established academic content standards at the same time students ma be assessed by different means thus the rule clarifies that the achievement of most children with disabilities will be measured against states gradelevel achievement standards for accountability purposes while only those with the most significant cogn itive disabilities can be measured against alternate achievement standards aligned with the states academic content standards and refl ecting the professional judgment of the highest learning standard s possible for the students the rule allows states to use test scores based on alternate achievement standards for students with the most sign ificant cognitive disa bilities to calculate adequate yearly progress ayp as long as the percentage of these students at the school district or state level who are count ed as proficient or advanced does not exceed 1 of all students assessed or bout 9 of all child ren with disabilities according to ed15 however if school district can document that the number of students with the most significant cognitiv impairments exceeds 1 the district can request an exception from the state16 the final rule provides some flexibility to states in defining children eligible for alternate assessments the rule requires states to establish and ensure implementation of clear and appropriate guidelines for individualized

amend the regulations related to esea as amended by nclb and regulations related to id ea as amended by pl 10844623 additions to title i regulations in general this policy is aimed at small group of students whose disab ility has precluded them from achieving gradelevel proficiency and whose progress is such that they will not r each gradelevel achievement standards in the same time frame as other students24 the preamble to the final regulations clarifies that these students are not limited to students with disabilities achieving close to grade level that they may be in any of the disability categories listed in the idea and may represent wide spectrum of abilities25 for this group of children with disabilities states may elect to develop or modify assessments based on modified academic achievement standards for appropriate gradelevel content in all cases the iep teams discussed below continue to make the decisions about which children with disabilities will take which assessment the rationale for identifying this s econd group of children with disabilities is that gradelevel assessment is too difficult and therefore does not provide data about students abilities or informatio n that would be helpful to guide instruction an alternate assessment based on alternate academic achievement standards which is appropriate for stude nts with the most significant cognitive disabilities is too easy and is not intended to assess students achievement across the full range of gradelevel content26 the final regulations allow states to develop modified academic achievement standards for such students that would be based on the states gr adelevel standards although the assessment may be less difficu lt than the states regular assessment27 the preamble to the final regulations provi des some general examples of how states might design alternate asse ssments based on modified ach ievement standards the state could remove more difficult items from the assessments and replace them with simpler items another strategy would be to reduce the number of alternative answers on multiplechoice items other strategies include developing alternate assessmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32913crs8 28 unlike alternate achievement standards maas cannot be based on outoflevel testing for example assessing student in 5th grade based on an assessment suitable for 3rd grade students as the preamble to the final regu lations notes outoflevel tests cannot be used as an alternate assessment based on modified academic achievement standards because by definition an outoflevel assessment does not cover the same content as an assessment based on gradelevel academic content standards 72 federal register 17750 april 9 2007 29 72 federal register 17750

regularly monitor the justifications fo r such exemptions note there is state exception for the 1 cap see 72 federal register 17779 april 9 2007 34 cfr 20013c4that incorporate technology to provide fo r more flexibility in the presentation of material and permit more fl exibility in how students res pond to test items eg by dictating answers rather than re sponding on paper and pencil test28 the final regulations make clear that any alternate assessment based on modified achievement standard s must meet several criteria although an alternate assessment may be easier than the assessment for the majority of students it must still be based on the same grad elevel academic content sta ndards in addition these assessments must meet technical standards including validity reliability accessibility objectivity and consistency with nationally recognized professional and technical standards29 as with the 1 rule disc ussed above states will be allowed to c ount proficient and advanced scores based on maas in determining ayp howev er proficiency or higher scores on these tests would be cappe d at 2 of all students tested or about 20 of students with disabilities30 proficient or advanced scores in excess of the 2 limit would not count toward ayp instead those scores would only be counted in the denominator of the ayp frac tion as nonproficient scores31 in addition the final regulations introduce 3 cap which is the combined cap for ayp determination for students assessed on alternate assessments32 the final regulations provide for certain exceptions to the 1 and 2 caps in combination with the overall 3 cap the exceptions for states are that states may only exceed the 2 cap if they are below the 1 cap states may never exceed the 3 combined cap the exceptions for leas are the following states may continue to grant local exceptions to the 1 cap33 leas may exceed the 2 cap only if they are below 1 caphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32913crs9 34 for summary of these cap

lea exceed either cap other schools will have to be lower to achieve the leas overall caps34 the final regulations require that states use documented and valid process for setting maas so that the standards are aligned with the states academic content standards for the grade in question are challenging for these students but may be easier than the gradelevel standards for most students and must describe at least three levels of achievement basic proficientand advanced 35 the final regulations provide state requi rements with respect both to students assessed based on alternate standards and to st udents assessed based on modified standards states must establish and monitor guidelines for iep teams regarding the determination of students with the most significant cognitive disabilities and students to be ssessed based on modified academic achievement standards provide iep teams with clear ex planations of how gradelevel academic achievement standards differ from alternate and modified standards and ensure that parents are informed if their children will be assessedbased on alternate or modified standards 36 the final regulations provide additiona l state requirements with respect to students assessed based on modified academic achievement standards these include that states must ensure that these students have access to gradelevel instruction that these students are not prevented from pursuing regular highschool diploma and that the iep team annually revi ews the appropriateness for the student of assessment base d on modified

states are longer required to use students first attempt at stateassessment instead state coul d use students best score from multiple testing to determine ayp 39 states are permitted to include scores of students who exit fromspecial education in the ayp calculation for children with disabilities for up to two years to avoid penalizing states for this positive outcome 40 the final regulations provide the secretary of education with the ability to grant states flexibility for implementing modified academic achievement standards through the 20082009 school year if states can demonstrate that they are moving expeditiously to adopt and administer these standards to qualify for this flexibility state must meet criteria that the secretary established41 additional resources to

children with disabilities in the assessment and accountability re quirements of nclb will lead to the exclusion of these children from the mainstream curriculum trend that federal special education legislation has aimed to thwa rt as one commentator has noted nclb requires annual tests and states that if child with disability is given an outoflevel test and the state reports these children as below proficient it would be counted against the schools performance such ties to testing could exacerbate problem that parents often talk about principals who try to pus h special education students out of their schools because they bring down their test scores84 the december 9 2003 regulations and the april 9 2007 regulations address th is concern first the performance of certain children with disabilities would be judged on alternate achievement standards or m odified achievement standard s with those performing at the proficient and advanced levels of these alternate standards counted toward achieving ayp in addition outoflevel assessments will meet the alternate achievement standards for the most significantly cognitively disabled children if they are aligned with the states academic content standards promote access to the general curriculum and reflect professional judgement of the highest achievement standards possible85 finally the 1 and 2 caps do not apply at the school level the new education department enforcem ent policy which gives the states more freedom in how they test children with disabilities may also address this issue thus there might be less incentive to segregate children with disabilities in separate schools or separate cla ssrooms to ensure that schoollevel ayp is met highly qualified teachers another area of concern is the appli cation of nclb personnel standards to special education teachers pl 108446 specifically addresses this issue in its definition of highly qualified which was discussed previ ously although this helps to align idea with nclb the definition has been criticized by some as leading to anomalous results such as long time high ly regarded special education teachers not being considered highly qualified86 in addition the more stringent requirements may exacerbate the existing shortage of special education teachers87 on the other hand it could be argued that all children especi ally children with di

that both the idea and the nclb require recipient states to include disabled children in the assessments with the modifications necessitated by their disabilities neither statute indicates that fape determinations under the idea are controlled by the performance of disabled children on assessments required under the nclb similarly in kirby v cabell county board of education 89 the court rejected an argument that the nclb imposed additional obligations regarding idea requirements in board of education of ottawa township high school dist 140 v us department of education 90 the plaintiffs school board s and special education students brought suit against the department of education alleging violation of idea since the students with disabilities had been tested at grade level standards rather than based on their iep the distri ct court held that the plaintiffs had standing to bring the suits since the harm alleged by the plaintiffs could not be attributed to the department of education the district court noted that not one provision of the nclba ultimate ly requires plaintiff school districts to change the ieps of its disabled students and observed that alternate assessments were available in addition the court stated that there has been showing that holding disabled children to the same achievement standard s as nondisabled children is in itself harmful or violative of ideas guarantee of free appropriate education especially when idea requires all disabled children included in statewide assessment programs including nclba assessments to take alternative assessments if required by their respective ieps the sevent h circuit court of appeals ffirmed and held that the plaintiffs had standing to bring the suit but found that the action was properly dismissed because the plaintiffs claim is too weak to justify continued litigation91 the rationale given for this decision was that the idea provisions at issue were enacted prior to the enactment of nclb and that the most recent law that is nclb controls the court of appeals noted that idea had been reauthorized in 2004 after enactment of nclb but that the provisions in question had not been changed by the
