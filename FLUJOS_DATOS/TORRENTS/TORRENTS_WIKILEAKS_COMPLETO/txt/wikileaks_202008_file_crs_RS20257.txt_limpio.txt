house committees sought to have agencies link fy1999 budget requests to goals in strategic plans5 the agencies first annual performance plans were sent to congress with fy1999 budgets they were to establish performance goals describe goals in an objective quantifiable and measurable form in an alternative descriptive form or to include statement that it is infeasible to express such goals describe the resources required to meet goals establish performance indicators to measure outputs or outcomes provide basis for comparing actual program results with performance goals and describe how measures would be verified and validated congressional expectations for performance plans were outlined in joint housesenate majority leadership letter to omb december 17 1997 in 1998 the house majority leadership reported that the plans were disappointing agencies did not deal with major management problems lacked reliable data to verify and validate performance did not link performance
