northflowing san joaqui n river the southflowing sacramento river and the san francisco bay to whic h the delta of the two rivers is linked the 1153squaremile estuary is the hub of californias exte nsive water supply system1 the delta provides water to more than 25 million people and habitat for various species including the endangered delta smelt as such the delta has endured decades of competing water demands duri ng this time the delta ecosystem has experienced environmental degradation increasing regional wa ter demands and decrease in reliable water supplies for urban agricultural and natural areas numerous categories of stake holders have an interest in water flowing through the delta including agricultural urban indus trial environmenta l and recreational interests in 2007 federa l court ordered flow restri ctions on the delta water projects to prevent the negative effect water diversions were having on species in the delta ecosystem2 this decision requires federal and state entities to reduce pumping water in two large water projects and therefore has had significant effects on the water supply of california in 1959 the state enacted the delta pr otection act which provided specific law to govern delta wate rs based on the unique problems posed by the delta3 the delta protection act provide s for protections against the two major problems salinity control and adequate supply4 these problems stem from an uneven distribution of water resources5 quantitatively the areas in california in which demand for water is highest are also the ar eas in which the supply is lowest causing shortages for users largely south of the delta qualitatively the delta is affected by saltwater intrusion caused by the inflow of saline tidal waters and the diversion of fresh water that would normally count erbalance the inflow the delta and its ecosystem are also affected by contaminants from urban and agricultural runoffhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34554crs2 6 cal water code 102 see national audubon society v s uperior court 33 cal 3d 419 441 cal 1983 7 see in re determination of rights to water of hallett creek

law provides for several limits on the use of the states waters because the waters of california are considered to be the property of the people of the state anyone wishing to use those waters must acquire right to do so6 california follows dual system of water rights recognizing both the riparian and prior appropriation doctrines7 under the riparian doctrine person who owns land that borders watercourse has the right to make reasonable use of the water on that land under the prior appr opriation doctrine person who diverts water from watercourse regardless of his location relative thereto and makes reasonable and beneficial use of the water acquires right to that use of the water before exercising the right to use the water appropriative users must obtain permission from the state through permit system run by the state water resources control board the board priority of water rights california law provides for hierarchy of these rights for users sharing water that may not meet all users needs8 because riparian users share the rights to the water with othe r riparians one riparian users right is considered superior to anothe rs riparian right therefor riparian rights are reduced proportionally in times of shortage with regard to appropriative rights the persons right that was appropriated first is considered superior to later appropriators rights to the water between the two types of rights users with riparian rights generally have superior claims to thos who have appropriative rights9 that is riparians generally may fill their needs before appropriators and appropriators fill their needs according to the order in which they secured the right to the water10 modification of water rights and the injury rule water rights may be modified under certain ci

users water rights claims to the sacramento river reclamation negotiated settlement contracts with users who held water rights predating the cvp often referred to as settlement contractors the settlement contracts provided an agr eed upon allocation of water rights to the river these contracts initial term was 40 years and the contracts are currently in the process of renewal21 exchange contracts exchange contracts provide assurance that the needs of these users whose rights predated the cvp often referred to as exchange contractors would be satisfied in entering these contracts the exchange contractors sold their water rights on th san joaquin river to the government except for reserved water water to which the exchange contractors held vested rights and agreed not to exercise the re served water rights in exchange for the government delivering specified amounts of substitute water22 the terms of the contract are for conditional permanent substitution of water supply the

the water quality standards were insufficient in light of the scope of the boards duty to act in accordance with the portercologne act44 the court also held that the board has the power and duty to

users permits it held that the board has the authority to modify permits to meet its water quality standards52 state law specifically authorizes the board to reserve jurisdiction to modify the permits it issues which the board did in the case of the projects53 the board is also authorized to modify pe rmits under its power to prevent waste or unreasonable use or methods of diversion of water54 the court noted that determination of reasonable use depends upon the totality of the circumstances presented and varies as the current situation changes55 the court held that the balancing of the

at provided 17 beneficial uses in three categories municipal and industrial agricultural and fish and wildlife and per mitted water flow to be regulated because of its impact on beneficial uses57 t h

selected litigation regarding flow reductions in the delta courts have allowed reduction in th flows in some situations and mandated them in others eg the 2007 wanger decision as discussed above certain federal actions have led to decreased flows in the rivers of the delta for example in the early 1990s endangered species act consultations regarding the newly threatened winterrun chinook salmon and delta sm elt resulted in reclamat ion pursuing alternative management of the cvp to void jeopardy to the species60 at the same time congress enacted the central valley proj ect improvement act which amended the projects authorization to include consider ation of fish and w ildlife preservation and allocated 800000 acrefeet of water for fish and wildlife purposes sometimes referred to as b2 water61 these events resulted in allocations being reduced by up to half in some years for some water contractors which federal court held was fair under the terms of the contract62 additionally the question of how to account for the b2 water has been recurring issue in litigation63 in other cases courts have addre ssed reductions due to environmental conditions one federal district court held that reclamation did not act in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it reduced the amount of water released in response to drought64 when trinity county sued reclama tion in the late 1970s it claimed that operation of the trinity river division of the cvp in response to drought conditions was in violation of federal reclamation law specifically that the reduced flows would not adequately pres erve fish and wildlife65 noting that the decision to reduce flows could be overturned onl if it was found to be ar bitrary and capricious the court held that reclamation appeared to consider the

provision requiring consideration of measures for the preservati on of wildlife could not be interpreted in isolation from the management prac tices of the cvp as whole68 in 2007 the federal district court for the eastern district of california addressed the issue of threatened species in the delta by issuing an interim order that required specified water flows for management of the deltas resources to protect the delta smelt69 that order placed limits on the amount of water that could be pumped out of the delta and thus would affect water users downstream70 in times of water reductions the exchange contractors are put in unique situation this is because their contr acts differ from the general cvp contracts71 as discussed above because the exchange c ontractors had rights predating the cvp their contracts provide guarantee that they receive the entire share from reclamation or that they could exercise their reserved rights to acquire that share therefore it is possible that in times of shortage though other users access to water is diminished the settlement and exchange contractors may still receive their entire share of water72 congressional authority to act and current interest although water law is traditi onally matter left to the states congress has taken role in the regulation of waters unde r its constitutional authority to regulate channels of interstate commerce for instance reclamation law typically regulates water supplied via federal reclamation pr ojects the rivers and harbors act of 1937 that reauthorized the cvp typically re gulates navigation
