the clearing congress lectures shoreham hotel washington dc clear procedure creativeness lecture given on 5 july l958 thank you we have lecture now on the remainder of clear procedure were going to wrap it all up and these boring technical details to get over with and we can have something interesting there are only two processes which clear people dont forget if they dont work they arent being run right we have to look that over as fact because each time i found them not running they were not being run right that is to say the various items which i have been taking up with you such as bad auditing arc breaks present time problems in restimulationnot starting session you know and skipping all of this and that falling off of the chair and telling the preclear h did it it takes something to make these things unworkable or some off beat command is being used or the command isnt being cleared and is never understood by the preclear in the first place see those things could all happen processes which clear people are help and what we call step six the reason we call it step six is that there was book clear procedure and thats step six of that book the whole first step of that first clear procedure issue one was devoted to participation of the preclear in the session and this oddly enough adds up to nothing more serious than help how do you secure his participation help of course well step six run subjectively that is withmock ups mental image pictures mock ups on the basis of keeping them from going away holding them still and making them more solid and if you will notice this is devoted to making creation possible ill go into that in moment very few auditors understand that even yet and this is devoted to creating this makes creation by the pc possible and this is creation betterment and you could run help step six help step six help step six help step six and youd eventually get somewhere but thats the way you more or less do it run help on some things and get it more or less flat and then run some step six and get that inpretty good shape and run some more help and then run some more step six run some more help and somewhere up along the line you say i just found out something he probably doesnt know this you better write ron and tell him because you know all those engrams and facsimiles in fact im mocking all them up all involved laughing you say kidding if you wanna be wanna be dont leave him with that one you know telling the preclear what to think do believe and cognite on is not part of the game of auditing matter how tempting it is the time worn example of the fellow who sat there with bad leg iclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure creativeness2 managed to audit him long enough so that he cognited on the fact that he had bad leg but it was obvious to that he had bad leg but it wasnt obvious to him if you start evaluating for the preclear and tell him what to cognite on why if you find you must do this you have two recourses one get audited and if you cant or wont do that take up hypnotism if you have success with that you might as well go all the way south and take up psychoanalysis now help and step six then are the processes which clear people and any other process is simply subsidiary auxiliary and makes auditing possible all other processes make auditing possible these processes clear people got that so sometimes you have to run some other processes to make auditing possible but dont think youre clearing anybodybecause youre not youre merely making clearing possible when you get around to it because you can run the other processes we have some hundreds of thousands of hours without clearing anybody all youre doing is setting preclear up to become able to run these two processes now how would you what do i mean by setting them up we have an old process that had been demonstrated right here at congress called scs stop change start change and stop now scs in its milder version or its more serious version stop cs which is just emphasis on stop of course are the elements of control and these elements of control are very definitely part and parcel to an auditing session if you think the preclear is going to be uncontrollable on body process like 8c which is good controlprocess the only trouble with 8c when you start to run 8c which is guiding him around the room which is part of upper indoc training thing you start guiding him around the room feeling the walls and that sort of thing if he turns on somatics or gets restimulation because of it you are saddled with flattening it you have to flatten it it might take you the next seventy five hours its alright its good process but it doesnt clear anybody if you start it you have to flatten it because the preclear will make further advance because life itself goes on running the process every time he sees wall he gets somatic get the idea youve just thrown him up into being set up to be run by life thats why we dont talk too much about 8c these days although its very valuable process scs is less susceptible tothese somatics and does the thing we want to have happen it puts the preclear under the auditors control and if you think that hes going to be little bit difficult to control physically think how difficult he will be to control when you cant see what hes doing you say well he couldnt run any he didnt handle stop cs couldnt handle that at all it annoyed him so i went immediately into step six and i say well mock up small object in front of you and of course he did and so forth and we ran it for 872 hours it didnt seem to do anything for him now why he was doing something that we could not directly observe if he couldnt be controlled in the body believe he cant be controlled in the mind and the auditor has to control his mental actions and thats why you run scs it justtells the person to start the body and change the position of the body and stop the body on command after hes done that these are the three elements of control he of course has the idea that he can be controlled he can be controlled and hes better off for it because he can control himself now too people who cant be controlled cant themselves control i dont know that the first lesson person must learn in order to command is to learn to obey i dont know if thats true but i certainly know that its directly true if person would control he hasclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure creativeness3 to be capable of being controlled himself you dont get stuck flow on this to have it work out so if person is going to do something in hidden way youre going to say mock up cat and he says uhuh but did he or didnt he if he cant be controlled i will inform you that maybe he did or maybe he didnt but probably he didnt and you would be running mental image process this step six youd be running this thing without the preclear doing the process you see but then the preclear wouldnt be getting clear on clear procedure because he isnt doing clear procedure the auditor is running clear procedure but the preclear isnt and it would probably clear the auditor but laugh therefore therefore scs becomes an intimate part of clear procedure but its just an auxiliary process it isnt going to do anything for him but this can do pointing to chart listing clear procedure but it makes possible running called scs scs by the way is pretty good process all by itself and the only trouble with running an auxiliary scientology process today is that theyre so good the old ones they worked well they did well and you can say boy am i making gains you know and you can just run that 8c and run that 8c and run that scs and the pc is feeling better hes more capable of taking care of life hes just getting along splendidly and you say well lets continue on this basis its practically matter of why waste your time theyre just auxiliary to this pointing tochart of clear procedure you can be trapped into the goodness of the thing now the other one is connectedness and connectedness is the broad process which covers havingness its you get the idea of making that wall connect with you its not you get the idea of connecting with that wall you get the idea of connecting with the floor you get the idea of connecting with the ceiling you get the idea and the preclear goes dadada moving hand downward gone because we have valuable formula operating here the formula for operating thetan which well talk about later is the person capable of being at cause over life matter energy space and time being at cause and when in doubt always put the preclear at cause over the situation hes being victimized by circuit thelong way to do it is just have him cause circuits see hes being victimized by the circuit so hes being the effect of the circuit so the thing to do is to turn him around and make him at cause over the circuit put him at cause put the individual at cause and you will always advance him now we said the individual didnt we we mean the thetan the funny part of the body is and this is total aside it would much rather be at effect how body loves effect oh if someone would only hit over the head with sledge hammer body thinks wouldnt that be nice wouldnt it be kind of them if bodies could think thats sort of the way that they would think about it and the thetan becomes deluded into believing that the ambitions of the body are theambitions of the self so they go around and try to find varied and fancy effects but the road out is cause not effect in scientology we have cause distance effect as being the most vital simplicity we have what do we means by cause we merely mean emanation point what do we mean by effect we mean receipt point what do we mean by distance we mean the space between when cause and effect are on the same point you have nut you get somebody sayingclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure creativeness4 well i dont know why i victimize myself this way isnt that an interesting interesting question for somebody to ask himself actually hes being another cause but hes also being the effect at the same time and he doesnt know whether hes the cause point or the effect point but probably hes both but whats obvious to him is that somebody is doing something to something and theyre both occurring at the same place his sole effort to get to cause point in the thing is to say i wonder why i am victimizing myself and hell make an actual effort to get to cause there are people who obsessively assume responsibility theres nothing wrong with assuming all the responsibility in the world so long as you are assuming the responsibilitywhen you are reactively taking over responsibility and you dont know that youre taking it over you get an entirely different picture you get something very amusing fellow gets hit by railroad train out in california the person commenting or hearing about it is in rhode island and they say i wonder why i let him go out that night you say to the person you wonder why you let him go out did you talk to him that night but i might have well did you think you should have called him that night well have you called the person for years well how could you have prevented him from going out that night well i just could have you press it little bit further well its just my fault i killed him there are people actually walking around guilty of murders they nevercommitted thats obsessive responsibility responsibility going totally out of control longer able to define responsibility at all theyre being reactively responsible for all sorts of things by the way when you run what part of that problem could you be responsible for you are really merely erasing the reactive responsibilities for that part of the problem the person eventually comes up to really taking some responsibility but obsessively they will say well im responsible for the sun the moon the stars the god im sure there are lot of ministers and preachers in the past who themselves personally invented god im sure this is the case because its true anyway nobody got that chuckle garbled comm lag anyway where we have where we have cause pc at we have things running along fine where we have the preclear causing something over here and thinking hes the effect over here pointing in different directions and then not taking any responsibility for the actual causing of the thing we then get him into the vast mystery known as being an aberree and hes in that mysterious state of not knowing where of where for my mother is mocking up this facsimile and is punishing with it this mental image picture of birth is totally responsible for my horrible condition dont you see and somebody else or something else is mocking it up it took us in scientology reason to ask the people who are in this state it took us in dianetics and scientology years to get around to the actual crux of the fact that the individual is mocking up his whole and entire bank there is crux you want to know what the crux is it might be interesting when an individuals ability to mock up to create mental image pictures is improved the bank improves proportionally isnt that cute isnt that interesting so we improve somebodys ability to create mental image pictures and his facsimiles get better you say well maybe we really improved his vision the only thing we worked on was his ability to create ill show you another way this is done by running help on him weclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure creativeness5 improved his ability to create ill tell you why that is in moment we improved his ability to create and we then get him to create for very short time and then get him to look at facsimile its much brighter much brighter the facsimile is much brighter so then we further improve his ability to create and then we run little bit more creativeness and then we get him to look at the same facsimile its broader its bigger and its fatter and its solider so we run some more help and some more step six on him and we get him to look at the same facsimile this is an actual test thats been run many times boy is that the fattest solidest engram you ever saw now here is place in case in processing on clearing where person would rather be dead all the facsimiles that he puts up are much more solid than they everhave been before and much more real with many more perceptions in them only he doesnt yet know hes making them so he becomes the victim of them and they are this tougher so somewhere along the line of clearing the preclear possibly had asthma or something this isnt necessarily true because the smoothness of auditing takes the curse off of this thats why you have to audit smoothly so please listen audit smoothly otherwise this hump cannot be passed the pc will start up toward it and say thats too much for fall off the ledge and skip it see you just ruined him you find another auditor the auditor runs some more help on him patches up auditing and so forth and take him over the hump this could happen you see but the reason it would happen is that the individual is can be victimized thoroughlyhe gets so good at these engrams locks secondaries these mental image pictures get so much bigger and so much fatter and his psychosomatics can get so much worse that only smooth auditing takes the curse off of it gets him over the hump and then all of sudden he realizes hes beginning to realize that hes mocking these things up himself at that moment he had the smell of ether from the operation you know he could smell the ether you know thats funny do you smell any ether in this room now if you were playing dirty pool doing bad auditing or research work something like that chuckle youd say look up as he smelled the ether you know he says how did i get back in this operating room because if he was stuck in facsimile or an engram of an operation hell get the whole thing backagain twice as twice as good as real the usual thing is the pc doesnt flinch or wince or go into bad condition because of this he ordinarily perseveres and goes on through and smooth auditing doesnt really kick these engrams into restimulation heres where heres where you actually get the most wallop out of case you start separating valences and circuits with help and half of the preclears body falls off at the right side and half falls off at the left side and he finds himself in totally strange body he says where did this body come from you know hands hands he realizes he always thought of himself as having had talons or something he says where did i get this body you know its just like coming into present time hes been going around in that body that was sosuccessful back there in 1710 now thats more spectacular but this can become quite interesting you start running it up and they get better and better and better thats why you run help step six help step six help step six back and forth thats one of the best reasons why you vary between the two because youd never hit this hump head on now what is all this about create what does creation have to do with clearing boy thats stupid question what does it have to do with clearing it has everything to do with clearing of course the person is creating an aberrative state creating an aberrative bankclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure creativeness6 hes creating freudian unconsc i knew fellow i ran across fellow one time that was creating freudian subconscious it was complete he read about it in book and after that he created it anyway chuckle complete he was perfect text book case as soon as i ran where he read the textbook and where he was now about eight or nine commands he ceased to be good freudian case so we got on and fixed him up now where creation is unknown unknowing subrosa preclears here and some mysterious force is creating from over here over which of course he has control or responsibility for we get reactive bank we actually get mental image pictures of one kind or another at which the preclear is not looking but which which are really terrorizing himdoing all sorts of things to him these things can contain anything and do now we have to get him to take over the responsibility for creation so this is little bit broader statement than saying get him to create see we have to get him to take over the responsibility of his action of creations well we do that by separating out all of the items all the major items that he has used to assist himself to create you got that thats why you run help and its the only reason you run help not to make him better boy hell become better boy hes okay but as long as hes in this aberrative cross mock up riff raff state hes mess you dont even have to make preclear better to clear him when hes clear he will be much better because fortunately thetan is basically good that stands in our favor he might as well be basicallyevil but he doesnt happen to be from our standards hes basically good the better he gets the more able he is to operate on an optimum solution which is the best that can be done for each one of the dynamics in other words an optimum solutions definition is simply this the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics and thetan in good shape starts operating on that basis so right up to the point of his getting clear he could be stinker and hed suddenly be saint you get the idea but he doesnt have to be saint after hed lived for little while hed find out that was bore and hed settle back to being scientologist laugh therefore we have to examine if responsibility for creativeness is so important then we have to examine the things that are impeding his creativeness and we find out that the things which first helped him and then sought to destroy him are aberrative only so long as they impeded or assisted and impeded his creativeness the who the who for instance who has mother who was painter and he goes along for years and he cant paint lick he cant do thing with paint brush its just wonder to him its an utter marvel to him the fact that he cant paint anything one fine day his mother dies and he can paint suddenly oh well he says competitions removed and so forth it isnt quite that simple mothers valence was the one that could paint and mothers valence came in snap only he wasnt himself any more mother also had bunions so now he has bunions get the idea hes notbeing himself hes gotten new beingness through the mechanism of life continuum or something of the sort but his mother helped him paint when he was little boy see also knocked his head off every time he spilled paint pot so she was also creative and destructive but the creativeness tended to overwhelm him just little bit and you run help on mother and you would get rid of this particular combination why would you run help on mother to make him feel better because mother was bad woman because you want to make him sane none of those reasons at all youre running help onclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure creativeness7 mother to increase his ability to create himself and so you run help on mother and that gets mother off the case as valence and youll find out he can do little bit better step 6 but im going to let you in on terrible secret for years now weve had to be careful we havent wanted to offend anybody with past lives i know its very hard for people to face the fact that theyve lived before i know its very bad as matter of fact its blasphemous because you know that when youre dead you go to heaven or you go to hell and thats the end of you isnt it that gets rid of you complete well unfortunately research has been able to discover the whereabouts of these two places although i was in place one time identified with the latter chuckle now what does person do well clearing people is path of truth not falsity its path of truth if you dont have any reality on past lives then get somebody to run you on how you could help dead body you will wonder how on earth you got so much stuff on dead bodies youve only lost couple of relatives where did all these dead bodies come from you could run that for quite while you could run it up to point of where you had vivid recall by the way this is the way to turn on full track memory anybody who says i dont believe in past lives i wont have anything to do with past lives ive never had any past lives whats the idea of publishing something on the subject of past lives past lives thats terrible brrr uhgg you know were all born from mass of myelin sheathing and laughing andwhen were dead were dead thats that hey you know an old physics professor i ran into recently died very short time ago and he lived out his own prophesy he said well he said ill die he says before they have an atomic war and then it wont make any difference to get the horrible trap this lie puts out there for somebody he says i want to be garbled of it all i want responsibility for this civilization i want to do nothing for it because when im dead im dead from there on out and i dont have to be victimized at all toward the end of his life why fascism moves in or they elect more republicans chuckle or something and you get the whole society sort of caving in at the edges and things falling apart and somebody passes law and he was right there in the assembly house you see and he hadfriends and all he had to say joe for heavens sakes an educational law that forces child to go to school at six oclock in the morning and study till tenthirty at night so that he can become scientist joe you know thats never going to make him scientist he could have said that but he didnt so he gets born again kicks the bucket picks up new mock up gets born again finds himself walking up the school steps at six oclock in the morning laugh the horrible poetry of it all well where we where we look over mans idiocies on this particular line we discover that the person who says there can be such thing can run the least easily how could you help dead body how could dead body help you isnt that an interestingcoordination its an immediate coordination the person says past lives bla bla ask him now come on right now right here how could dead body help you you put him in the nicest comm lag you ever heard of thats the one thing hes trying to escape is that dead body and he thinks even if he thinks thought about that life hell be dead again and so hes busy mocking up this dead body all the time hes creating dead body all the time so that he can stay away from it which is one way of doing it laugh but hes at the same time inhibiting the mock up and putting cap on the mock up so that at time will the mock upclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure creativeness8 ever spring into his view while he mocks it up so that nearly everything thetan isnt looking at in his own subjective universe actually has these two things going on its being mocked up and its being blanked out and sometimes person is awfully hard put to blank out all the things he mocks up he can get so hard put they have to electric shock him i dont know what it has to do with it at all but they do it now the individuals ability to create heres news has not been impeded in the present lifetime im sorry to have to tell you this because if it didnt make any difference i would skip it but it happens to be the difference between clearing people and not clearing people nobodys forcing you to accept this as concept all you have to do is accept itintellectually and use it in clearing yukyukyuk boy thatll hang you with it laugh but the point is simply this that if we if we use only factors which hes met in his present lifetime the only thing well achieve is an assist hell be alright for this environment but thats all hell be alright for now we suddenly shift his environment and what do we get he spins in why honest im afraid theres not i know youve been in terrible straits in this lifetime i know its been rough but do you know there hasnt anything happened in this present lifetime of sufficient magnitude to aberrate you ill tell you why because youre alive youre here so its obvious youre still sane why you had lifetimes when the lights finally went out you were nuttier than fruitcake you know it lifetime that didnt evermake you stark staring mad is hardly any duress at all and we face this fact in clearing and those people who are attempting clearing walking the nice little tight rope of one life and im born into it and i die out of it and thats it arent making the grade theyre just not getting anywhere you cant clear person by running help on his wife agnes you get the idea you have to run help on wife you never have to brief preclears with past lives all of sudden he says whats this old hag doing here laugh you have to run help on wife man woman husband baby dont mess around with this stuff of run help on joe and bill and pete and his wife agnes or her husband joe see just dont fool around with itbecause youve got the person pegged right here and hell be way up here on top remember basic basic on old dianetics chains huh well youre auditing way up here on top of tremendous chain of events which have experiences by the tens of thousands preceding it and is boy its as sticky as garbled as solid tar and you audit his wife agnes for hours and hours and hours and hours and he feels little bit better about his wife agnes he hopes his wife agnes only drinks and runs around with other men nothing she does thats aberrative how how about the woman he married back in the roman empire the fourth time she tried to murder him and he found out about it he found out that also his worst enemy was in on it as her lover and when he reported it to the senate he found out that the master at arms wasalso in on the plot and about the time he was totally outraged the emperor had him fed to the lions and just as they swished him out the gate and into the maw of their largest and best black maned lion he wasnt feeling well that day and it took two hours to kill him we got situation where the guard said thatll teach you to get married laugh so the long and short of the situation is that people dont get aberrated in this lifetime thats all there is to it they just dont get aberrated in one lifetime it takes longer than thatclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure creativeness9 fortunately it doesnt take longer than that to clear them now thats news for you if it took more than one lifetime to clear somebody wed have had it it doesnt even take lifetime if youre very good auditor it doesnt take month very good and if the preclear is very cooperative and nothing odd happens in that month like getting somebody shocked the reason people go on and on and on and on and on with auditing toward clear is because theyre not auditing the vital points that should be audited now well get on to this other mock up thing why cant this individual do mock ups why cant he do mock ups that is to say when you say cat why cant he put cat up in front of him easily why does he have screen in front of him or an invisibility or this or thatwhats the matter there whats impeding his ability to mock up he isnt doing it hes doing it on circuit thats what is impeding him he has somebody over here mock up something over here pointing in two different places and hes busy mocking up this person here but theres something else going on thats very important in clearing remember we used to say if you can get the mind to do what the mind is doing the whole problem would come to pieces well i finally found out what the mind is doing it is obsessively mocking up certain set of mock ups and if you can get the mind to mock up what it is mocking up youre preclear will have reality but if you ask somebody to mock up something he isnt mocking up he has reality on it therefore you can take very aberrated preclear and run step sixall the way around and so forth and mock up this and mock up that well he isnt mocking those things up so he doesnt mock those things up and he doesnt get very far but we ask him to run 8c and he walks around he can do 8c you know slaps this wall nothing to it and so on totally unreal everything is unreal run concepts totally unreal straightwire totally unreal you got preclear that week after week of auditing simply sits there and says yeah pleasant nothings happening nothings happening nothings happening but its alright anytime you had that case where nothings happening you havent asked him to mock up what hes mocking up only it would be too catastrophic to do so so you run help on it you find out what hes mocking up obsessively now every mock up that goes out thereis being put up by this figure well we try to find this figure in this lifetime who is this personality this valence that does his mock ups for him now who is that person we try to find it in this lifetime and this is why i tell you past lives im afraid if youre going to clear anybody you have to recognize this fact and find some subjective reality on it because so far weve never found current lifetime personality guilty its always somebody back there eight planets ago or something of the sort with bunch of half billion personalities stacked up on top of it and theres real duress and he just goes on obsessively mocking up this mock up and this mock up then does things for him in other words it helps him basically it helps him create things he knows its winning mock up because it killed him thats how heknows its winning mock up its the best test in the world you see how that would be we ask him to mock up or do anything else but mock that thing up and he tells us its all unreal and nothing is happening and he is auditing this mock up in some fashion while were auditing him and if we dont get in there and figure out what kind of mock up hes mocking up were not going to get very far we should run help on it how could you help that now you merely have to have type of thing you dont have to know where it is on the track you dont have to know what it is you dont have to know the name rank and serial number of the last roman soldier that pierced his gullet after raping his wife you dont haveclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure creativeness10 to know all these things in specific detail itll fall to pieces on helping soldiers you know how would you help soldier oh he thinks of soldiers known in this lifetime in the last war and so forth he thinks of soldiers here or one soldier there muttering sort of dim rather unreal but it has to do with soldiers somewhere else sometime or another must have read about it in book here he goes with soldier soldier soldiers of one kind or another running help on them and them helping him and all of sudden wow something happens something starts to move out of his body something starts to go this way or that way and all of sudden its different hes suddenly able to mock up something field whole black screen that he wore between himself and his mock ups and his bank and so ondisappears that requires judgment and it also requires the use of generality i found person one time that was very very certain that women were the most aberrated thing in the world because he went out every two weeks and found himself new girl would tear around for couple weeks and find another girl tear around for couple weeks and find another girl and when i got down to what he was stuck in and what he was obsessively mocking up so help it was house he couldnt stay home laugh thats certainly far cry from women isnt it i have rule whatever the preclear says it is i use something else if he knew that much about it it wouldnt be aberrative now men and women are method of creating new bodies and his dependency on men and women for the creation of new bodies has rendered him incapable of mocking up body that you or i could see now were talking about ot operating thetan he doesnt any longer mock up body whenever he needs to be recognized because men and women mock up bodies for him according to certain set of rules which are laid down in this district obstetric code and freudian analysis if they dont know how now here you have this thing though this new proposition of creativeness hes dependent on men and women to create well funny part of it is you might run help on men in brackets and run help on women in brackets and not get any place and all of sudden hit gold mine on baby you see but thisthen cleared up and all of sudden away he went it requires certain amount of judgment you have to look for something on the case now an emeter is of assistance to certain degree on handling cases its greatest assistance however is not necessarily the location theres an emeter emeter in hand the location of thing on the track or something like that can be spotted with an emeter and they have many uses but its main use is to know whether or not the preclear is still under control now the manifestation on an emeter when you strike one of these valences im talking about obsessive mock up you realize that an obsessive mock up is more mass on the person and therefore more resistance more electrical resistance not emotional but electricalresistance and you get stuck the needle starts to stick and the longer you guess the more the needle sticks you just start piling stuff up on the stuck spot so you better take the first thing you had that it got stuck on and run help on it the needle seemed to be nice and free until you started talking about young boys and hes had it the needle all of sudden started to get stiff you insisted on talking about it little bit further and you mentioned young girls and got about the same then you talked about men and then you talked about women then you talked about cheesecake then you talked about houses and then you talked aboutclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure creativeness11 something else the needle from there on out is going to get still and more and more still its going to stick but its stuck the first time it stuck and if youre good auditor you noticed the first time it stuck and you cleared help on that you see you have to be very alert the main use of the meter is making sure that the individual gets unstuck when youve stuck him now where an individual is demonstrating disabilities in creativeness he has accepted too much help which has then betrayed him taking somebody into universe to teach him how to write probably restimulates people who have tried to teach him how to write and tell stories and have then dumped him in the river when he became too much competition getthe idea so that somebody tries to help him write in this life and he runs into helpbetrayal in some earlier situation which is quite brutal and violent dont you see he wouldnt clear up at all by simply running the situation in this life you know lets clear up his writing by running his university classes because obviously he could write before he went to university and when he came out he couldnt standard situation you see somebody helped him create now its good actually to blame that situation and try to audit it because it isnt going to go any place what youve got to do is get this class of things this class of things truly as you run into these things adventure is with us again you remember when we were running engrams and secondaries we were running bloody adventure we hadpreclears rolling around on the floor and rolled up in prenatal balls you know and screaming at high c that human voice could possibly emit or tolerate we had situation there where we had lots of adventure tremendous adventure we got another one because help never gets upset this side of stark violence you cant upset peoples help by slapping them on the wrist you can by they offer you something and you start cutting their fingers off one quarter inch at time theyre liable to get little upset but the magnitude of violence required to aberrate thetan on the subject of creativeness escapes the modern imagination i wont bother to give you any examples you start running men man which will take care of all things body woman baby mother house planet sun anything that apparently is the case combination be willing to change your mind if youre wrong dont beat one to death that isnt producing results it says right in the auditors code and all of sudden youll get some kind of an idea of what it takes to aberrate thetan theres plenty of magnitude theres plenty of betrayal theres plenty of injustice large gobby doses of gore for somebody to come along and say that some little girl met some little boy and they noticed things and then ever afterwards the little boy was aberrated and later on became homosexual for anybody to put this out as fact showed him to be very bad investigator or dam liar or both sex you say is one of the primary factors of creative aberration to create an aberration by sex you would think is deadeasy the guy is at least creating something with sex even if its only even if its only trouble chuckle here to some degree on creativeness its not nearly as aberrative as whole group of oh sexual incidents of great magnitude would not be as aberrative as great group of people they get together to build building the preclear is part of the group and hes building the building too and theyre all building along garbled going along fine one day the rest of the group turns around to him and says get out of here and they ejectedclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure creativeness12 him they wouldnt have anything to do with him anymore and he could never find out what he did im afraid that sort of thing third dynamic aberration would be much stronger fellow who was going along quite happily he was being man and all of sudden grew great alligator scales all the way down his back that would be worse than any sexual aberration hed be ejected from the human race in some fashion or hed become such tremendous curiosity and become so wealthy exhibiting these scales hes be such loser or such successful boy on the subject that the thing would aberrate his normal ideas more importantly some individual has been able to make it for years generations millennia as lets say an officer of police always been able to make it all the way up theline always been able to make it made better societies made people stand in line created things everybody respected him you know boy hes just going along fine one day hes the emperors captain of body guards something of the sort and they he didnt do any treason so they arrest him for treason because they want to get him out of the road or something of the sort and then they garrotte him but then they decide not to garrotte him at the last moment and put him on public display garbled and he finds out his wife did it all in the first place and thats the end of that life he went on for years generations millennia as terrific success to create society from this viewpoint so its obviously successful mock up now hes taught not just once but maybe the next sixteen times he tries it that when you be come apolice officer or captain of police or chief of body guard or something like that you get executed thats the first thing that happens now he has two data that cannot compute and we get the basis of every obsessive mock up and computational situation on case the situation cannot be computed one day one day he runs into friend who is cop whos been guilty of killing wife and we find him as an auditor we find him in the valence of the cop who killed his wife and we say good heavens what is all this about what is all this about we say well obviously wife killing hes just being cop run help on cops thats all you have to do all of sudden the case will fall apart hed be able to mock up hed be able to get the show on theroad in all directions but if you were unlucky you could go for long time without finding out that it was cop valence he was up against youd be running mothers and mothersinlaw and babies and houses and perambulators and bicycles and mayors and politicians and soldiers and sailors and cows and almost everything then nothings happening its alright im getting along alright i enjoy auditing im enjoying being audited then one day when you get smart and you start to get interested in the preclear and you talk to him little bit and find out the one thing he has never mentioned was that he went to the university and roomed with afterwards fellow who was police officer killed his wife and who was executed hell tell you at first that he didnt even know the guy but this is gone get the idea yousuddenly get this type of person you run that type of person on help not that individual but that type of individual and you run help on it in brackets the case falls apart and he can do step six like startled gazelle he can really do step six ive audited him now the point im making is then the actual commands of step six are relatively simple they are the subject of publications all youre doing when youre running step six is getting the individual practice in simple form mock up you have him mock up something inclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure creativeness13 front of his body and keep it from going away mock it up behind his body and keep it from going away below his body above his body the right of the body the left of the body each time keeping it from going away each time asking if he did so and thanking him for it and then you run simple mock ups in front behind left right above below the body on holding them still and then simple mock ups again lot of auditors miss on this they just have him mock up anything you want him to mock up simple mock ups cubes circles little things and you run the same type of thing on make it little more solid and ask him if he did and you get then an individuality improving improving showing up being more and more able to create and at the same time getting more and more confidence in creating so youd say help makes it possible for him to create and step six gives him the confidence and practice of actual creation this is clearing he eventually winds up without reactive bank and hes happy about it because he can mock up one any time he wants to but he doesnt have to now the fact of clearing was for many years barred from our knowledge by the simple fact that we could not ourselves believe the horrible truth that people through irresponsibility mocked up all of their own difficulties theres good to merely challenge them they got to assume all these responsibilities youve got to sneak up on them much more quietly than that and we can do so now with clear procedure therefore clearing is fact clearing can be done and you can do it thank you end of lecture
