from ben santer santer1llnlgov to pjonesueaacuk subject re fyi date wed 25 apr 2007 165829 0700 replyto santer1llnlgov xflowed dear phil i looked at some of the stuff on the climate audit web site id really like to talk to few of these auditors in dark alley they seem to have understanding of how science is actually done appreciation of the fact that uncertainty is an integral part of what we do once again just let know how i can help it will be good to see you in exeter im looking forward to that ill have two nights in london after the meeting and am hoping to spend some time wandering around the british museum i met very nice lady stephanie while i was giving series of climate change lectures in puerto rico back in january shes professor at the university of san francisco and fortuitously specializes in the policy implications of climate change risk assessment etc she also likes hiking and climbing its fun to have life again as they say over here best wishes to you and ruth ben pjonesueaacuk wrote ben thanks for the thoughts im in geneva at the moment so have bit of time to think possibly ill get the raw data from ghcn and do some work to replace our adjusted data with these then make the raw ie as transmitted by the nmss this will annoy them more so may inflame the situation got some ideasthoughts from mike kevin and gavin schmidt some of the stuff on the climat audit web site is awful will also be talking to someone at uea is they have anything useful to say also talking to weichyung about how hell respond i will be in exeter get back from tarragona on the weds am so should be there for dinner on the first day lots of odd things going on at the hc by the way see you in exeter cheers phil dear phil sorry about the delay in replying to your email ive been out of my office for few days this is really nasty stuff and im sorry that its happened to you the irony in this is that you are one of the most careful and thorough scientists i know keenans allegations of research misconduct although malicious and completely unfounded clearly require some response the bottom line is that there are uncertainties inherent in measuring any properties of the realworld climate system youve probably delved deeper than anyone else on the planet into uncertainties in observed surface temperature records this would be well worth pointing out to mr keenan the whole tenor of the website stuff and keenans garbage is that these folks are scrupulously careful data analysts and you are not they conveniently ignore all the pioneering work that youve done on identification of inhomogeneities in surface temperature records the response should mention that youve spent much of your scientific career trying to quantify the effects of such inhomogeneities changing spatial coverage etc on observed estimates of globalscale surface temperature change the bottom line here is that observational data are frequently messy they are not the neat tidy beasts mr keenan would like them to be this holds not only for surface temperature measurements it also holds in spades for measurements of tropospheric temperature from msu and radiosondes and for measurements of ocean temperatures from xbts profiling floats etc we would like observing systems to be more accurate more stable and bettersuited for monitoring decadalscale changes in climate you and kevin and many other are actively working towards that goal the key message here is that despite uncertainties in the surface temperature record uncertainties which you and others in the field are well aware of and have worked hard to quantify it is now unequivocal that surface temperatures have warmed markedly over the past 100 years uncertainties in the station histories do not negate this basic message hope some of these random musings might be useful phil let know if theres anything else i can do to help will you be at the hadley centre science review group meeting in may with best regards ben pjonesueaacuk wrote all thanks for the thoughts ill muse on them whilst away ive decided to ignore the blogs but will wait till i hear from weichyung when hes back there is point yet in my responding to keenan till weichyung hears im away much of the next 3 weeks so i wont be responding quickly ill be noting down some points for possible response so anything ill do will be considered rather than my usual quick responses the unequivocal statement in the spm will be clear in any response the whole tone of their argument smacks of last resort challenge 2007 continues warm for the first 3 months cheers phil i agree on the blogs i have refrained from any responses to the attacks on wrt hurricanes etc k i dont disagree w kevins points here but i do think it is dangerous to respond to an accusation made on blog dubious one at that it sets bad precedent on the other hand since the letter to wang was copied to you i guess it is legitimate for you to respond to that but very carefully as kevin points out mike kevin trenberth wrote hi phil i am sure you know that this is not about the science it is an attack to undermine the science in some way in that regard i dont think you can ignore it all as mike suggests as one option but the response should try to somehow label these guys and lazy and incompetent and unable to do the huge amount of work it takes to construct such database indeed technology and data handling capabilities have evolved and not everything was saved so my feeble suggestion is to indeed cast aspersions on their motives and throw in some counter rhetoric labeling them as lazy with nothng better to do seems like good thing to do how about i tried to get some data from mcintyre from his 1990 paper but i was unable because he doesnt have such paper because he has not done any constructive work there is basis for retracting paper given in keenans message one may have to offer correction that particular sentence was not correct if it claimed something that indeed was not so but some old instrumental data are like paleo data and can only be used with caution as the metadata do not exist it doesnt mean they are worthless and can not be used offering to make correction to few words in paper in trivial manner will undermine his case kevin hi phil this is all too predictable this crowd of charlatans is always looking for one thing they can harp on where people w little knowledge of the facts might be able to be convinced that there is controversy they cant take on the whole of the science so they look for one little thing they can say is wrong and thus generalize that the science is entirely compromised of course as nicely shown in the spm every landmass is independently warming and much as the models predict so they can harp all they want on one chinese data set it couldnt possibly change the big picture let alone even the trends for china the so they are simply hoping to blow this up to something that looks like legitimate controversy the last thing you want to do is help them by feeding the fire best thing is to ignore them completely they longer have their friends in power here in the us and the media has become entirely unsympathetic to the rants of the contrarians at least in the usthe wall street journal editorial page are about the only place they can broadcast their disinformation so in other words for contrarians the environment appears to have become very unfavorable for development i would advise wang the same way keenan may or may not be bluffing but if he tries this i believe that british law would make it easy for wang to win defamation suit against him the burden is much tougher in the states mike phil jones wrote kevin have look at this web site i see youre away the websites can wait but scroll down to the letter below from keenan the last sentence httpwwwclimateauditorgp1471comments and httpwwwclimateauditorgp1479more1479 one is about data from paper 17 years ago jones et 1990 also there is this email below sent to weichyung wang who was one of the coauthors on the 1990 paper weichyung is in china and may not yet have seen this when hes back in albany ive suggested he talks to someone there it is all malicious ive ccd this to ben and mike as well to get any thoughts from their experiences if it gets worse i will bring susan in as well but im talking to some people at uea first susan has enough to do with getting the ar4 wg1 volume out on the 1990 paper i have put the locations and the data for the rural stations used in the paper on the cru website all the language is about not being able to send them the station data used for the grids as used in 1990 i dont have this information as we have much more data now much more in australia and china than then and probably more stations in western ussr are as well as for the other request i dont have the information on the sources of all the sites used in the crutem3 database we are adding in new datasets regularly all of nz from jim renwick recently but we dont keep source code for each station almost all sites have multiple sources and only few sites have single sources i know things roughly by country and could reconstruct it but it would take while ghcn and ncar dont have source codes either it does all come from the nmss well mostly but some from scientists lot of the issues are in various papers but they never read these also certainly use talking to them in geneva all week david parker and tom peterson will be there i can live with the web site abuse but the keenan letter knocked back bit i seem to be the marked man now cheers phil from dj keenan to weichyung wang cc phil jones subject retraction request date fri 20 apr 2007 133115 0100 xmailer microsoft outlook express 60029003028 xueaspamscore 00 xueaspamlevel xueaspamflag dear dr wang regarding the chinese meteorological data analyzed by wang et grl 1990 and jones et nature 1990 it now seems clear that there are severe problems in particular the data was obtained from 84 meteorological stations that can be classified as follows 49 have histories 08 have inconsistent histories 18 have substantial relocations 02 have singleyear relocations 07 have relocations furthermore some of the relocations are very distantover 20 km others are to greatly different environments as illustrated here httpwwwclimateauditorgp1323comment102970 the above contradicts the published claim to have considered the histories of the stations especially for the 49 stations that have histories yet the claim is crucial for the research conclusions i emailed you about this on april 11th i also phoned you on april 13th you said that you were in meeting and would get back to i have received response i ask you to retract your grl paper in full and to retract the claims made in nature about the chinese data if you do not do so i intend to publicly submit an allegation of research misconduct to your university at albany douglas j keenan
