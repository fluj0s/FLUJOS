tsunami humanitarian assistance and relief operations summary on december 26 2004 magnitude 90 undersea earthquake off the west coast of northern sumatra indonesia unleashed tsunami that affected more than 12 countries throughout south and southeast asia and stretched as far as the northeastern african coast current official estimates indicate that more than 250000 people are dead or missing and millions of others are affected including those injured or displaced making this the deadliest tsunami on record sections of indonesia sri lanka india and thailand have suffered the worst devastation in response the united nations the united states and other donor nations have organized what some have called the worlds largest relief and recovery operation to date president bush pledged 350 million in aid early on and mobilized the us military to provide logistical and other assistance the administration has increased this amount by seeking 600 million in its request for 950 million for tsunami relief in the fy2005 emergency supplemental of this total 346 million would replenish usaid emergency aid accounts that had been drawn down in support of the us government response and reimburse defense department accounts that were used in the relief effort on march 16 the house passed hr 1268 funding all items proposed under the tsunami recovery and reconstruction fund except for the 45 million proposed for debt reduction the largescale us response to the tsunami is unlikely to reverse the decline in the us image abroad since the september 11 attacks because this decline primarily is due to american policies in the middle east however the scale and scope of us assistance could provide positive example of us leadership and military capabilities additionally the disaster relief cooperation between the us and indonesian militaries is likely to be mentioned during the annual congressional deliberations over renewing restrictions on usindonesian

humanitarian assistance and relief operations background1 introduction on december 26 2004 magnitude 90 undersea earthquake off the west coast of northern sumatra indonesia unleashed tsunami that affected more than 12 countries throughout south and southeast asia and stretched as far as the northeastern african coast within six hours the deadly waves traveled more than 3000 miles and carved trail of death and destruction as they arrived on land current official estimates indicate that more than 250000 people are dead or missing and millions of others are affected including the injured or displaced2 the world health organization who indicates that an estimated three to five million people lack the basic necessities for survival between one and two million people may be displaced in many places the physical environment is badly damaged or destroyed including entire communities homes businesses tourist areas and infrastructure roads bridges power and telephone systems and public buildings for many their means of livelihood and way of life has been wiped out in the hardest hit areas social services are severely compromised or nonexistent experts have said this is the most powerful earthquake in 40 years and the fourth and perhaps the second most deadly in the last century estimates of the dead make it the worst tsunami disaster on record massive global relief and recovery operation is underway according to the united nations the relief operation is the largest ever undertaken indonesia sri lanka india and thailand have suffered some of the worst devastation within day all were declared disaster by their respective us ambassador which allowed us aid to be immediately released through the office of foreign disaster assistance ofda for information on current conditions and latest developments view the reports of governments private voluntary agencies and agencies on the web at httpwwwreliefwebint 1 prepared by rhoda margesson foreign affairs analyst 2 early estimates of deaths from natural disasters are difficult to calculate and usually quite different from the final count in this disaster the final number likely will never be known with any accuracy given the number of countries involved the long populous coastlines that were struck by the tsunamis and the number of villages completely destroyed numbers fluctuate see donald g mcneil jr experts say accurate toll is hard to calculate new york times december 29 2004 crs2 figure 1 map of the 2004 indian ocean earthquake and tsunami comparisons to past disasters3 in terms of estimated fatalities the indian ocean tsunami ranks among the worlds worst natural disasters though it falls below other events see table 1 the unique feature of this tsunami is the extent of the damage and the number of countries affected unlike the damage caused by other disasters which tended to be highly localized the indian ocean tsunami struck thousands of miles of populous coastline in nearly dozen countries affecting millions of people the devastation was particularly acute in several island areas where at times entire land masses were flooded the very nature of the tidal waves combined with the lack of warning made women children the elderly and others unable to swim particularly vulnerable also the potential deaths of thousands of tourists from the industrialized world vacationing in southern thailand and sri lanka mostly europeans but also many americans and japanese has given the indian ocean tsunami higher profile than previous disasters 3 prepared by mark manyin specialist in

emergency response gained momentum in january discussion of the medium and longterm reconstruction of the area had already begun and continues at international meetings and within the us government ongoing damage assessments related to reconstruction are underway in the affected countries experts had already estimated the total damage to the region in the billions of dollars in indonesia joint report issued by the government of indonesia and the international donor community estimates that the total cost of damages and losses is 445 billion4 secretary general kofi annan said it could take ten years to bring parts of the region back to full capacity the reconstruction effort will likely attempt to reduce the vulnerability of these countries to similar disasters in the future although countries in the pacific region have warning system for tsunamis which are relatively frequent occurrence the countries in the indian ocean lack such coordinated response in an effort to improve disaster preparedness review of the response to the earthquake and tsunami may include an examination of the dissemination of information by national governments to other governments and to their populace communication between regional governments about the course and damage of the storm and local governmental disaster response plans and procedures see the section on early warning systems

indian ocean earthquake and tsunamis fact sheet 36 february 22 2005 as the disaster unfolded the dilemma involved in prioritizing resource allocations began to take shape on the one hand to try to save as many lives as possible and on the other to identify and dispose of bodies as death tolls continued to rise multiple challenges have arisen because of the large number of countries affected across wide geographic area moreover indonesia sri lanka and somalia have been in conflicts that are as yet unresolved and present potential difficulties in the distribution of aid and there are millions of people displaced separated from their families and left with nothing critical problems vary by country including the condition of the infrastructure and response system the scope of destruction and degree of access the situation in each country is discussed later in the report initial assessments indicated that the most urgent priorities in the affected areas were for potable water sanitation and waste disposal food and shelter as the transition to recovery continues water and sanitation activities providing shelter to affected communities and monitoring health remain clear priorities 5 prepared by rhoda margesson foreign affairs analyst crs6 relief operations and aid delivery experts break relief operations into several phases search and rescue treatment and survival relocation and rehabilitation and longterm reconstruction6 as with any massive undertaking that has many moving parts it can take days to get relief effort underway delays in transportation and congestion lack of transportation infrastructure bureaucratic problems lack of access all can cause bottlenecks at key points in the system while timing is critical to save lives to enable network of this size to function efficiently requires the coordination of assessments and appropriate responses with local governments communities and the international community in general the relief effort has been viewed positively and the convening authority of the united nations has been well received the sheer scale of this relief effort has brought together tremendous capacity and willingness to help but experts generally caution that an ongoing effort and strategic planning at the regional and country levels is required at each phase to work out coordination and logistics issues the relief effort is now focused primarily on recovery and rehabilitation7 more detailed interagency assessments are underway the information from which will be critical for planning recovery and reconstruction initiatives developing strategies for the use of funding and determining whether personnel are in place with adequate resources in certain areas particularly in indonesia access and logistics problems continue there are logistical bottlenecks and the lack of transportation and adequate infrastructure remain challenge concerns about disease and the need for sanitation and medical capacity are still critical impediments to aid in indonesia appear to be particularly challenging for several reasons there are the obvious logistical difficulties the destruction of transportation infrastructure has made it difficult to extend assistance to all of the affected areas8 the coordination of national and local level government with the military and relief groups presents problems the conflict between secessionists and the government has also complicated the relief effort the indonesian military feels it has to look to both relief and counterinsurgency operations there is also the issue of national pride indonesia was like india leading member of the nonaligned movement this may be in part reason for indonesias decision to ask providers of foreign military assistance to leave the country by march the indian ocean earthquake and tsunami created natural disaster of historic proportion the massive relief and reconstruction effort underway also departs from previous emergency operations in its scope and scale the initial objectives of the relief operation involving search and rescue treatment and survival are thought to 6 relief massive effort massive need christian science monitor

indonesia is open to trucks and passable for 67 kilometres but the journey now takes 12 hours instead of the 2 it used to take prior to the tsunami crs7 have been met in the immediate posttsunami period basic needs were addressed and further deaths were prevented although it is early to determine lessons learned the assessment of the response to the tsunami disaster so far has been positive on many levels from meeting basic humanitarian needs to civilmilitary coordination information sharing and working with national governments and indigenous organizations the operation has not been without its challenges such as bottlenecks in aid delivery but all things considered it is currently viewed by many as largely successful in addition to working closely with the national governments of the countries affected by the disaster the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs unocha has been the lead agency working with actors on the ground coordinating with the military and enlisting donor support as the immediate humanitarian requirements of the operation have been fulfilled transition to recovery and reconstruction is now taking place and the operation is shifting from using military to civilian capacity for delivery of assistance for the foreseeable future unocha will continue as the lead agency the transition phase of the posttsunami period will be challenging while emergency assistance and the need to guard against the outbreak of disease will continue for some time there is new emphasis on conducting assessments and planning for longterm reconstruction and with that priorities and funding are beginning to shift9 initial assessments focused mainly on basic assistance needs now longterm challenges such as creating jobs and housing are become more pressing host governments are also taking more of lead in determining the outcome of this next phase and with this transition there are other issues to consider such as security and political tensions access for aid workers and the return of displaced populations within the relief operation transparency and accountability at the united nations but also with any organization receiving funds remains point of focus coordinating the assessments projects and capabilities of numerous actors with host governments will become more difficult as the complicated task of reconstruction takes hold health the world health organization who which is the lead agency for the coordination of international public health response to disasters such as the tsunami and the united nations childrens fund unicef along with international organizations and nongovernmental organizations ngos are all working to meet the public health needs of the affected region in the first week after the disaster who warned that the death toll could double if clean water sanitation medical treatment and relief supplies were not provided to the affected areas10 9 see usaid indian ocean earthquake and tsunamis fact sheet 32 february 8 2005 10 response to enormity the washington post december 29 2004 crs8 who continues to stress the need to guard against the risk of disease and further deaths through surveillance and early warning systems who remains particularly concerned about disease outbreaks among the many vulnerable populations from contaminated water sources and crowded unsanitary living conditions including cholera dysentery malaria and dengue fever the numbers of injured are estimated to be twice or three times the death toll so far there do not appear to be any signs of epidemics who has also identified the need to address mental health issues and rebuild the capacity of health systems as critical to recovery11 protection for children and separated orphans12 background trafficking in children goes on worldwide and may even be increasing statistics on child trafficking however are very unreliable and official estimates may reflect only part of its actual extent the department of states 2004 trafficking in persons report says that of the 600000 800000 persons trafficked across international borders each year 70 are female and 50 are children in addition according to that report many more people probably millions are trafficked within countries the international labor organization ilo puts the number of children trafficked both internally and across borders annually at 12 million all these numbers are estimates and country is immune from trafficking including the united states13 according to the united nations human trafficking is highly lucrative global industry controlled by powerful criminal organizations from which they derive many billions in revenues annually this places human trafficking just behind drug and arms trafficking in terms of illicit revenues global experience in addressing child trafficking and distinct focus on the problem separate from the overall human trafficking issue is relatively new the problem is huge in scope multifaceted and sensitive both culturally and politically both boys and girls are trafficked as are children of all ages some very young children and some nearly adults trafficking in children is directly linked to their subsequent exploitation the forms of exploitation vary including commercial sexual exploitation for prostitution or pornography use as domestic servants as bonded laborers as beggars in other illicit activities from drug running to burglaries as well as child soldiers in addition babies may be trafficked for adoption and older teens for marriage in all cases constraints are put on the movement of the children involved who are virtually enslaved girls are the chief victims of trafficking for 11 see questions and answers south asia earthquake and tsunami world health organization january 14 2005 12 prepared by rhoda margesson foreign affairs analyst 13 anywhere between 20000 and 50000 people are trafficked into the united states each year depending on the source in addition there are around 200000 young people in america who may be victims of trafficking within the united states remarks of under secretary of state for global affairs paula dobriansky in helsinki finland on june 3 2003 at httpwwwusembassyfiservletpageserverpagetraffickingdobrianskyhtml for background see also crs report rl30545 trafficking in persons the us and international response by francis t miko crs9 sexual exploitation domestic work and marriage boys and girls however are subjected to trafficking and most forms of exploitation14 the root causes of sale and trafficking of children are complex and include conditions of conflict and population movements poverty lack of employment opportunities low social status of the girl child impunity from prosecution and general lack of education and awareness children from minority groups or those who are undocumented are particularly vulnerable to being trafficked15 situations of massive dislocation due to natural disasters like the recent tsunami in the indian ocean provide opportunities for syndicates to take advantage of the chaos and breakdown of protection mechanisms that leave orphans and children separated from their parents particularly vulnerable tsunami orphans the tsunami generation unicef and other organizations focused on the fate of children orphaned or separated from their families amid the chaos of disaster acknowledge it is multifaceted problem that will take time to resolve the scope of the problem in the tsunamiaffected countries is not fully known and although there are only estimates of the number of children orphaned or separated from their parents unicef now states that the numbers of unaccompanied and separated children are much lower than initially expected unicef refers to these children as the tsunami generation early on after the tsunami struck the united nations international organizations and ngos issued warnings of the risks to children left unprotected in the aftermath of the tsunami they are working on highalert prevention mechanisms including raising awareness at camps providing guidelines to officials and volunteers urging governments in affected countries to act and identifying police and community officials to be of assistance international adoptions are considered very premature and are not considered the best option for the child governments of affected countries are working with unicef to prevent illegal adoptions and trafficking unicef has developed five key steps to protect children from exploitation including identification and registration provision of immediate safe care tracing and reunification with extended family members alerting police and community authorities and working with governments of the affected countries to monitor the problem unicef is also encouraging children to go back to school as soon as possible as way of creating more normal environment and beginning to deal with the mental trauma of the disaster see appendix 2 for an overview of unicefs activities 14 trafficking in children for sexual purposes an analytical review p 17 at

sanitation health and other kinds of relief supplies on december 28 10 million was allocated for the relief effort for total estimated initial contribution by the united states of around 15 million17 as reports of the growing scale of the disaster came in the united states raised its pledge to 35 million18 by december 31 this number had increased to 350 million of this amount as of february 22 2005 usaid reports that more than 120 million has been committed19 for the latest breakdown of us government assistance to the region see httpwwwusaidgov military assistance to the region in coordination with international organizations and ngos includes flights with relief aid medical supplies personnel and equipment to affected areas20 initially the us navy dispatched p3 patrol aircraft

positioned to provide relief supplies including the capacity to produce potable water transport vehicles generators and other equipment military forensic teams deployed to thailand and preventive medicine units conducted assessments in indonesia by midjanuary more than 11600 military personnel were involved in the relief operation with 17 ships and 75 aircraft the cost of total military

the efforts of the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha as the lead agency on the relief effort two interagency task forces were established one to coordinate us government relief efforts and the other to assist in tracking missing americans eighteen americans are confirmed dead with another sixteen presumed dead private sector assistance has already been substantial and is expected to continue to grow21 on january 3 president bush announced that former presidents george hw bush and bill clinton would lead fundraising effort in the us private sector in support of the tsunami crisis they traveled to the region to assess the damage from february 1821 cash donations are being encouraged it is too soon to estimate the value of private relief supplies which will be transported by dod under the denton program22 us secretary of state colin powell florida governor jeb bush and usaid administrator andrew natsios visited the affected region in early january 2005 to assess the situation and whether the response is sufficient to meet the needs on the ground several us congressional delegations have also traveled to the region over the past few months the us emergency response mechanism the united states is generally leader and major contributor to relief efforts in humanitarian disasters23 in 2004 the united states contributed more than 24 billion to disaster relief worldwide in the case of the indian ocean earthquake and tsunami it is clear that the response will require major longterm effort beyond the relief and recovery operation currently underway24 21 see also crs report rl32738 charitable contributions for tsunami relief pl 1091 by pamela l jackson 22 the denton program named after former member of congress jeremiah denton authorizes shipment of privately donated humanitarian goods on us military aircraft on spaceavailable basis the donated goods must be certified as appropriate for the disaster by usaids ofda and can be bumped from the transport if other us government aid must be transported 23 for background information see crs report rl32714 international disasters and humanitarian assistance us governmental response by rhoda margesson 24 there are number of variables that make reading the united states government numbers and drawing accurate conclusions problematic questions about authority definitions and categories of services make up part of the reason it is challenge to grasp the concept and continued crs12 the president has broad authority to provide emergency assistance for foreign disasters and the united states government provides disaster assistance through several us agencies the very nature of humanitarian disasters the need to respond quickly in order to save lives and provide relief has resulted in an unrestricted definition of what this type of assistance consists of on both policy and operational level while humanitarian assistance is assumed to provide for urgent food shelter and medical needs the agencies within the us government providing this support expand or contract the definition in response to circumstances funds may be used for us agencies to deliver the services required or to provide grants to international organizations ios international governmental and nongovernmental organizations ngos and private or religious voluntary organizations pvos usaid is the us agency charged with coordinating us government and private sector assistance25 it also coordinates with international organizations the governments of countries suffering disasters and other governments ofda in usaids bureau of humanitarian response can respond immediately with relief materials and personnel including personnel and materiel already located in various countries around the world26 it is responsible for the provision of nonfood humanitarian assistance and has disaster response teams darts which can be assembled quickly to conduct assessments of the situation ofda has wide authority to borrow funds equipment and personnel from other parts of usaid and other federal agencies usaid has two other offices that administer us humanitarian aid food for peace ffp and the office of transition initiatives oti usaid administers title ii of the ffp under pl 480 and provides relief and development food aid that does not have to be repaid oti provides postdisaster transition assistance which includes mainly shortterm peace and democratization projects with some attention to humanitarian elements but not emergency relief the department of defense dod overseas humanitarian disaster and civic aid ohdaca appropriation funds three dod humanitarian programs the humanitarian assistance program hap the humanitarian mine action hma program and foreign disaster relief and emergency response fdrer the office provides humanitarian support to stabilize emergency situations and deals with range of tasks including the provision of food shelter and supplies and medical evacuations in addition the president has the authority to draw down defense equipment and direct military personnel to respond to disasters the president may 24 continued function of humanitarian assistance another factor has to do with how the numbers are generated in budgets within the us government each agency has its own budget with its own criteria accounting detail and regional specificity the fact that an urgent response to humanitarian crises is often required only compounds the problem budgets may reflect regional support certain area specific countries or combination thereof over time and with changing events particularly in comparing assistance levels with other countries financial sources may be compared against other forms of assistance blankets etc or they may reflect commitments of support rather than overall obligations 25 private donations may be made to the private agencies working the area which are listed on the internet at httpwwwinteractionorg 26 authorized in sec 491493 of pl 87195 the foreign assistance act of 1961 crs13 also use the denton program to provide space available transportation on military aircraft and ships to private donors who wish to transport humanitarian goods and equipment in response to disaster generally ofda provides emergency aid which lasts 3090 days the same is true for department of

northernmost province of aceh was closest to the epicenter of the indian ocean earthquake successive tidal waves of 30 to 50 feet high slammed into acehs west coast of nearly 200 miles as of the end of february 2005 the indonesian government estimated over 127000 killed and over 116000 missing aerial surveys of acehs west coast from banda aceh the provincial capital southward for about 150 miles revealed near total destruction of towns and villages with many of them underwater the coastal area was isolated with aid getting through until january 1 2005 the same is true of number of small islands off sumatras west coast initial international aid is coming through the reopened banda aceh airport and the airport at medan major city south of aceh the united states australia and singapore were supplying the bulk of aid and nongovernment humanitarian groups were also active the initial input of aid brought forth partial recovery in banda aceh the reopening of markets the restoration of power and water to 40 of the city and shipments of fuel supplies into the city indonesian government efforts to remove massive debris and bury thousands of dead people were making progress although much remained to be done beginning on january 1 us sh60 bravo helicopters flying off the us aircraft carrier abraham lincoln were delivering food and water to the isolated towns and villages down acehs west coast from banda aceh on january 2 us navy helicopters numbering about 25 flew 27 missions and delivered 80000 pounds of supplies indonesian navy helicopters also were delivering supplies to these towns and villages but the indonesian military only has few helicopters in sumatra providing adequate water to the thousands of acehnese stranded along the west coast has been difficult medical treatment of numerous injuries also has been difficult many of the injured have to be transported by helicopter to medical facilities at banda aceh which strains the helicopter fleet available the indonesian military tni controls the relief supplies at the banda aceh and medan airports until january 1 the tni initially refused to allow foreign relief airplanes to land at banda aceh indonesian president susilio yudhoyono apparently overrode military opposition to foreign relief deliveries since then several tni commanders have cooperated with american australian and singaporean military units and they have praised the us military relief effort nevertheless on january 11 and 12 the indonesian military and government officials announced restrictions on future foreign relief operations in aceh the main restrictions are termination of all foreign military relief operations by march 26 restrictions on plans by us marines to move significant quantities of aid and manpower into the west coast of aceh the establishment of tni operational control over all foreign relief operations requirement that tni officer be on board any foreign aircraft engaged in relief confinement of foreign aid workers to the towns of 39 prepared by larry niksch specialist in asian affairs and bruce vaughn analyst in asian affairs crs22 banda aceh and meulaboh unless they receive tni permission to operate elsewhere and requirement that aid workers operating outside banda aceh and meulaboh must be accompanied by tni personnel us and other foreign militaries began to withdraw in february 2005 and complete withdrawal likely will occur by the march 26 deadline the indonesian government also announced that it would issue master plan on march 26 to shift the aid effort in aceh from humanitarian assistance to reconstruction as part of this the government disclosed that it was reviewing the presence of foreign nongovernment groups ngos in aceh and that it would order some of these to depart on or around march 26 foreign aid donor countries pledged 17 billion in reconstruction aid for aceh in 2005 and they offered to reschedule indonesian foreign debt repayments of up to 2 billion this is on top of 34 billion in development aid to indonesia indonesias plans to establish relocation centers to initially house 30000 acehnese tsunami refugees then an additional 60000 remains controversial the military will have role in operating the centers in the past the military has practiced forced relocation of acehnese as counterinsurgency tool foreign ngos are reluctant to be involved in this program there are an estimated 380000 refugees in aceh the military has admitted that it has continued to carry out operations against free aceh insurgents despite the militarys selfproclaimed ceasefire after december 26 tni attitudes are governed by an insurgency in the province that has gone on since 1976 antiindonesia forces the free aceh movement gam seek independence for the province and cite decades of repressive indonesian rule as justification for their uprising the indonesian military tni long has been accused of committing atrocities and other human rights abuses in aceh and being involved in corrupt practices there in may 2003 the indonesian government under pressure from the tni ended sixmonthlong ceasefire with the insurgents and declared martial law the tni suppressed separatist political activity and reported resumed severe human rights violations the tni also banned foreigners from aceh including aid workers the government lifted the ban on foreign aid workers on december 27 2004 but the restrictions announced on january 11 and 12 2005 appear motivated at least in part by desire of the tni to restore aceh as much as possible to the pretsunami situation of closure to foreigners tni commanders justify the restrictions as needed to protect aid workers from the gam and prevent relief supplies from falling into the hands of gam however gam has declared ceasefire and asserts that it welcomes the foreign presence the tni reportedly has pressed for reduction of the foreign ngo presence in aceh after march 26 2005 the government and the gam renewed peace talks in february 2005 in helsinki finland the gam dropped its demand for independence and proposed selfrule it continued to reject the indonesian government special autonomy plan for aceh contending that the plan actually provided for continued centralized rule from jakarta indonesian delegates said they would take the gams proposals to jakarta and that the indonesian government would reply at the next round of talks crs23 the tni also has facilitated the entrance into aceh of islamic militant groups allegedly for relief operations the tni provided air transport provisions and housing to these groups one of these groups the mujahideen council of indonesia mmi is viewed by us terrorism experts such as zachary abuza currently with the us institute of peace as political front for jemaah islamiya qaedas regional terrorist arm in southeast asia40 the tnis support of mmis entrance into aceh raises questions regarding the tnis relations with and policies toward islamic terrorist groups secretary of state condoleeza rice certified in february 2005 that indonesia is cooperating in investigating the killings and wounding of an american teacher in papua in august 2002

dead86 officials said that about half of the dead were foreign vacationers many from europe many oceanfront properties particularly hotels were destroyed in the wave compared to other affected nations however the infrastructure in thailand was left relatively unscathed the regional electricity grid and telecommunication network continued to function and the transportation system and water supply in phuket were largely unaffected the emergency response in thailand was praised by the international community united nations and australian relief agency officials described effective and rapid

forces and his handson leadership thaksin has also come out strongly in favor of establishing tsunami alert system in cooperation with other regional governments scattered press reports initially accused government officials of declining to evacuate the island despite receiving warning based partially on fears of hurting the tourism industry87 such criticism has largely subsided however and thaksins popularity ratings have increased based on his leadership in the wake of the disaster on february 7 2005 thaksin was elected to second term the diplomatic and logistical challenge of the disaster in thailand was different from the other affected countries because at least 36 nationalities were represented among the victims many consulates were directly involved in the tasks of

as of december 29 had given out little information of the effects on burma an official from an international aid agency told the agence france presse on december 27 on condition of anonymity that government officials were confirming 36 dead the government subsequently issued figure of 53 dead on december 28 the agence france presse cited at least 90 killed but cited source the source apparently was information over the internet websites of antigovernment groups the international aid agency official speculated that the actual death toll is far greater given the trajectory of the tidal waves and the closeness of burmas indian ocean coastline to the epicenter of the earthquake the london sunday telegraph reprinted in the washington times january 2 2005 quoted burmese fishermen describing major loss of life on lower burmas coastline just north of the hardhit thai coast however officials stated on january 6 that the death toll in burma was relatively small the burmese government had not issued an appeal for international aid as of january 3 2005 officials doctors without borders and the international committee for the red cross have sought government permission to visit the lower burma coastline the issue of aid is complicated by the heavy economic sanctions imposed by the united states and the european union on burma because of the politically repressive policies of the militarydominated burmese government united nations officials in rangoon stated on december 27 that the united nations was prepared to conduct relief operations the government likely would accept humanitarian and reconstruction aid from china burmas main international supporter and from regional countries like malaysia singapore and india the government also might accept humanitarian aid from japan which has provided low levels of such aid despite sanctions on japanese developmental aid and investment however the government likely would not allow any sizeable presence of foreign aid workers it is also highly unlikely that the government would ask for or accept aid from the united states number of experts on burma have stated that the views of burmese military officials toward the united states have become very negative because of the absence of positive us response to the governments release from house arrest of opposition leader aung sann suukyi in 1992 and the us congress enactment of total ban on burmese imports to the united states in july 1993 in response to the rearrest of aung sann suukyi the maldives95 the tsunami also hit the islandstate of

the united states has been reported as giving 014 percent of gnp in international development assistance as compared to norways 092 percent contribution127 usaid director andrew natsios has refuted

the dispatch of secretary of state powell and florida governor bush to the region week after the tsunami may help to change this perception in previous disasters pledges made by governments have not always resulted in actual contributions the bam earthquake of december 2003 is but one example raised by the united nations experts are concerned that while billions of dollars have been pledged to help the victims of the tsunami disaster there is guarantee that these pledges will be honored it also cannot be assumed that the funds represent new money as it may previously have been allocated elsewhere some are also concerned about funding priorities and resources for other disaster areas and the very real possibility of international donor fatigue it will take time for more complete picture to reveal how the actual costs of the tsunami disaster will be shared among international donors130 competing aid and budget priorities131 even before the disaster struck congress was expected to struggle to find the resources to sustain us aid pledges amid efforts to tackle rising budget deficits by among other measures slowing or reducing discretionary spending during the fy2005 debate lawmakers reduced the presidents foreign assistance budget request subset of the larger foreign policy budget request by 17 billion or nearly 8 this was the first time such cuts occurred during the bush administration some members of congress publicly have expressed concern that funding for tsunami relief and reconstruction which depleted most worldwide disaster contingency accounts if not fully restored through supplemental appropriations may jeopardize resources for subsequent international disasters or for other aid priorities from which tsunami emergency aid has been transferred132 transparency members of congress have also raised concerns about transparency of donor contributions allocation of monies and monitoring of projects by the united nations the united nations has said it will improve its financial tracking and reporting system and price waterhouse coopers is reportedly assisting in that effort many contributions are also being made directly to international organizations and nongovernmental organizations which could raise the same questions about transparency requirements moreover while earmarks and time limits may ensure greater accountability they can also add pressure for organizations to spend contributed funds sometimes leading to unnecessary spending waste and 129 david sanger its about aid and an image new york times december 30 2004 130 james

antiindonesian free aceh movement gam to establish ties to ji or qaeda additionally some indonesian organizations and charities with known ties to ji have dispatched humanitarian relief teams to aceh in southern thailand the areas most affected by the tsunami are generally considered ethnically and regionally distinct from the predominantly muslim provinces on the western coast of peninsular thailand which have been the site of sectarian and anti government violence by muslims over the past year countering negative images of the united states the largescale us response to the tsunami is unlikely to reverse the decline in the us image abroad since the september 11 attacks because this decline primarily is due to american policies in the middle east however the scale and scope of us assistance could provide positive example of us leadership and military capabilities the decline in the us image abroad has been particularly acute in the muslim world especially in indonesia where according to one series of polls only 15 of those polled in 2003 said they had favorable opinion of the united states down from 61 in 2002137 additionally the us tsunami relief effort could help counter the perception among some southeast asians that the united states not only has placed too much emphasis on terrorism in its southeast asia policy but also has relied too heavily on hard military power to combat terrorism the 911 commission and others have recommended expanding us public diplomacy programs as way to help win the global battle for hearts and minds especially in the islamic world from which the muslim terrorists seek to draw recruits and support the restrictions on foreign relief activities announced by the indonesian military and government on january 11 and 12

early warning systems international scientific technological and other challenges138 nations affected by the december 26 2004 tsunami assisted by others are pursuing multilateral effort through the

the house approved nearly 23 million for us tsunami detection and warning in fy2005 emergency supplemental appropriations139 decisions about whether and how to proceed will likely be complicated for number of reasons one reason is because of the number of different potential international parties that would be involved with the need to coordinate data collection and warning dissemination and second is the funding needed to establish tsunami warning system in that region third is that nations including some in the indian ocean might charge for access to critical satellite data that may help in warning potential victims some in congress assert that the costs of acquiring those data could be well worth it in terms of lives saved while others counter that access to those proprietary data should be provided free of charge especially when the united states and other nations provide disaster relief and propose funding tsunami detection and warning activities for the region140 the greatest challenge is likely to be establishing local or regional emergency management infrastructures for inhabitants in coastal regions bounding the indian ocean to receive tsunami alerts in sufficient time to evacuate and to be notified when to return after the dangers have subsided141 many question who would be responsible for building and maintaining such systems after the indian ocean tsunami disaster some members of congress were concerned about the possible vulnerability of us coastal areas to tsunamis and the adequacy of early warning for coastal areas of the western atlantic ocean congress has introduced legislation142 and the bush administration has proposed expanding tsunami warning networks in pacific coastal areas and adding coverage for the atlantic seaboard the gulf of mexico and the caribbean sea143 additional tsunami detection and warning instrumentation for the united states and elsewhere could run into the millions of dollars to help offset those costs some experts suggest that existing global weather buoys regional coastal and ocean 139 house committee on appropriations making emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending september 30

totaled 412 million the bush administration budgeted 158 million for fy2005 much of this aid has gone to programs supporting the development of democratic political institutions in indonesia with recent emphasis on indonesias education system the administration reportedly will tap this existing bilateral aid program to help fund the us relief effort in indonesia146 congress can be expected to receive new aid requests from the administration focusing on humanitarian and reconstruction aid especially directed at aceh such requests undoubtedly would turn the attention of the administration and congress to the political situation in aceh especially the insurgency and the role of the indonesian military tni additionally the disaster relief cooperation between the us and indonesian militaries is likely to be mentioned during the annual congressional deliberations over renewing restrictions on usindonesian militarytomilitary relations which the bush administration has sought to restore since the september 11 2001 attacks for more than decade congress has restricted the provision of military assistance to indonesia due to concern about serious human rights violations by the tni most notably the massacre of hundreds of people participating in proindependence rally in dili east timor in november 1991 in press briefing on january 6 2005 secretary powell said that the us is trying to provide the indonesian government with enough spare parts to repair five indonesian c130 hercules transport aircraft that currently are not operational this would raise indonesias number of operational c130s to twelve as discussed below current us legislation places strict controls on the provision of military equipment to indonesia when pressed on the issue of whether jakarta in the future might use repaired planes in its conflict with the gam rebels in aceh secretary powell said that the humanitarian need trumps right now the reservations we have he added his hope that the indonesian governments desire to receive additional military parts in the future would serve as disincentive for using aircraft against the gam147 144 usgs earthquake hazards program off w coast of

source reported by unicef on january 12 2005 crs50 unicefs child protection response to the indian ocean emergency as of february 11 2005 overview the emergency following the tsunami differs from many others as the numbers of unaccompanied and separated children are relatively low large proportion of the dead was children in all affected countries extended family and community protection mechanisms function well and almost all separated children are being cared for by relatives and communities this has positive effect on both immediate care and protection and on longer term psychosocial wellbeing registration of children and family tracing were of critical importance in the first weeks following the disaster unicef in collaboration with agencies ngos and governments helped in setting up of registration and tracing facilities in order to identify orphans and reunite families the issue affecting most surviving children in the long run is distress at what they have gone through as result there is high need for psychosocial support not only to children but also to their families as well as those working with children such as teachers and social workers there have been scattered reports of trafficking of children most could not be confirmed particularly in sri lanka cases of military recruitment of children have been increasing some have occurred from tsunami camp facilities but most from local communities the particular vulnerability of the displaced populations the deployment of thousands of aid workers military personnel and logistics staff and the uncontrolled access to affected areas by non locals and foreigners lead to higher risk of sexual exploitation and trafficking of children key achievements at the global level unicef coordinates core group of agencies other international bodies and ngos including world vision icrc unhcr irc and save the children common principles tools questionnaires and registration forms were jointly developed unicef also coordinated the drafting of interagency guidelines on psychosocial support and guiding principles on separated children in addition unicef provided all its offices with reference material on trafficking child marriage and hivaids in emergencies and also training modules international standards and other material including on the secretary generals bulletin on sexual exploitation and abuse at the national level unicef took the lead on child protection issues in many of the affected countries child protection officers work in all affected countries in close collaboration with governments and provide support to coordination of registration efforts including use of standardized forms foster care arrangements support to foster families with use of institutionalized care only as last resort and training of police and military on child protection issues crs51 in indonesia unicef helped set up 20 registration centers for children and joint database was put in place unicef trained volunteers on identification of separated children and family reunification police officers and military were trained on child protection issues including women police officers who act as focal points for women and children within the local government coordination group on trafficking was established and unicef acts as the focal point in aceh on the code of conduct on sexual exploitation in sri lanka the registration in camps was completed database for registration was set up and common registration forms are in use psychosocial workers were trained recreation kits for children distributed and psychosocial support is provided in affected areas unicef is investigating reports about the recruitment of children and allegations of sexual abuse and violence against children in india unicef is printing booklet on trafficking and provides psychosocial support in 13 districts in thailand and the maldives unicef provides information on psychosocial support future concerns continued risks of child exploitation due to loss of livelihoods support to single parent households continued monitoring of foster care placement reliable followup to ensure that children in foster care arrangements are properly cared for institutionalized care used only as last resort awareness raising and programs to address domestic violence awareness raising about child marriage which is very common in some
