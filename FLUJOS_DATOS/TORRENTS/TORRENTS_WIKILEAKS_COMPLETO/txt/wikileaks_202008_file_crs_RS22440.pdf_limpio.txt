determined under the applicable state laws the ucx benefit is required to be the same amount on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as the state uc which would be payable to the individual under the app licable state law the individuals federal military service and federal military wages are assigned or transferred as employment and wages covered by that state law subject to the use of the applicable schedule of remuneration that is for claims purposes military wages are determined by the pay grade at separation from military service wage table is provided by the federal government and then is equated to civilian wages for each military pay grade102164 provides that exservicemembers be treated the same as other unemployed workers with respect to benefit levels the

benefits in the state where they are searching for employment uc eligibility criteria and benefits vary by state the exservicemembers must meet the same criteria that civilian workers are required to meet for their uc benefit eligibility thus two ex servicemembers with the same earnings and work history may qualify for different amounts of benefits if they file for ucx in different states the equivalent military measurement of wages and time in service are used to determine eligibility and benefit levels7 if the exservicemember was originally in the active duty military he or she must have left military service unde r honorable conditions and eith er completed full term of service or have been released early under qualifying reason if the exservicemember was reservist formerly on active

christine scott and julie m whittaker for an explanation of how funds are transferredleast 90 continuous days ucx benefits are not payable during periods in which the exservicemember is eligible to receive certain allowances or educational assistance allowances from the survivors and dependents educationa l assistance program or the department of veterans affairs vocational rehabilitation and education program participation in the montgomery gi bill does not preclude receipt of ucx benefits however having student status does limit uc benefit eligibility in most states and these limitations would extend to those workers recei ving ucx benefits many states exclude workers while they attend school and some states include vacation periods in that exclusion selfemployed and sole proprietor exservicemembers when an ex servicemember was previously selfemployed or was soleproprietor the worker would have been excluded from receiving uc benefits after active duty if the ex servicemember is unemployed the exser vicemember would qualify for ucx benefits based on military service however most states require that the worker be searching for employment and would not cover worker who was reestablishing selfemployment or small business ucx financing the ucx benefit is funded by the federal government through its federal account in the employment trust fund utf8 each state is reimbursed by the federal government for each unemployed worker whose base period wages included federal military wages civilian spouses who quit employment because of military spouse transfers civilian spouses who quit their employment because their m ilitary s pouse was transferred generally will not qualify for uc benefits most state uc programs do not award uc benefits to workers who quit th eir jobs because spouse was transferred deeming this as voluntary quit the ws of several states colorado maryland massachusetts north carolina and texas include specific disqualification for claimants who quit work to relocate with spouse in several states the disqualification following voluntary quit continues until the claimant returns to work completes specifi ed duration of work and earns wages of specified amount in other states the di squalification is time limited these states penalize the worker for quitting but recogniz that economic conditions may be such that even person who diligently seeks work may find none the reasoning is that beyond certain point if diligent job seeker is still unemployed such continuing unemployment is attributable to labor market conditions rather than their decision to quit thus spouses relocating to areas of high unemploymen t or limited opportunities may become eligible for benefits even if initially disqualified transferred spouse exception

are levied on employers based on combination of established rates and the empl oyers past history of its workers using the uc system generally employers with greater history of unemployed workers would have worse experience rating and would pay higher state unemployment taxes military service of business owners or employees may impact the tax rate that certain employers face furthermore if workers who quit to join their transferred milita ry spouse receive uc benefits this may impact the overall state unemployment tax burden of most if not all of the states employers business owner if called up for active military service may need to layoff some or all of the businesss workers once the business owner returns from military service the revival of the business may mean that the small business may face new higher state unemployment tax rate if the servicemember serves for less than two years some of the workersucx benefit may be ba sed on nonmilitary work these workers receive hybrid ucucx benefit in some states their former civilian employers may face state unemployment tax increase as result workers who quit their jobs and move to accompany their militaryspouse may receive uc benefits in 23 states these st ates do not charge uc benefits to employer accounts when workers voluntarily quit their jobs to accompany transferred military spouse the benefits paid to worker accompanying military spouse generally would not increase the state unemployment taxes of the workers former employer however these benefits are still charged to th states account within the utf as result the cost of the benefits are passed onto the states employers as socialized cost and may increase the overall state unemployment tax rate states may choose to create provisions th at remove or limit these tax increases in certain situations for example in illinois business owners who are called to active duty from the reserve and had to close their firms are not charged for the increases attributable to uc benefits for the workers who lose their jobs on account of the closure when the business owne r returns and reopens his or her business the businesss state unemployment tax rate is not increased in texas if an employee was called to active military service but thenqualifies for uc benefits the employer does not face higher state unemployment tax rate this is even if portion of the ucucx benefit is based on the former employees ear nings at the previous employer maine south dakota virginia and wyoming provide for the non charging of benefits for unemployment directly resulting from reinstatement of another empl oyee upon his or her completion of uniformed service duty
