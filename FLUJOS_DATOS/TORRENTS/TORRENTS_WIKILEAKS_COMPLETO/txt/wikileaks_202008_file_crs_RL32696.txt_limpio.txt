planning equipment acquisition training and exercise needs7 urban area security initiative uasi provides funding to address the planning equipment training and exercise needs in urban areas identified by dhs the program is designed to help the urban areas prevent respond to and recover from terrorist attacks additionally in the fy2005 dhs appropriations pl 108 334 congress authorized that funds from this program be provided to nonprofit organizations located within the identified urban areas8 law enforcement terrorism prevention program letpp assists law enforcement agencies in conducting terrorism prevention activities the activities include information sharing target hardening threat recognition and mapping counterterrorism and security planning interoperable communications and terrorist interdiction9 citizen corps program ccp originally administered by the federal emergency management agency fema provides funding for volunteers participating in community security through personal preparedness training and community service this program supports the states local citizen corps councils which encourage citizens to prevent prepare for and respond to all hazards10 emergency management performance grants empgs originally administered by fema support comprehensive emergency management at the state and local levels the program assists in mitigation preparedness response and recovery from all hazards funds provided from this program may also be used to support state and local activities to manage the consequences of terrorist attacks11 metropolitan medical response system mmrs was originally administered by the department of health and human services hhs but was transferred to fema within the emergency preparedness and response directorate of dhs in march 200312 the program helps the 124 metropolitan medical systems identified by dhs to enhance and sustain their integrated and systematic preparedness actions to respond to mass casualty events the mass casualty events can be the result of incidents ranging from chemical biological radiological nuclear and explosive attacks to epidemic outbreaks natural disasters and largescale hazardous materials events13 7 fiscal year 2005 homeland security grant program program guidelines and application kit p 19 8 ibid 9 ibid 10 ibid p 20 11 ibid 12 pl 107296 sec 5035 homeland security act 13

appropriations pl 108334 congress directed dhs to allocate fy2005 funding for shsgp letpp empg and ccp in the same manner as the fy2004 allocations these allocations were based on the formula of 075 of total appropriations guaranteed to each state and 025 of total appropriations guaranteed to each us territory14 in the absence of statutes or congressional guidance dhs in fy2004 allocated the remaining appropriations in direct proportion to the ratio of the states population to the total national population15 uasi discretionary allocations were distributed using credible threat presence of critical infrastructure vulnerability population population density law enforcement investigative and enforcement activity and the existence of formal mutual aid agreements as funding factors16 mmrs allocations guaranteed all 124 mmrs jurisdictions 227592 in fy2005 for total appropriation of 282 million which is 218 million less than appropriated in fy200417 hsgp application and matching requirements odp required every state and territory to submit its application for hsgp subgrants including the state homeland security grant program law enforcement terrorism prevention program and citizen corps programs by january 16 2005 odp stated it will respond to each completed application later than 15 days after receipt with each application the state must provide program narrative that describes current management capabilities to develop implement and manage the hsgp subgrants this narrative also included such specifics as an overview of the process by which the state determines funding allocations to localities and state efforts to achieve national incident management system nims standards18 there was matching requirement for these subgrants each application delineated the

requirement of 50 federal share and 50 state cost share cash or inkind match american samoa guam the us virgin islands and the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands did not have matching requirement for their empg allocations20 uasi applications and matching requirements the application process for uasi recipients has not changed from fy2004 program guidance this guidance however provided for newly identified uasi urban areas this guidance required newly identified urban areas to provide odp with points of contact definition of the urban area and the establishment of an urban area working group uawg21 there was matching requirement for uasi grants passthrough requirements each state obligated not less than 80 of the state homeland security grant program urban area security initiative law enforcement terrorism prevention program and metropolitan medical response system to localities within 60 days of the grant award date additionally any uasi funds retained by the state had to be used to directly support the identified urban area the state was encouraged to passthrough 100 of mmrs funding to the identified metropolitan medical system any funds retained by the state however had to be documented in written agreement between the state mmrs grant administering agency and the chair of the identified mmrs recipient there was minimum passthrough requirement for ccp states however were expected to work with local citizen corps councils and to expend the funds to support citizen corps council education and training states were required to pass through 100 of empg

sector involvement states were required to coordinate shsgp and uasi citizen awareness and participation activities with the state agencies administering ccp in addition states were encouraged to collaborate with the private sector to leverage private sector homeland security initiatives resources and capabilities dhs considers private sector involvement crucial given most of the nations critical infrastructure is privately owned and operated24 operational overtime costs states and localities were authorized to use up to 25 of their letpp allocation to support operational overtime costs incurred during an hsas highorange threat level that is associated with critical infrastructure security urban areas were authorized to use up to 25 of their uasi allocations to support operational overtime costs for increased critical infrastructure security of this amount only 10 could be used for overtime costs associated with an hsas elevatedyellow or highorange threat level the remaining 15 of uasi allocations could be used only to support overtime costs incurred during an hsas highorange threat level25 critical infrastructure protection dhs directed states and local governments to consider critical infrastructure as any system or asset that if attacked would result in catastrophic loss of life and cause catastrophic economic loss states and localities were required to consider specific facilities as critical infrastructure this included such facilities as venues for large public celebrations and events water systems chemical facilities power generations systems rail and highway bridges mass transit subway systems and telecommunications and cyber facilities26 border security the security of the nations borders has become an important aspect of homeland security since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the importance of border security has resulted in dhs authorizing portion of hsgp funding to be used for securing the us borders states and localities were authorized to use letpp funding to provide enhanced law enforcement operations for increased border security during an hsas highorange threat level uasi funding could be used for enhancing border security during an hsas elevated yellow or highorange threat level increased patrol presence at the border and additional traffic control points were some of the enhanced law enforcement operations authorized by dhs for border security27 unauthorized homeland security activities dhs did not allow states or localities to use hsgp funding for the following activities construction and 23 ibid 24 ibid pp 2324 25 ibid pp 2526 26 ibid p 27 27 ibid p 27 crs7 renovation of building unless for enhancing the security of the facility and hiring of personnel28 the hiring of personnel is an issue that many state and local officials have stated is critical homeland security need former dhs secretary ridge however stated before the senate committee on governmental affairs that it was not the role of the federal government to pay the salaries of state and local employees29 in addition to guidance on applications homeland security strategies citizen and private sector involvement operational overtime costs critical infrastructure protection and border security dhs provided information on homeland security equipment training and exercises in the hsgp program guidance this information however was similar to that provided to states and localities in fy2003 and fy200430 task force on state and local homeland security funding recommendations in march 2004 former dhs secretary tom ridge established the task force on state and local homeland security funding this task force comprised governors mayors local government officials and tribal officials it was tasked to examine the distribution of homeland security funds to states and localities and develop specific and objective recommendations to expedite the process by which dhs allocates homeland security assistance funding the task force focused on three areas delay of funding best practices and recommendations to eliminate delay in funding31 in june 2004 the task force published its report report from the task force on state and local funding which provided recommendations to streamline federal homeland security grant applications and distribution processes32 the following table

office for domestic preparedness issues funding distribution methods on july 22 2004 the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states 911 commission issued the 911 commission report recommending among other things that federal homeland security assistance be distributed to state and local governments based on risk and vulnerability the 911 commission recommended that risk and vulnerability assessments consider population population density vulnerability and the presence of critical infrastructure within each state33 other critics of the fy2005 funding distribution method including some members of congress stated that the funding distribution methods used to provide federal homeland security assistance to states and localities were inadequate and unfair additionally these critics asserted that the present formula did not consider 33 national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission report washington gpo july 22 2004 p 396 crs9 the threat of terrorist attack or vulnerability34 other observers noted this allegedly unfair distribution of funds35 variation in the distribution of funds under the fy2005 state homeland security grant program was seen for example in comparison of wyoming and new york wyomings fy2005 state homeland security grant program allocation of 9 million36 based on wyomings 2002 estimated census population of 498703 the state was allocated 1800 per capita in contrast new york arguably more likely target for terrorist attacks was allocated 494 million from the state homeland security grant program in fy200537 based on new yorks 2002 estimated census population of 19157532 new york was allocated 257 per capita the 911 commission recommendation the 911 commission reported that prior to the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks federal department had as its first priority defending the united states from domestic terrorist attack this changed with the creation of dhs in 200238 according to the report challenge was more difficult for federal government decision makers than to set priorities making hard choices in allocating limited resources39 the 911 commission recommended that state and local homeland security assistance should be allocated strictly on risk and vulnerability assessments in 2004 new york city and washington dc would likely be at or near the top of any threat assessment list the commission indicated that it understands the argument for state and local baseline security it stated unequivocally however that federal homeland security assistance should not remain program for general revenue sharing it suggested that federal assistance should supplement state and local resources based on risks and vulnerabilities that merit additional support40 some would argue that the 911 commission recommendation to distribute federal homeland security assistance funding based on threat and vulnerability is not 34 us congress house of representatives

commission report p 395 40 ibid p 396 crs10 viable at this time critics pointed to the lack of dhss ability to determine accurately the nations threats risks and vulnerabilities an example of this would be the decision by dhs to raise the homeland security advisory system hsas threat level from elevatedyellow to highorange on august 1 2004 this action based in part on terrorist threat intelligence that was reportedly preseptember 11 2001 led to the following comment by senior law enforcement official there is nothing right now that were hearing that is new why did we go to this level i still dont know that41 another example would be attorney general john ashcrofts june 14 2004 announcement that secret cell of qaeda had plotted to attack an undisclosed columbus ohio shopping mall42 some arguing against the proposed risk and vulnerability criteria pointed out that when security increases in one location there was possibility that terrorists search for other softer targets43 additionally in letter to former dhs secretary ridge the democrats on the house select committee on homeland security now the house committee on homeland security expressed concern that inconsistent methodology for extracting data about key critical infrastructure assets around the nation resulted in incomplete and inadequate vulnerability assessments44 those responding to such critics noted that risk and vulnerability assessments based on credible and corroborated intelligence were arguably the logical method of allocating limited homeland security assistance funding the recommendation however was based on the 911 commissions recognition of the reality of limited funding for protecting the nation and that risk and vulnerability assessments based on available intelligence were two main criteria in determining the appropriate level of homeland security it may be argued however that the 911 commissions recommendation did not provide sufficient guidance for distributing homeland security assistance based on risk and vulnerability assessments the recommendation however identified the political issues associated with homeland security funding distribution additionally the recommendation proposed such criteria as population population density vulnerability and the presence of critical infrastructure the 911 commission did not define risk and vulnerability factors nor did it define critical infrastructure in the absence of definitions for these criteria each state could have theoretically argued for significant portion of homeland security funding based on its own definition of risk vulnerability and critical infrastructure if congress legislates the 911 commission recommendation to distribute homeland security assistance funding based on risk and vulnerability assessments 41 dan eggen and dana priest pre911 acts led to alerts the washington post aug 3 2004 p a1 42 john futty heartland logical target the columbus dispatch june 16

critical infrastructure it may need to give guidance to dhs on what risk and vulnerability criteria and critical infrastructure to consider with this guidance congress could through statutory or conference report language direct dhs to weigh some risk and vulnerability criteria and critical infrastructure more heavily than others due to the diversity of the us economy the large and interconnected nature of private and government operated critical infrastructure sectors dhs may not be able to conduct indepth and complete risk and vulnerability assessments in short amount of time dhs would need to establish national vulnerability assessment based on state vulnerability assessments then dhs would need to identify the nations critical infrastructure and establish priorities for its protection intelligence reform bills in the 108th congress two bills passed the house and senate that included provisions to change the current homeland security assistance funding formulas s 2845 the national intelligence reform act of 2004 and hr 10 the 911 recommendations implementation act both bills proposed to include threat and risk criteria in the distribution of portion of the funds neither hr 10 nor s 2845 however proposed to distribute state and local homeland security funding strictly according to threat and risk both bills proposed guaranteed minimum amount to each state45 these provisions were removed from the bill as finally enacted46 authorized expenditures for homeland security assistance funding witnesses before congressional committees have testified that there is need at the state and local level to increase the number of homeland security personnel47 these personnel include firefighters law enforcement personnel emergency managers and emergency medical personnel additionally these witnesses have testified about the cost in overtime during an hsas highorange threat level one could argue that the most important homeland security asset state and locality possess is personnel without an adequate number of first responders and other homeland security personnel all other federal homeland security assistance is arguably marginal at securing states and localities from terrorist attacks presently empg is the only hsgp program that allows states and localities to use grant funding to pay the salaries of emergency managers letpp and uasi authorize portion of state and locality funding to be used for overtime costs during hsas elevatedyellow and highorange threat levels 45 for further information and comparison of these bills see crs

addition to empg providing funding for personnel and the letpp and uasi overtime cost funding there are other options for providing assistance to states and localities with homeland security personnel need funding personnel costs with shsgp grants if congress were to decide that funding state and local personnel costs was an important aspect of homeland security it could direct odp to authorize states and localities to use shsgp funds for personnel costs congress could also appropriate specific percentage within shsgp funding for personnel costs this option however would provide funding that some argue is responsibility of state and local governments dhs secretary ridge in testimony before the senate governmental affairs committee on may 1 2003 stated that it was not the responsibility of the federal government to pay the salaries of state and local employees48 funding overtime costs associated with an hsas highorange threat level should congress determine that dhs does not provide enough assistance to states and localities during an hsas highorange threat level it could direct odp through statutory or conference report language to authorize states and localities to use shsgp funding for overtime costs during this threat level if congress chose not to authorize the use of shsgp funding for overtime costs it could direct odp to increase the percentage of letpp and uasi funding it authorizes states and localities to use for overtime costs some could argue that the federal government specifically dhs determines when there is need to raise the hsas threat level thus the federal government should assist states and localities when they raise their homeland security due to this threat level this option however could be compared to the funding of homeland security personnel issue and the discussion of the federal governments non role in funding personnel at the state and local levels could be argued as valid for overtime costs 48 us congress senate committee on
