bridge enewsletter lrhs congress lectures date the dynamic principle of existence now in dianetics the dynamic principle of existence as agreed upon by all animals and so forth and beings was said to be survive and we know just little bit more than that that was observable and youll find that in book one dianetics the modern science of mental health in scientology weve advanced this just little further and we know the dynamic principle of existence in scientology broadens out to create the dynamic principle of existence is creating the action of creation is the dynamic principle of existence excerpted from the melbourne congress lectures more on the cycle of action an article by l ron hubbard from the melbourne congress lectures but let us examine this cycleofaction as it is examined in fundamentals of thought and well find out something very interesting creation to persist as in survival has to be continuously created so its create that was the beginning and then you get createcreatecreatecreatecreate see continuous creation we get the persistence of something if its continuously created and then one of two things would happen it would either be continuously created or not created at all and youd get absolute destruction but if the continuous creation changed while it was being continuously createdyou created something on it to change its form or alter it or vary it in some wayyou would get the destruction of the original form you get the idea there is such thing as an absolute destruction except ceasing to create and this is one of the most fundamental fundamentals of this universe and these particular discoveries and so forth take nuclear physicists and leave them with terrible headaches because theyre more simple and more fundamental than nuclear physics because it gives you the character of matter and you can go off into complications that have gimmicks and ruddy rods and quantum mechanics and everything else all piled on top of this thing gahwoof what is still being created that everything else is creating an alteration of well that is the fundamental building block of the universe its that thing which is still being created that great many alterisnesses have been created about right now you almost never see pure cycleofaction pure cycleofaction would simply be this fellow creates something then he continues to create this thing so that it looks like its persisting you see and then ceases to create it at which moment it disappears now that would be knowing meaning clearcut cycleofaction that would be in its simplest form and thats the only kind of real destruction there would be youd just cease to create somebody and that would be destruction in an absolute nature now wherewhere do we go astray on destruction and how do things get so mishmashed and why is everybody so puzzled about it all well its just that most destruction is not cessation of creation its an additional creation on top of the object which is being destroyed we have form and we put some dynamite in it and it goes boom and we say well we destroyed that oh did we what are all those fragments lying all over the place so destruction is actually basically an alterisness what people call destruction is an alterisness its never the cessation of anything so if you wonder if somebody gets in trouble if he goes around destroying things well the more he destroys the more he doesnt get rid of because hes got the bits and pieces left forever lying all over the place because he still must be creating whatever he tried to destroy l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture the route through step six this lecture is available in the melbourne congress lectures success from listening to the congress lectures ive been listening to the congresses in order since they came out there is something i noticed that i was aware of in the late 80s when i was doing the lower levels as an auditor at that time i was also listening to the pdc lectures and i was surprised to find that the data on these ot stuff was paralleling what i was learning on the levels in present time the congress lectures always coincide with something i am doing on different dynamics im on an advanced course and i cant tell you how many times datum has been applicable to what i was doing as an auditor the lectures gave more data on the objectives i was running at that exact moment on the 3rd dynamic he spoke of applicable things in the games congress lectures and the washington antiradiation congress lectures auditing is only one side of the bridge you just have to do both so the dynamic principle of existence more on the cycle of action melbourne congress success from the congress lectures special congress package offer melbourne congress history is made in australia landmark congress pivotal responsibility an epic role in the future of earthall part of rons personal address to australian scientologists with auditor training courses standardized clearing technology in broad use and central dissemination center now established at saint hill ron embarked on roundtheworld tour to now ensure the stability of all scientology organizations but that tour was only small stepping stone towards far grander destination hed set his sights upon operating thetan and thats why his first stop was australia as the necessary base in the southern hemisphere far away from the potential fallout of east and west warmongers here then is his message to australian scientologists on responsibility they hold to this day as last safe harbor here too is rons deeply personal story of how he first forged bond with australia when serving as us naval officer through the second world war but while that was of course presentlife history it became fully whole track as ron next made his first public announcement of recent developments on ot and drawing from the whole tangled history of thetans he reveals the mechanism of how deepseated aberration reverses the cycleofaction in beingmoving one from create to destroy moreover ron had found the answer and it was summed up in single word responsibility it was breakthrough that would open the gateway to ot and
