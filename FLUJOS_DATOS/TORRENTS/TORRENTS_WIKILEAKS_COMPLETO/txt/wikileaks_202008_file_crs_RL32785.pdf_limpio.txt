embargo financial times february 15 2005european unions arms control regime and arms exports to china background and legal analysis introduction in recent months discussions have been held within the european union eu on the question of lifting the embargo on ar ms exports to the peoples republic of china that was imposed on china on june 27 1989 following the lead of the united states the european union took this action in the wake of the june 4 1989 crackdown on chinese citizens by the ch inese military in tiananmen square in beijing and the serious infringement of human rights in china that followed the prospect that the eu would lift its embarg on arms exports to china has led to number of ongoing discussions between eu member states and the united states the united states government continues to maintain its own arms embargo against china and the us strongly opposes lifting the eu embargo at this time on human rights and security issues grounds key nations within the european union particularly france and germany strongly support lifting of the embargo and the united kingdom has advised the bush admin istration that it will also support lifting the embargo when the subject is formally addressed by the eu most likely during the early spring of 2005 all 25 members of the eu must agree before the arms embargo can be lifted1 the chinese have been seeking lifting of the arms embargo arguing that it is discriminatory they note that other nations deemed pariahs such as sudan or north korea do not have such an embargo imposed on them the chinese also view lifting of the embargo as an important symbolic political act by the eu as they see the embargo as cold war era relic and thus an impediment to better relations with european union members france germany and other eu members claim the embargo hinders stronger eu political and economic relations w ith china after their december 16 and 17 2004 meeting eu leaders pledged to address lifting

against third countries in general eu embargoes are either adopted to implement security council resolutions acting under chapter vii or are autonomous in the latter case embargoes are legally founded

instances member states convened as body the eu ropean council adopted declarations to impose embargoes7 within such context the embargo on china was imposed in 1989 by the then twelve members of the european community the eus precursor the objective was to introduce arms trade restrictions against the regime in china in reaction to the killing of demonstrators in tiananmen square the introduction of the common foreign and security policy cfsp by the treaty on european union maastricht treat effective in n ovember 1993 altered the procedural basis for eu embargoes decisions to impose an embargo still require unanimity among eu member states but such decisions are now based on common positions rather than declarations8 often implementing regulations are also adopted members are required to conform with the provisions or regulations and common positions both instruments contain detailed description of the type of material covered as well as the terms and conditions of implementation by the member states arms embargoes are also subject to eu standards on arms exports such as the 1998 code of conduct on ar ms exports hereafter the eu code consequently in the implementation of the arms embargo on china eu members are expected not only to abide by the restrictions on arms trade on china but also with the eu requirements on arms exports ultimately what given embargo entails may be viewed differently by different mber states and as political statement by the european union the eu code on arms exports is not legally binding on the eu member states european unions arms embargo on china on june 27 1989 the european council c onvened in madrid agreed to impose an arms embargo on china the entire text of the embargo which is in the form of political declaration is rather brief in the first two paragraphs it condemns the repression in china and reque sts that the chinese aut horities cease executions and respect human rights the fourth paragraph contains the measures agreed by the members states these include the susp ension of military cooperation and highlevel contacts reduction of cultura l scientific and technical cooperation programs and prolongation of visas to chinese stude nts the specific wording of the arms restrictions on china calls for inte rruption by the member states of the community of military coopera tion and an embargo on trade in arms with

imposed later in the cfsp context are more elaborate and specific in their scope and coverage for instance the burmamyanmar embargo which was first adopted in 1991 has been updated and revise d number of times due to the lack of progress in democratization and continuous violation of human rights and appears as common position which is binding it contains inter alia ban on technical assistance related to military activities and the provisi on maintenance and use of weapons and ammuniti on paramilitary equipmen t and spare parts10 the arms embargo against china has not been interpreted uniformly by the eu members since it was imposed this has been attributed to severa l factors including lack of specificity in the political declaration absence of legally binding document such as common position as is the cas with subsequent embargoes imposed on other countries and more importantly the existing loopholes and weak points in the eu arms control system for instance the uk interpreted the embargo in narrow manner as to include the following items lethal weapons such as machine guns largecaliber weapons bombs torpedoe s and missiles specially designed components of the above nd ammunition military aircra ft and helicopters vessels of war armored fighting vehicles and othe r weapons platforms and equipment which might be used for internal repression11 the french have interpreted the embargo similarly12 since 1989 european nongovernmental or ganizations have reported that the embargo on china has been bypassed by veral eu members and has been reduced to mere symbolic instrument13 one arms trade expert with the stockholm international peace research institute sip ri of sweden has stated that many european licenses for the arms trade are actually issued for material which on paper can be used for civilian purposes what is known as dual usage the embargo has actually been circumvented in this way for years14 amnesty international in its 2004 report

provisions member states are urged to put in place legal norms for lawful br okering activities including obtaining written authorization prior to engaging in arms brokering and to keep records for at least 10 years24 european union code of conduct on arms exports background and assessment the european union eu code of conduct on arms exports was adopted on june 8 1998 during the presidency of the united kingdom25 the eu code sets up eight criteria for the export of conventional arms and denial tification procedure obligating eu member states to consu lt on possible undercuttin g arms sales one eu state might make even though another eu st ate has chosen not to make comparable arms export under this procedure member states are required to transmit through diplomatic channels informa tion on licenses refused and reasons for the denial thus before member state authorizes license which has been refused by another member state for the same transaction it is necessary to consult th state that rejected the license in the first place if the member state decides to issue the license it must inform the state that refused to grant authorization26 the eu codes eight criteria which are to be utilized by eu members when reviewing license requests and making deci sions whether or not to make an arms export can be briefly summarized as follows 1 consistency of export with the exporters international commitments arising from eu or osce arms embargoes 2 risk that export would be used for in ternal repression or where the recipient country has engaged in serious violations of human rights 3 risk that export would provoke or prolong armed conflicts 4 risk of recipient using export to undermine regional peace and security 5 effect of export on defense and national security interests of friends and allieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32785crs7 27operative provision 6 of the eu code states that the criteria in the code and the consultation procedure provided for in the code shall apply to dualuse goods as specified in annex 1 of council decision 94942cfsp as amended where there are grounds for believing that the enduser of such goods will be the armed forces or internal security forces or similar entities in the recipient country as with sales of military equipment the decision to grant or not grant license for the sale of dualuse equipment is left to each eu nation to decide on its own6 commitment of purchaser to fight terrorism and uphold international law 7 risk of diversion to third par ties or to terrorist organization 8 risk that export would undermine the stainable developmen t of the recipient country it is important to emphasize that these eight criteria and the eu code on arms exports in its entirety are political st atements by the european union and not legally binding on the member states of the eu alt hough the code is supposed to represent moral imperative that eu member states are expected to uphold and enforce nevertheless matter how strong the language of purpose and intent contained in the codes eight criteria is the 12 operativ provisions of the eu codethe sections of the code which set out the manner in wh ich the code is to be carried outcontain significant loopholes which militate against it being strong regime in its current form for the control of conventional arms exports from eu member states this circumstance is illustrated by the following examples 1 while each eu member state is to review export license applications made to it on casebycase basis against the eight specific criteria in the eu code operative provision 3 of the code expressly states that the decision to transfer or deny the transfer of any item of military equipment will remain at the national discretion of each member state thus each eu member state is free to make an arms sale based on its own termination regarding whether it is appropriate or not27 2 operative provision 10 provides additi onal guidance to member states in application of the eu code it states it is recognized that member states where appropriate may also take into account the effect of proposed exports on their economic social commercial nd industrial interests but that these factors will not affect the application of the above criteria literal reading of that sentence could mean that those who adopted the eu c ode recognized that national economic or commercial interests would weigh importantly in the decisionmaking process regarding any given arms sale and may even trump the larger stated euwide interest in restricting problematic arms exports yet in the same sentence the provision effectively states that while national economic selfinterest may compel member state to sell that state is expected not to do so to remain true to the principles of the eu code 3 major oversight mechanism within the eu code is operative provision 8 which requires that confidential annual report is to be circulated by each eu member state to the other eu states dealing with its defense exports and its own implementation of the code these reports are to be disc ussed at an annual meeting of the member states where the operation of the eu code is reviewed and any improvements to it can be recommended to the eu council subsequently ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32785crs8 28for details of individual eu member state arms data reporting practices see generally

uses an abbreviation scheme whereby number is attached to specific category of military equipment and this numbercategory is given in the license data table to indicate the value of licenses granted for sales of that specific category for example ml10 is aircraft unmanned airborne vehicles aeroengines and aircraft equipment related equipmen t and components specially designed or modified for military use the united kingdom provides detailed breakdown of its licenses in the sixth report since the way its standard export licenses are valued in its licensing system currently preclude this the same is true for italy and the czech republic however france and germany are able to break down the categories of their licenses for purposes of the eu report the data in the report indicate that the largest share of french license approvals for china in 2003 were in categories ml11 electronic military equipment 985 million euros ml10a ircraft and relate d equipment 454 million euros and

most of the arms exports authoriz ed for china by eu members have been made by france the united kingdom and it aly the czech republic austria and germany granted substantially smaller valued licence approvals united states concerns as the european union has moved towards lifting the existing embargo on arms exports to china in recent months significant emphasis has been placed by some eu members on the proposition that the eur opean unions code of conduct on arms exports with additional modifications would be more effective control device than the existing embargo on arms exports to china at

originally led to th embargo the us government however remains skeptical that strengthened eu code would provide an effective deterrent to increased arms sales to china the united states objections to the lifting of the european unions arms embargo on china center on three major concerns first the united states is concerned that china would use eu memb er state weapons or weapons technology to enhance the capability of chinas military by providing them with items they could not obtain elsewhere including from their principal arms supplier russia or from other noneu suppliers such as israel such items could incl ude electronic warfare equipment command and control systems and technology advanced communications equipment radar sonar avi onics and fire control system s advanced airtosea and airtoground missiles might also be obtaine d number of the above items could contain advanced stateo ftheart technology which could be used to upgrade existing chinese air and naval weapons systems should china obtain high technology items such as these from eu sources the united states military operating in asia could face notably increased threat from the chinese military as they conduct their operations in areas close to china and to taiwan capability china has been pursuing in recent years second the united states is concerned that through eu arms exports china could secure sufficient enhancement of its military equipment and capabilities that it could be emboldened to seriously threaten taiwan in its continuing dispute over taiwans political status such an event could increase sinous tensions and increase the prospects of military confrontation between the two countries third the united states believes that china has not seriously addressed the human rights violations against its own people since the 1989 tiananmen square events and therefore the arms embargo should not be lifted until significant steps to improve human rights in china have taken place31 the president and senior bush admin istration officials have made such arguments to the european union membership during secretary of state condoleezza rices european trip in february 2005 secretary rice stated on february 9 that with respect to the arms embargo that human rights concerns need to be taken into consideration in any decision that was tied to tiananmen noting that the status of the

between china and taiwan the president stated that european leaders had informed him that they could develop protocol that could address us concerns he addedwhether they can or not well see the president also said that when the europ eans settled on the new c ode of conduct they would have to sell it to the united states congress33 senator richard lugar chairman of the senate foreign relations committee in press interview noted the implications of not addressi ng congressional concerns on the issue reportedly stating the technology the us shares w ith european allies c ould be in jeopardy if allies were sharing that through these commercial sales with the chinese he further said that if the lifting of the eu arms embargo on china resulted in such diversion he would support restrictions on sales of american arms technologies to europe34 status of european union action based on the directive given to the luxembourg presidency of the eu during the european council meetings on december 16 and 17 2004 the eu expects to review report on the issue of lifting the chinese arms embargo during the first half of 2005 and could address the matter as early as march 2005 at the meeting of the european council scheduled for that month formal eu deci sion is not expected until may or june 2005 since the european council has already stated its political will to continue to work towards lifting the arms embargo the prospects of it doing so when the issue is formally addressed are high35 what is not clear should the eu lift the chinese arms embargo is what will be the nature and scope of the revisedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32785crs12 code of conduct and the new instrument on measures pertaining to arms exports to postembargo countrieswhat is referred to by the eu as the toolbox the details of any such changes to the code of conduct will not be known until the eu announces them internal consultations among eu members on this question are continuing what is reasonably clear is that the issue of lifting the eu embargo on chinese arms has become contentious i ssue in useu relations and could have important implications for future coope ration between the us and eu member states in the military sphere if the us becomes convinced that military technology shared with eu nations c ould end up being transferred to china in postembargo period
