6110c17 shspec67 problems intensives procedure heroic measures have been used on the time track when lighter efforts to get into communication have failed brutality follows failed communication overts are always to be found in the wake of nocommunication the auditor who gets annoyed with the pc has just failed to audit the pc he has just failed to get the pc to communicate he has had methodology or he hasnt applied it if this were widespread scientology would go the way of all former religions towards ritual and brutality the real overt is not bad auditing its bad dissemination ie bad teaching bad comm of how to apply not insisting that it be done right its your inability to get information from pcs which leads to your not trying to get any which drives you into vicious frame of mind about pcs which drives you into not wanting to audit any at all the auditor who has withholds wont ask for withholds if on top of that he cant get information from the pc and doesnt know how to go about it hell end up not auditing thats why any auditor who is not now auditing isnt auditing hes lost his confidence in his ability to obtain the information necessary to resolve the case as long as you have social mores people will violate them and go out of comm with the group the auditorpc relationship is group and if they are out of comm with group they will tend to be out of comm with all groups youve got to raise their group consciousness before you get an auditorpc relationship so by using the white form you get the withholds off from the sections where they are likely to be concealing anything present physical condition 2d stuff crimes past mental treatment etc all societies set themselves up to be ill because as soon as you have bunch of thoushaltnots you will get the two phenomena of withholds and make guilty so you get people out of comm asising of those conditions so civilizations grow ill and die when mores are your sole method of being civilized youll get destruction scientology is the first civilization not to operate this way as long as you can get people to talk so that they can asis instead of repressing it you can truly handle the ills of civilizations up to now repression was the only available method someone could prove that civilization was made possible only by this mechanism of withholding and making guilty but only as long as his premise was that man is basically evil you have to process somebody and find they are nicer people than you thought previously before you can accept the idea that another basis for civilization is possible otherwise youd think that if you freed man hed become more evil if you audit someone and see him becoming more vital active polite and freer you dont get the impression that hes more evil at all where an individual has withdrawn out of earlier groups he becomes harder to process in the group called auditorpc and harder to get along with in the group called scientology failed group member doesnt make good group member this applies to this lifetime former lives have an effect but the force comes from the thislifetime groups that he has left you could do sec check on each of the groups they had left to get them going into session more easily pay particular attention to this with people who are renegades from groups which intended to help doctors psychiatrists etc run out his ows on that earlier group you have to be clever to do it because you have to find out the mores of the earlier group so do get all you can on his former groups at least as to what hes been in and left only take selfdetermined changes for the problems intensive processing they dont give you anything to handle eg graduation but eg dropping out of school you would be interested in what you want is his solutions to problems he didnt know he had other determined changes arent his solutions youll get reads on them because they are charged but they are not what you want details on running the process stable datum if you have to remedy havingness lot ruds are out never run stop avoid stills unless youve got movement in the command the mechanics of the prior confusion will hang you up in the stillness if you can get the pc to restate it so its got action in it great preventing type action is questionable but it will run perhaps slowly but better than stop more details on procedure
