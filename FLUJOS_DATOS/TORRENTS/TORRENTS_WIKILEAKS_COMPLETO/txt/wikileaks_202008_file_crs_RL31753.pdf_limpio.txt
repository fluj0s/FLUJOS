eligibility for the housin g programs administered by hud part of huds failure to issue regulations re garding the impact of prwora on housing programs reportedly stems from an ongoing discussion of

parolees and may be eligible for housing assistance as such 23 the one exception appears to be in the case of the lead hazard control grant programs the comments section of department of justice attorney general final order 66 federal registe r 3615 issued in 2001 notes that hud had determined that benefits under the lead hazard control program were not federal public benefits within the meaning of prworamixed families many households that incl ude us citizen s or qualified aliens also include ineligible aliens eg unauthorized aliens section 214 of the housing and community development ac t of 1980 as amended requires hud and local public housing authorities to provide prorated assistance to families in which at least one member has ligible immigration status prorated housing benefit is calculated by reducing the be nefit due to the family by the proportion of nonqualified aliens in the household21 comparison of prwora and section 214 the aliens eligible for housing assist ance under section 214 are similar to those eligible for federal pub lic benefits under prwora ie those who are not prohibited from eligibility with some exceptions both statutes allow lprs asylees refugees and those on the registry to be eligible for assistance both statutes allow parolees eligibility but prwora states that thealien must be paroled into the us for period of one year while timelimit is specified in 214 both statutes extend eligibility to aliens whose deportation is beingwithheld on the basis of prospective persecution but 214 only references those whose deportati on is withheld on the basis of prospective persecution post 1996 while prwora includes anyone whose deportati on is withheld pre or post1996 only prwora specifically allows eligibility for cubanhaitian entrants22 only prwora allows battered immigrants who can show asubstantial connection between the battery and the need for benefits to be eligible both pwora and section 214 do not make nonimmigrants and uthorized aliens eligible for benefits it is also important to note that while section 214 applies only to those programs covered by section 214 prima rily the direct rental assistance program prwora applies to all progra ms providing federal public bene fits as noted earlier hud has not published guidance as to which of its programs are considered as providing federal public benefits 23httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31753crs7 previous legislation addressing section 214 and prwora differences in the 108th congress senator christopher kit bond offered samdt 224 which was passed by voicevote and adde d to the senate version of hjres 2 fy2003 omnibus appropriations bill but it was not included in the final version of the bill the amendment would have added the category qualified alien to the categories of noncitizens eligible for hous ing benefits under section 214 of the housing and community development act of 1980 bringing section 214 into conformity with prwora the ame ndment would have effectively made cubanhaitian entrants aliens whose deportation was being withheld on the basis of prospective persecution prior to 1996 and certa in battered aliens statutorily eligible for housing benefits due to the complicated nature of th interaction of the housing law and prwora there was confusion over the pur pose of the amendment while some viewed the amendment as t echnical correction others we re concerned that it would have broadened noncitizens eligibility for housing programs and still others were concerned that it might have restricted eligibility while the bond amendment was not include d in the conference agreement the conference report directed the department of housing and urban development to work with the department of justice to develop any necessary technical corrections to applicable housing statutes with respec t to qualified aliens who are victims of domestic violence and cuban and haitian immigrants to ensure that such statutes are consistent with the personal responsibility and work opportunity act of 1996 and the illegal immigration reform and personal responsibility act of 1996 hrept 10810 alien eligibility as applied to specific housing programs section 214covered programs i ncluding public housing and section 8 there are several potentially conflicting interpretations of the interaction of section 214 and prwora and uncertainty regarding hud s interpretation of the noncitizen eligibility rest rictions under one possible interpretation to be eligible for section 214 programs class of nonc itizens cannot be prohibited from receiving benefits under prwora and must be listed as an ligible class under section 214 for example parolees who have been in the united states for less than one year would be ineligible for section 214 prog rams because although they are eligible under section 214 they are prohibited under prwora on the other hand battered immigrants would be ineligible for section 214 programs because although they are not ineligible for benefits under prwora they are not listed as eligible under section 214 interestingly under this inte rpretation the interac tion between section 214 and prwora make the alien eligibility requirements for section 214 housing programs more restrictive than the requi rements for other fede ral public benefitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31753crs8 24

2008 28 for example cubanhaitian entrants are eligible for housing benefits in floridaalthough by itself section 214 is not necessarily mo re restrictive than the provisions in prwora second possible interpretation depends on whether or not prwora makes qualified aliens affirmatively elig ible for benefits prwora states notwithstanding any other provision in the law an alien w ho is not qualified alien is not eligible for any federal pub lic benefits24 it could be asserted that by not prohibiting qualified aliens from fe deral public benef its prwora grants eligibility to qualifie d aliens for federal public benefits since prwora effectively supercedes section 214 given the notwithstanding clause under this interpretation all noncitizens w ho are qualified aliens would be eligible for section 214covered housing programs despite statutory and regula tory arguments this s econd interpretation may in fact reflect what is happening in practice prior to the enactment of prwora hud released regulations based on section 214 that established standard for verifying an applicants immigration status25 to verify eligibility phas and property owners use the systematic alien verification for entitlements save system26 which enables federal state and local governmental agencies to obtain immigration status information to dete rmine eligibility fo r public benefits27 the save system is also used to determin noncitizen eligibility for other benefits including medicaid temporary assistance for needy families tanf and food assistance which use the noncitizen eligibility restrictions outlined in prwora as result it is possible that some housing authorities are using the noncitizen eligibility requirements specified in prwora without regard to section 21428 as noted

earlier prwora does not necessarily affirmatively make qualified aliens eligible for benefits rather it excludes aliens who are not qualified aliens from receiving federal public benefits since hud has not issued regulations regarding alien eligibility for homeless programs one can conclude that si nce qualified aliens are not prohibited from receiving benefits they are effectively eligible for these benefits 30 8 usc 1642dhomeless assistance grants account as well as the housing for persons with aids hopwa program one of the programs funded through the homeless assistance grants is section

rental assistance as result nonqualified liens eg nonimmigrants nd unauthorized aliens as defined by section 214 are ineligible for the sro program however hopwa and the remaining homeless programs sc shp and esg are not covered by section 214 although prwora lists housing assi stance as federal public benefit governed by the statute hud has not issued regulations to clarify whether hud homeless assistance programs are considered federal public benef its and therefore subject to prworas noncitizen eligibility restrictions assuming the homeless assistance programs sc shp esg and hopwa are governed by prwora citizens and qualified aliens are effectively29 eligible for benefits from all homeless assistance programs if they meet need st andards the status of nonqualified aliens is less clear as the assistance provided through some of hud s homeless programs could fit the prwora exception allowing nonqualified aliens access to emergency programs the exception applies if the be nefit provided meets three requirements 1 it is an inkind benefit provi ded through public or private nonprofit organizations 2 the benefit is not conditioned on clients income or resources and 3 the benefit is necessary for th protection of life and safety temporary emergency shelter provided through the esg program could fulfill the requirements of this exception however some transitional and all permanent housing may not meet the second requirement formerly homeless individuals who reside in permanent supportive housing pr ovided through sc or shp pay portion of their income toward rent the same is true for some tran sitional housing provided through shp hud has not published guid ance indicating which if any of its programs are considered to meet the three requirements for exception from prwora as emergency programs another portion of prwora that could be relevant for homeless assistance programs is provision that exempts nonprofit charitable organizations that provide federal public benefits from having to verify the eligibility of program participants30 to the extent that administr ators of huds homeless assistance programs are nonprofit organiza tions which many of them are they are not required under the terms of prwora to verify thei r clients citizenship status thus nonqualified aliens may be receiving services from th organizations regardlesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31753crs10 31 with the exception of the lead hazard control program the comments section of department of justice attorney general final order 66 federal registe r 3615 issued in 2001 notes that hud had determined that benefits under the lead hazard control program were not federal public benefits within the meaning of prwora 32 as noted earlier prwora does not necessarily affirmatively make qualified aliens eligible for benefits rather it excludes aliens who are not qualified aliens from receiving federal public benefits since hud has not issued regulations regarding alien eligibility for other hud needsbased programs one can conclude that since qualified aliens are not prohibited from receiving benefits they are effectively eligible for benefitsof their eligibility status furthermor hud has not published guidance regarding the verification of immigration status for homeless programs that are not governed by section 214 whether or not they are administered by charitable organization making it even more unclear whether or not in practice nonqua lified aliens receive benefits see discussion under documenta tion and verification later in this report mixed families are not separately dealt with in regulations for hud homeless assistance programs and given their ambi guous eligibility status and the lack of verification guidance it is unclear how they are treated other hud needsbased programs the other needsbased housing programs administered by hud are significantly different from the section 214covered programs in th at they primarily provide funding to nonprofits states and units of local governments to provide variety of forms of assistance to lowincome individuals families and communities examples of other hud needsbased housing programs include the section 202 housing for the elderly program the section 811 h ousing for the disabled program the community development block gran t program and the home investment partnerships program the section 202 nd 811 programs are similar to the section 8 projectbased rental assi stance program which is section 214cove red program but they are administered by nonprofits ra ther than phas home and cdbg are block grants administered by units of state and local government who generally award the funds to nonprofit partners home funds housing activities cdbg

these programs may or may not be considered federal public benefits hud has not issued guidance defining which types of assistance under the other needsbased housing programs are federal public be nefits and subject to prworas nonc itizen eligibility restrictions31 further hud has not issued guidance as to how participating entities s hould implement the pr wora restrictions assuming the prwora restrictions apply to these programs and since they are not covered by section 214 it can be interpre ted that citizens and qualified aliens are effectively32 eligible for benefits from all other hud

receiving housing benefits regardless of their eligibility see discussion under documentation and verifica tion later in this report further much of the assistance provided by the other needsbased housing programs is administered through nonprofits which as noted earlier in this report are not required to verify immigration status as result while cer tain nonqualif ied aliens may be ineligible for assistance under th other hud needsbased programs to the extent that assistance is provided by ch aritable organizations their status is not required to be verified so they may be receiving assistance mixed families are not separately dealt with in regulations for other hud needsbased housing programs and given their ambiguous eligibility status and the lack of verification guidance it is unclear how they are treated documentation and verification as discussed above noncitiz eligibility varies among huds needsbased housing programs34 and is governed by both prwora and section 214
