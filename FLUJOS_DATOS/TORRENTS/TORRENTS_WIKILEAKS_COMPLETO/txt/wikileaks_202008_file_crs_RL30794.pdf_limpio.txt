omnibus farm bill the federal agriculture improvement and reform fair act pl 104127 prescribed farm commod ity support policy through 2002 most significantly producers of wheat corn and other feed grains rice and cotton would receive annual fixed payments contract payments starting at 56 billion and declining gradually to 4 billion for total of about 36 billion over the 7year life of the law at the time of enactment market prices for these commodities and most others were high and expected to remain high by the middle of 1998 prices for many commodities began sharp decline and remained at low levels compounding the depressed market conditions were production disasters in some regions caused by droughts floods and diseases congress responded to the deteriorating farm revenue situation with series of emergency economic and disaster relief measures the 105th congress included nearly 57 billion in emergency farm aid in the omnibus fy1999 appropriations law pl 105277 the 106th congress provided more assistance the fy1999 supplemental appropriation pl 10631 included 574 million in farm assistance another supplemental aid package totaling about 87 billion was incorporated into the fy2000 usda appropriations bill pl 106 78 an additional 576 million largely for hurricane floyd farm victims was included in hr 3425 and incorporated into the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 pl 106113 the agriculture risk protection act of 2000 pl 106 224 included about 7 billion in farm relief in addition to crop insurance provisions estimated to cost 72 billion over the coming 5 years finally approximately 35 billion in additional assistan ce for farmers was included in the fy2001 usda appropriations pl 106387 october 28 2000 nationally total direct government payments to farmers are estimated to be about 233 billion in calendar year 2000 42 of farmers 554 billion in net farm income included in the government payments figure is 89 billion in emergency assistance due largely to these government payments the farm economy is in comparatively strong financial condition at the beginning of 2001 however not all producers have received federal farm subsidies indeed critics charge that farm income support policy as implemented by the 1996 farm bill and supplemented by recent emergency assistance has not necessarily reached farms in need while those not in need may receive assistance others point out that farm support is intended to preserve the productive and competitive integrity of the sector not be welfare for individual farms what nearly all policy makers agree upon is the desire to end the pattern of frequent ad hoc relief with more predictable federal farm support numerous policy options were offered but none developed consensus of support during the 106th congress the task of developing future farm support policy now moves to the 107th congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30794contents overview 1 farm economic situation 2 farm relief

economic relief and policy issues in the 106th congress retrospective overview the last omnibus farm bill the federal agriculture improvement and reform fair act of 1996 pl 104127 prescribed farm commodity support policy through 2002 the key farm income support feature was agricultural market transition act amta payments also called contract payments and freedom to farm payments which total about 36 billion over seven years the fixed annual amta payments gradually decline each year as prescribed by law about 55 billion in payments were made in fy1999 51 billion are programmed for fy2000 and 41 billion are scheduled for fy2001 see crs report rs20271 support programs for major crops description and experience low commodity prices coupled with natural disasters in some major growing regions which cut many farmers income prompted the 105th congress to include about 57 billion in additional emergency farm assistance in the omnibus fy1999 appropriations law pl 105277 october 21 1998 over and above the levels authorized under the 1996 farm bill the 106th congress passed another major supplemental package of 87 billion in emergency farm relief in the fy2000 usda appropriations act pl 10678 october 22 1999 additional farm assistance amounting to 576 million was included in the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 pl 106113 november 29 1999 the 576 million were targeted primarily at eastern producers hurt in 1999 by hurricane floyd and by drought economic forecasters expected weak markets and relatively low farm prices for major crops to persist through 2000 that prospect led congress and the president to propose more assistance to the agricultural sector the 2000 election cycle added to the momentum in order to avoid the requirement for an emergency designation the fy2001 congressional budget resolution h res 290 sec 216 agreed to april 13 2000 reserved 714 billion expressly for additional income assistance for farmers of the total 55 billion was set aside for fy2000 instead of providing this money through either the annual usda appropriation or supplemental spending bill house and senate conferees attached it to an authorizing bill the crop insurance reform legislation hr 2559 titled the agriculture risk protection act of 2000 pl 106224 june 22 2000 later approximately 35 billion in additional assistance for farmers was included in the fy2001 usda appropriations act pl 106387 october 28 2000 during calendar 2000 as with 1999 there was little debate over whether or not additional farm income assistance was needed the disagreements revolved around the design of the assistance program who should get it and what should be thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30794crs2 delivery mechanism only few critics argued against additional farm assistance claiming that the problems would selfcorrect throug h reduced production and increased domestic and export sales caused by low prices others maintained that us taxpayers already were making large direct farm payments to farmers that were not financially needy furthermore some argued that higher farm spending would leave fewer dollars for other national priorities such as tax relief debt reduction or spending on social programs the fact that large supplemental payments were adopted 3 years in row is causing critical examination of domestic support policy substantial portion of the farm relief was disaster assistance which is not related to commodity support policy however about 17 billion in supplemental relief was paid to farmers solely in response to low prices this spending led the congressional agriculture committees to focus on policy alternatives long before expiration of the 1996 farm bill farm economic situation overall depressed agricultural export values and low us farm prices helped to hold total farm commodity receipts to forecast 1945 billion in 2000 an improvement from the previous years 1886 billion but substantially below the 1997 record high of 2076 billion usda data show that total livestock receipts rose but that prices and receipts for major crops remained relatively flat us agricultures prosperity is heavily dependent on exports which account for about 20 of the value of us farm production and for an estimated 30 of all harvested crop acreage however export value was down from the record of 60 billion in fy1996 to projected 509 billion in fy2000 and projected 53 billion in fy2001 much of the decline was explained by financial crises in key overseas markets particularly asia which had been the fastest growing market for us farm goods and in russia where us imports declined by about 80 between 1997 and 1998 the high value of the us dollar relative to other exporting countries currencies added to the competitive difficulties usda forecast data show that 2000 net cash farm income was 554 billion 800 million more than in 1999 and close to the 1998 level largely due to record high direct government payments to farmer s see figure 1 also us agricultures overall farm business balance sheet was strong according to usda the value of farm real estate and other farm assets continued to rise while debt stabilized in 1999 and 2000 farm debt measured as percentage of farm assets the socalled debtto asset ratio was forecast by usda to be 159 in 2000 generally regarded by credit experts as highly favorable levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30794crs3 figure 1 gross cash income cash expenses and net cash income according to usda calendar 2000 direct federal farm payments amounting to 233 billion which exceeded the previous record levels of 206 billion in 1999 and 167 billion in 1987 offset income losses due to low commodity prices see figure 2 another measure of taxpayer support to the farm sector was spending by usdas commodity credit corporation ccc which finances price and income support programs and related activities such as conservation export promotion and disaster assistance analysts estimate that ccc net outlays for fy2000 exceeded 323 billion eclipsing the previous record of nearly 26 billion set in fy1986 see figure 3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30794crs4 figure 2 direct government

congressional budget office cbo estimateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30794crs13 trade considerations us trading partners watched closely to assess whether the emergency farm assistance provided over the past two years was compatible with us commitments under the uruguay round ur agreement on agriculture generally that agreement places countries domest ic farm support programs into one of several broad categories based on their relative likelihood to distort trade most major agricultural trading countries are required to discipline limit total spending ie their aggregate measure of support or ams for their most tradedistorting socalled amber box policies countries report to the world trade organization wto on their domestic farm spending for each year although such reports are often submitted 2 to 3 years after the end of the marketing year in question the united states like virtually all other countries has been below its allowable annual levels us amber box programs have included dairy peanut and sugar price supports crop marketing loans loan deficiency payments and other direct crop payments linked to perunit levels of production storage payments and crop insurance and loan interest subsidies among others the least tradedistorting programs in the socalled green box category are exempt from ams reductions these programs include income supports not coupled to current production such as amta payments conservation and environmental activities such as the conservation reserve program crp farm disaster relief payments and domestic food aid the ur agreement provides latitude to us policymakers in developing both the emergency farm measures and proposed changes in longterm farm policy many analysts predict that this latitude will enable the united states to claim that its 1998 1999 and 2000 supplemental farm relief payments are exempt from ams commitments because they were not tied to current production of specified commodity nonetheless some member nations of the wto could argue that the payments were made specifically in response to immediate price and supply conditions and were so large as to affect world trading patterns thereby undermining the objectives of the agreement the question could become point of contention in the ongoing negotiations among wto member nations to further reform agricultural trade although the united states might counter that others notably the eu continue to subsidize their farm sectors at substantially higher levels see crs report rl30612 farm support programs and world trade commitments july 26 2000 other policy proposals supporters of the policy changes made by the 1996 farm law saw benefits to farmers because it released them from the planting and cropland setaside requirements of earlier price support and supply management policies the new laws transition or contract payments to farmers were expected to provide stable and known amount of income support while farmers would make their planting and selling decisions based on market price signals policymakers recognized that commodity prices would continue to fluctuate from year to year as they always have however there also was the expectation that farmers would use some portion of the transition payment received during high price years as cushion to help them during low price periods additional risk protection was maintained by continuation of the marketinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30794crs14 1 this proposal was similar in concept to the supplemental income payment program proposed by representative stenholm in hr 2792 in the 106th congress and described on page 16 of this reportassistance loan programs revision of the crop insurance program and adoption of pilot revenue insurance projects also authorized by the 1996 farm law opposition to the 1996 farm law enacted during period of high farm prices for most commodities came from those concerned that amta contract payments would not increase but would continue to decline when market prices fell although almost all farmers and policymakers recognize that the farm economy will always be subject to periods of low prices caused by excess production or weak demand few predicte d that the recent price declines would be so steep affect so many commodities and last so long while some members accused freedom to farm of not adequately protecting farmer incomes few believed that the 1996 law was the cause of these problems some argued that washington should stay the course and not change the basic marketoriented premise of the 1996 farm bill but they also expressed support for substantial ad hoc farm aid others called for more fundamental policy changes but few sought return to past supply management and government invento ryholding programs the emergency farm relief measures approved in 1998 1999 and 2000 advanced the time frame and increased the size of payments to farmers without changing the framework of support established by the 1996 farm bill that framework benefits farms that had land in the former grain and cotton programs critics argued that amta does not attempt to target assistance to farmers most in need farm bill supporters noted that market loss assistance payments are the most efficient method for quickly channe ling badly needed funds to the farm sector furthermore supporters argued federal farm programs are intended to maintain the productive and competitive capacity of us agriculture not serve as welfare for individually needy farms still some members of congress favored fundamental design changes to current support programs to make assistance counter cyclical to market prices andor targeted to farms in the greatest financial need also among the many questions before policymakers were the budgetary and trade impacts of additional assistance administration views the clinton administration was among those calling for changes in permanent farm policy secretary glickman criticized the 1996 farm law for failing to offer counter cyclical assistance and for not targeting assistance to smaller farmers and those producers most in need however not until the administration sent its fy2001 budget to congress in february 2000 did the secretary make any specific proposals for change the centerp iece of the administrations proposals was new supplemental income assistance program siap that would compensate farmers for current low prices based on actual production not on past production as with amta payments1 siap would make payments to grain cotton and oilseed producers if projected gross income for the crop falls below 92 of the preceding 5year average gross incomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30794crs15 would include gross market revenues plus government payments payments to individual farmers would be based on current production annual siap payments would be capped at 30000 per person furthermore siap payments would be adjusted downward to zero as amta payments reached and exceeded 30000 siap would only make up for the difference that agriculture market transition act amta payments were below 30000 legislation also was requested to extend the dairy price support program to 2002 in addition the secretary stated his intention to use his existing authority to preserve grain cotton and oilseed marketing assistance loan rates in 2000 at their 1999 levels as well as to implement grain storage facility loan program for farmers together these socalled farm income support proposals were estimated to cost 3264 billion in fy2001 and 2695 billion in fy2002 the administrations proposal did not gain much momentum in congress nor did any other proposals for major changes in the 1996 farm law however federal farm policies including the 1996 law and possible alternatives to its basic structure did become the subject of extended debate for example on august 3 4 and 5 1999 senate agriculture committee chairman lugar held three days of comprehensive hearings on the farm income situation secretary glickman was the lead witness at these hearings the house agriculture committee conducted lengthy series of farm policy hearings that began in september 1999 the chairman of the house committee indicated that consensus on how to change farm policy emerged from those hearings crop loan program changes the 1996 farm bill continued marketing assistance loans for major crops which are designed to facilitat marketing by providing shortte rm financing to farmers when market prices fall below the commodity loan rates now capped at 1995 levels repayment may be made at the lower market price instead of the higher loan rate the marketing loan gain is an income subsidy to the farmerborrower farmers eligible for but who forego the loans can receive loan deficiency payments ldps equal to the marketing loan gains see crs report 98744 agricultural marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments several bills introduced in the 106th congress s 30 hr 1299 hr 1468 hr 4979 proposed removing or raising the farm bill cap on loan rates for grains cotton and oilseeds also s 30 hr 1299 and hr 4979 would have permitted the secretary of agriculture to extend the term of loan now nine months for additional periods hr 2704 would have restored the farmerowned reserve for for grain which was suspended by the 1996 farm bill the for effectively functions as 3year extension of the marketing loan during which time farmers might not accrue interest on the loan and also could receive storage payments under certain conditions such loan proposals appealed to those who wanted more of link between commodity prices and government payments than is the case under freedom to farm eliminating the cap on marketing loan rates was proposed but not adopted at the end of the 105th congress largely because of the cost then estimated at about 5 billion its potential for reversing the decoupled design of farm policy and in some views possibly exacerbating the oversupplylow price problem ie longer loan periodshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30794crs16 could lead to the buildup of more surplus stocks further lengthening the duration of depressed prices raising payment limitation the 1996 farm bill imposed per person limit on marketing loanldp gains at 75000 per year this counts against all crops not each one separate limit of 40000 is in place for amta payments low prices below established crop loan rates meant large marketing loanldp gains for farmers many of whom reached this annual payment limit in contrast to limits on payments there is maximum on the quantity of commodities that farmer can place under loan and then forfeit to settle the loan obligation and thereby circumvent the payment limitation however few policy officials wanted to see the ccc acquire forfeited grains cotton or oilseeds the farm relief provisions of pl 10678 doubled the perperson limit on loan gains to 150000 for the 1999 crop year only then in february 2000 the secretary approved the sale of commodity certificates to farmers for use in repaying nonrecourse commodity loans this was done to avoid forfeiture of commodities to ccc the action effectively eliminated the per person payment limitation on loan gains however certificates have their own constraints and administrative requirements that make them unworkable in some situations and burde nsome in others legislation such as hr 4895 and s 3049 was introduced in the 106th congress to continue the higher cap and the fy2001 usda appropriations act pl 106387 sec 837 again doubled it to 150000 but only for the 2000 crop year those who wanted to retain lower payment limitations noted that the combination of marketing loan and amta payment limits already effectively double the threeentity rule which allows for the full limit on the first farm plus half on each of two additional farming operations this they argued is already generous government subsidy particularly when it is available regardless of farmers financial situation supplem ental income payment program representative stenholm introd uced on august 5 1999 bill hr 2792 to establish new system of supplemental income payments for produce rs of crops eligible for marketing assistance loans wheat feed grains cotton rice and oilseeds the payments would be made whenever the current years national gross revenue for crop falls below 95 of its previous 5year average peracre payment rate would be calculated based on the difference between 95 of that 5year average and the current years revenue per acre this calculation would be used to set perunit payment for each producers harvested production in addition the bill attempted to ensure that farms with weatherreduced yields would receive the same level of assistance as other participants representative stenholm unsuccessfully offered version of his bill as an amendment to the crop insurance legislation hr 2259 marked up prior to the august 1999 recess by the house agriculture committee this proposal served as the conceptual framework for the secretarys siap proposal farm income and trade equity act senator conrad on july 26 1999 introduced the farm income and trade equity act s 1436 aimed at altering the basic longterm provisions of the 1996 farm bill this bill would have permitted farmers to forgo their amta contract payments in exchange for new twotiered system of subsidies the first tier would have provided marketing loans for grainshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30794crs17 cotton and soybeans set at 100 of past market prices second tier of transitional international marketing equity time payments would have been based on the usdacalculated difference between the new loan rate and the level of support received by europea n union eu producers for the same crops the payments would have been designed as direct challenge to eu domestic farm subsidies which are much higher than those in the united states the senator in 1999 tentatively estimated the annual cost of the plan at 7 billion more than the scheduled amta payments risk management crop insurance is one way farmers can manage their financial risk other examples include participating in the federal farm income and price support programs utilizing the privat futures market to cushion themselves against future price declines and entering into production or marketing contracts with food processors or other buyers of their commodities early in the crop insurance debate in the 106th congress senate agriculture chairman lugar promoted bill s 1666 that would have made direct payment to any producer who adopted at least two of variety of risk management strategies however the committee did not act on s 1666 and instead to focused on crop insurance program improvements proposed in hr 2559 and approved the agriculture risk protection act of 2000 pl 106 224 tax and regulatory proposals the comprehensive tax relief bill hr 2488 adopted by congress on august 5 2000 but vetoed by the president on september 23 contained several provisions of interes t to farmers farm fishing and ranch risk management accounts ffarrm introduced in the 106th congress as s 642 grassley and hr 957 hulshof would have modified federal tax law by permitting farmers to set aside money in higher income years without having to pay taxes on it until the money is withdrawn presumably in years when taxable income is lower also in the tax bill was the acceleration to 2000 of full deductibility of health insurance premiums for the selfemployed now set to take effect by 2003 farm organizations supported hr 8 measure to end estate taxes that they contend make it difficult for farmers to pass their businesses to their children on july 19 2000 chairman lugar introduced s 2894 wideranging bill to provide tax and regulatory relief to farmers none of these proposals was enacted during the 106th congress producer interests such as the american farm bureau federation also believed that longterm impro vements in farm income could be achieved if the federal government relaxed variety of regulatory requirements affecting producers costs overly stringent application of the federal pesticide endangered species and water quality laws were often cited supporters of these laws argued that changes proposed by agricultural groups would jeopardize the health of consumers natural resources and the environment competition policy agricultural businesses like other sectors of the economy have long been subject to organizational changes including consolidation of processing and production into fewer and larger operations more vertical control of the various stages of production processing and marketing and the shift from open cash markets to closed systems involving contractual arrangements between buyers and sellers many economists and many within the industry itself believe that such changes create more efficient resource allocation make us agricultural exportshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30794crs18 more competitive on world markets and benefit consumers by providing wider variety of lowerpriced and higherquality foods however many produ cers believe that such changes stifle competition cause lower farm prices and farm incomes and force families out of agriculture concern about structural change and its potential to adversely affect many farmers intensifies during periods of low farm prices many farm groups called on government to strengthen enforcement of existing antitrust and competitiveness authorities andor adopt new laws where necessary both the house and senate agriculture committees held number of hearings in the 106th congress on concentration and competition problems and policies and several bills were introduced for example s 2252 and s 2411 both would have provided usda with expanded authority to address business mergers in agriculture s 2252 along with hr 2829 would have extended to poultry the same types of oversight usdas grain inspection packers and stocky ards administration gipsa now has over livestock markets hr 3159 would have imposed an 18month moratorium on large agricultural mergers and acquisitions s 1738 and hr 3324 would have banned the ownership of slaughter animals by meat packers s 3091 would have implemented general accounti ng office recommendations aimed at improving gipsas ability to address livestock market competition issues s 3243 would have addressed agricultural contracts strengthened bargaining associations and brought poultry under usdas enforcement authority see crs report rs20562 merger and antitrust issues in agriculture conclusions an unan ticipated and sharp drop in agricultural export demand followed the financial crises of 1997 and 1998 in much of asia and russia reduced demand combined with large commodity inventories and continued high levels of production in exporting countries pushed prices down from near record highs to near record lows that did not recover little more than two years into sevenyear policy of marketoriented farm programs congress responded to the dramatic drop in prices by adopting series of ad hoc emergency farm income support laws since the agricultural market transition act of 1996 was enacted about 17 billion in supplemental income support payments were authorized almost all of them in the 106th congress the legislation also provided about 3 billion in disaster assistance to offset losses from floods droughts and diseases and an estimated 8 billion in crop insurance subsidies the emergency assistance was accompanied by substantial criticism of the policy and tools contained in amta however changes in policy were postponed amta expires with crop year 2002and so some of the policy proposals offered in the 106th congress as well as new ideas will be introduced in the 107th congress
