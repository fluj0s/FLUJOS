regime in spring 2003 iraqs external debt was estimated to be around 130 billion reducing this debt to sustainable level has been priority of the us government since 2003 debt relief negotiations have taken place in variety of fora and led to the cancellation of significant amount of iraqs external debt iraqs external debt comprised four components paris club bilateral debt 425 billion non paris club bilateral debt 674 billion commercial debt 20 billion and multilateral debt 05 billion debt relief negotiations first led to an 80 reduction of the paris club debt the paris club agreement also set the terms for nonparis club and commercial debt cancellation levels provision of the paris club agreement is that iraq cannot accept debt cancellation agreement with other creditors on more favorable terms for iraq than those reached with the paris club thus iraq is expected to receive more than an 80 cancellation from all of its creditors negotiations with nonparis club creditors are ongoi ng and resolution of the commercial debt is largely complete the negotiations and process of providing debt relief to iraq may shed some light on the approaches bilateral and corporate creditors take toward providing international debt relief to middleincome countries who would not be eligible for the debt relief already provided to the poorest countries in light of iraqs experience three new precedents appear to have taken shape 1 willingness by the international community to grant stay on the enforcement of creditor rights to collect unpaid sovereign debt 2 an increased flexibility in paris club debt relief decisions and 3 an unwillingness by successor regimes to claim that their debt is odious and repudiate it this report will be updated as events warrant

and congress debt relief is important to us interests for several reasons including releasing funds to help support iraqs budget pay for iraqs security and reestablish iraqs financial standing with international creditors and the financial markets iraqs saddamera debt is estimated at 130 billion and has been the focus of numerous negotiations over the past three years among bilateral multilateral and commercial creditors these negotiations led to an 80 reduction of paris club and commercial debt 1 negotiations with nonparis club bilateral creditors including saudi arabia and other persian gulf countries are ongoing the united states forgave its saddamera debt worth 41 billion in november 2004 this report proceeds in three parts the first provides snapshot of the iraq debt situation following the ouster of the saddam regime the second discusses subsequent debt relief negotiations and their resolution the third presents three possible implications for future debt relief cases that arise from iraqs experience they are 1 willingness by the international community to grant stay on the enforcement of cr editor rights 2 an increased flexibility in paris club debt relief decisions and 3 an unwillingness by successor regimes to claim that their debt is odious and repudiate it g11g155g138g154g514g156g561g7g161g157g142g155g151g138g149g561g6g142g139g157g561 the precise dimensions of iraqs foreign debt obligations are unknown this is due to disagreements on what iraq actually owes and how interest on this debt should be calculated or if it should be counted at all 2 iraqs external debt following the end of the saddam regime was approximately 130 billion this debt comprised four components official paris club bilateral creditors 425 billion official nonparis club bilateral creditors 674 billion commercial creditors 20 billion and multilateral creditors 3 05 billion the first three major components are discussed below

external debt to paris club countries was 3715 billion including interest 4 later 1 the paris club is the forum where major creditor countries negotiate terms for restructuring or resolving official governmenttogovernment debt it includes the united states and 18 other permanent members austria australia belgium canada denmark finland france germany ireland italy japan netherlands norway russia spain sweden switzerland and the united kingdom other creditors are allowed to participate in negotiations on an adhoc basis 2 creditor countries use different interest rates and levy different penalties for iraqs payment arrears hence the debt owed to each creditor can grow at different rates in addition iraq could claim that it should not be expected to pay debt or interest accrued after the united nations security c ouncil imposed sanctions in 1990 that made it illegal for financial institutions to process iraqs financial transactions 3 iraqs debts to the world bank and the imf were cleared in 2004 largely by contributions from paris club donor countries 4 iraq paris club debt treatment november 14 2004 available at httpwwwclubdeparisorgencountries

saddam hussein the international community began the process of helping iraq rebuild its economy9 an integral component of economic reconstruction following any conflict is resolving old debts and regaining access to the international financial community iraq however was unique case unlike many of the worlds poorest countries iraq is considered middleincome country because of its substantial petroleum reserves iraq would likely be able to service its existing debts once its petroleum industry was functioning many analysts thus argued that iraq appeared to be good candidate for socalled debt flow treatment involving rescheduling its official debts until it had the capacity to repay instead of cancelling them completely as is done for the poorest countries which lack any natural resources that can be used to generate revenue others asserted that if iraqs future oil revenues were used to fund repayment of old debts not enough would remain to fund its current and future economic needs 8 ibid 9 see crs report rl31944 iraqs economy past present future by jonathan sanford httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33376g11g155g138g154g514g156g561g6g142g139g157g561g20

hussein regime led by the bush administration consensus was reached that iraq would receive debt relief on terms that were unique in light of its economic resources but not unprecedented given the political situation debt relief has been provided to various countries for political and economic reasons the united states for example has provided special bilateral debt relief to egypt pakistan jordan and poland among many other countries g18g138g155g146g156g561g5g149g158g139g561g6g142g139g157g561g20g142g149g146g142g143g561 the paris club is an informal arrangement among creditor countries to abide by fixed set of rules and principles for debt relief that have been agreed on by its members paris club members meet periodically to reschedule and in some cases collectively cancel the debts owed to them by other countries the us share of any paris club debt relief must be appropriated by congress since the paris club was the most organized of all of iraqs creditors and included the major industrialized countries it was able to start the debt relief negotiations and establish the precedents that other bilateral and commercial creditors would need to follow in september 2003 the g7 finance ministers called on the paris club to make its best effort to complete the restructuring of iraqs debt before the end of 2004 10 president bush appointed former us secretary of state james baker iii as his personal envoy on the issue of iraqs debt in december 2003 secretary baker traveled to eur ope asia and the middle east for discussions with foreign government officials in countries open to providing some debt relief to iraq the baker appointment and the ensuing supportive response from other paris club countries showed that the major creditor countries were interested in cancelling iraqs external debt even though iraq had the natural resources to eventually service its debts by itself prior to the iraq case paris club debt cancellation rather than debt rescheduling was only available for the poorest countries paris club members began offering debt cancellation in addition to debt rescheduling in 1988 at the 1988 toronto meeting of g7 finance ministers paris club members agreed to extend to poor countries up to onethird forgiveness of their bilateral debts 11 over the next decade the paris club gradually increased the amount of debt that it would be willing to

in the iraq case implementing stay on the enforcement of creditor rights to use litigation to collect unpaid sovereign debt was major priority and was implemented by security council resolution 1483 shortly after the collapse of the saddam regime implementation of this stay occurred with very little debate over whether such comprehensive debt shield should be used in fact debate over the general advisability of debt shield mechanisms for countries facing economic crisis did occur between 2001 and 2003 at the imf at the time there was concern that several south american countries including argentina and brazil would default on their international debts during this debate the us administration led the opposition to comprehensive debt shield mechanism and the propos was eventually withdrawn it appears that after iraq however such debt shield mechanism is feasible if it is introduced in political forum such as the united nations rather than an economicfinancial one like the imf and that it is an adhoc process not attached to any formal mechanism for debt resolution 24 sovereign bonds government issued debt are th primary form of developing country debt these bonds are held by many types of investors both large and small the common issuance of sovereign debt represents major shift in in how developing countries structure their debt when countries ran into economic

countries and arrange terms to restructure the debt there is now much wider spectrum of investors in sovereign bonds creating much costlier and more difficult resolutions however outside of the paris club there is formal mechanism to coordinate debt restructuring negotiations between creditors and the debtor government to address these concerns in 2001 the imf proposed creating the sovereign debt restructuring mechanism sdrm to help negotiate debt restructurings in general among other things the imfs proposal was designed to afford rights to defaulting countries similar to those afforded bankrupt companies in the united states under chapter 11 of us bankruptcy codes standstill on debt payments was to go into effect while countries renegotiated their debt contracts with their creditors through dispute resolution mechanism administered by the imf the debt standstill was considered one of the most important components of the proposed sdrm 25 it also proved to be the one of the most highly c ontested issues concerning the sdrm proposal26 the sdrm proposal was rejected by the bush administration the private sector and many members of congress the bush administration advocated more decentralized marketoriented approach that would include clauses in sovereign bond contracts known as collective action clauses cacs which would stipulate how the fi nancial contracts would be resolved pending financial crisis or default majority of commercial creditors also discouraged the establishment of the sdrm for example the institute for international finance iif global association of financial institutions was concerned that an international bankruptcy court could inhibit investor confidence delay renewed access of debtor countries to capital markets that use the sdrm and possibly lead to increased global financial instability through contagion effects in other emerging markets27 according to the iif the sdrm also might encourage moral hazard by encouraging other sovereign borrowers not to pay debts in order to receive standstill protection the essential concern with the sdrm was whether the united states and the international community should condone an official stay on creditor rights through litigation shield such as the sdrm after two years of debate the proposal was eventually bypassed at the spring 2003 imf meetings when the united states government threw its support behind including cacs in new bond contracts instead of creating new imf function however only few months after these meetings the united nations security council iraq resolutions were passed providing essentially the exact protections to iraq that were rejected at the imf financial analysts note that immunizing iraqs debts from foreign claims through security council resolution is radical move in th history of sovereign debt negotiations in the past the us government has taken rather handsoff stance that let the financial markets resolve debt disputes this approach known as the restrictive approach to state immunity and codified through the foreign sovereign immunities act of 1976 pl 94583 established that foreign states are not immune from jurisdiction

allowed creditors to sue foreign governments regarding debt claims and remained uninvolved in matters between us creditors and foreign governments29 the iraq case thus illustrates that the united stat and the international community are willing to shield debtor from its creditors on an adhoc basis casebycase without formal international bankruptcy regime this can be accomplished multilaterally through security council resolutions or bilaterally through executive orders since these measures were not taken in other recent financial crisisafflicted countries such as argentina or brazil it appears that policymakers are only willing to use such measures selectively and for countries that exhibit perceived or potential threat to us and international security this understanding is made more explicit by implementing the stay on debt repayment through the united nations political institution seen principally as focused on international security rather than the international monetary fund which is primarily financial institution g8g149g142g161g146g139g146g149g146g157g162g561g152g143g561g18g138g155g146g156g561g5g149g158g139g561g3g144g155g142g142g150g142g151g157g156g561 in addition to providing precedent for comprehensive debt shield the iraq case helped institutionalize increasing flexibility in paris club debt restructuring treatments prior to iraq paris club members adhered to relatively strict set of rules to determine both which countries would be eligible for debt relief and the level of that debt relief based on their economic situation however whenever new situation ar ose where paris club members wanted to provide debt relief but existing rules would not support it new rules were created offering deeper and deeper debt reduction thus the toronto terms introduced in 1988 begat houston terms in 1990 london terms in 1991 naples terms in 1994 lyon terms in 1996 and finally cologne terms in 1999 each offering increased debt relief cologne terms part of the heavily indebted poor country program allow for up to 100 debt cancellation for select group of countries that the imf and world bank deem to be the most heavily indebted the prevalence of debt reduction in paris club operations has led to what some have called the slippery slope towards hipcization as increasing amounts of debt cancellation have been requested for countries on geopolitical rather than economic grounds 30 pakistan for example is not hipc country yet it is considered to be an integral partner in us antiterror efforts when debt relief was sought for pakistan in 2001 the paris club negotiated special ad hoc arrangement on nearcologne terms even though pakistan did not economically qualify to receive such treatment instead of continuing to treat special cases like pakistan under adhoc terms the paris club formalized new system of more flexible debt relief arrangements with iraq under the new evian approach as discussed earlier in the report following evian potential

the terms agreed to at cologne all other countries will be treated on casebycase basis with any debt relief determined by imf debt sustainability analysis with an option for threepart phased debt relief such as iraq is receiving the introduction of evian terms was crucial for iraqs debt relief plan without evian in place commented euromoney its hard to imagine the paris club members would have signed off on deal as nakedly political as iraqs31 some argue that the evian approach is unfair and opens the door even wider to political debt relief using resources that could potentially go to increased debt relief or foreign assistance to poor and developing countries for example indonesia kenya and georgia recently emerged from decades of authoritarian rule and are saddled with extensive government debt yet they received nowhere near the level of international exposure that has been given to iraq 32 its an outrageous double standard according to salih booker the head of africa action washingtonbased lobbying group33 it appears that the new flexibility evidenced by the introduction of the evian approach is continuing following evian paris club members introduced even greater flexibility in 2005 by allowing countries to buy back their debt po licy that had previously not been allowed in 2004 russia using proceeds generated by record high petroleum prices approached the paris club and requested to buyback some of its debt germany refused to participate scuttling paris club deal deal was eventually agreed on in may 2005 that allowed russia to repay 15 billion in debts at par 34 according to this agreement russias debts were paid ahead of schedule without requiring prepayment penalty following the russia agreement additional buyback deals were reached with nigeria and peru in october 2005 deal was reached where nigeria wa s allowed to buy back some of its debt at discount leading to debt relief worth 18 billion and total reduction of nigerias paris club debt from 36 billion to 6 billion the peru buyback like russias was at par and will lead to peru prepaying 17 billion of its paris club debt as some analysts have illustrated introducing flexibility into paris club arrangements was well underway prior to its handling of the iraq case35 however it appears that the precedent set by iraq may open the door to increased debt relief for middleincome countries combined with the new willingness to engage in debtbuybacks resolving international debt may be easier in the coming years

knows both of these facts at the time of lending36 however the concept of odious debt does not appear to be well established in international law and has never been cited by either national or international tribunal as reason to repudiate debt claim37 repudiating iraqs debts under the concept of odious debts was raised by some members of congress in 2003 in hr 2482 the iraq freedom from debt act introduced by representative carolyn maloney the bill which was not enacted called on the imf and the world bank to cancel iraqs odious debt and called on congress and the president to urge fellow iraqi creditors to cancel their owed debt as well iraqi officials have steadfastly claimed that they would not seek repudiation under the odious debt concept in an interview with euromoney in september 2004 iraqs minister of finance adil abdul mahdi said iraqs need for very substantial debt relief derives from the economic realities facing post conflict country that has endured decades of financial corruption and mismanagement under the saddam regime principles of public international law such as the odious debt doctrine whatever their legal vitality are not the reason why iraq is seeking this relief38 iraq preferred to seek reduction of its debts through normal and official channels the paris clubs iraq agreement reached three months after the ministers euromoney interview provided an 80 total reduction and set the parameters for the ongoing debt reduction efforts with nonparis club and commercial creditors this allowed iraq to receive its debt relief without the potential destruction of creditor relationships than can come about with debt default in retrospect it appears that an odious debt approach may have been difficult for iraq since many of iraqs debts were taken for economic development or commercial purposes and appear legitimate 39 none of the debt in question was borrowed during the period when iraq was under sanctions when large amounts of iraqs oil revenue were diverted for the construction of saddam husseins palaces and other indulgences it is also not evident that at least to degree greater than in other countries the proceeds of the development loans were diverted for personal use or to fund oppression within iraq iraqs refusal to use an odious debt approach begs the question under what circumstances could the odious debt principle be applied in its current form the odious debt doctrine according to one analyst offers meaningful guidance to shape decisions on lending to emerging markets40 one proposal is for the imf or some other international body to assess regimes legitimacy and make an odiousness determination thus allowing any future government to declare any sovereign debt incurred by the previous illegitimate regime odious and repudiate it41 such sanctions regime may act as an incentive to creditors both private and public not to 36 todd moss scott standley and nancy birdsall double standards debt

could legitimately repudiate the former regimes debts us foreign assistance to the new regime could also be made contingent on repudiation of odious debts on the other hand the united states or other nations may not necessarily agree with the odiousness determination for various political reasons it also may be difficult to make such determination while problem regime is in place especially if other forms of political and economic statecraft are being employed however given that the odious debt concept appears unusable in its current format refashioning the odious debt concept as sanctions regime represents one possible way to reduce the flow of financial resources to undesirable governments such system would create additional incentives for creditor governments and the commercial sector to avoid lending to these regimes by creating the legal precedents necessary for successor regime to repudiate socalled odious debt
