respondent khan and his corporation entered into an agreement with pe titioner state oil to lease and operate gas station owned by state oil respondents agreed to obtain the stations gasoline supply from state oil at price equal to suggested retail price set by state oil less margin of 325 cents per gallon respondents could charge any amount for the gasoline sold to its customers but if it charged price higher than state oils suggested retail price the amount ove r 325 cents per gallon had to be rebated to state oil if respondents sold gasoline for ss than the suggested retail price the decrease would reduce its profit margin respondents later fell behind in lease payments and state oil gave notice of its intent to terminate the agreem ent the state court appointed receiver to operate the gas station and the receiver was not subject to the price restraints the receiver had an overall profit margin more than 325 cents per gallon by lowering the price of regular grade gasoline and raising the price of premium gasoline respondents sued state oil in the united states district c ourt for the northern district of illinois and alleged that state il had engaged in price

prices respondents claimed that by charging differe nt prices on grades of gasoline as the receiver did it could have increased sales and profits the district court found that the allegations did not state per violation of the sherman act because they did not have th manifestly anticompetitive implications or pernicious effect on competition that is require d to justify finding per violation the district court also conclude d that respondents did not demonstrate antitrust injury or harm to competition the district court entered summary judgment for state oil the court of appeals for th seventh circuit reversed2 the seventh circuit after reviewing the legal and economic aspects of price fixing concluded that state oils pricing scheme was per antitrust violation under an earlier supreme court decision albrecht v herald co3 in which the supreme court held that the action of newspaper publisher in fixing ceiling at which its distributors could resell the newspaper to the public was illegal per yet the seventh circuit expressed dissatisfaction with the albrecht ruling we have considerable sympathy with the argument that albrecht is inconsistent with the cases that establish the requirement of proving antitrust injury in fact we think the argument is right and that it may well portend the doom of albrecht in jack walters sons corp v morton building inc 737 f2d 698 70607 7th cir 1984 we said we rega rded the continued validity of albrecht as an open question albeit for different reason that after albrecht the supreme court had reversing its previous position recognized that exclusive dealer territories may be procompetitive continental tv inc v gte sylvania inc 433 us 36 97 sct 2549 53 led2d 568 1977 as we pointed out earlier in this opinion and as one of the dissenting opinions in albrecht had pointed out as well 390 us at 169 88 sct at 88182 price ceiling is natural and procompetitive incident to scheme of territorial exclusivity the majority opinion in albrecht had rejected this argument on the ground that price fixing cannot be jus tified because it blunts the pernicious consequences of another distribution practice 390 usat 154 88 sct at 874 namely exclusive territories we now know that the consequences of that other practice are not not generally at any ra pernicious so another prop beneath albrecht has been knocked away although state oil does not make the argument from sylvania maybe because it does not grant its dealers exclusive territories the record is silent on the matter4 the supreme court granted certiorari to consider whether state oils conduct constituted per violation of the sher man act and whether re spondents are entitled to damages based on st ate oils conducthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98218crs3 5state oil co v khan 118 sct 275 1997 6118 sct at 283the court held that state ils conduct did not constitute per violation of the sherman act thereby overruling albrecht and remanded to the court of appeals the question of whether respondents are entitled to recover damage s in light of the overruling of albrecht 5 not only are the potential injuries cited in albrecht less serious than the court imagined the per rule established therein could in fact exacerbate problems related to the unrestrained ex ercise of market power by monopolist dealers indeed both courts and antitrust scholars have noted that albrecht s rule may actually harm consum ers and manufacturers see eg caribe bmw inc v bayerische motoren werke aktiengesellschaft 19 f3d 745 753 ca 1 1994 breyer cj areeda supra par 1636a at 395 g mathewson r winter competition policy and verti cal exchange 1314 1985 other commentators have also explained that albrecht s per rule has even more potential for deleterious effect on competition after our decision in gte sylvania because now that vertical nonpri ce restrictions are not unlawful per the likelihood of dealer monopoly power is increased after reconsidering albrecht s rationale and the substantial criticism the decision has received however we concl ude that there is insufficient economic justification for per invalidation of vertical maximum price fixing that is so not only because it is difficult to accept the assumptions underlying albrecht but also because albrecht has little or relevance to ongoing enforcement of the sherman act6 the court went on to state that in overruling albrecht it was not holding that all vertical maximum price fixing is per lawful instead the court stated like most commercial arrangements subject to the antitrust laws vertical maximum price fixing should be evaluated under the rule of reason as for whether respondents are entitled to damages based on stat oils conduct the court held that with its overruling of albrecht this issue should be reviewed by the court of appeals in the first instance
