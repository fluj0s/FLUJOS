documents stored digitally since the nsa revelations began in june us president barack obama and other top american officials have all claimed that the surveillance activities were aimed exclusively at preventing terrorist attacks but the targeted spying of indian diplomatic buildings could have been done for political and commercial reasons not the core responsibility of the nsa according to the 2010 comint communication intelligence document about close access sigads the offices of indian diplomats and highranking military officials stationed at these important posts were targets of four differentkinds of electronic snooping devices lifesaver which facilitates imaging of the hard drive of computershighlands which makes digital collection from implants vagrant which collects data of open computer screens and magnetic which is collection of digital signalsall the indian targets in the list are marked with an asterisk which according to the document means that they have either been

hindu why indias mission and embassy which clearly pose terrorism threat to the us were targeted by the nsa spokesman for the office of the director of national intelligence said the us government will respond through diplomatic channels to our partners and allies while we are not going to comment publicly onevery specific alleged intelligence activity as matter of policy we have made clear that the united states gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations we value our cooperation with all countries on issues of mutual concern but the spokesman didnt answer the hindus specific questions about why the topsecret document about spying on indian missions shouldnt be revealed or reproduced by this newspaper in full or part the document obtained by the hindu reveals scary scenario of breach of official secrecy of indian missions and violation of privacy of indian diplomats and other staff working in the three premises that were targeted located between 2nd and 3rd avenue on 43rd street in the eastern part of manhattan the office of indias permanent representative to the was on top of the list of indian targets designed by the legendary indian architect charles correa the building with red granite base and doubleheight penthouse porch at the top has the offices of indiaspermanent representative deputy permanent representative minister and political coordinator six counsellors colonelrank military advisor and several other secretaries who look after different areas of indias engagement with the world it was this building that was the main target of all four nsa bugs from lifesaver which can send to the nsa copies of everything saved on the hard drives of office computers to vagrant which can pick data straight from computer screens though emails sent to indias new york mission have remained unanswered so far an indian diplomat told the hindu that the nsa eavesdropping might have done extensive damage to indias stand on many international issues ranging from security council reforms to peacekeeping operations if they could implant bugs insidecommunications equipment of european union office here and tap into their communications cables as well there is reason to believe that they didnt snoop on us said the diplomat speaking strictly on condition of anonymity we are still assessing the damage if they managed to copy our hard drives nothing is left to imagination second to the mission on the target list was the chancery building of the indian embassy located at 2107 massachusetts avenue in washington dc consisting of two adjacent buildings one constructed in 1885 and the other in 1901 the chancery has offices of the indian ambassador the deputy chief of mission several ministers and counsellors who head political economic defence and industry sections and three defence attach√©s representing the indian army air force and navy this building from where india maintains its diplomatic trade and strategic tieswith the us was on the target list for three bugs that can make images of hard drives pick digital signals and copy data of computer screens the third indian building targeted by the nsa is the embassy annex located on 2536 massachusetts avenue in washington dc the annex has three very important departments the consular section headed by minister looks after visa services the commerce department also headed by minister is involved in broad range of trade issues and negotiations besides assisting the indian businesses and an office of the indian space research organization isro represented by counsellor takes care of cooperation between two countries in the field of space this building was on the nsa target list for highlands and vagrant which collect data from implants andcomputer screens respectively its important to recall here that indias space programme was targeted by another nsa tool prism which intercepts and collects actual content on internet and telephone networks as reported by the hindu on tuesday but officials at the indian embassy claim that the premises are safe adequate measures are in place in this regard and all steps taken to safeguard the national interest wrote an official in an email response to queries by the hindu though indian official was willing to talk on record specifically about the nsa bugs mentioned in the top secret document in private they admitted that its violation of all norms and security if these bugs were implanted physically on our machinery telephones and computers it means serious breach in security who did that job forthem its very alarming situation even if they accessed our data remotely it is quite serious matter because we try to debug our systems constantly said an indian diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity the document obtained by the hindu doesnt say if the bugs were placed physically or if the machines at the indian mission and embassy were targeted through the internet network bugs similar to those aimed at indian offices were actually implanted in commercially available encrypted fax machine used at missions such as that of the european union in recent expose the guardian had revealed that the nsa infiltrated the internal computernetwork of several european embassies and the eu to intercept their communications that had led to roar of protests from european capitalsnsa
