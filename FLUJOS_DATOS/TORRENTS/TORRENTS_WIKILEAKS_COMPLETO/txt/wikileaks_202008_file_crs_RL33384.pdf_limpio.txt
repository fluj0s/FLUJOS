cable television background and overview of rates and other issues for congress history of cable rate regulation the cable communications policy ac t of 1984 98 stat 2779 pl 98549 established for the first time national regulatory policy concerning cable television communications the act established comprehensive cable regulatory scheme delineating regulatory authority among the federal state and local levels increasing cable service rates and customer servi ce complaints however prompted congress to revisit the law as local authoritie s and consumer groups lobbied for new legislation on october 5 1992 congress passed the cable television consumer protection and competiti on act of 1992 106 stat 1460 pl 102385 this law addressed such issues as cable rates mustcarry rules retransmission consent program access franchising authority servi ce standards and more promulgation of regulations required by the 1992 act wa s done by the federal communications commission fcc the regulations were completed in stages according to dates set by the act the fccs first set of cable rate rules implementing this act went into effect september 1 1993 the fcc expected on av erage 10 reduction in overall cable bills however on average did not mean that all rates decreased 10 or even that all rates decreased one reason was that all cable systems did not charge rates that the fcc determined to be unr easonable some rates incr eased and congress and the fcc decided to address th issue of rate hikes after conducting review of cable ra tes following issuance of its 1993 rate regulations the fcc decided to revisit this issue on march 30 1994 the fcc issued rules for second round of cable rate regulations these new rules were intended to cut cable rates on average an additional 7 predictions were made estimating the number of cable subscribers who would see further reductions in their cable bills the new rules took effect on may 15 1994 the telecommunications act of 1996 110 stat 115 pl 104104 was passed by the 104th congress in february 1996 this act eliminated most cable television rate regulations beyond the basic tier as of march 31 1999 in most cases rates for basic tier of services defined as the tier that includes over the air broadcast stations continues to be regulated either by local franchising authorities lfas or state authorities most small cable operators those serving less than 1 of all cable subscribers and having ffiliation with any company whose gross annual revenues exceed 250 million were freed from rate regulation

current cable rate issues according to the 2005 fcc annual report on cable industry prices 1 released in december 2006 the overall average monthl price for basicplusexpanded basic cable service increased by 52 from 4091 to 4304 over the 12month period ending january 1 2005 industry statistic s on cable rates vary slightly from fcc statistics see below but cable companies in recent years have stated that sharply rising costs of obtaining sports and tertainment programming coupled with system upgrades caused them to increase rates for subscribers2 ongoing consumer concerns about rate increases for subscription television prompted congress to mandate gene ral accounting office gao now the government accountability office study of cable rates releas ed in october 2003 in its report telecommunications issues rela ted to competition and subscriber rates in the cable television industry 3 gao sought to examine the impact of competition on cable rates assess the reliability of information contained in the annual fcc report on cab industry prices and examine the causes of recent cable rate increases in surveys of the i ndustry conducted by gao for its report gao concluded that the annual f cc report did not appear to provide reliable source of information on the cost factors underlying rate increases or on the effects of competition most notably costs associated with upgrading equipment and services gao recommended that fcc take steps to improve the reliability of data in its report gao also found that several key f actors including 34 average increase in programing costs incurred by cable operators during the past three years specifically 59 average increase in sports programing costs and cost increases from system upgrades have put upward pressure on operators to raise rates to their customers the gao report also discusse d the option of converting cable system pricing to à carte per channel pricing instead of the current tiered system it noted that despite the customer benefit of greater choice à carte pricing could impose additional equipment costs on the cu stomer and alter the current economics of the industry especially how cable providers generate advertising revenueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33384crs3 4 the fcc twelfth annual report on competition in video markets as well as previous years reports and current and previous ye

companies offer broadband services via cable mode m classifying br oadband cable service as an information service telecommuni cations service or as combination of the two has important regulatory implications generally classification as an information service would subject cable broadband serv ices to minimal federal regulation and requirement that they provide open access to their systems to competing internet service providers isps classification as telecommunications service could subject cable broadband serv ices to common carrier regulation and could require provision of open access to co mpeting isps recently the courts and the fcc have come to different conclusions regarding classification of these services in ruling on march 14 2002 the fcc ruled that cable modem service is properly classified as an interstate inform ation service the ruling further determined that cable modem service is not cable service and that cable modem service does not contain separate telecommunications service and is not subject to common carrier regulation the rules th at govern telephone providers8 however in an opinion filed on oct ober 6 2003 the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit came to different conclusion regarding the classification of cable modem rvices the court ruled in brand x internet service v fcc that cable modem services are legally in part telecommunications service which could lead to the requirement that cable operators open their lines to competing internet service providers9 this decision vacated in part the fcc march 2002 declaratory order which classified cable modem service as exclusively an information service free from the rules of access governing telecommunications services the fcc appealed the ninth circuits
