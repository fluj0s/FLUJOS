summary there is widespread belief that the like lihood of terrorist use of chemical and biological weapons cbw is increasing in part as result of publicized new evidence of terrorist interest and capabilities as well as the political fallout from the war in iraq this is serious present concern that deserves examination in the broader framework provided by the patterns motivations and historical context for the current terrorist threat although it can have powerful psychological impact past cbw use by terrorists has been ra re and has not caused large number of casualties especially compared to other w eapons terrorist att acks are deliberately designed to surprise so trend analysis will ever perfectly predict them especially in the contemporary international climate

threat in context background current popular attention bein g paid to the threat of chemical and biological weapons cbw use by terrorists may give the impression that this is new phenomenon but it is not most chemical and biological weapons themselves have long history the first chemical weapons were used in ancient gr eece biological weapons have been used in wartime context since at least the middle ages1 employed extensively in the first world war notably in the use of mustard gaschemical weapons have volved very little in their technology since the mid twentieth century although recent technol ogical advances in biological weapons have been made the vaccines and treatments available to deal with some of them have also advanced histor ically most terrorist groups have avoided using cbw in part because they do not want to aliena their own constituencies and in part because they have not had the technical expertise to turn them into effective weapons 2 those cbw attacks that have occu rred represent small proportion of the total number of international terrorist incidents3 cbw weapons have rarely been used by subnational groups but there is growing concern that past pa tterns of use could be about to change many experts worry about the increasing av ailability of cbw in the last decade or so combined with the serious psychological impact that their use would have this concern was heightened after 1995 when th japanese terrorist organization aum shinrikyo used the chemical nerve agent sarin on the tokyo subway killing 12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31831crs2 4 indeed some of the mostoften cited examples of terrorist use of chembio agents have proven to be overblown or lacking evid ence see jonathan b tucker editor toxic terror assessing terrorist use of chemical

chronologypeople and injuring up to 6000 the groups fforts which fell far short of its goals attracted widespread atten tion and helped increase focus on the socalled weapons of mass destruction wmd terrorist threat while there is considerable informati on about state acquisition andor use of cbw evidence regarding nonstate acquisition andor use is cont radictory and often sketchy4 although hard evidence is limited sampling of terrorist groups or individuals that are reported to have shown an interest in or used chembio agents usually in very limited ways includes the pkk kurdistan workers party believed to have weaponized the nerve gas sarin hamas islamic re sistance movement which has reportedly coated shrapnel with poisons and pesticides numerous us domestic individuals and groups without foreign connections including the minnesota patriots council the socalled alphabet bomber rise larry wayne harris and others who have used or inte nded to use ricin plague anthrax hydrogen cyanide sarin and other agents and of c ourse qaeda and its associated groups5 but the efforts of aum shinrikyo repres ented watershed with its bizarre and seemingly irrational agenda its systematic pursuit of technical competency and its repeated attempts to kill large number of japanese civilians even with its multiple technical failures aum shinrikyo led to he ightened anxiety about the attractiveness and feasibility of future mass casualty terrorist use of cbw still numerical trends for cbw attacks have not increased according to the monterey institute of inte rnational studies terrorism chronology between 2000 and 2001 the last year for which published da ta are available the number of hoaxes went up from 25 to 603 but the number of cbw incidents actually decreased from 48 to 256 thus it would appear that the fall 2001 anthrax attacks in the united states resulted in numerous copycat hoaxe s but they did not reflect an overall increase in bioterrorism events however terrorism experts continue to worry about the use of chemical and biological agents possible reasons for increased terrorist use the reasons for increased potential us can be grouped into four major categories the growth of militant religi ous groups with political agendas as percentage of all terrorist groups th increasing global availability of cbw information and stockpiles the internationalization of the threat of terrorism and the clear evidence of terrorist interest and capabilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31831crs3 7 in 1980 there were 2 out of 64 and in 1995 th ere were 25 out of 58 religious groups listed in the randst andrews university chronology of international terrorism see bruce hoffman inside terrorism new york colombia university press 1998 pp 9091 and nadine gurr and benjamin cole the new face of terrorism threats from weapons of mass destruction london ib tauris 2000 pp 2829 ad mittedly some of that increase may be accounted for by changes in how groups are categorized 8 these figures are derived from an examination of annual data from patterns of global terrorism see audrey kurth cronin behind the curve globalization and international

difficulties in domestic continuedfirst there has been sharp increase in militant religious groups internationally as percentage of all terrorist groups ov er the last years of the twentieth century such groups went from being just over thr ee percent of all identified terrorist groups in 1980 to fortythree percent by 19957 militant religious terrorists experts note may label their victims as heretics or infidels and thus unfit to live the incentives for such groups to kill large numbers of people may thus be unconstrained by the scruples of earthly constituencies in combination with this worrisome development the lethality per terrorist attack went up over the course of the past decade while there were fewer attacks overall in the 1990s the number of people killed and maimed per attack increased this confirmed the fear of many expert s that terrorism based on extreme religious beliefs in association with other developments discussed below might be even more dangerous than were the left wing ri ght wing and ethnonationalistseparatist groups that predominated in earlier years8 larger proportion of the attacks that did occur were executed by persons with religionba sed animus the tragedies of september 11th seemed to bear out both of these trends second there is growing concern about the increasing availability of information and resources for the building of weapons by subnational groups that in former years had been feasible only with the resources of state like the rest of the world terrorist groups have access to the va st amount of techni cal data disseminated through the internet more and more info rmation that might previously have been difficult to collect is becoming easily accessible among the groups that have reportedly demonstrated inte rest in acquiring unconventional weapons besides qaeda are the plo the red army f action hezbollah the kurdistan workers party german neonazis and the chechens9 at the same time the breakup of the soviet union increased potential access to va st highly advanced arsenal of not only nuclear but also chemical nd biological weapons and expertise the combination of greater movement of people knowle dge and products across borders in globalized world and greater availability of materials and expertise in the postsoviet era have together led to potentially rious erosion in stat control over chemical and biological weapons or their ingredients10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31831crs4 10 continued regulation by dana shea 11 the central intelligence agency unclassified report to congress on the

2003third the nature of international terro rism has evolved in dangerous ways in recent years although many traditional gr oups carry on in their struggles the growth of religiouslyoriented groups has led to an increased commonality of interests between populations in disparat geographical areas in pa rt in reaction to american global policies and cultural as well as political global reach groups are developing ties across formerly divisive ideological ethnic and national lines the area of potential recruits is thus broader than it might have been for traditional ethnonationalistseparatist group supported only by its local constituency for example also this internationalization of the threat has often led to greater distance between groups and targets th result is not only removal of moral constraints but also political constraints with less worry about potentially sullying homeland or killing potential constituents thus the internationalization of terrorism may unfortunately imply an increase in just the sorts of incentives that lead groups to consider unconve ntional weapons fourth and perhaps most important ther are clear indications of interest in cbw on the part of contemporary terrorist groups as well as some evidence of actual capabilities with longstanding expressed desire to acquire them and demonstrated willingness to kill americans qaeda and its associates is the group that most worries us experts osama bin laden has reportedly pursued the development of chemical and biolog ical weapons since the early 1990s11 in 1998 he spoke of acquiring weapons of mass destruction being religious duty and the eleventh volume of qaedas 5000page encyclopedia of jihad is devoted to explaining how to construct cbw12 there are many substantiated examples in the open press of efforts by qaeda and its allies to develop th weapons during operati ons in afghanistan coalition forces found trace amounts of ricin and anth rax at five

training in chechnya and the pankisi gorge region of georgia16 most recently evidence seized in march 2003 with the arrest of operations chief khalid shaikh mohammed demonstrated surprising technical sophistication w ith production timetables and manufacturing specifications for bioch emical agents especially weaponized anthrax17 in addition to these highly publicized examples there are many other press reports of varying reliability it is hard to know with confidence what the logic of this apparently growing interest in cbw is if high casualties ar the intended end these agents are not the most effective means chembio agents are generally more useful for increasing anxiety and panic than causing high numbers of casualties pr ojections of tens of thousands of casualties are theoretically possible18 but many such estimates are worstcase scenarios likely to occur in hardtoachieve circumstances with ideal weather conditions temperature controls di spersion rates concentrations of agent and so on19 still terrorism is psychological weapon intended for political effect the goal might instead be to cause economic damage or to show strength and increase political support or leverage or to copy other terrorist groups or to emulate the technological capabilities of statesor some combination of these while this is fine line to draw there is danger th at western governments might overstate and hype the threat leading to some of the same outcomes by heightening anxieties there are large number of pr actical obstacles to terrori sts using these weapons and these will be discussed next httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31831crs6 20 see smithson and levy rethinking the lessons of tokyo chapter three ibid pp 71111 21 for much more information on this see crs report rl31669 terrorism background on chemical biological and toxin weapons and options for lessening their impact by dana shea 22 according to smithson and levy the larges t death toll resulting from single cbw attack was 19 and in 96 percent of the cases three or fewer people were either injured or killed ataxia p xiiipossible reasons against terrorist use there are at least four reasons why rrorist groups like qaeda might avoid using chembio agents in attacks against the united states and its interests first and most important the technical difficulties in carrying out such attacks continue to be significant aum shinrikyo is good example of group that had unusually favorable circumstances for producing che mical and biological weapons including money facilities time and expertise yet they were unable to do so effectively some experts argue that aum shinrikyos expe rience which included problems ranging from obtaining biological seed cultures to effectively disseminating them to chemical leaks and accidents is as easily warning of the technical challenges involved as it is an example for future groups20 for most nonstate actors difficulties with acquiring materials maintaining them transforming them into weapons and disseminating them effectively are numerous while many technical advances have occurred in recent years arguably reducing the barriers somewhat there are still considerable obstacles to terrorist devel opment of chemical and biological weapons21 second as mentioned above there are far easier and potentially more effective at least in terms of casualty numbers alternatives to chemical and biological weapons on the rare occasions when they ve been used cbw have not resulted in large death tolls especially compared to conventional weapons such as truck bombs and individual explosive devices22 it is worth bearing in mind that the attacks of september 11th accomplished mass destruction wit hout any unconventional weaponry if measured strictly in terms of their proven capacity to kill people or the frequency of terrorist use in the past cbw weapons are not the most worrisome threat third the incentives and disincentives for individual terrorists to use chemical and biological weapons are complex and ma not be exactly the same as those that guide the use of more conventional weapons recent suicide ttacks indicate among other things an apparently growing willingness on the part of terrorist organizations to plan and condone the death of their own operatives in the service of the cause it is difficult to handle many chemical and bi ological agents without putting the handler at risk especially in the absence of the kind of topquality equipment that is more commonly available to states but instanta neous death in dramatic explosion is far cry from the agony of slow death fro m smallpox or exposure to nerve agent of course there are many unknowns but from an individual perspective the incentives and disincentives for dying in cbw attack should not be assumed to be the same as those that factor into other types of attacks indeed the existence ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31831crs7 23 see paul wilkinson editors introduction technology and terrorism in technology and terrorism london england frank cass 1993 pp 111 among terrorism experts the question of how terrorists use technology pecially the degree to which they innovate technologically is complex and contentious 24 for example see the usa patriot act pl 1075 and the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act pl 107188 larger numbers of religious rrorists could actually imply decreased likelihood of the use of chemical and bi ological weapons although this point should not be overstated violence whose primary aim is to kill as many perceived enemies as possible may not be likely to employ these agents it is difficult in most scenarios to execute an attack with chembio weapons that kills large number of people finally groups tend to mimic previous successes although terrorists do innovate in various ways23 groups have most often pr eferred to use weapons that have proven track record there are guarantees but going strictly on the odds and the historical patterns of terrorist be havior most experts posit that there is higher likelihood that the next major att ack will use conventi onal not unconventional means but again the caveat is that terrorism seeks to shock issues for congress if chemical or biological terrorist attack were to occur it is most likely that the event would be on small scale physically with much larger effects on the population psychologically for this reason targets of terrorism are forced to seek fine balance on one hand it is importa nt to prepare the public for the possibility of an attack among other things ce one of the incentives for using these weapons is to induce panic preparations lower the likelihood of their occurrence in the first place on the other hand hyping and publicizing the threat potentially distorts its probable magnitude and like lihood this could arguably add to the incentives for terrorist organization to attempt an attack additional measures to counter both st ate and especially nonstate means of proliferation of chemical nd biological weapons are cr ucial to reducing the threat in the future both domestically and internationally this is difficult technical challenge in an age of globalization wh the expertise and means to carry out attacks are becoming much harder to control through traditional state measures like border controls export contro ls treaties and sa nctions defensive measures and consequence management to reduce both the effects of an attack and the incentives to carry one out will be increasingly important within the united states some measures enhancing the security of laborat oriesfacilities have already been enacted24 some believe that existing measures are adequate and others disagree with respect to the increasing global availability of information and materials related to chemical and biol ogical weapons an important issue could be the fate of the people who have worked in the iraqi w eapons programs at this writing the full nature of those programs is not public ly known however as the united states forcibly disarms iraq it could become critical to ensure that cbw

lligence but also the productionlevel technicians and others w ho may have access or some degree of knowledge at least in the short term the nightmarish scenario of loss of control of iraqi cbw including potential sale or transfer to terrorist organizations could arguably be more likely in an atmos phere of political or economic instability there might be incentives for new links to develop between iraqis who might have benefitted from the previous regime and wellheeled gr oups like qaeda and its associates osama bin ladens expression of support fo r the iraqi people if not the baathist regime as well as evidence of qaedas existing interest and capabilities argue for scrupulous caution along these lines th ere have been extensive measures under the nunnlugar comprehensive threat re duction program oriented toward the arsenal of the former sovi et union but postconflict iraq could present important new proliferation risks existing legisla tion including the iraq sanctions act of 1990 and existing provisions under the chemical weapons convention and the biological and toxin weapons convention may not ad equately address this new concern25 and additional measures targeting this emer ging danger may be worth considering
