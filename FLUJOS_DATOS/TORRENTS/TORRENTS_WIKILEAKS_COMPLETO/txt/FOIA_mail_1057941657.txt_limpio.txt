from ben santer santer1llnlgov to phil jones pjonesueaacuk rlsemailuncedu subject more on climate research date fri 11 jul 2003 124057 0700 cc tom wigley wigleyucaredu michael mann mannvirginiaedu mike hulme mhulmeueaacuk dear phil in june 2003 climate research published paper by david douglass et the et includes john christy and pat michaels douglass et attempt to debunk the paper that tom and i published in jgr in 2001 accounting for the effects of volcanoes and enso in comparisons of modeled and observed temperature trends jgr 106 2803328059 the douglass et paper claims and purports to show that collinearity between enso volcanic and solar predictor variables is not serious problem in studies attempting to estimate the effects of these factors on msu tropospheric temperatures their work has serious scientific flaws it confuses forcing and response and ignores strong temporal autcorrelation in the individual predictor variables incorrectly assuming independence of individual monthly means in the msu 2lt data in the douglass et view of the world uncertainties in predictor variables observations etc are nonexistent the error bars on their estimated enso volcano and solar regression coefficients are miniscule over year ago tom and i reviewed for jgr paper by douglass et that was virtually identical to the version that has now appeared in climate research we rejected it prior to this both tom and i had engaged in long and frustrating dialogue with douglass in which we attempted to explain to him that there are large uncertainties in the deconvolution of enso volcano and solar signals in short msu records douglass chose to ignore all of the comments we made in this exchange as he later ignored all of the comments we made in our reviews of his rejected jgr paper although the douglass et climate research paper is largely criticism of our previouslypublished jgr paper neither tom nor i were asked to review the paper for climate research nor were any other coauthors of the santer et jgr paper asked to review the douglass et manuscript im assuming that douglass specifically requested that neither tom nor i should be allowed to act as reviwers of his climate research paper it would be interesting to see his cover letter to the journal in the editorial that you forwarded dr kinne writes the following if someone wishes to criticise published paper she must present facts and arguments and give criticised parties chance to defend their position the irony here is that in our own experience the criticised parties ie tom and i were not allowed to defend their positions based on kinnes editorial i see little hope for more enlightened editorial decision making at climate research tom richard smith and i will eventually publish rebuttal to the douglass et paper well publish this rebuttal in jgr not in climate research with best regards ben phil jones wrote dear all finally back in the uk after asheville and iugg attached is an editorial from the latest issue of climate research i can only seem to save it this way seems like we are now the bad guys cheers phil at 0751 040703 0600 tom wigley wrote mike mann i agree that kinne seems like he could be defreitas clone however what would be our legal position if we were to openly and extensively tell people to avoid the journal tom __________________________________ michael mann wrote thanks mike it seems to that this kinne characters words are disingenuous and he probably supports what freitas is trying to do it seems clear we have to go above him i think that the community should as mike h has previously suggested in this eventuality terminate its involvement with this journal at all levelsreviewing editing and submitting and leave it to wither way into oblivion and disrepute thanks mike at 0100 pm 732003 0100 mike hulme wrote phil tom mike so this would seem to be the end of the matter as far as climate research is concerned mike to climate research editors and review editors dear colleagues in my 2006 email to you i stated among other things that i would ask cr editor chris freitas to present to copies of the reviewers evaluations for the 2 soon et papers i have received and studied the material requested conclusions 1 the reviewers consulted 4 for each ms by the editor presented detailed critical and helpful evaluations 2 the editor properly analyzed the evaluations and requested appropriate revisions 3 the authors revised their manuscripts accordingly summary chris freitas has done good and correct job as editor best wishes otto kinne director
