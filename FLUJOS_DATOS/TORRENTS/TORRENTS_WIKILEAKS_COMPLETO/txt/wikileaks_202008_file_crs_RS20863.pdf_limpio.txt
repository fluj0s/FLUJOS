services group december 11 2006 abstract this report discusses regulation of mbr as an ozonedepleting substance and addresses possible concerns for congress such as whether there should be more rapid phaseout whether permanent critical use exemptions may be needed or whether us phaseout should be prolonged to provide time to Ô¨Ånd suitable substituteshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20863 order code rs20863 updated december 11 2006 methyl bromide and stratospheric ozone depletion wayne morrissey information research specialist in science and technology knowledge services group summary methyl bromide mebr widely used pesticide in agriculture is regulated for its potential ozonedepleting effects in the ea rths stratosphere controls on production emissions and trade are manda ted internationally under th 1987 montreal protocol on substances that depl ete the ozone layer the protoc ol and domestically under title vi of the us clean air act ban on production for nonessential uses occurred on december 31 2004 but the protocol s till regulates post2004 production for critical uses us agribusinesses have sought exem ptions from the environmental protection agency epa to produce mebr for certain cr itical uses after the ban exemptions are resisted by some protocol parties and environmental advocates who seek rapid definitive ban on production and use chemical companies maintain that they cannot foresee development of effective chemical substitutes for all uses of mebr in the near term and agricultural producers indicate they may have to rely on less economical and less effective treatments production allowances for mebr for 20052008 have since been approved under the protocol and the ep has approved allocations for registered us users due to declining production of manufactured mebr the epa would permit commercial trade of pre2005 i nventories this report w ill be updated as warranted introduction methyl bromide mebr plays an important role in international agriculture because of its effectiveness in killing insects and plant pathogens mebr is used extensively for preplanting and postharvest treatment of crops it also is used for quarantine and preshipping qps treatment of agricu ltural commodities and containers used in international importing and ex porting of agricultural goods in the mid1980s group of atmospheric sc

continuedfigure 1 shows that in agricultural uses typically about 80 of manufactured mebr is for fumigating soils prior to planting to prevent root damage another 20 is used as pesticide to treat

crop storage facilities about 1 of total is used for quarantine and preshipment qps treatments in global agricultural trade the profile of emissions differs for various uses about 50 of mebr is

protocol parties had challenged the epas submission for ncues because of uncertainty about future s upplies of mebr for us agri cultural businesses president bush and some members of congress considered withdrawal from the international treaty14 in the wake of us concerns and so compromises by dos negotiators it had appeared to some observers that the u s position had gained greater support among protocol parties during negotiations for the 2006 growing season when submitting us nominations for critical use exemptions n cues for 2007 to the protocol secretariat the epa stated that future us demands for mebr would likely decline due to introduction of promising alte rnatives for some appli cations in the marketplace15 us negotiations under th montreal protocol at the 15th
