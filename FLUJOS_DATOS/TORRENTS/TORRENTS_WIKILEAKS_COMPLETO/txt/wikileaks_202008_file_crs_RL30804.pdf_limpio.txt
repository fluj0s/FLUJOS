elect the president and vice president of the united states indirectly through an arrangement known as the electoral college system the electoral college system comprises complex mosaic of constitutional provisions state and federal laws and political party rules and practices although the electoral college system has delivered uncontested results in 46 out of 50 presidential elections since it assu med its present constitutional form in 1804 it has been the subject of persistent criticism and frequent proposals for reform reform advocates cite seve ral problems with the current system including close or multicandidate election can result in electoral college majority leading to contingent election in congress the current system can result in the election of president and vice president who received majority of electoral votes but fewer popular votes than their opponents the formul for assignment of electoral votes is claimed to provide an unfair advantage for less populous states and does not account for population changes between censuses and the winnertakeall system used by most states does not recognize the proporti onal strength of the losing major party minor party and independent candidates on the othe r hand defenders assert that the electoral college system is an integral and vital component of federalism that it has 92 record of noncont roversial results and that it promotes an ideologically and geographically broad twopa rty system they maintain that repair of the electoral college system rather than abolition w ould eliminate any perceived defects while retaining its overall strengths proponents of presidential election reform generally advocate either completely eliminating the electoral college system re placing it with direct popular election or repairing perceived defects in the existing system the direct election alternative would replace the elector college with single na tionwide count of popular votes that is the candidates winning plurality of votes would be elected most proposals provide for runoff election if candidates received minimum of 40 of the popular vote electoral college reform proposals in clude 1 the district plan awarding each states two at large electoral votes to the statewide popular vote winners and one electoral vote to the winning candidates in each congressional district 2 the proportional plan awarding electoral votes in states in direct proportion to the p opular vote gained in the state by each candidate and 3 the automatic plan awarding all of each states electoral votes directly on winnertake all basis to the statewide vote winners major reforms of the system can be effected only by constitutional amendment process that requires twothirds approval by both houses of congress

president and those advocating that state or federal representatives should elect the president the electoral college an overview and analysis of reform proposals introduction the electoral college system in brief the president and the vice president of the united states are elected indirectly by an institution known as the electoral college the us constitution in article ii section 1 clause 2 as amended by the 12th amendment together with series of implementing federal statutes1 provides the broad framework through which electors are appointed and by which they cast votes for the president and vice president origins of the ectoral college the method of electing the president and vice president was the subject of considerable discussion at the cons titutional convention of 1787 while some delegates favored direct ection of the president others opposed it on the grounds that the people would lack sufficient know ledge of the character and qualifications of presidential and vice presidential candidates to make intelligent electoral decisions indirect election of the chief executive by congress the legislatures of the states or even by electors drawn by t enjoyed equally wide or greater support moreover the delegates were reluctant to set uniform national voting standards for federal elections believi ng this to be prerogative of the states finally delegates from less populous states feared that presid ential elections might be dominated by few large states2 the convention settled on compromise plan the electoral college system3 it provides for the election of the presid ent and vice president by electors appointed by each state in manner determined by its legislature the electors then meet in their respective states to vote among its more attractive elements it removed election from congress thus reinforcing separation of power s acknowledged the federal principle by requiring electoral votes to be cast by state and made it at least possible that some of the people would be able to vote albeit indirectly for the nations chief executive for instance while the constitution did not mandate popular participation in the lection of electors neither did it prohibit it leaving the question to state discretion in fact the states moved to provi for direct popular choice of electors by the voters beginning in the late 18th century by 1836 onlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30804crs2 4 the founders feared and deprecated the w hole idea of competing political factions or parties which they associated with what th ey viewed as the worst excesses of the british system in the electoral college they sought perhaps ingenuously to craft system where electors chosen by or simply in touch w ith the people would cast nonpolitically motivated votes for the best candidates for president 5 adams was elected president but too many federalist electors cast their second votes for candidates other than pinckney so jefferson came in second in the total number of electoral votes and was thus elected vice president this revealed another unintended consequence of the original constitutional provisions si nce adams and jefferson now president and vice president were bitter political enemiessouth carolinas legislature continued to select the states presidential electors and since the civil war electors have b een popularly chosen in all states the 12th amendment the constitution originally provided that each elector would cast two votes for different persons for president the person winning the most electoral votes provided the total was majority of th total number of electors would become president the person winning the next rgest number would become vice president there was to be separate vote for vice president this system understandably failed to envision the growth of political parties in the new republic which would nominate unified tickets of nominees for president and vice president4 the system worked as intended only for the two elections won by george washington by 1796 nascent party system proposed competin g candidacies of john adams and thomas pinckney for the federalists and thomas jefferson and aaron burr for the anti federalists or republicans5 in each case the second named candidate was clearly intended to be nominated for vice president but because electoral votes were undifferentiated it was necessary for at leas t one elector on the winning team to cast vote for candidate other than the desi gnated vice presidential nominee in order to avoid tie for the presidency when adams and jefferson again contested the election of 1800 with burr again as jeffersons designat ed vice presidential running mate the republicans won solid majority of electors but failed to have one elector cast his vote for someone other than jefferson jefferson and burr we re thus tied for the presidency and the election went to the house of representatives the electoral college misfire threw the nation into its first and one of its worst constitutional crises as federalists and dissident republicans plotte d and caballed to deny jefferson the presidency the house required 35 deadlocked ballots befo re the impasse was broken and jefferson was elected the shock of the 1800 election led directly to proposal of the 12th amendment in 1803 and its speedy ratification in 1804 th system was revised so that electors would cast one vote each for president and vice president thus compartmentalizing the two contests as before the candidate s who gained majority of electoral votes would be elected president and vice president if there were majority the househttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30804crs3 6 for additional information on this process known as contingent election please consult crs

ticket system of awarding elect oral votes discussed infra there have been contingent electionsadditional 4 states voting for william h crawford20 likewise election of the vice president by the senate has occurred onl once on february 8 1837 the senate elected richard mentor johnson as vice pr esident over francis granger by vote of 33 to 16 some commentators have criticized the 1825 presiden tial contingent election claiming it created constitutional crisis because the house according to jackson supporters appeared to select president as part of po litical corrupt bargain between adams and henry clay who had been disqualified from the contingent election process because he came in fourt h after jackson adams and crawford in electoral vote totals recall that the 12th amendment limits contingent election candidates to the top three electoral vote winners21 indeed critics of the contingent election system generally argue that it further removes the choice of president and vice president from the voters that is members of the house and senate are free to exercise their choice without regard to the winners of the popular vote in their districts states or in the nation at large moreover by effectively granting each state an equal vote the contingent election syst em fails to account fo r great differences in population and the number of votes cast in the various states on the other hand others point out that the 1825 house contingent election resulted in political backlash that ultimately f acilitated andrew jacksons ccessful election four years later as result supporters mainta in the contingent election system has demonstrated that it does function by cha nneling voter dissatisfac tion into subsequent political action22 in evaluating the contingent electi on process some commentators have suggested that any threshold inquiry require s assessing how often contingent election occurs that is if the results of ge neral election are frequently inconclusive thereby increasing the likelihood of contin gent election then democratic criteria would require implementing reforms that b ring the people into the contingency process23 indeed critics of the electoral college system caution that the presence of viable and wellfunded thirdparty or independent presiden tial candidates who may be able to garner electoral votes by carrying plurality of the votes in statewide elections increases the likelihood of contin gent election the most recent example of thirdparty candidate winning electoral votes occurred in 1968 with the minor party candidacy of

quarterlys guide to us elections 4th ed washington cq press 2001 continuedsouthern states24 furthermore critics argue an extremely close andor contested presidential election such as that of 2000 could likewise increase the probability of contingent election determining the presidency25 it is also important to note when cons idering the contingent election procedure that the 12th amendment does not provide for dist rict of columbia participation in contingent election in the house and nate while the ratification of the 23rd amendment in 1961 granted the district of columbia three votes in the electoral college the district of columbia would be effectively disenfranc hised in contingent election as it is not state and sends neither senators nor representatives to congress26 the minority president an electoral college misfire reform proponents also cite the fact that the current electoral college system can result in the election of socalled minority president ie one who wins majority of electoral votes but loses the popular vote indeed in the 1800s the electoral college system led to the election of three such minority presidents namely john quincy adams in 1824 rutherford b hayes in 1876 and benjamin harrison in 1888 in 1824 john quincy adams received fewer popular and ectoral votes than andrew jackson his major opponent but was chosen president by contingent election as noted previously both ran as democratic republicans in 1876 republican rutherford b hayes receiv ed fewer popular votes than his opponent democrat samuel j tilden but won the election by one electoral vote in the presidential election of 1888 republican benjamin harrison received fewer popular votes than his major opponent democrat grover cleveland but won the election with more electoral college votes27 most recently for the first time in 112 years the very closely contested presidential election of 2000 resulted in president and vice president who received majority of electoral votes but fewer popular votes than the electoral vote runners up the popular vote results for that ection were gore and lieberman 50992335 for bush and cheney

electoral college as the composition of the electoral college is based on state representation in congress some maintain it is incons istent with the one person one vote principle29 the constitutional convention of 1787 agreed on compromise election plan whereby less populous states were assured of minimum of three electoral votes based on two senators and one representative re gardless of state population since state electoral college delegations are equal to the combined total of each states senate and house legation the composition of the electoral college thus appears to be weighted in favor of the small states the two senatorial electors and the one representative elector to which each state is entitled may advantage smaller states over more populous ones because voters in the smaller states in effect cast more electoral votes per voter for inst ance in 2000 voters in wyoming the least populous state cast 218351 popular votes and th ree electoral votes for president or one electoral vote for every 72784 voter s by comparison californians cast 10965856 popular votes and 54 electoral votes or one electoral vote for every 20307130 as result of this distribution of electoral votes among the states it is argued that small states have an advantage over large states with regard to electoral vote allocation relative to their populations while it is generally recognized that small states possess an arithmetical advantage in the electoral college some observers hold that conversely the most populous large states enjoy voting power advantage because they control the largest blocs of electoral votes for ex ample voters in more populous states are better able to influence larger bloc of electoral votes than those in less populous ones because of the winnertakeall method of allocating electoral votes thus to use the previously cited examples voter in wyoming in 2000 could influence only three electoral votes whereas voter in california could influence 54 electoral votes in the same presidential election accordin g to this argument known as the voting power theory the electoral college system actually provides an advantage to the six most

advantage enjoyed by ethnic minority voters according to this argument minority voters eg blacks hisp anics and jews tend to be concentrated in populous states with larg electoral college delegations by virtue of this concentration they are presumably able to exert greater influence over the outcomes in such states because they tend to vote overwhelmingly for candidates whose policies they perceive to be favorable to their interests and thus helping to gain these states and their electoral votes for the favored candidates these arguments were advanced by the presidents of the american jewish congress and the national urban league as reasons for their support of the electoral college system during hearings before the senate judiciary committees subcommittee on the constitution as it considered direct ection amendment in 197932 current methods of allocating electoral votes under article ii section 1 clause 2 of the constitution electors are appointed in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct in interpreting this constitutional provision the suprem court in the 1892 decision mcpherson v blacker33 held that state legislatures have the exclusive power to direct the manner in which presidential and vice presidential electors are appointed moreover aside from congress having the authority under this provision to determine the time of choosing electors and the day on which they vote the power of the several states is exclusive accordingly state legislature has the authority to determine for example whether its electors will be allo cated according to the general ticket system or the district system34 the general ticket or winnertakeall system presently 48 states and the district of columbia maine and nebraska are the exceptions having adopted the district system have adopted the winnertakeall method of allocating electors under this method the slate of ectors representing the presidential and vice presidential ticket that wins plurality of

votes plur ality are elected the popular votes are also tallied in each district where the di strict elector candida winning the most votes is elected proponents of the distri ct system claim that it more accurately reflects differences in support in various parts of state and does not necessarily disenfranchise voters who picked the losing ticket the decennial census problem as the number of electors apportioned to each state is equal to the combined total of its representatives and senators in congress38 that number is ultimately dependent upon each states population after each decennial census the 435 representatives are reapportioned to the st ates based on their respective populations some states gain representatives while other states lose them in accordance with shifts in population39 therefore the gain or loss of states representation in the house of representatives affects the size of its electoral college delegation the decennial reapportionment of ectors fails however to account for significant population shifts that often occur during the course of decade thus the allocation of electoral votes in the 2000 election actually reflected 1990 population distribution among the states for period of time therefore this situation results in overrepresentation in the electoral college for some states and under representation for others moreover th 2000

set forth in the constitution and applicable federal statutes number of contingencies could occur as result of the death disability or resi gnation of prospective president or vice president during the period between nomina tion and inauguration given that the rules of succession may be unclear during certain stages of the process some commentators have argued that statutory or constitutional reforms are needed in order to provide clarifica tion and avoid dispute the first contingency could occur if candidate nominated by political party were to die or resign prior to the november election at that point in the process since one has been elected there is not yet question of succession under the constitution or federal law52 as result the political parties have dopted rules to fill presidential and vice presidential nominee vacancies53 for example in 1972 the democratic party filled vacancy when vice presidential nominee senator thomas eagleton resigned at the end of july and the democratic national committee met on august 8 to nominate r sargent shrive r as the new vice presidential candidate the second could occur if presidentia l or vice presidentia l candidate were to die after election day in november but before the electors meet to cast their votes in december this contingency has been the subject of concerned speculation and unsettled debate some commentators suggest that the political parties employing their rules providing for the filling of pr esidential and vice presidential vacancies would designate substitute nominee accordingly the electors who are predominantly party loyalists would cast their votes for the substitute nominee thereby producing the satisfactory result of the election of candidate from the party that prevailed in november54 other commentators however caution that faithful elector perhaps complying with state statutorily mandated pledge would feel compelled to vote for the decedent even though precedent suggests that such votes

president elect shall have died the vice presidentelect shall become president on january 2058 this point of view receives str ong support from the language of the 1932 house committee report accompanying the 20th amendment addressing the question of when there is president elect the report states it will be noted that the committee uses the term president elect in its generally accepted sense as meaning the person who has received the majority of electoral votes or the person who has been chosen by the house of representatives in the event that the election is thrown into the h ouse it is immaterial whether or not the votes have been counted for the person becomes the president elect as soon as the votes are cast59 others however are doubtful as to whether an official president

qualified electors totaling 15 of the number of ballots cast at the last gubernatorial election and to file them in early february of the presidential election year the court found that ohios election

of either house since that time proposals to reform the electoral college in recent congresse s generally fall into two categories those that would eliminat the electoral college system entirely replacing it with direct popular election nd those that seek to repair perceived defects in the existing arrangement these proposals are examined below the direct election plan elimin ation of the ectoral college in recent decades the most widely offere d proposal to reform the present method of electing the president and vice president has been the direct election plan under this plan the electoral college would be abolished and the president and vice president would be elected directly by popul ar vote most dir ect election proposals would require that the winning candidates receive at least 40 of the votes cast andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30804crs19 81 less frequently offered variant would provid for election by joint session of congress instead of runoff election in the even t candidates received 40 majority 82 league of women voters of the u s supra note 74 at 7179provide for runoff election between th two presidential and vice presidential tickets receiving the greatest number of popular votes if candidates receive the requisite percentage81 some direct election plan s however would not require candidates to win specific percentage of the vote in order to be elected more votes or plurality would suffice others have proposed that in the event the 40 threshold is not attained then congress meeting in joint session and voting per capita rather than by states as under curre nt contingent election procedures would elect the president and vice president pro and arguments proponents of direct election as noted ear lier may be likened to archilochuss foxes they make the argument that th eir proposal is simple and democratic the candidates winning the most popular votes woul d always be electe d direct election would thus eliminate the possibility of minority president and vice president because the candidate winning the most popular votes would always prevail further it would eliminate what they characterize as an even greater potential for distortion of the public will by abolishing the contingent election process in addition proponents note that the direct election plan would give every vote equal weight regardless of the state in which it was cast it is further noted that the direct election plan would reduce the complications that currently could arise in the event of presidential candidates death between election day and the date that the electoral college meets since the winning candidates would become president and vice presidentelect as soon as the results were certified opponents archlochuss foxes offer many arguments by comparison they assert that the direct election plan would weaken the present twoparty system and result in the growth of minor parties th ird parties and new parties todays two major parties are relatively broadly based both ideologically and geographically and conduct nationwide presidentia l campaigns in order to assemble the requisite majority of 270 electoral votes similarl the need to forge national coalitions having wide appeal has been contribu ting factor to the comparative moderation of the two major parties nd the governmental stability enjoyed by the nation under the present system moreover it is argued the growth or emergence of more narrowly focused parties could have divisive effect on national politics and result in governance by less stable coalitions similar to those in some parliamentary democracies opponents also contend that direct ection plan would weaken the influence both the smallest and most populous populated states are said to enjoy under the present system since direct popular election would eliminat the role of states as election units in favor of the single nationwide count under direct presidential election thus each vote would be count ed equally under the one person one vote principle regardless of the population si ze of the state in which it was cast82 finally they question the 40 runoff requirement in cluded in most direct election proposalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30804crs20 83 rev stat ann tit 21 805 84 neb rev stat 32548how can the concept of plurality presid ent who may have gained well under half the votes be justifiable if the chief aim of direct popular election is to elect president who enjoys majority of votes other critics of direct election contend that the allocation of electoral votes is vital component of our federal system th federal nature of the electoral college system is positive good according to its defenders they assert that the founders of the constitution intended the states to play an important role in the presidential elections and that the electoral college sy stem provides for federal election of the president that is less legitimate than the system of allocating equal state representation in the senate direct popular election they claim would be serious blow to federalism in the united states finally they note that as was demonstr ated in the presidential election of 2000 close results in single state in close election are likely to be bitterly contested under direct election they cla im every close contest in th future could resemble the postelection struggles in 2000 but on nati onwide basis as both parties would seek to gain every vote such rancorous di sputes they argue could have profound negative effects on political comity in th nation and possibly even affect the political stability of the federal government electoral college reform in contrast to direct popular election the three proposals described in this section would retain the electoral college but woul d repair perceived defects in the existing system one characteristic shared by all three is the elimination of electors as individual actors in the process elector votes would remain

reflects political diversity within different regions of states while still providing twovote bonus for statewide vote winners on the other hand opponents of the district plan contend that it does not go far enough in reforming the present electoral college method because the weight of each vote in small state would still be greater than the weight of vote in more populous state in addition they note the di strict plan would continue to allow the possibility of electing minority presid ents and vice presidents who won the electoral vote while losing the popular vot some opponents of the district plan further argue that it has the potential to fragment the electoral vote among marginal candidates who may manage to capture few districts this they claim might actually weaken the present

the interests of fairness and accuracy most proportional plans divide whole electoral vot into thousandths of votes that is to the third decimal point this variation is known as the strict proportional plan another version the rounded propor tional plan would provide some form of rounding to retain whole electoral votes89 under most proposals advocating the proportional plan the pres

proponents note that the automatic plan would eliminate the possibility of the faithless elector furthermore the automatic plan would preserve the present twomajor party system under statebystate winnertakeall method of allotting electoral votes under the present system minor parties new parties and independent candidates have not fared very well in presid ential elections probably due to inter alia problems such as ballot access procedures public financing in the general election and the lack of name recognition and grass roots organization in comparison to those of the established major pa rties opponents of the au tomatic plan argue that it perpetuates many of the perceived inequities inherent in the present electoral college system of electing the president and the vice president opponents also note that under the automatic plan it w ould still be possible to elect minority president and vice president those receivi ng more electoral votes than popular votes under the present system93 moreover it presents the per ceived problem that congress and not the people could still decide the presidency and the vice presidency when majority of the electoral vot is not obtained reform proposals following th 2000 presidential election in the presidential election of 2000 the ectoral college system resulted in president and vice president who receive d more electoral

extraordinarily close electoral vote margin it was anticipated that congre ss would revisit the question of electoral college reform reform proposals were duly introduced but action was taken during the 107th congress nor has any been taken to date on relevant proposals introduced in the 108th congress94 congressional attention focused instead on proposals for election administration reform resulting in the passage of pl 107252 the help america vote act hava in 2002 this act expanded federal involvement in election administration tr aditionally state responsibility by setting new requirements for improveme nts in voting systems providing grants to states to improve voting administration and establishing the fede ral election administration commission to administer these programs and monitor state compliance with havas provisions95 concluding observations prospects for reform despite various criticisms and controversies the electoral college system has endured since the first presidential elections in 1789 over the past two centuries it has evolved through the ratification of one constitutional amendment the 12th the passage of various federal and state laws and changing political party practices and traditions it has delivered the presiden cy to the popular and electoral vote winners in 46 out of 51 elections since it became operational in 1804 and even in the case of misfires that is cases in which candidate was elected with majority of electoral votes but minority of popular votes the re sults it has delivered have been widely if not universally accepted as legitimate96 interest in changing or abolishing the electoral college has arguably been dependent at least in recent decades on how accurately it has appeared to ratify the voters choice during periods when the system seemed to be performing well there was relatively little impetus for reform lthough as noted earlier there was nearly always steady stream of proposals for change followi ng close elections in 1960 1968 and 1976 however proposed constitutiona l amendments providing for direct election were actively considered in the house of representatives and the senate in the 91st through 96th congresses during these periods of heightened interest directhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30804crs26 97 hjres 681 91st cong carried in the house on september 18 1969 by vote of 338

challenge faced by all wouldbe constitutional amendments pproval by twothirds of the members of both chambers present and voting followed by approval in threef ourths of the states during the ensuing two decades the ectoral college delivered substantial majorities of electoral votes to the popul ar vote winners in every presidential election once again the system func tioned as its defenders predicted notwithstanding occasional concerns over close elections and the potential impact of independent or third party candidates and there was little impetus for change during this period curiously perhaps the bitte rly contested presidential election of 2000 which many observers characterized as an electoral college misfire failed to galvanize support for direct popular election or electoral college reform anger over the elections outcome seemed more intensely directed against voting system inadequacies and failures in florida and by extension nationwide that had thrust the election results into uncertainty and cont ention for over month as noted earlier the help america vote act of 2002 which soug ht to remedy defici encies in elections administration technology and procedures owed its passage largely to these controversies the first and perhaps largest single factor in the electoral college reform equation is article v of the constitution which pr ovides for its amendment among other things as noted previously in this repor t the founders intenti onally made it difficult to alter the nations fundamental charte r establishing what is the only double requirement of super majo rities in the document proposed amendment must win proposed by two thirds majorities in bot h houses of congress and must then be approved by three fourths of the states in practice the hurdle has been raised even higher since it is customary to attach sevenyear deadline for ratification of proposed amendments second most successful attempts to ch ange the constitution have depended on the stimulus of sudden great events or have benefitted from the ripeness of an idea that had been before the public for many years sometimes both factors have contributed to the successful passage and ratification of an amendment another common element in successful amendments has generally been widespread public awareness of problem to be addressed and broad na tional consensus that reform was necessary and desirable moreover ch an awareness has usually extended well beyond congress into the nation at large for instance the only previous constitutional revision of the electoral college the 12th amendment was spurred by pr ofound constitutional crisis the eventshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30804crs27 99 see discussion of the 12th amendment earlier in this report 100

election of 180099 although public opinion in its modern sense can scarcely be said to have existed at the time americas political elites had been strongly influenced by the election and its aftermath in this case congress acted with considerable dispatch for the era proposing an amendment less than two years later in december 1803 the states moved even more quickly to approve the proposal the 12th amendments ratification process was completed in either june or july of 1804 depending on whether the gislature of new hampshire or tennessee is considered to have cast the decisive vote100 more recently pr oposal and ratification of the 25th and 26th amendments was facilitated by trends and developments representative of those cited above the 25th amendment which revamped presidentia l succession procedures emerged almost directly from the events surrounding the assassination of pres ident john f kennedy in 1963 which incontestably stunned and ga lvanized both congress and the nation the vice presidency was vacant for 14 months with the designated presidential successors during this period being the 71yearold speaker of the house of representatives john w mccormack and the 86yearold president pro tempore of the senate carl f hayden the obvi ous need for constitutional procedures to replace vice president who had succeeded to the presidency or left office for some other reason coupled with the shock followi ng president kennedys death led to broad national consensus for change bot h in congress and among the public an amendment was proposed to the states on july 6 1965 and was declared to have been ratified less than 19 mont hs later on february 23 1967 the 26th amendment which effectively set 18 as voting age in the united states had been under consideration in various proposals beginning in the 1940s and throughout the postwar era public consen favorable to lowering the voting age began to emerge it is arguable however that the great upsurge in political involvement among young people that bega n with president kennedys summons to public service in the early 1960s and tinued albeit down many different roads during the vietnam war and the general cultural upheaval that characterized the latter part of the 1960s also strongly cont ributed to the amendments success the 26th amendment was proposed by cong ress on march 23 1971 and was declared to have been ratified less th an four months later on ju ly 10 of the same year notwithstanding the results of the pr esidential election of 2000 proposals for direct popular election or re form of the electoral colle ge in the subsequent 107th and 108th congresses never benefitted from comparable sense of urgency or high level of public awareness and consensus on the need for reform finally the success of amendments has often depended on the support of congressional leaders who helped guide such proposals to passage by congress and proposal to the states for instance both the 25th and 26th amendments enjoyed the approval and very active support of house judiciary committee chairmanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30804crs28 emmanuel celler and senator birch bay h chairman of the senate judiciary committees subcommittee on the constitution the cause of electoral college reform has not had such champions since senator bayh guided direct election proposal to the senate floor in 1979 given the high hurdles faced by pr oposed cons titutional amendments it is arguable that the electoral college system will likely remain in place unless or until its alleged failings become so compelling that large concurrent majorities in the public the congress and the states are prep ared to undertake its reform or abolition
