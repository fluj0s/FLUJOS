military activities of the department of defense dod including pay and benefits of military personnel operation and maintenance of weapons and facilities weapons procurement and research and development and for other purposes most of the funding in the bill is for programs administered by the department of defense though the bill also provides 1 relatively small unclassified amounts for the central intelligence agency retirement fund and intelligence community management 2 classified amounts for national foreign intelligence activities administered by the cia and by other agencies as well as by dod and 3 very small amounts for some other agencies five other appropriations bills also provide funds for national defense activities of dod and other agencies see appendix b for an overview the administrations fy1999 budget included 2706 billion for the national defense budget function of which 2508 billion was requested in the defense appropriations bill along with annual defenserelated appropriations congress also acts every year on national defense authorization bill the authorization bill addresses defense programs in almost precisely the same level of line item detail as the defenserelated appropriations bills differences between the authorization and appropriations measures within each house generally concern only few programs congressional debate over major defense policy and funding issues usually occurs mainly in action on the authorization bill because the defense authorization and appropriations bills are so closely related this report tracks congressional action on both measures crs2 status congress completed action on the annual defense authorization and appropriations bills on october 1 the final status of action on these bills and on related legislation is as follows house and senate 302b allocations on may 14 the senate appropriations committee approved its initial allocation of funds to each of its 13 subcommittees and on may 22 house appropriations committee chairman bob livingston announced his proposed initial 302b allocations the full committee approved the initial allocations on june 16 these allocations which are revised over the course of the year ultimately determine how much money will be available for defense and other programs under the jurisdiction of the appropriations committees the final senate allocations to the defense subcommittee are 250290 billion in budget authority and 244942 billion in outlays these amounts are slightly below what the administration had requested while allocations to the military construction subcommittee are somewhat above the request the final house allocations provide 250499 billion in budget authority and 244965 billion in outlays for the national security subcommittee see table b1 in appendix b below for allocations of all defense discretionary funds see crs report 96912 brief introduction to the federal budget process by robert keith for discussion of

conference agreements on the defense authorization and appropriations bills resolved number of major issues including relations with china the house approved several floor amendments to the authorization bill to limit satellite and missile technology exports to china the white house objected to several of the provisions especially to ban on satellite exports china was also contentious issue in senate debate on the authorization bill the senatepassed bill included several statements of policy but some especially contentious chinarelated amendments offered by senator hutchinson were dropped during floor debate chinarelated provisions were major issue in the authorization conference the conference agreed to drop language banning the export of satellites to china but included provisions that would 1 take review of technology exports to china away from the commerce department and return it to the state department 2 require advanced congressional notification of satellite sales to china along with presidential justification for waiving human rightsrelated limits on satellite transfers and 3 prohibit export of missile equipment or technology to china unless the president certifies that the export will not hurt the us space launch industry and will not improve chinas missile launch capabilities the conference agreement also includes housepassed measure that would prohibit the transfer of port facilities near san diego to cosco chinese shipping company the senatepassed version of the defense appropriations bill included revised amendment by senator hutchinson condemning forced abortions in china and requiring that foreign officials from china or other nations involved in forced abortions forced sterilization or genital mutilation be denied visas to the united states the appropriations conference agreement does not include this measure but it contains prohibition on dod doing business with chinese armyowned companies and requires report on the security situation in the taiwan strait base closures neither the house nor the senate authorization bills approved new rounds of military base closures as the administration had requested the senate approved an amendment by senators inhofe and dorgan that would make it somewhat more difficult for the defense department to realign military bases in the absence of congressionally established base closure process dod strongly objected to this provision the conference agreement drops this provision according to press accounts sen inhofe agreed to drop it in return for conference acceptance of the housepassed provision regarding cosco social issues the housepassed authorization bill required the army navy and air force to separate men and women in basic training as the marine corps now does the senatepassed bill in stark contrast specifically prohibited implementation of new policies to separate men and women in basic crs5 training until after congressionally established commission reports in key floor vote on june 24 the senate rejected brownback amendment to incorporate the house language instead the senate endorsed substitute offered by senator snowe that allows current integrated training practices to continue though it would require additional steps to separate male and female sleeping quarters this was reportedly major issue in the housesenate authorization conference the conference ultimately adopted the senate language but also included sense of the house statement urging separate training units on other social issues the house authorization included measure applying to the secretary of defense and the president requirement that commanders display exemplary behavior and the conference agreement includes similar provision but only as sense of the house statement both the house and the senate rejected floor amendments to eliminate the current ban on abortions in military medical facilities tritium production the housepassed authorization bill included measure that would prohibit the defense of energy doe from buying tritium for nuclear weapons from commercial nuclear reactors without this source of tritium doe would have to build new facilities to produce tritium in south carolina the congressional budget office estimated that it would cost about 3 billion over the next forty years to buy tritium from commercial sources and 10 billion to buy it from new facilities the senatepassed authorization bill included provision allowing doe to choose the longterm option the conference agreement allows doe to make the choice but prohibits implementation of any plan for year which will allow congress to review the decision again active duty endstrength the housepassed authorization bill rejected an administration request to eliminate floors on active duty endstrength levels the senate version of the authorization bill and both house and senate versions of the appropriations bill however all agreed to the administrations proposed reductions in endstrength the authorization conference report agrees to the administration request pay raise the housepassed authorization provided pay raise of 36 for military personnel while the senate version and both house and senate versions of the appropriations bill initially provided only the requested raise of 31 on june 25 however the senate approved an amendment to the authorization bill by senators thurmond and levin to increase the pay raise to 36 offset by an acrosstheboard reduction of rd funds senators stevens and inouye among others cosponsored the amendment and they subsequently offered an amendment to provide the same pay raise on the defense appropriations bill the authorization and appropriations conference agreements provide 36 raise bosnia the administration requested 19 billion for bosnia in fy1999 as emergency funding not subject to the 2705 billion cap on defense spending under the 1997 balanced budget act the senatepassed version of the defense appropriations bill included the requested funding while the house bill did not in addition the sasc report on the authorization bill approved that crs6 amount and explicitly stipulated that the funding should be provided as emergency appropriations the housepassed authorization bill did not address emergency funding but instead included provision to cap bosnia spending at 19 billion with the services allowed to spend 100 million more if necessary to protect us troops the administration strongly objected to this provision in floor action on the authorization both houses considered and rejected measures to require the withdrawal of us troops from bosnia by specific date but the senate version of the authorization bill also included sense of the congress statement encouraging the president to establish conditions allowing drawdown of forces in bosnia the authorization conference agreement specifically authorizes 19 billion in emergency funding for bosnia and allows larger expenditures if the president certifies that the funding is needed to meet us national security needs and will not undermine readiness the appropriations conference agreement did not include emergency funding for bosnia but it was later provided in supplemental appropriations measure included in the fy1999 omnibus appropriations bill weapons priorities compared to past years contentious weapons issues were few but there were some the administration requested just one c130j aircraft and objected to the addition of more than 400 million for 7 additional aircraft in the house authorization and appropriations bills the senate bills added smaller amounts the authorization and appropriations conference agreements provide funds for 7 aircraft 6 more than requested the house and senate appropriations bills reduced funding for the theater high altitude area defense thaad system by substantial amounts in the wake of the most recent test failure in may although the administration agreed that the program should be restructured it wanted to maintain funding the authorization conference agreement however cuts 294 million and the appropriations conference agreement cuts 376 million the senate authorization and appropriations bills reduced or eliminated funding for another theater missile defense tmd system the medium extendedrange air defense system meads cooperative program with allies that the administration wants to continue the authorization conference agreement cuts funding from 44 million requested to 24 million and prohibits expenditure of any funds unless the defense department finds room for meads in future budget plans the appropriations conference agreement provides just 10 million the senate authorization and appropriations bills also reduced funding for the airborne laser abl program and increased funding for spacebased laser sbl rd the administration strongly objected but the authorization conference agreement follows the senate the appropriations conference agreement provides somewhat more than the authorization for abl both house and senate appropriations bills also reduced funding for new aircraft carrier development in the wake of the navys decision not to pursue clean sheet design for new cvx carrier the navy wanted to keep some of the money to develop progressive changes in the current design the authorization conference agreement provides 110 million and the appropriations conference agreement provides 105 million of the 190 million requested the senate authorization and appropriations bills included advance procurement funds for new lhd8 amphibious ship the defense department did not object though some lawmakers denounced it as crs7 an example of pork barrel politics the authorization conference agreement provides 50 million and the appropriations agreement 45 million the house and senate differed on the number of new fa18ef aircraft to procure and the house added funds for two unrequested f16 aircraft the authorization and appropriations conferences funded 30 f18s as requested and one f16 the administration objected to requirement in the senate authorization bill that the f22 aircraft complete certain testing before additional procurement contracts are signed the authorization conference includes the restrictions but allows them to be waived the administration objected as well to some cuts in other areas that the house especially imposed to finance increases in certain programs including department of energy weapons programs the authorization conference agreement makes somewhat smaller cuts in these programs some longterm weapons issues appear to have been resolved this year the battle over b2 bomber procurement now appears over and the house national security committee did not renew its long fight to require design competition in the new attack submarine nssn program see tables a3 a4 and a5 below for action on major weapons programs military health care the house and senate authorization bills both took steps to ensure that military retirees continue to have access to the defense health care system the senate bill approved three pilot projects to test alternative approaches and the house approved floor amendment to establish test of plan to allow military retirees to join the federal employees health benefit plan fehbp the authorization conference includes pilot projects to test fehbp using the dod tricare program as supplement for medicare and giving retirees access to tricare pharmacy benefits each of these issues and background on other matters is discussed below in more detail defense policy issues budget constraints the results of last years quadrennial defense review qdr and its companion reports ongoing battles over some social issues and several other matters all combined to create broad agenda in this years defense debate key matters of discussion included 1 military base closures 2 bosnia funding 3 controls on technology exports to china and some other nations 4 other efficiency measures 5 military readiness 6 longterm funding for defense modernization 7 military personnel levels 8 national guard and reserve funding and the role of army national guard combat units 9 major weapons programs including ballistic missile defense the b2 bomber fighter aircraft and shipbuilding 10 number of social issues including sexual harassment and genderintegrated training and 11 other matters including military health care policy and year 2000 computer problems the following sections briefly review each of these issues the effect of budget constraints on the defense debate in considering the fy1999 defense budget the congressional defense committees were constrained by the 1997 budget agreement since the administration request for fy1999 was right at the agreed level of defense spending of 2705 billion in new budget authority the crs8 defense debate in congress initially amounted to zerosum game any amounts that congress added for programs it favored and any proposed administration reductions that it rejected would have to be offset by reductions in other defense programs this represents sharp break with the experience of the past three years in which congress has added substantial amounts to annual administration defense budget requests for details see table c2 in appendix c in the end congress provided an additional 83 billion for defense programs as part of the omnibus appropriations bill but this was not considered until the very end of the process the budget constraints could have led to confrontation between congress and the administration over defense priorities in which congress would add money for programs it felt the administration had neglected and pay for the additions by cutting some high priority administration programs for their part senior administration officials said that they tried to avoid potential conflicts by meeting congress half way on programs of ongoing congressional interest 1 among other things officials say they fully funded national missile defense development they requested more money than in the past for national guard and reserve equipment they made an effort to identify and fund all defense health program costs and they moved funding for the next nimitzclass aircraft carrier forward one year to fy2001 to avoid gap in production for the most part contentious debate over priorities within the defense budget did not materialize in house and senate action fy1999 defense authorization and appropriations bills while the house and senate provided some money for unrequested weapons programs and other priorities the amounts are relatively small the amounts later added for defense in the omnibus appropriations bill for the most part did not go to contentious weapons programs except for 1 billion added for ballistic missile defense the quadrennial defense review this years congressional defense debate was also affected by the outcome of last years quadrennial defense review qdr and two subsequent reports the defense reform initiative report and the report of the national defense panel the qdr released on may 19 1997 was thoroughgoing reassessment of us defense policy by the department of defense the defense reform initiative report issued on november 10 1997 identified number of efficiency measures the national defense panel report released on december 1 1997 reviewed the qdr and focused on potential defense requirements in the 20102020 period each of these reports highlighted themes that will be important ongoing matters of discussion in congress among other things the qdr proposed revised very broad statement of us defense strategy reaffirmed the requirement that us forces be able to prevail in two nearly simultaneous major theater wars proposed measures to reduce pressures on the force created by the relatively large number of smallerscale contingency operations in the postcold war era and identified key elements of the socalled revolution in military affairs rma the qdr and the defense reform initiative 1 this point is based on briefing for congressional staff by under secretary of defense comptroller william j lynn iii crs9 emphasized the need for increased efficiency in order to save money for weapons modernization and both strongly endorsed two more rounds of military base closures the national defense panel report endorsed much of the qdr including its focus on shaping the international security environment and on efficiency measures but the panel also called for greater emphasis on homeland defense and on preparations for potentially very different kinds of threats in the future the panel argued that less emphasis should be placed on preparing to fight two major theater wars and more on preparing for the future and it called for 5 to 10 billion more to be spent each year on experimental force exercises and new technology additional military base closures both the quadrennial defense review and the defense reform initiative report recommended two more rounds of military base closures as critical means of saving money to finance future defense modernization programs the defense department formally proposed two more closure rounds in its legislative plan last year one round in 1999 and another in 2003 congress was not receptive to the proposal however and dod did not pursue the proposal as vigorously as it did this year this year secretary cohen made congressional approval of two new base closure rounds in 2001 and 2005 into one of his top priorities on april 2 the defense department released report on base closures that was required by the fy1998 defense authorization act2 the report reaffirms earlier dod estimates that previous base closure rounds in 1988 1991 1993 and 1995 will lead to annual savings of about 56 billion per year beginning in fy2000 on this basis the defense department projects that two future base closure rounds each as large as the earlier average will lead to annual savings of 28 billion in todays prices when fully phased in these amounts officials argue are crucial to pay for weapons programs that are expected to begin production at the end of the next decade within congress resistance to more base closures has been hardened by objections to administration action following the 1995 base closure round the 1995 base closure commission recommended that two air force aircraft depot maintenance facilities in sacramento california and san antonio texas be closed which would have left more work for depots in oklahoma georgia and utah3 the white house however instead developed plan to privatize in place at the two sites ie private contractors would be allowed to bid for contracts to perform work at the two facilities this plan is now being implemented and the administration argues that the results are positive with competition for contracts leading to better prices to many members of congress however the administration plan politicized the base closure process last year the defense authorization bill was held up for several months by bitter dispute over proposals to ensure that the remaining public facilities 2 department of defense the report of the department of defense on base realignment and closure april 1998 3 administration officials point out that the 1995 base closure commission recommended that work at the california and texas depots either be transferred to other depots or be made subject to competition by private companies they insist therefore that privatization in place is not insistent with the commissions recommendations crs10 receive adequate work this spring lawmakers complained about an air force memo discussing white house request that the defense department encourage private company to bid on contract to perform work at the sacramento facility in congressional hearings secretary cohen and other officials were told repeatedly that privatization in place has eroded support for further base closures in response secretary cohen has said that congress can include prohibition on privatization in place in any future base closure legislation cohen has also argued that congress should approve more base closures now so that the defense department can prepare for them in the longterm fy20002005 defense plan that it is now preparing for review of base closure issues see david lockwood military base closures time for another round crs report 97674 f congressional action neither the house nor the senate agreed to additional military base closures in action on the fy1999 defense authorization in critical measure of support for base closures sasc voted down proposal by senators mccain and levin to approve one more base closure round in 2001 on june 25 the senate approved by 4845 an amendment by senator inhofe that would make it somewhat more difficult for dod to realign facilities in the absence of congressionally established base closure process just week earlier however senator inhofe predicted that next year congress will approve another base closure round to occur in 2001 the inhofe amendment was ultimately dropped by the authorization conference bosnia funding and troop levels on march 2 the administration sent two separate requests to congress for money to pay for military contingency operations overseas the first was request for supplemental appropriations of about 18 billion in fy1998 to cover costs of extending the us mission in bosnia through the end of the fiscal year and for costs of expanded operations in the persian gulf due to the confrontation with iraq the second was an amendment to the fy1999 defense budget request asking for another 19 billion to cover costs of extending the mission in bosnia through fy1999 congress agreed to provide the fy1998 supplemental funding in hr 3579 discussed above the fy1999 request for bosnia was initially considered in the course of congressional action on the regular fy1999 funding bills and funding was ultimately provided in the onmibust appropriations bill hr 4328 the administration requested that the additional fy1998 and fy1999 funding for bosnia be designated as emergency appropriations under the terms of the budget enforcement act this would raise caps on defense discretionary spending and on total discretionary spending by the amount provided so the costs would not have to be offset by cuts in other defense programs this proposal was contentious for the past three years congress had insisted that anticipated costs of ongoing military operations in bosnia the persian gulf and elsewhere be provided as part of regular defense appropriations measures within caps on defense spending established in the annual budget process the fy1998 and fy1999 supplemental funding has broken this precedent the administration argued that bosnia costs were not assumed in defense plans at the time the 1997 budget agreement was reached if congress did not agree to designate the bosnia funding as emergency appropriations and bosnia operations continue then the costs would have to be offset by cuts in other defense programs crs11 congressional action in its version of the defense authorization bill sasc approved 19 billion for bosnia in fy1999 as an addition to the regular 2705 billion funding for national defense and explicitly said that the funding should be provided as emergency appropriations as the administration requested in its version of the authorization hnsc did not specifically address emergency funding for bosnia but instead established cap of 19 billion on the amount that may be expended for bosnia in fy1999 with an additional 100 million available in case of emergency to protect us troops on may 21 the full house rejected motion by representative barney frank to recommit the authorization bill to committee with instructions to report revised bill that would cut off funds for operations in bosnia after dec 31 1998 without prior congressional approval the housepassed defense appropriations bill also did not include emergency funding for bosnia on june 24 the senate approved an amendment to the authorization bill by senator thurmond urging the president to reduce the us troop level in bosnia but in key test of policy it rejected an amendment by senator bob smith to cut off funds unless congress approves the deployment senators byrd and hutchison did not offer their amendment to require that the us troop presence in bosnia be drawn down to the average level maintained by major allies on july 30 the senate added an amendment proposed by senator stevens to the defense appropriations bill to provide the requested 19 billion as emergency appropriations on the broader issue of congressional war powers the housepassed appropriations bill included provision proposed by representative skaggs to prohibit expenditures on offensive military action without advance congressional approval the senate however voted by 8415 to table an identical amendment to the appropriations bill offered by senator durbin the white house threatened veto if the skaggs provision were included in the appropriations bill the authorization conference agreement approves 19 billion in emergency funding for bosnia but it must still be appropriated the conference agreement also allows expenditure of more than that provided the president certifies that the funding is needed for national security and will not reduce readiness the appropriations conference agreement does not include emergency funding for bosnia leaving the issue for later consideration the skaggs amendment was dropped in the appropriations conference agreement requested emergency funding of 19 billion for bosnia was provided in the fy1999 omnibus appropriations bill relations with china and controls on technology exports to china and other nations policy toward china became major focus of congressional attention in the wake of allegations that the loral space corporation provided assistance to china in improving its missile launch technology and on the eave of the presidents trip to china nuclear tests by india and pakistan also focused attention on trade sanctions legislation and other export controls congressional action the house approved several amendments to the defense authorization bill to restrict technology exports to china and other countries one amendment limited export of missile and satellite technology and provision of technical assistance to china another subjected satellite exports to the same licensing requirements as munitions another transferred responsibility for reviewing technology exports to china from the commerce department to the state department and another allowed congress to review nuclear technology crs12 exports through the same procedures as weapons exports the white house strongly objected to these measures the housepassed bill also included provision to prohibit the transfer of facilities at long beach naval shipyard near san diego to chinese shipping company cosco number of amendments concerning technology exports to china relations with china and trade sanctions were proposed in senate action on the defense authorization bill on june 23 the senate rejected motion to table four chinarelated amendments by senator hutchinson and debate on china policy was then put off senator hutchinson then said that he planned to offer his amendments when the senate took up the defense appropriations bill senator stevens however delayed floor action on the bill reportedly in part because he was concerned that contentious amendments on china or other issues could derail the bill ultimately the senate considered number of chinarelated issues in action on other bills and senator hutchinson offered single revised amendment on the defense appropriations bill this measure required the state department to deny visas to foreign officials involved in forced abortions forced sterilization or genital mutilation and it passed unanimously the authorization conference agreement drops house language banning the export of satellites to china but includes provisions that would 1 take review of technology exports to china away from the commerce department and return it to the state department 2 require advanced congressional notification of satellite sales to china along with presidential justification for waiving human rightsrelated limits on satellite transfers and 3 prohibit export of missile equipment or technology to china unless the president certifies that the export will not hurt the us space launch industry and will not improve chinas missile launch capabilities the conference agreement also includes the housepassed ban on transferring port facilities cosco for review of china policy issues see crs issue brief 98018 chinaus relations by kerry dumbaugh other efficiency measures along with additional base closures both the qdr and the defense reform initiative report recommended number of other efficiency measures the most important measures include 1 onethird reduction over the next few years in the staff of the office of the secretary of defense osd and substantial cuts in military service headquarters staffs 2 cuts in civilian and military personnel carrying out support functions and 3 aggressive pursuit of publicprivate competitions for additional activities now carried out by civilian dod employees in the past congress has on the one had pressured the defense department to reduce the number of people engaged in overhead activities and on the other hand imposed some barriers to reductions in civilian personnel levels issues this year included first whether the dod cuts in osd and headquarters personnel amount to real or only paper reductions second whether congress will require different or deeper cuts in overhead personnel and third how congress will react to privatization measures at local facilities over the past couple of years the house in particular has sought to impose deep cuts in the number of personnel engaged in acquisition activities the senate and the administration sought to soften houseproposed measures in part on the grounds that acquisition personnel have been defined too broadly at the same time the house has resisted proposals to open weapons maintenance and other activities to private competition crs13 congressional action in report language hnsc urged the defense department not to waive cuts in acquisition personnel that were mandated in last years defense authorization act and criticized dod for not complying with reporting requirement on management headquarters personnel hnsc also imposed an acrosstheboard cut of 500 million in funding for consultants and cited this reduction as reform measure the white house objected to the cut in consulting funds and to several measures in the housepassed authorization bill saying they would restrict dods ability to pursue efficiencies the authorization conference agreement includes 1 measure to withhold 10 percent of funds for the office of the secretary of defense unless dod meets all statutory requirements to cut headquarters staffs and provides mandated reports to congress 2 cuts 25000 acquisition personnel 3 cuts 240 million for consultants and 4 reduces the number of assistant secretary of defense positions from 10 to 9 military readiness military readiness has been focus of intense attention in congressional hearings throughout the year many members of congress have cited repeated reports about readinessrelated problems ranging from shortage of air force fighter aircraft spare engines to drop in army standards for new recruits to shortfalls in army personnel in key skill areas including combat infantry to drastic decline in pilot retention rates in the air force and the navy these are symptoms some conclude of an imminent readiness crisis brought about first by inadequate funding for defense and second by the clinton administrations willingness to commit us forces to more missions abroad than the force can reasonably support in response administration officials acknowledged some problems but they insisted that there is overall crisis in readiness now or in the foreseeable future early deploying units they say remain fully ready though some later deploying units may take longer than in the past to prepare evidence of problems they say is largely based on anecdotes that do not accurately portray the state of the force overall readiness reports they insist continue to show highly qualified and capable force problems that have occurred are being fixed some air force engine spares for example were in short supply because of mistakes in projecting failure rates but the planning models have now been changed pilot retention has been problem in part because of airline hiring and in part because of demands of operations abroad but sustained effort to resolve the problem is underway congress approved higher pilot reenlistment bonuses last year and several steps are being taken to limit deployments army recruiting continues to meet longstanding quality goals most recently however officials in the services have expressed growing concerns about personnel recruitment and retention on september 15 the president met with senior military officers who reportedly identified increasingly serious readiness problems and urged support for higher defense spending on september 28 the joint chiefs testified before the senate armed services committee about the state of military readiness and identified need for more that 17 billion per year in additional defense spending later in response to questions of senator mccain the chiefs identified shortfalls of as much as 135 billion over five years congressional action hnsc restructured operation and maintenance funding to provide more money for depot maintenance and real property maintenance it also mandated substantial changes in readiness reporting which dod crs14 complains will be difficult and costly to implement sasc also provided limited additional amounts for readinessrelated accounts in floor action on the defense appropriations bill the senate approved an amendment by senators domenici and harkin to require reports on food stamp use by military families and other factors related to family life morale and retention the senate also adopted hutchison amendment stating the sense of the congress that readiness has been eroded by combination of declining budgets and expanded missions including the mission in bosnia the authorization conference agreement requires improved readiness reporting provides more money for recruiting and various troop benefits increases added pay for flight duty and emphasizes quality of life measures such as day care centers and housing in construction programs the fy1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes 13 billion for enhanced military readiness the bill did not however make changes that some had sought in military retirement benefits as way of bolstering personnel retention longterm funding for defense modernization the flip side of the military readiness issue concerns the adequacy of longterm weapons modernization programs in recent years the administration has given very high priority to readinessrelated funding as result from year to year funding that the defense department had planned to spend on weapons procurement has instead had to be reallocated to operation and maintenance accounts which are most closely related to readiness in the fy1999 budget this problem has not been completely resolved the requested level of procurement funding 487 billion is very close to the level that was planned last year there was some decline officials acknowledge but only they say because of adjustments in weapons programs following the quadrennial defense review but this is true only because the administration requested funding for fy1999 bosnia costs as emergency appropriations not subject to the cap on overall defense spending if the budget had to absorb bosnia costs then procurement spending would likely decline more generally the administration has set goal of building up procurement funding to 60 billion per year by fy2001 to meet this goal without an increase in overall defense spending however flies in the face of historical experience in the defense budget as senior defense officials candidly acknowledge the administration hopes to meet the target by applying base closure and other efficiency savings to the procurement accounts failure to achieve planned savings however would put off reaching the target as would continued growth in weapons maintenance costs unplanned quality of life requirements costs of contingency operations not funded through emergency appropriations health care cost growth or any of number of other expenses recently under secretary of defense jacques gansler said that the 60 billion procurement target was becoming harder to reach congressional action versions of the defense authorization and appropriations bills include substantial increases in modernization funding the omnibus appropriations bill provides 1 billion for bmd programs but other funds for weapons modernization military personnel endstrength levels the qdr mandated cut of 37000 active duty personnel and of 55000 reserve positions through about the year 2003 the active duty reductions taken mainly out of support activities are part of the crs15 qdrs efficiency savings there has however been some vocal resistance in congress to proposed personnel cuts while few object to reductions in support activities many argue that active duty forces are already being strained by the requirements of contingency operations and forward presence abroad so that further force cuts are illadvised the army in particular has long had shortages of personnel in certain skills situation it has been willing to live with on the assumption that units would be filled out with individual reservists in the event of major conflict but in handling smallerscale operations this aggravates burdens on the force because units sent to bosnia or elsewhere are fully manned in part by drawing personnel from other active duty units increasing shortages elsewhere4 for the past two years congress has set floors on active duty personnel levels in order to carry out the qdr reductions congress must agree to reduce or eliminate the statutory floors some members of congress do not want to do so congressional action the administration requested that active duty end strength be reduced by more than 35000 from the authorized fy1998 level and by about 24000 from the actual fy1998 level and that congress repeal statutory floors on endstrength hnsc rejected the administration request to repeal the statutory floors and agreed to reduce authorized endstrength by 11000 fewer positions than the administration wanted arguing that troops are being overworked sasc approved the requested endstrength reductions and repeal of the statutory floors house and senate versions of the defense appropriations bill assumed the requested cuts in endstrength in fy1999 the authorization conference report agrees to the administration request national guard and reserve issues in the wake of the qdr simmering dispute between the active army and the army national guard arng over the role of arng combat units broke into open warfare the guard believes that active army leaders have not given guard combat units especially eight arng combat divisions an appropriate role in war plans and that the qdr did not adequately consider the views of arng leaders in the midst of this dispute last year congress approved measure requiring the appointment of one guard and one reserve officer as special advisors to the chairman of the joint chiefs this year the defense department has requested substantially more money than in the past for guard and reserve weapons procurement meanwhile the army chief of staff has been meeting with arng leaders in an attempt to ease the ongoing dispute congress has perennially added money for guard and reserve weapons programs to the budget and has tried to protect guard units for thorough discussion see robert l goldich the army reserve components strength and force structure issues crs report 97719 july 15 1997 congressional action as it has in the past congress added substantial amounts for equipment earmarked for national guard and reserve forces 4 us general accounting office military readiness observations on personnel readiness in later deploying army divisions testimony of mark gebicke director of military operations and capabilities issues before the subcommittees on readiness and military personnel house committee on national security report tnsiad98126 mar 20 1998 crs16 major weapons programs disputes over major weapons programs almost always arise in congress this year issues include missile defense missile defense programs fall into two categories national missile defense nmd is designed to protect the united states itself against longrange missile attack theater missile defense tmd programs are designed to protect forward deployed us forces and allies from short or intermediaterange missile attack following the qdr the administration increased funding for nmd programs and the level of funding has become less contentious than in the past see table a3 for the funding request major policy disputes remain unresolved however the administration is pursuing plan to develop nmd technology while deferring decision to deploy system it also hopes that any system eventually deployed will allow the 1972 abm treaty perhaps with some amendments to survive missile defense advocates in congress however believe that threats to the united states warrant early deployment of nationwide defense and many believe the abm treaty is anachronistic disputes over tmd systems meanwhile continue key issues this year involve the theater high altitude area defense thaad system the navy theaterwide program and the medium extended range air defense system meads thaad and navy theaterwide are relatively longrange interceptor systems the administration has delayed thaad development because of test failures and for affordability reasons wants to delay procurement of the navy system until after thaad procurement is underway meads is cooperative program with european allies to provide an improved airmissile defense system for forward deployed troops congressional action in the past provisions to require deployment of nationwide defense have sometimes held up completion of defense authorization and appropriations bills as result for the past two years congress has considered though it has not passed separate legislation establishing missile defense policy this year the senate armed services committee again took this approach on april 24 it reported s 1873 srept 105175 the american missile protection act of 1998 calling for deployment of nationwide defense as soon as technically feasible on may 13 and again on september 9 however the senate failed to invoke cloture on the bill congress has also acted on tmd programs earlier in the year on march 30 the house approved hr 2786 the theater missile defense improvement act of 1998 that authorizes 147 million in additional funding in fy1998 for selected tmd programs and the fy1998 supplemental funding bill hr 3579 includes 179 million for tmd programs the housepassed version of the fy1999 authorization included some additional money for the navy area defense program and some other tmd systems the sasc version of the bill provided added funding for the navy theater wide program but reduced thaad slightly on may 12 however the thaad program suffered its fifth successive test failure and on may 14 the senate approved an amendment by senators thurmond and levin to trim another 2539 million from the program crs17 because engineering development will be delayed the senate committee version of the defense appropriations bill reflected this measure and also restructured the thaad demonstrationvalidation program on may 21 the full house approved committee amendment to restructure the thaad program it required dod to select an second contractor to compete with lockheedmartin on the program and it shifts 1427 million from engineering development to technology development sasc also cut meads funding from 43 to 10 million and required dod to study alternatives the senate appropriations bill follows suit neither hnsc sasc nor sac added money for nmd in action on related program sasc was critical of the air force advanced airborne laser abl program and cut funding by 97 million sasc also increased funding for spacebased laser rd by 94 million in pe 63731c bmd support technology the senate appropriations bill cut 57 million from the abl sac also added 10 million to the tmd budget for boost phase intercept technology in part as an alternative to thaad the congressional defense committees have all endorsed accelerated development of the navy theater wide tmd system budget additions range from 70 million in the house authorization bill to 150 million in the house defense appropriations bill the authorization conference cut thaad by 294 million and reduced meads by 19 million to 24 million it also prohibits further meads expenditures until meads funding is included in longterm defense budget plans finally the agreement follows the senate increases in the space based laser program and cuts the airborne laser by 57 million the appropriations conference agreement cuts thaad by 376 million reduces meads to 10 million and cuts the airborne laser by 25 million finally the fy1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes additional funding of 1 billion for missile defense with specific allocation of the funds indicated the b2 bomber in recent years some members of congress have proposed procurement of 9 more b2 bombers in addition to the 21 already financed with the house generally supporting more bombers and the senate opposed the annual compromise has been to provide enough money to keep production lines available and to study the issue some more in march an independent commission mandated by congress issued the latest b2 study it called for more bombers to be produced largely because of cost congressional action none of this years defense bills add money to procure more b2 bombers which may mark the end of the b2 battle hnsc added limited amount for b2 upgrades while sac cut some from the request new fighter aircraft three new fighter aircraft programs are in various stages of development and production the navy fa18ef multirole fighter the air force f22 air superiority fighter and the multiservice joint strike fighter jsf development program dod has requested fy1999 funding to buy 30 fa18ef aircraft to continue to develop the f22 and to procure the first two aircraft and to carry on jsf rd the qdr studied the three programs and decided to continued all of them though all were reduced some crs18 members of congress remain of the view that dod cannot afford to buy all three and that one should be canceled there have also been differences between the two houses on each of the programs the cost of the f22 has been major concern in the senate especially congressional action hnsc and hac reduced fa18ef procurement from the 30 aircraft requested to 27 but otherwise made changes in major tactical aircraft programs sasc included requirement that the f22 complete 10 of planned flight tests before funding for the next round of procurement is released this provision reflects concern about concurrent testing and production but the senate rejected bumpers amendment to the authorization bill to require 601 hours of flight testing before the next round of procurement the administration objected to the senate requirement the authorization conference included funds for 30 f18s as requested and allows flight test requirement for the f22 to be waived the appropriations conference also approved 30 f18s shipbuilding in recent years congress has added substantial amounts to shipbuilding programs generally by moving up planned ship purchases to avoid costly gaps in production congress has also ensured that major shipyards have enough work to cover overhead and development costs and to maintain trained employment levels one major issue carried over from last year concerns procurement of the cvn77 the last of the planned nimitzclass aircraft carriers the navy had until recently planned to buy dod has now moved up planned procurement of cvn77 to the fy2001 budget full funding had been planned in fy2002 this is an alternative to plan that the carrier shipbuilder newport news shipbuilding nns had proposed last year to provide accelerated advanced procurement funding nns had argued that its approach called smart buy would avoid gap in production and would therefore save the navy as much as 600 million on the price of the ship the new dod plan will not save as much but it also avoids big bill in fy1999 and fy2000 another longerterm issue concerns development of the next generation dd21 destroyer last year ingalls shipbuilding company of mississippi and bath iron works of maine agreed to team together in developing and building the ship the navy initially agreed to the teaming arrangement but then became concerned that competing team appeared to seek the contract most recently the navy has reached agreement with the ship builders and with combat system integrators for lockheedmartin and bath to form one team and raytheon and ingalls second to pursue competition in combat systems and design though both shipyards are guaranteed eventual production work also the navy has abandoned plans to develop an entirely newdesign aircraft carrier known as the cvx5 instead the navy will pursue incremental improvements in the next three nimitzclass carriers eventually leading to new design congressional action hnsc and subsequently the full house approved the administrations shipbuilding program largely intact including the 5 see robert holzer navy sinks futuristic carrier defense news may 2531 1998 p 4 crs19 administration request for funding for one new attack submarine nssn this marks the end of an ongoing debate in which hnsc has tried to mandate competition between newport news shipbuilding and general dynamics electric boat division to design different versions of the submarine sasc and sac also largely supported the shipbuilding request but added 50 million in advance procurement to buy new lhd7 class amphibious ship rather than overhaul older ships for the mission this addition has received some attention because the ships are built by ingalls shipbuilding company in senate majority leader trent lotts home state of mississippi the authorization conference agreement provides 50 million in lhd7 advance funds and the appropriations conference provides 45 million new issue arose following reports that the navy has decided not to pursue development of cleansheet design for the cvx the key issue is how money for carrier rd will be allocated for its part the navy wants to protect funding for cvn upgrades the senate appropriations committee however recommended 130 million reduction in funding for cvx rd and 50 million increase for cvn77 under program element pe 0603512n the committee also cut 357 million for cvx feasibility studies from pe 0603564n and recommended 5million increase to pe 0603564n to establish red team ie an independent study team to study futuristic aircraft carrier concept the house appropriations bill cut funding for the cvx by 100 million the authorization conference agreement provides 110 million for cvx rd and appropriations conference agreement provides 105 million other weapons issues the administration did not request funding in the fy1999 budget to purchase additional f16 aircraft congress has in the past supported continuing low level of procurement as means of keeping production lines going encouraging foreign sales and meeting air force requirements for attrition aircraft funding for the joint target attack radar system jstars aircraft was also be an issue the qdr recommended reducing the total planned procurement of jstars aircraft from 19 to 13 on the assumption that nato would agree to purchase 6 aircraft with alliance common funds nato did not decide to purchase jstars however so there was interest in congress in restoring the earlier plan congressional action the house authorization added 66 million to procure 2 f16s and also added advance procurement funds for 2 additional jstars aircraft the house also added substantial amounts for national guard and reserve equipment including 300 million in defensewide account and additional amounts for specific weapons programs the house also provided funds for 8 c130 cargo aircraft of various types dod had requested just one the house appropriations bill provided 60 million for two f16s advance procurement money for jstars 120 million for guard and reserve equipment and 461 million for 8 c130s sasc provided 72 million either for advance procurement or for termination costs for jstars pending dod report on its plans for the program and alternatives sasc also funded 4 additional c130s and crs20 added 60 million for guard and reserve procurement sac funded 3 additional c130s and provided 247 million for miscellaneous guard and reserve procurement6 c130j funding was particularly contentious issue rep obey offered an amendment in the hac markup to eliminate funds for 4 of the 8 aircraft in the subcommittee bill and to use the savings instead to restore fa18ef procurement to the requested level and upgrade 4 existing c130s he complained that increases in the c130j program were approved because the aircraft is built in georgia near the speakers district and that they come at the expense of more valuable programs such as the fa18ef the authorization conference agreement provides funds for 7 c130s 1 f16 advance procurement funds for jstars and 60 million for miscellaneous guard and reserve equipment in addition to funding in regular line items for equipment that will be supplied to the guard and reserve the appropriations conference agreement follows suit on c130s provides 36 million not 72 million for jstars advance procurement and provides 140 million in separate guard and reserve procurement account national defense panel recommendations the national defense panel was critical of planned procurement of weapons that it said will not be able to cope with future threats in the panels view the defense department should reduce or terminate legacy programs and instead pursue leapahead technologies including much lighter more easily deployable equipment for land forces longerrange fighter aircraft and ships with lower radar visibility the panel specifically criticized the army m1a2 tank upgrade crusader artillery and comanche helicopter programs the navy and air force fa 18ef and f22 programs and the navy cvn77 aircraft carrier some members of congress have echoed questions the panel raised about legacy systems but few have yet proposed specific program changes congressional action sasc approved measure to require quadrennial defense review at the beginning of each new administration to be preceded by recommendations on strategy from national defense panel sasc also criticized the armys crusader artillery program and ordered review of the program in light of the national defense panels argument the authorization conference agreement requires report on crusader sexual harassment genderintegrated training and other social issues social issues are frequently matters of debate on annual defense funding bills this year the main focus of discussion has been on the outcome of sexual harassment cases in the army and on the related issue of genderintegrated training in the services last year the administration appointed commission to review gender integrated training while congress established separate commission the administrationappointed commission headed by former senator nancy kassebaum baker made thirty recommendations aimed at improving recruitment and training the recommendations that received the most attention were to provide separate units 6 sac provided 500 million for national guard and reserve equipment of which 213 was earmarked for c130 aircraft and 40 million for c9 aircraft crs21 and separate barracks for men and women during basic training policy the marine corps but not the other services has followed7 in contrast longstanding defense advisory group on women in the military called the defense advisory committee on women in the services dacowits also studied the issue and disagreed with the kassebaum baker committees recommendation for greater gender separation in training secretary of defense cohen subsequently decided to leave it to each of the services to determine whether to make changes and none of the services has altered its policy the congressionallymandated commission has not yet completed its investigations congressional action the hnsc version of authorization bill included provision requiring the services to phase in separate units and separate barracks for men and women in basic training the rule in the house did not make in order any floor amendments to reverse the hnsc requirements so there was floor action on the issue in stark contrast sasc prohibited any steps to change current service practices until the congressionallymandated commission reports senator brownback proposed an amendment to the authorization bill to insert the house language but on june 24 the senate approved snowe substitute that would allow the services to follow current practices so the house and the senate were directly at odds on genderintegrated training hnsc also included provision requiring that the secretary of defense and the president display exemplary conduct as is required of uniformed commanders under current law8 the authorization conference agreement allows current unit training practices to continue but requires separation of sleeping quarters for men and women in basic training it also includes sense of the house statement urging separate training and another sense of the house statement to the effect that senior officials should be held to exemplary standards defense health care number of defense health care issues have been under continued discussion in recent years including the effectiveness of the dod program to provide health care for defense dependents through managed care system called tricare and health care benefits for military retirees congress is continuing to evaluate tricare and last year established demonstration program to test system known as medicare subvention in which medicare will pay the defense department for care provided to military retirees who are eligible for medicare benefits congressional action hnsc and sasc both took steps to ensure that military retirees will continue to have access to health care at defense facilities both established demonstration projects to test alternative means of providing health care to retirees the house also approved an amendment to test allowing military retirees access to the federal employee health benefits plan fehbp the authorization conference agreement includes three major demonstrations of 7 report of the federal advisory committee on genderintegrated training and related issues to the secretary of defense december 16 1997 the report is available electronically at httpwwwdefenselinkmilpubsgitindexhtml 8 section 507 of the fy1998 defense authorization act pl 10585 hr 1119 amended title 10 us code to extend requirement of exemplary conduct long applied to the navy and marine corps to include army and air force commanders crs22 means to provide continued health care to retirees including 1 test of allowing retirees to enroll in fehbp 2 provision of tricare benefits as supplement to medicare and 3 providing retirees with tricare pharmacy benefits medical research and development earmarks for several years defense appropriations bills have earmarked funds for various medical programs including bone marrow transplants breast cancer and prostate cancer research and other disease research none of these funds have been requested congressional action the senate version of the defense appropriations bill set aside 250 million for medical rd earmarks saying that the defense department should determine priorities among various programs this would restrict the amount available for such programs the full committee specified that funding should not be reduced below the fy1998 level for breast cancer and prostate cancer research the house bill in contrast included separate amounts for number of medical earmarks the appropriations conference agreement provides separate earmarked funds for number of medical programs including breast cancer and prostate cancer research and follows the senate approach on number of other programs year 2000 computer problems like other agencies and corporations the defense department faces potentially serious problem with its computers in adjusting to the turn of the century congressional action the house appropriations committee added 16 billion in emergency appropriations not counted against caps on defense and total discretionary spending to help the defense department fix its computers on the same day the committee also approved emergency funding for the same purpose for the treasury department in the full committee markup rep obey criticized this emergency funding as in effect an increase in the defense budget but neumann amendment to remove the money was rejected on june 19 however the house republican caucus decided not to provide money to fix the y2k problem as emergency appropriations and the rule on the defense appropriations bill approved on june 24 subsequently removed the 16 billion in emergency funding the issue of emergency funding for bosnia and y2k and of offsetting rescissions was then left to be addressed in separate supplemental appropriations bill and not in the defense appropriations measure the fy1999 omnibus appropriations bill provides 11 billion for the defense department for y2k conversion and an additional 24 billion for other agencies tritium production the defense authorization bill approves funding for department of energy weapons related activities as well as for department of defense activities the defense appropriations bill does not provide funds for doe however instead all doe funding is provided in the energy and water development appropriations bill key issue in the defense authorization bill this year concerns tritium production for department of energy nuclear weapons programs crs23 congressional action the housepassed authorization bill included measure that would prohibit the defense of energy doe from buying tritium for nuclear weapons from commercial nuclear reactor without this source of tritium doe will have to build new facilities to produce tritium in south carolina the congressional budget office has estimated that it will cost about 3 billion over the next forty years to buy tritium from commercial sources and 10 billion to buy it from new facilities the senatepassed authorization bill included provision specifically allowing doe to choose whichever longterm option it prefers this was major issue in the authorization conference the conference agreement allows doe to make the choice but prohibits implementing the plan for year allowing congress to review the decision next year senator kyl has reportedly put hold on the authorization conference report because he objects to this provision feeling that it is urgent for doe to

14 09 18 13 38 sources current year figures from office of management and budget deflators from dod comptroller the cuts in the defense budget over the past several years have been achieved mainly by reducing the size of the military force and by slowing the pace of weapons modernization under plans established by the quadrennial defense review released on may 19 1997 active duty endstrength will decline from 22 million in fy1987 to 136 million by fy2003 reduction of 36 funding for weapons acquisition has declined even more steeply the fy1999 budget requests 487 billion for weapons procurement and 361 billion for research development test and evaluation rdte adjusted for inflation proposed procurement funding is 65 below the level in fy1985 and the total for procurement plus rd is down by 54 the level of procurement funding is matter of ongoing debate key goal of the quadrennial defense review is to increase procurement funding over the next several years mainly by reducing defense civilian personnel levels and transferring the savings to weapons acquisition by fy2001 the administration projects 613 billion for procurement see table a2 in appendix to reach this level however depends on 1 achieving projected savings through reforms in defense business practices and 2 controlling the growth of operation and maintenance expenses see below for further discussion for detailed
