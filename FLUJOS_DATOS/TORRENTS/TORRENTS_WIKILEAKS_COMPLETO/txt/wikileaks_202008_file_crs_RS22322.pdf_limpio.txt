by replacing the contents of the housepassed bill with those of s 2020 an important part of both the house and senatepassed bills was the extension of numerous temporary taxreducing provisions that are scheduled to expire at various times over the next several years although most of these extenders were th same in both plans there were some differences including extension of the increased alternative minimum tax amt exemption contained in the senate proposal but not the house bill and reduced rates for capital gains and dividends which were in the house measure but not the senate plan aside from the extenders the senate bill contained number of additional items not in the house plan including tax incentives for development in areas affected by recent hurricanes both tax benefits and reforms related to charitable contributions and revenueraising items in the area of tax shelters and sewhere in addition on december 7 the house passed stand alon bills extending the increased amt

forthcoming legislation this report will be updated as gislative developments occurhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22322crs2 the figures in the budget resolution do not pl ace an absolute limit on the tax cuts congress can pass for fy2006 or subsequent ears for example the budget resolution itself called for tota l of 106 billi on in tax cuts over five years the same amount proposed by president bush in his fy2006 budg et proposal however the congressional budget resolution contains only 70 billion in its reconciliation inst ructions 11 billion for fy2006 tax cuts specified in the r econciliation instructions are protected from certain points of order under nate budget consideration rule s if point of order is raised supermajority is re quired for passage thus as practical matter the 70 billion fiveyear and 11 billion fy2006 reconc iliation figures may place constraint on the amount of tax cuts that are likely to be considered and may lead to tradeoffs between specific tax cuts or the adop tion of revenueraising offsets large number of extended provisions we re common to both the house and senate bills in most but not all cases the ex tensions carried through the end of 2006 some of the more prominent extensions in both bills were the alternative deduction for state and local sales taxes extended through 2006 in both measures the research and experimentation tax credit extended through 2006 in both measures the deduction for highereducation expenses extended through 2006 in the house proposal and 2009 in the senate plan the 15year depreciation recovery period for leas ehold improvements and restaurants extended through 2006 in both proposals the work opportunity and welfaretow ork tax credits extended through 2006 in both plans application of non refundable tax credits against the amt extended through 2006 in both proposals and the increased 100000 expensing tax benefit for small businessinvestment extended by both measures through 2009 two prominent extensions that differe d between the two proposals were the increased alternative minimum tax amt exclusion for individuals and reduced rates for capital gains and dividends the senate bill extended the amt exclusion for one year but did not extend the capital gains and dividend rate reductions the house bill extended the rate reductions for two years through 2010 but did not extend the amt exemption on december 7 however the house passed h r 4096 standalone bill extending the increased amt exemption due to the prominence of these two items some background information is useful the temporary tax cut for capital gains and di vidends was enacted by the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliati on act of 2003 jgtrra pl 10827 jgtrra reduced the tax rate on both capital gains and dividends to 15 5 for income in the 15 and 10 regularincome brackets with complete limination in 2008 however the reductions are temporary and are scheduled to expi re on january 1 2009 absent congressional action the capital gain s rate will revert to prior laws 20 rate 10 for income in the lowest brackets dividends will be taxed under the tax ra tes applicable to regular income which range from 10 to 35 but whic h are also scheduled to revert to 15 to 396 range in 2011 according to jct estima tes twoyear extension of the reducedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22322crs3 1 oneyear extension that was dropped by th finance committee would reduce revenue by an estimated 117 billion over five ears and 262 billion over 10 yearsrates for capital gains and dividends will reduce revenue by an estimated 204 billion over five years and 508 billion over 10 years1 the context of the amt exemptions extens ion is this individuals generally pay either their amt or regular tax whichever is higher taxpayers tentative amt is partly dependent on flat exemption amount specified by law th value of the exemption is subject to erosion due to inflation and the grow th of real income partly for this reason an increasing number of taxpayers are faced w ith the possibility of paying the amt rather than the regular tax beginning in 2001 cong ress enacted series of temporary increases in the exemption the most recent increas was provided by the working families tax relief act of 2004 pl 108121 under its terms the exemption is 58000 for couples and 40250 for individuals however the in crease expires at the end of 2005 and absent congressional action in 2006 the exem ption will revert to prior laws level of 45000 and 33750 for couples and i ndividuals respectively aside from the extenders the senate bill contained number of additional items not in the house bill these included number of tax cuts for areas affected by the recent hurricanes set of provisions applying to charitable contributions and number of revenueraising provisions the disasterrelated provisions we re generally more in the nature of development incentives for stricken areas than were the provisions of the katrina emergency tax relief act pl 10973 that congress enacted in september the earlier measure generally focused more on providing direct tax relief to individuals affected by the hurricanes pr oviding for example more generous rules for deducting casualty losses and set of tax benefits for charitable giving the senate bill would generally have extended ketras scope to include victims of hurricanes rita and wilma in addition it contained package of tax benefits for devel opment in the affected areas and included provisions such as bonus preciation for investment in the gulf area and increased lowincome housing tax credits on december 7 the house passed stand alone bill hr 4440 containing set of disa sterrelated tax benef its similar to those in the senate reconciliation package the di sasterrelated bill was approved by the senate and signed by the president becoming pl 109135 the charityrelated items in the senate bill included both tax benefits and revenue raising measures the tax cuts included proposal that would ve allowed taxfree withdrawals from iras if used for char itable purposes and provision to allow non itemizers to deduct charitable contributions in certain ci rcumstances the proposal however would also have instituted min imum floor amount below which deduction is not permitted for itemizers revenueraising items in the charitable area included provisions intended to curtail th involvement of taxexempt organizations in tax shelters and the doubling of certain fine s and penalties appli cable to charitable organizations in terms of revenue impact the largest of the revenueraising items was codification of the economic substance doctrine that is imed at suppressing co rporate tax shelters other

from the finance committee proposal the house bill was estimated to reduce revenue by 556 billion over five years 801 billion over 10 years and by 49 billion in fy20063 debate over reconciliation legislation focused in part on its specific provisions their fairness and their likely economic impact supporters of the tax cuts in general however in some cases cited philosophical reasons belief in low tax burdens in addition supporters linked the economys r ecovery from the 2001 recession to the tax cuts enacted in egtrra jgtrra and elsewhere arguing that the stimulus from the tax cuts helped make the slum p shorter and less severe than it otherwise would have been it was argued that continuation of those cuts many of which will expire without congressional action is important to sustain economic growth4 opponents of the tax cuts generally questioned the prudence of enac ting tax cuts in time of budget deficits and also tend to be skeptical of the tax cuts beneficial economic effects5
