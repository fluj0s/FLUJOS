aa200521103 executive summary between may and june 2005 oios conducted an audit of unons recreation centre in 1999 commercial operations had generated surplus funds which unon decided to use to provide facilities which would enhance the m orale of staff and hope fully attract m ore united nations personnel to nairobi nairobi was then experiencing recru itment problem following the bom bing in 1998 and an increase in security problem s coupled with infras tructure problem s that resulted in nairobi being categorized as c duty station after series of inhouse discussions decision was taken to build recreation centre on what was then viewed as undeve loped land adjacent to the perim eter fence of the gigiri com pound the construction took place betw een july 2003 and january 2005 at cost of approxim ately us2 m illion oios reviewed the ev ents leading up to and including construction of the recreation centre and concluded that there are num ber of lessons to be learnt from this to help strengthen the way com mercial operations it cou procurem ent section and building managem ent and transportation unit bmtu carry out construction and related works unon is actively addressing all of the issues ra ised and oios would like to thank unon for the prom pt attention being given to the issues discusse d below and for the constructive approach taken throughout the audit process document management to ensure that cou m aintains the appropriate level and type of docum entation to enable it to explain its actions to its own m anagem ent and other inte rested parties oios recom mended that unon review docum ent m anagem ent arrangem ents for cou decision to construct because there was insufficient docum entation to xplain both the rationale for deciding to build recreation centre and that the design m et the need s of potential clientele oios recom mended that cou com mission study on potential usage of existing f acilities over the next five to ten years and possible strategies for m eeting dem and funding the initial stages of the project were m arked by poor financial planning which was recognised and subsequently addressed w hile unon was able to demonstrate that there were sufficient funds available to pay for the project it was unable to dem onstrate value for m oney although oios recognised that im provem ents had been m ade thr ough the recent hiring of professional m anagem ent it recom mended that further focus should be placed on financial training to both m anagem ent and accounting staff in cou guidelines should be created and issued on the type and nature of financial planning which is required of cou for projects they undertake in addition oios felt there was scope to consider whether security funds earm arked for relocation of com mercial operations could be used for enhancing security of the recreation centre authority to construct in the absence of docum entation to explain whet her and in what circum stances unon had the authority for construction works in the gi giri com pound oios recom mended unon to seek clarification from united nations headquarters unhq on the delegated authority of director general dg unon with respect to the construction works location of the recreation centre oios established that the recreation centre was built on wetland in contravention of the ram sar convention w hilst unon had initiated com plete environm ental assessm ent for the entire united nations com plex in nairobi it was not clear whether this study would address how to rectify dam age to the existing wetland recom mendation has therefor been raised to ensure that this assessm ent extends to the wetland project management in the opinion of oios m any of the issues described in the report stem from failure to establish adequate project m anagem ent arrangem ents at the start of the project this was recognized and addressed but only at late stage although unon di d recruit staff with architectural and project managem ent experience oios is of the opinion th at additional training should be considered to enhance the project m anagem ent capability of bmtu and cou construction oios noted num ber of errors and om issions in th construction with total value of approxim ately us180000 which unon intends to recover from the contractor and oios has m ade recom mendations to assist unon track

cost of approxim ately us2 m illion the recreation centre is located next to the perim eter fence of the united nations com plex and includes the following an upper floor containing the m ain lobby

ent of the recreation centre was initially tendered based on the recom mendations of consultancy com pany to outs ource the daytoday running of the centre to managem ent com pany unon has since decided to proceed with m anagem ent of the recreation centre using its own resources f or the sporting f acilities and outsourcing the catering facilities 4 the findings and recom mendations contained in this draf t report were discussed with the staff responsible for the audited activities and the director division of adm inistrative services during exit m eetings and discussions held in august and septem ber 2005 their comments have been reflected in this draft report ii audit objectives 5 the overall objective of the audit was to provide the direct orgeneral dg unon with an assessm ent of the adequacy of the rrangem ents for building and running the recreation centre this included evaluating the adequacy effectiveness and efficiency of internal controls b evaluating whether adequate guidance and procedures were in place c determ ining the reliability and integrity of the f inancial data d reviewing com pliance with united nations regulations and rules and adm inistrative instructions assessing effectiveness and efficiency of arrangem ents for operations page 1 iii audit scope and methodology 6 the audit covered activities for the peri od january 1999 to june 2005 in nairobi and involved review and assessm ent of internal control system s interviews with staff analysis of applicable data review of the available docum ents and other relevant records 7 very little docum entation was availabl covering the period 2000 to 2002 thereby limiting oios scope for review and assessm ent of activities during this period as further discussed below iv audit findings and recommendations document management 8 the audit was delayed because of the abse nce of docum entation pertinent to the audit issues raised these problem s were m ostly the result of an absence of policies and procedures dealing with the level and type of docum entation that cou needed to keep on the work it performed oios views this as very serious weakness that lim its cous ability to explain its actions to its own m anagem ent and other interested parties poor docum entation also increases the risk of fraud through lack of transparency of actions carried out recommendation to ensure proper accountability fo r the work of the com mercial operations unit cou unon should re view cou inform ation needs and the arrangem ents for the classification stor age archiving and retention of their docum ents and records and ensure that all cou inform ation is adequately docum ented and centralized w ritten guidelines should also be issued to the staff to ensure uniform approach to inform ation classification and retention rec 01 9 unon accepted the recommendation and comme nted that it will initiate action to address it immediately oios thanks unon and will close the recom mendation upon notification of the outcom of the review exercise and subsequent action taken on cou inform ation needs and upon receipt and review of the written guidelines issued to the staff b feasibility 10 unon tasked the com mercial operations dvisory board coab in 1999 to advise it on how it m ight best use surplus com mercial funds to the benefit of all staff w hilst there was docum entary evidence to support that som analysis work was carried out as to how best to use the funds the docum entation was insufficient to enable oios to draw any conclusions about whether an adequate analysis had been perform ed and the recreation centre constructed was the best use of surplus funds it was also unc lear how the capacity of 600 people had been determ ined cou inf ormed oios that the si ze of facilities was determ ined by the available budget for construction and an analysis of potential usage and capacity of facilities was conducted as part of consultant review in septem ber 2004 which suggested that m embership capacity of 600 should be planned for and would m eet expected dem and this analysis focussed on self sustainability of the recreation centre and did not consider m inimum and m aximum page 2 potential users of each facility offered for exam ple the im pact of new office buildings was not considered recommendation to assist unon in planning for nd m anaging dem and for recreation centre facilities the com mercial operations unit cou should conduct study on potential usage of existing facilitie s over the next five to ten years and possible strategies for m eeting dem and rec 02 11 unon accepted the recommendation and comme nted that it will initiate action to address it immediately oios thanks unon and will close the recom mendation upon receipt and review of the outcom of the study and possible strategies for m eeting dem and c funding financial planning 12 whilst there was little evidence of form financial planning oios was pleased to note that cou had ensured that there were available funds to the cover expenditure of approxim ately us17 m illion incurred at the tim of the audit financial surplus at the start of the project was not accurately known in an audit carried out in septem ber 2000 oios had blished that the surplus figure was not accurate and needed to be revised co mmercial operations unit aa20002100304 this recom mendation was not closed until july 2005 and there was little evidence to explain on what basis unon deci ded that there were sufficient surplus funds to allow the project to start b funding strategy strategy to explain how the surplus would be used including consideration of how any additiona l surplus generated would be used to assist in funding the project did not m aterialise until 2002 and the strategy developed was never im plem ented c tracking expenditure against budget this was not considered until march 2002 when unon requested coab to prepare pla n indicating funds available projected incom balance projected running costs and how they were expected to be covered there was evidence that the plan was ever produced and there was docum entation dem onstrating that available funds would pay for the project d running costs there was evidence to show th at due consideration had been given to the cost of operating the recreation centre once it was constructed and whether the project would be selfsustainable or not 13 oios attributes these problem s to lack of ppropriate financial expertise for this type of planning within cou and unon unon m anagem ent during 2003 identified this failing and recruitm ent process was initiated to identif more com mercially f ocused m anagem ent new cou m anager was recruited in october 2004 the lack of project financial m anagem ent at the time means that unon cannot dem onstrate that the recreation centre as constructed represents best value for m oney page 3 recommendation to ensure proper project financia l planning is carried out unon should arrange for appropriate financial trai ning to be given to m anagem ent and accounting staf f in the com mercial op erations unit cou and guidelines should be created and issued on the type and nature of financial planning which is required of cou for projects they undertake rec 03 14 unon accepted the recommendation and comme nted that it will initiate action to address it immediately oios thanks unon and will close the recom mendation upon notification of appropriate financial training given and upon receipt and review of guidelines issued on financial planning b security considerations 15 at the request of the general asse mbly in decem ber 2003 unon undertook review of its com pliance with the headquarters mini mum operating security standards hmoss which included the location of com mercial opera tions the review indicated the need for relocating all com mercial operations outside th com pound perim eter by its resolution 59276 section xi of 23 decem ber 2004 the general assem bly approved funds for unon for the construction of new offsite building to accom modate unon com mercial operations cou informed oios that shatter proof film and an ectric fence had been installed at the recreation centre as per the hmoss requirem ents w hilst appreciating the work undertaken oios is of the opinion that further consideration of the secu rity aspects of the recreation centre should be made to determ ine whether any additional s ecurity funds earm arked for relocation of commercial operations could be used for the recreation centre recommendation unon should determ ine whether any f unds earm arked for relocation of commercial operations under ga reso lution 59276 section xi of 23 decem ber 2004 can be m ade available for paying for security m easures implem ented to ensure the recreation centre is secure and safe place for staff to use rec 04 16 unon accepted the recommendation and comme nted that it will initiate action to address it

approved the fac ilities currently im plem ented cou and the procurem ent travel and shipping section p tss further explained that the lack of docum entation explaining the basis f or the f acilities currently of fered by the recreation centre is attributed to undocum ented deliberations of th coab which were however included in the final term s of reference for the recreation centr the inform ation provided by cou indicates that the decision to construct on the current s ite and the f acilities constructed was based on the work of this com mittee 19 due to absence of this docum entation oios in not able to confirm that the constructed facilities m eet the needs of potential clientele and that the inform ation provided enabled unon managem ent to m ake an inform ed decision this issue

for the purpose of this conventi on wetlands are areas of m arsh fen peatland or water whether natural or artif icial perm anent or tem porary with water that is static or flowing fresh brackish or salt including areas of m arine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six m etres the ram sar convention has adopted classification of wetland type which includes 42 types grouped into three categories marine and coastal w etlands inland w etlands and hum anmade w etlands the recreation centr appears to have been built on wetland of the type covered by the ram sar convention and an incom plete analysis has been carried out as to the effect of this action and what steps should be taken to m itigate the effects 23 at the tim the decision was m ade to build on the wetland unon did not have any guidelines or procedures that required an envi ronm ental assessm ent prior to any building taking place on underdeveloped land within the com plex consequently environm ental im pact assessm ent was conducted or even consider ed and there was docum entation supporting whether this issue was raised by the united nationshabitat architects consulted in 2001 24 in march 2004 the local residents brought the issue to the attention of unon and prom pt action was taken to reque st uneps division of global environm ent facility dgef to undertake an environm ental im pact assessm ent wh ich concluded that the construction was on wetland and half the wetland had already been stroyed and the construction had affected the functioning of the rem aining wetland in co mpensation for the dam age already done unon created lagoon in the wetland to ensure constant supply of water however the environm ental impact assessm ent focused on hydrogeology of th wetland and did not look at the im pact on biodiversity it is therefore not known how the construction has im pacted on the biological species for which the wetland serves as unique habitat in addition considering the extent of developm ent as of april 2004 dgef m ade recom mendations on possible m itigation m easures impacting the rem aining wetlands som of these recom mendations were im plem ented including the om ission of security patrol road s initially designed to be constructed on the wetland and developm ent of an underground drainage system to direct surface water from the facilities and neighbouring facilities to the wetlands however som recom mendations were not im plem ented because of the advanced stage of construction 25 unon m anagem ent has recognised the lack of adequate environm ental assessm ent

of the project coab was assigned responsibility for oversight which it carri ed out in consultation with the buildings managem ent and transportation unit bmtu in their official capacity as unons buildings managers however unon did not have inhouse technical expertise to advise on the construction of such project until the appointm ent of an inhouse architect in october 2003 one seem s to have recognised at the outset the dangers of not having technically qualified project m anager accountable for delivery and res ponsible for ensuring the efficient m anagem ent and planning of resources following the recru itment of an inhouse com mercial m anagem ent expert in october 2004 unon did ppoint cou as the project m anager but this was at the point of finalising construction and approving
