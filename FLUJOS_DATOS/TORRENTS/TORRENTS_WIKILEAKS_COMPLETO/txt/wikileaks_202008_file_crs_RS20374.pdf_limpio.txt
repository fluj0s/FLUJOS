code rs20374 october 25 1999 awards of attorneys fees to small businesses and labor organizations that prevail against the nlrb or osha hr 1987 106th congress henry cohen legislative attorney american law division summary hr 1987 106th congress the fair access to indemnity and reimbursement fair act which was reported by the committee on education and the workforce on october 14 1999 would make it easier for small businesses and labor organizations that prevail against the nlrb or osha in administrative or court proceedings to recover their attorneys fees from the government it would do so by requiring fees to be awarded automatically in cases to which it applied instead of only when the governments position was not substantially justified hr 1987 106th congress the fair access to indemnity and reimbursement fair act was reported by the committee on education and the workforce on october 14 1999 the committee report hrept 106385 states that its purpose is to assist small businesses and labor organizations in defending themselves against government bureaucracy by providing for the reimbursement of attorneys fees and expenses to certain prevailing small employers the legislation is intended to help prevent spurious lawsuits and ensure that employers of modest means have an incentive to adequately represent themselves against the national labor relations board nlrb and the occupational safety and health administration osha the bill would amend the national labor relations act nlra and the occupational safety and health act osha so that each would provide that if an employer or in the case of the nlra labor organization prevails in an adversary adjudication conducted by the nlrb or osha or prevails in civil action including proceedings for judicial review of agency action brought by or against the nlrb or in the case of osha the secretary of labor then the employer or labor organization shall be awarded fees and other expenses as prevailing party under the equal access to justice act eaja 5 usc 504 28 usc 2412d but without regard to whether the position of the board or in the case of osha the secretary of labor was substantiallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20374crs2 justified or special circumstances make an award unjust this entitlement to an award of fees and other expenses would apply however only to employers or labor organizations that had not more than 100 employees and net worth of not more than 7000000 at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated to understand hr 1987 one must have some background in the law of attorneys fees awards and eaja the general rule in the united states known as the american rule is that each party to lawsuit pays its own legal fees and that federal court ordinarily may not order the losing party to pay the winning partys attorneys fees unless statute authorizes it to do so congress however has enacted numerous feeshifting provisions that authorize federal courts to order the losing party to lawsuit to pay the prevailing partys attorneys fees see awards of attorneys fees by federal courts and federal agencies crs rept 94970 eaja is one of these provisions most feeshifting provisions are parts of particular statutes and apply only to suits brought under those statutes for example title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 includes feeshifting provision that authorizes courts to award attorneys fees to parties who prevail in lawsuits filed under title vii 42 usc 2000e5k eaja however is not part of any other statute it provides that in adversary adjudications before federal agencies and in civil actions including proceedings for judicial review of agency action brought by or against the united states under statute that does not have its own feeshifting provision the agency or court shall award fees to party who prevails against the united states the agency or court may not award fees however if the united states proves that even though it lost the proceeding its position was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust the agency or court may also not award fees if the prevailing party is an individual whose net worth exceeded 2000000 at the time the adversary adjudication or civil action was filed or is business or association with more than 500 employees or net worth of not more than 7000000 at the time the adversary adjudication or civil action was filed furthermore although most feeshifting provisions authorize court to award reasonable fees eaja imposes cap of 125 per hour unless the agency or court determines that an increase in the cost of living or special factor such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved justifies higher fee comparing hr 1987 with eaja reveals that under the bill fees could be awarded in the same types of proceedings as under eaja adversary adjudications and civil actions including proceedings for judicial review of agency action and as fees under hr 1987 would be awarded under and in accordance with eaja the 125 per hour cap as well as other features of eaja not mentioned above would apply the differences between the bill and eaja are two first an employer or labor organizat ion with not more than 100 employees and net worth of not more than 7000000 could recover fees under hr 1987 without regard to whether the position of the government was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust this is significant because under eaja the substantially justified exception means that even in most cases it loses the united states does not have to pay attorneys fees under hr 1987 by contrast fee award to party with not more than 100 employees and net worth of not more than 7000000 that prevailed against the unitedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20374crs3 states would apparently be automatic as the bill provides that fees shall be awarded and provides exceptions and the committee report states that fees would automatically be allowed second employers and labor organizations with between 101 and 500 employees could not recover under the bill whereas they may recover under eaja if they have net worth of not more than 7000000 the committee report indicates the intention that the employeeeligibility limit be mere 20 percent of the current 500 employee limit for employers under the eaja if the bill is enacted employers and labor organizations with between 101 and 500 employees presumably could continue to recover fees under eaja with its substantially justified exception hr 1987 does not state this explicitly but it does not seem intended to eliminate existing rights of employers and labor organizations that it does not benefit the rationale for the fair act the committee report states is that government agencies the size of the nlrb and osha wellstaffed with numerous lawyers should more carefully evaluate the merits of case before bringing it against small business which is illequipped to defend itself against an opponent with such superior expertise and resources furthermore small businesses have been victimized by relatively frivolous lawsuits by these agencies but have been unable to fight cases to their conclusions based on the merits due to lack of resources and have had to settle the case under current law small businesses and unions who have prevailed against the nlrb or the osha may use the equal access to justice act unfortunately the eaja is not often utilized against the nlrb or the osha and has proven ineffective agencies have easily met the substantially justified burden of proof because courts have interpreted the burden to actually be one of reasonable basis in law and fact given the low burden before the nlrb and the osha and sine an eaja claim itself can be as costly as the underlying action not many eaja claims are being filed with either agency the minority views that accompany the committee report argue the majority failed to provide any evidence whatsoever that the board or osha have abused their statutory authority in issuing and prosecuting complaints the majority has also failed to show that the equal access to justice act provides insufficient redress to respondents who prevail in proceedings before the nlrb and osha review commission hr 1987 is blatant attempt to chill the boards and oshas exercise of statutory responsibility to enforce the nlra and the osh act by penalizing these agencies for every instance in which they attempt to do so unsuccessfully instead of encouraging cooperation between employers and the two agencies hr 1987 would actually encourage defendants to litigate matters with the nlrb and osha resulting in fewer settlements lengthier litigation and ultimately delaying compliance with the nlra and osh act enactment of hr 1987 would put the safety and health of thousands of workers at risk and deny workers the right to organize in order to secure higher pay greater benefits and job protectionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20374
