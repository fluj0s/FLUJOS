development among industry universities and the federal rd establishment this is evident in legislation creating technology transfer mechanisms as well as in support for two extramural programs of the national institute of standards and technology nist the advanced technology program atp which provided seed funding matched by private sector investment to companies or consortia for the development of generic technologies that have broad application across industrial sectors and the manufacturing extension partnership mep which offers technical assistance to small and mediumsized firms through regional centers in conjunction with state or local governme nt universities or the private sector the presidents fy2008 budget proposed significant decrease in support for manufacturing extension to 463 million and did not include funding for tp the final appropriations legislation pl 110161 provides mep with 896 million and replaces tp with new initiative the technology innovation program tip which is funded at 652 million with an additional 5 million from fy2007 tp unobligated balances pl 11069 the america competes act authorizes funding for nist programs through fy2010 and creates various new activities within the laboratory the administrations original fy2009 budget request proposed funding mep at 4 million to terminate federal support for the program and provided financing for tip on june 6 2008 the president submitted series of amendments to his budget one of which reduced the amount for the mep program to 2 million the fy2009 appropriations bill ordered reported from the house committee on appropriations would finance mep at 112 million while support for tip would total 652 million s 3182 as reported by the senate committee on appropriations provides 110 million for manufacturing extension and 65 million for tip several bills introduced in the current congress are consistent with parts of the american competitiveness initiative announced by the president in the 2006 state of the union address that proposed several innovationrelated activities including increased basic research funding making permanent the research and experimentation tax credit which was extended through the end of 2007 by pl 109432 and improved math and science education s 833 the competitiveness through education technology and enterprise act of 2007 would make the research tax credit permanent as does hr 2133 hr 2138 hr 2734 hr 3907 hr 5105 hr 5681 and s 2209 s 41 the research competitiveness act of 2007 and hr 1712 the research and development tax credit act of 2007 also make the research credit permanent and create tax exempt facility bonds for the development of research park facilities among other things hr 6049 as passed by the house and s 2552 would extend the research credit through the end of 2008 s 592 and s 2884 extend it through the end of 2012 s 1373 and hr 4250 provide grants and loan guarantees for the development and construction of science parks

over competition from foreign firms the us congress has increasingly looked for ways the federal government can stimulate technological innovation in the private sector this technological advancement is critical in that it contributes to economic growth and long term increases in our standard of living new technologies can create new industries and new jobs expand the types and geographic distribution of services and reduce production costs by making more efficient use of resources the development and application of technology also plays major role in determining patterns of in ternational trade by affecting the comparative advantages of industrial sectors since technological progress is not necessarily determined by economic conditions it can have effects on trade independent of shifts in macroeconomic factors that may affect the marketplace joint ventures are an attempt to facilitate technological advancement within the industrial community academia industry and government can play complementary roles in technology development while opponents argue that cooperative ventures stifle competition proponents assert that they are designed to accommodate the strengths and responsibilities of these sectors collaborative projects attempt to utilize and integrate what the participants do best and to direct these efforts toward the goal of generating new goods processes and services for the marketplace they allow for shared costs shared risks shared facilities and shared expertise the lexicon of current cooperative activity covers various different institutional and legal arrangements these ventures might include industryindustry joint projects involving the creation of new entity to undertake research the reassignment of researchers to new effort andor hiring new personnel collaborative industryuniversity efforts may revolve around activities in which industry supports centers sometimes crossdisciplinary for research at universities funds individual research projects andor exchanges personnel cooperative activities with the federal government might include projects that use federal facilities and researchers federal funding for industryindustry or industryuniversity efforts or financial support for centers of excellence at universities to which the private sector has access there are many different types of cooperative arrangements the flexibility associated with this concept can allow for the development of institutional and organizational plans tailored to the specific needs of the particular project issues of patent ownership disclosure of information licensing and antitrust are to be resolved on an individual basis within the general guidelines established by law governing joint ventures collaborative ventures can be structured either horizontally or vertically the former involves efforts in which companies work together to perform research and then use the results of this research within their individual organizations the latter involves activities where researchers producers and users work together both approaches are seen as ways to address some of the perceived obstacles to the competitiveness of american firms in the marketplace g12g152g146g151g157g561g11g151g141g158g156g157g155g146g138g149g561g20g142g156g142g138g155g140g145g561 traditionally the federal government has funded research and development to meet mission requirements in areas where the government is the primary user of the results andor where there is an identified need for rd not being performed in the private sector most government support is for basic research which is often longterm and highly risky for individual companies yet

can revolutionize the marketplace studies have shown that inventions based on rd are the more important ones however the societal benefits of research tend to be greater than those that can be captured by the firm performing the work thus the rationale for federal funding of research in industry the major emphasis of legislative activity has been on augmenting research in the industrial community this focus is reflected in efforts to encourage companies to undertake cooperative research arrangements and expand the opportunities available for increases in research activities collaboration permits work to be done which is too expensive for one company to fund and also allows for rd that crosses traditional boundaries of expertise and experience joint venture makes use of existing and supports development of new resources facilities knowledge and skills the concentration on increased research as prelude to increased technological advancement was based upon the pipeline model of innovation this process was understood to be series of distinct steps from an idea through product development engineering testing and commercialization to marketable product process or service thus increases at the beginning of the pipelinein researchwere expected to result in analogous increases in innovation at the end however this model is longer considered valid innovation is rarely linear process and new technologies and techniques often occur that do not require basic or applied research or development most innovations are actually incr emental improvements to existing products and processes in some areas particularly biotechnology research is closer to commercial product than this conception would indicate in others the differentiation between basic and applied research is artificial the critical factor is the commercialization of the technology economic benefits accrue only when technology or tech nique is brought to the marketplace where it can be sold to generate income andor applied to increase productivity in the recent past it was increasingly common to find that foreign companies were commercializing the results of us funded research at faster pace than american firms in the rapidly changing technological environment the speed at which product process or service is brought to the marketplace is often crucial factor in its competitiveness the recognition that more than research needs to be done has lead to other approaches at cooperative efforts aimed at expediting the commercialization of the results of the american rd endeavor these include industryuniversity joint activities use of the federal laboratory system by industry and industry industry development efforts where manufacturers suppliers and users work together

important mechanism intended to facilitate technological innovation traditionally universities perform much of the basic research integral to certain technological advancements they are generally able to undertake fundamental research because it is part of the educational process and because they do not have to produce for the marketplace the risks attached to work in this setting are fewer than those in industry where companies must earn profits universities also educate and train the scientists engineers and managers employed by companies academic institutions do not have the commercialization capacity available in industry and necessary to translate the results of research into products and processes that can be sold in the marketplace thus if the work performed in the academic environment is to be integrated into goods and services mechanism to link the two sectors must be available prior to world war ii

universities this financial support helped shape priorities and build relationships however after the war the federal government supplanted industry as the major financial contributor and became the principal determinant of the type and direction of the re search performed in academic institutions this situation resulted in disconnect between the university and industrial communities because industry and not the government is responsible for commercialization the difficulties in moving an idea from the research stage to marketable product or process appear to have been compounded efforts to encourage increased collaboration between the academic and industrial sectors might be expected to augment the contribution of both parties to technological advancement company support for research within the university provides additional funds and information on the concerns and direction of industry for many companies access to expertise and facilities outside of the firm expands or complements available internal resources yet such cooperation should not necessarily be seen as panacea oftentimes collaborative ventures fail because of various factors including conflicting goals differing research cultures and financial disagreements

extensive facilities expertise knowledge and new technologies with partners in cooperative venture in certain cases the government laboratories have scientists and engineers with experience and skills as well as equipment not available elsewhere the government also has vested interest in technology development it does not have the mandate or resources to manufacture goods but has stake in the availability of products and processes to meet mission requirements in addi tion technological advancement contributes to the economic growth vital to the health and security of the nation collaboration between government laboratories and industry is not however just one way street in several technological areas particularly electronics and computer software the private sector is more advanced in technologies important to the national defense and welfare of this country interaction with industry offers federal scientists and engineers valuable information to be used within the government rd enterprise g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g11g151g146g157g146g138g157g146g159g142g156g561g146g151g561g5g152g152g153g142g155g138g157g146g159g142g561g20g493g6g561 the cooperative venture concept is not new in the early 1970s the national science foundation established its industryuniversity cooperative research centers program the electric power research institute research organization supported by the electric power utilities has been in operation since 1973 in the private sector the microelectronics and computer technology corporation mcc which performs research for its member firms and the semiconductor research corporation src which funds research in universities were created in the early 1980s the difference today is the number of projects and the scope of legislative activity designed to promote cooperative ventures faced with pressures from foreign competition the governments interest appears to be expanding beyond that of funding rd to meeting other critical national needs including the economic growth that flows from new commercialization in the private sector while acknowledging that the commercialization of technology is the responsibility of the business

to stimulate innovation and technological advancement in industry these activities often involve the removal of barriers to technology development in the private sector thereby permitting market forces to operate and the provision of incentives to encourage increased innovation related efforts in industry cooperative rd efforts are part of both these trends the national cooperative research act pl 98462 is designed to encourage companies to undertake joint research which is typically longterm risky and often too expensive for one company to finance this legislation clarifies the antitrust laws and requires that the rule of reason standard be applied in determinations of violations of these laws that cooperative research ventures are not to be judged illegal per it also eliminates treble damage awards for those research ventures found in violation of the antitrust laws if prior disclosure as defined in the law has been made in addition pl 98462 makes some changes in the way attorney fee awards are made to discourage frivolous litig ation against joint research ventures without simultaneously discouraging suits of plaintiffs with valid claims between 1985 when the law went into effect and 2003 over 900 joint ventures have filed with the justice department 1 pl 10342 the national cooperative production amendments act of 1993 amends the national cooperative research act by among other things extending the original laws provisions to joint manufacturing ventures these provisions are only applicable however to cooperative production when the principal manufacturing facilities are located in the united states or its territories and each person who controls any party to such venture is united states person or foreign person from country whose law accords antitrust treatment less favorable to united states persons than to such countrys domestic persons with respect to participation in joint ventures for production the omnibus trade and

operation of the new activity funding under tip is limited to small and mediumsized businesses whereas grants under tp were available to companies regardless of size in the advanced technology program joint ventures were required to include two separately owned forprofit firms and could include universities government laboratories and other research establishments as participants in the project but not as recipients of the grant under tip joint venture may involve two separately owned forpro fit companies but may also be comprised of one small or mediumsized firm and university single company was able to receive up to 2 million for up to three years under tp under tip the participating company which must be small or mediumsized business may receive up to 3 million for up to three years in atp small and mediumsized companies were not required to cost share large firms provided 60 of the total cost of the project while in tip there is 50 cost sharing requirement which again only applies to the small and mediumsized businesses that are eligible there were funding limits for the fiveyear funding available for joint ventures under tp the tip limits joint venture funding to 9 million for up to five years the advisory board that was created to assist in the advanced technology program included industry representatives as well as federal government personnel and representatives from

direct and indirect federal support for expanded cooperative work leading to commercialization however given current concerns over the federal budget it is unlikely that large sums of government money will be forthcoming for such efforts in the future yet other actions may reflect federal interest in the process of technological advancement the use of the extensive government rd system with its expensive stateoftheart facilities can provide both academia and industry with resources that may be beyond their financial ability and despite the often shortterm focus of budget decisions federal funds and nonmonetary contributions to cooperative ventures may be leveraged by contributions from state and local agencies and the private sector if the proliferation of programs is any indication state and local jurisdictions have been in the forefront of cooperative endeavors many state and local economic development activities focus on increasing innovation and the use of technology in the private sector instead of competing for companies to relocate many of these jurisdictions now see additional benefits accruing from the creation of new firms and the modernization of existing ones through the application of new technology various states and localities are attempting to foster an entrepreneurial climate by undertaking the development and support of variety of programs to assist existing high technology businesses to promote the establishment of new companies and to facilitate the use of new technologies and processes in traditional industries while these efforts vary by state and locality many of them include industryuniversitygovernment cooperation several congressional proposals for increasing cooperative ventures built upon existing state and local activities in these areas for additional discussion see crs report 96958 technology development federalstate issues out of print contact the author wendy h schacht for copies 2027077066 and crs report 98859 state technology development strategies the role of high tech clusters by wendy h schacht proponents of cooperative work argue that certain be nefits are associated with joint ventures the increased popularity of this concept and expanding federal support for this approach however might suggest some questions be raised to assess whether cooperative ventures are meeting expectations are there drawbacks to this effort in general and in specific instances are cooperative projects addressing the problems associated with the competitiveness of us industry are they moving technology development in the right direction it might be expected that an increasing number of industries andor companies will come to the federal government for assistance in supporting cooperative rd activities despite opposition by some to what has been described as picki ng winners or losers various sectors of the government have chosen to provide funding for cooperative ventures in specific industries while requiring that the private sector generate matching funds at the same time there are programs and policies that attempt to facilitate cooperative efforts across industry in general decisions might need to be made whether one approach is better than the other or if both should continue if part of government policy is to respond to individual industry requests for assistance congress may opt to consider developing procedures to select between industries andor companies competing for limited federal funds can and should federal guidelines be established in addition is it possible to determine at this time what type of cooperative ventures are the most effective and efficient is there in fact one best model or should each venture be tailored to the specific situation and finally what are the implications of these decisions for policymaking in congress

without developing through these steps in fact most innovations are actually incremental changes in existing goods and services in response to unmet market needs the most crucial factor is the availability or use of the technology or technique in the marketplace in the recent past the commercialization and diffusion of products and processes often stood out as significant problems in terms of the ability of us industries to compete firms in several other countries particularly japan and the east asian newly industrializing countries have been successful in commercializing the results of rd in various instances this was research initially performed in the united states as evidenced by the vcr and semiconductor chips basic research and the pursuit of science are done successfully in the united states as indicated in part by the number of nobel prizes awarded to americans however excellence in science does not necessarily assure leadership in world markets it has been noted that the united states was the worlds premiere economic power in the 1920s when this nation was far from being in the forefront of science instead market leadership is significantly affected by the development and application of technology to make the goods and services the consumers want to purchase thus questions may be raised as to whether programs and policies encouraging increased cooperative research without concomitant efforts to facilitate the development and commercialization of technologies and techniques can be effective mechanisms to increase the competitiveness of american industry do we ne ed to know more about how to encourage the application of the research resulting from joint ventures in the manufacture of products and processes and in the delivery of services do these cooperative activities include mechanisms to facilitate the effective and timely transfer of the results back to the companies where they can be developed into goods for the marketplace since the major portion of the costs associated with bringing out new product occur at the development and marketing stages not in the research phase should there be additional government incentives to encourage companies to spend funds for commercialization in addition to research g15g138g151g158g143g138g140g157g158g155g146g151g144g561 it is in the manufacturing arena where american companies appear to be the most vulnerable to foreign competition process technologies those used in manufacturing can significantly lower the costs of production and increase the quality of goods and services in global competition the presidents commission on industrial competitiveness under former president reagan concluded that competitive success in many industries today is as much matter of mastering the most advanced manufacturing processes as it is in pioneering new products the costs associated with the development and purchase of new manufacturing equipment are high this is particularly true for the 350000 small companies which make up major segment of the manufacturing community several of the cooperative efforts supported by the federal government address these manufacturing concerns the manufacturing technology program of the department of defense the advanced manufacturing initiatives in the department of energy and the manufacturing extension centers

activities devoted to facilitating the development of new manufacturing techniques and their use in industry enacted in the current congress pl 11069 authorizes new program of partnerships between industry and other educational or research institutions to develop new manufacturing processes techniques or materials in addition manufactu ring fellowship program would be created with stipends available for postdoctoral work at nist these activities differ from the established mep effort where new manufacturing research is conducted as existing manufacturing technology is applied to the needs of small and mediumsized firms considering the importance of manufacturing the existing cooperative programs may not be sufficient to increase the competitiveness of american industry are there more effective types of joint ventures cooperative efforts where resources could be pooled and the equipment shared may be one way to improve the manufacturing capability of us firms large or small

many of the industries interested in cooperative ventures with federal financial support have approached the department of defense and to lesser extent the department of energys defense programs because these agencies have the greatest amount of available resources andor funding they also tend to have the expertise to operate largescale programs and maintain close ties with certain industrial sectors which could be encouraged to increase cooperation in addition both dod and doe have vested interest in the availability of certain technologies which could be provided by healthy domestic commercial market however questions remain whether sponsorship of certain cooperative ventures by dod and the department of energys defenserelated programs will lead to increased commercialization in the civilian marketplace critics argue that defense spending is not an effective mechanism to increase industrys ability to innovate and develop new technologies much of the research and development in the defense arena may be too specialized overdesigned andor too costly to have value for commercial markets the rd also tends to concentrate on weapon systems and other defense hardware rather than on process technologies that are often necessary to improve manufacturing productivity one reason cited for the competitive problems of the machine tool industry was its focus on defense needs rather than on the commercial market which is larger in the aggregate on the other hand the us commitment to military rd has contributed to favorable balance of trade in the defense and aerospace industries in the sematech effort the purpose of dod support was to facilitate the commercial development of technologies with critical defense applications the companies involved in sema tech were experienced semiconductor manufacturers and were knowledgeable about the markets needs and operations thus although the initial work performed by this semiconductor consortium may have been partially funded by the defense advanced research project agency it was designed to result in new products and processes in the civilian marketplace where both defense and commercial demand can be met sematech now operates without direct federal financing the issue of cooperative work between the defense department and the private sector leading to commercial technologies was addressed in the former technology reinvestment project and was

technical information what is critical to competitiveness is the speed at which this knowledge is used to make products processes and services for the marketplace however it appears that many foreign firms are willing and able to take the results of research performed both in the united states and their own countries and rapidly make high quality commercial goods many of these companies are purchasing american businesses or establishing us subsidiaries to access american expertise with the increased activity in research consortia particularly those with federal support questions might be asked as to whether or not foreign companies should or could be barred from access to the results larger issue is how to define an american company is it determined by majority ownership manufacturing location value added to the us economy or by some other definition in addition since technology is most effectively transferred by persontoperson interaction would cooperative activities between american industry and foreign firms produce an outflow of information which could be used to increase competitive pressures

and direct federal funding indirect measures include such things as tax policies intellectual property rights and antitrust laws that create incentives for the private sector other initiatives include government financing on cost shared basis of joint efforts such as the advanced technology program and manufacturing extension partnerships in the past participants in the legislative process generally did not make definite or exclusionary choices between these two approaches however these activities were revisited in the 104 th congress given apparent republican preferences for the funding of basic research and not technology development for example efforts to eliminate the advanced technology program funding for flat panel displays and agricultural extension reflected concern over the role of government in developing commercial technologies and generally resulted in reductions of direct federal financing for such public private partnerships issues were again raised in subsequent congresses although relevant ongoing program was terminated until fy2008 when tp was replaced by the technology innovation program as the 110 th congress continues to make budget decisions
