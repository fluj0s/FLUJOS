of the six republics of the new socialist federal republic of yugoslavia led by communist partisan leader josip broz tito with the collapse of communism in eastern europe croatia and the other republics of yugoslavia held their first multiparty elections in 1990 the nationalist croatian democratic union hdz headed by franjo tudjman won the majority of votes and parliamentary seats croatia pushed for facto independent croatia within congressional research service the library of congress crs2 confederation with other yugoslav republics but was rebuffed by serbia croatia held referendum on sovereignty on may 19 1991 the referendum was approved by over 90 of those voting many ethnic serbs in croatia abstained croatia along with neighboring slovenia declared independence on june 25 1991 local serb insurgents and the yugoslav army seized about onethird of croatia mostly areas in which serbs formed majority or plurality of the population with the goal of uniting these areas with serbia the outgunned croats agreed to the deployment of peacekeeping force in december 1991 to separate the two sides but used the respite to build up their forces in may and august 1995 croatia unleashed its revamped army against the serbheld regions of western slavonia and krajina respectively brushing aside forces and killing several peacekeepers bosnian serb forces and serbiamontenegro did not come to the aid of local serb forces which were quickly crushed each offensive triggered massive exodus of serbs from the conquered areas emptying them of most of their population serbs attempting to return to their homes were attacked by croat mobs or had their houses burned far from stopping the attacks croatian authorities moved croat refugees from other regions into abandoned housing after the offensives the final serb held area eastern slavonia agreed to be reincorporated in croatia without bloodshed after twoyear transitional period under administration croatia assumed full control of the region in january 1998 political situation from 1990 until 1999 croatia was led by president franjo tudjman and his nationalist croatian democratic union hdz tudjmans successes in securing croatias independence and restoring croatias control over its territory made him popular with many croats he won reelection as president in 1992 and 1997 by large margins according to the 1999 state department report on human rights practices tudjmans regime while nominally democracy had strong authoritarian elements opposition parties and media were harassed and official media slavishly praised the regime election laws were manipulated to the hdzs advantage government cronies were given control of lucrative privatized businesses the popularity of the regime began to wane in the late 1990s as croatias independence appeared secure and the economic situation in the country deteriorated croats were also angered by rampant highlevel hdz corruption and cronyism moreover many croats appeared to feel that tudjmans autocratic highly nationalist regime was increasingly inappropriate for their country which they wanted to become normal european state this shift in public sentiment caused sea change in croatian politics when tudjman died in december 1999 after long bout with cancer in january 2000 the hdz suffered crushing defeat in parliamentary elections an opposition coalition led by the former communist centerleft social democratic party sdp and the centerright croatian social liberal party hsls won 71 of the 151 seats in the lower house of the croatian parliament the sdphsls coalition then formed majority with grouping of four smaller centerright opposition parties the croatian peasant party hss the croatian peoples party hns the istrian democratic assembly ids and liberal party which won 24 seats the hdz won 46 seats the new majority formed government headed by sdp leader ivica racan crs3 the parliamentary election was followed by presidential elections in late january and early february 2000 croatian voters again demonstrated their desire for change in surprise result to many observers stipe mesic former hdz leader who broke with tudjman in 1994 over tudjmans support of croat hardliners in bosniahercegovina won 42 of the vote hsls leader drazen budisa finished second with 28 hdz moderate mate granic finished third with 22 in runoff vote between the two leading candidates mesic beat budisa handily 56 to 44 both mesic and budisa campaigned on pledge to break with the authoritarian excesses of the tudjman regime and support croatias integration into europe however observers say voters appeared to prefer mesics humorous downtoearth style sharp contrast with tudjmans aloof and many detractors said pompous manner the new government has attempted to dismantle many of the most unpopular aspects of the tudjman regime shortly after taking office president mesic released watergate style tapes from recording system tudjman had installed in his office although many of the most damaging tapes had reportedly been destroyed before mesic took office the ones that remained painted sordid picture of cynicism and corruption that further blackened the reputation of the former regime in november 2000 with the support of president mesic the croatian parliament amended the constitution to reduce the vast powers of the croatian presidency the government has also tried to reform media laws to make them more democratic and to prosecute corruption cases against the previous regime including against tudjmans daughter but has not been able to make rapid progress economy in 1993 croatia embarked on an ambitious macroeconomic stabilization program that cut inflation from 1517 in 1993 to an estimated 36 in 1997 it also stabilized croatias currency the kuna which was introduced in may 1994 after years of decline due to the effects of war and economic mismanagement gross domestic product declined nearly 60 between 1989 and 1994 the economy began to recover croatia embarked on voucher privatization program which turned most small and midsize firms over to private owners mainly company management and employees the privatization of several large strategic enterprises in such areas as telecommunications banking and energy has been slower the tudjman government handed over control of many key firms to regime cronies some regimelinked businessmen mismanaged their firms and stolen large sums from them many companies are heavily indebted and lack the capital needed for restructuring bad debts to enterprises led to the collapse of several banks key factor in the defeat of the hdz in the januaryfebruary 2000 elections was the deterioration of croatias economy since coming into power the new government has cut spending especially defense spending and subsidies to the bosnian croat military and reduced taxes it has maintained the previous governments stress on price and exchange rate stability economic growth has resumed gross domestic product increased by 35 in 2000 however unemployment remains high at 154 in 2000 and living standards have not shown dramatic improvement as yet which has contributed to decline in the governments popularity in 2000 croatia joined the world trade organization in vote of confidence in its policies croatia received 250 million standby loan from the international monetary fund in march 2001 crs4 foreign policy during the tudjman era croatias relations with western countries were often difficult tudjmans authoritarianism and nationalism often put him at odds with western objectives on the other hand tudjman viewed his country as part of the west and sometimes made grudging concessions in an effort to gain acceptance aid and to head off possible sanctions western officials demanded more respect for democracy and human rights in croatia they called for real progress in returning serbs refugees to their homes western countries also demanded that croatia cooperate fully with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty one particular area of dispute between western countries and croatia was the wests demand that croatia compel its croat allies in bosniahercegovina implement the dayton peace accords dpa croatia provided large amounts of material aid advice and personnel for bosnian croat military forces during the bosnian war and continued to do so after the war critics charged that while providing lip service to the dpas goal of an integrated bosnia tudjman had built client state within state in hopes of one day breaking it away from bosnia and merging it with croatia the new croatian government has stressed that its main foreign policy goal is integration into western institutions the new government has vowed to bring greater democracy to croatia including reforming media laws the new government has pledged to allow all serb refugees to return to their homes progress on this issue has been modest only about 80000 of the 300000 serb refugees or displaced persons have returned to their homes in part due to the lack of an administrative and legal framework to permit refugees to quickly regain possession of their property in february 2001 president mesic said that croatia has cut off all funding to the bosnian croat military analysts note that tudjmans support for croat separatism in bosniahercegovina was largely due to the presence of hercegovina croats among his senior advisors and cronies the policy had little real support among most croats in croatia croatias new leaders say that croatia does not want special relationship with croatmajority areas of bosnia but would like good relationship with unified bosnia in marchmay 2001 bosnian croat hardliners attempted to secede from the federation of bosniahercegovina one of the two semiautonomous entities within bosnia the effort failed in part due to the firm opposition of croatia and the international community the new government has cooperated more closely with the icty than the tudjman regime in march 2000 the new government turned over indicted bosnian croat war criminal mladen tuta naletilic to the icty despite public outrage in croatia against 45year sentence handed down few days earlier by the court against bosnian croat military leader tihomir blaskic in september 2000 the croatian government arrested five croats for war crimes against serbs during the war in croatia in february 2001 mirko norac former croatian general was arrested by croatian authorities on war crimes charges against serb civilians in croatia in 1991 in april 2001 icty investigators exhumed the bodies of serb civilians killed by croatian forces in krajina in 1995 croatian and icty investigations of war crimes committed in croatia have created tensions within croatias military civilian population and in the tribunals relations with the croatian government croatian leaders have expressed fears that the icty could indict commanders of croatias successful military campaign to retake serbheld regions of croatia in 1995 while most croats have little wish to shield bosnian croat war criminals or those who committed individual atrocities in croatia the vast majority of croats crs5 strongly support the war of independence from yugoslavia and object to prosecutions of senior officers that could bring their victory into disrepute western officials applauded the new government as hopeful sign for croatia and the region in sign of their support croatia was admitted to natos partnership for peace program in may 2000 croatias longterm goal is to join nato in may 2001 croatia joined the visegrad group of 9 now 10 central european aspirants to nato membership croatia wants to join as soon as possible natos
