library of congress president bushs proposed medicareendorsed drug discount card initiative status and issues summary on july 12 2001 president bush announced medicareendorsed prescription drug discount card program to help seniors lower their outofpocket drug costs the president stated that the discount card program would be an interim measure until broader medicare prescription drug benefit for seniors can be created many seniors do not have adequate prescription drug coverage in 1998 an estimated 10 million elderly people or 27 of medicare beneficiaries did not have any form of prescription drug coverage the administration planned to implement the card program in january 2002 but it was put on hold because of federal court order pharmacy groups successfully filed lawsuit against cms in 2001 asking federal court to issue an injunction that would halt the card program on the grounds that the administration had statutory authority to establish the program the administration proceeded with plans to modify the program and use formal rulemaking process for new proposal on august 30 2002 cms issued the final rule pharmacies continued to claim that the administration lacked the statutory authority to implement the initiative on january 29 2003 federal district court ruled that the administration did not have the statutory authority to offer the card program cms issued statement saying that it would be evaluating its options and it would likely appeal in the 108th congress representative mark foley introduced bill hr 513 in the house on january 31 2003 to authorize the secretary of health and human services to endorse prescription drug discount cards for use by medicare beneficiaries the proposed card program would be similar to prescription drug discount card programs that are currently available from number of sources the administrations card would endorse and promote number of qualified privatelyadministered prescription drug discount card plans which would have onetime maximum enrollment rate of 25 per plan since the announcement of president bushs proposal several pharmaceutical companies have implemented their own senior discount card plans for lowincome seniors beginning in early 2002 the administration has stated that the medicareendorsed card plans would offer discounts in the range of 10 to 13 and up to 15 on retail prescription drug prices the net overall effects of president bushs proposed program would depend on the details of the individual card plans which are not yet available congressional critics of president bushs proposal dispute the administrations estimates of potential discounts some members of congress believe that the card program would not provide additional benefits for seniors they cite recent study by the us general accounting office gao on prescription drug discount prices available at retail pharmacies internet pharmacies and existing drug discount card programs the members

prescription drug discount card program to help medicare beneficiaries reduce their outofpocket drug costs the president stated that the discount card program was an interim measure that would precede broader medicare reform measures including prescription drug benefit for seniors medicare does not cover most outpatient prescription drugs most seniors have some form of supplementary health insurance to cover expenses not met by medicare however many of these plans do not offer drug coverage or offer limited protection for drug expenses1 the presidents card program is controversial and immediately prompted criticism from the retail pharmacy industry from some members of congress and from some consumer groups critics of the plan have argued that the plan would not bring additional benefits for seniors and that retail pharmacies would bear the burden of prescription drug cost reductions for seniors shortly after the card initiative was announced in 2001 pharmacy groups successfully filed lawsuit against cms asking federal court to issue an injunction that would halt the card program on the grounds that the administration had statutory authority to establish the program the administration proceeded with plans to modify the program and used formal rulemaking process for new proposal on march 6 2002 cms issued proposed rule for the card program with 60day comment period on august 30 2002 cms issued the final rule although pharmacies continued to assert that the administration lacked the authority to implement the initiative cms proceeded with the program on january 8 2003 cms formally solicited applications from parties interested in offering medicare prescription drug discount cards applications were due on march 7 2003 on january 29 2003

report rl30819 medicare prescription drug coverage for beneficiaries background and issues by jennifer osullivan crs2 various options cms has including likely appeal2 the bush administration has stated that it would include prescription drug coverage in its plan to revise medicare but it is unclear whether the prescription drug discount card would be included in the administrations proposal in the 108th congress legislation has been introduced hr 513 to authorize the secretary of health and human services to endorse prescription drug discount cards for use by medicare beneficiaries currently many private companies and membership organizations offer prescription discount cards for seniors the medicare discount card program would allow private companies to develop discount card plans for beneficiaries and apply for medicare endorsement of their plans the presidents proposed program would in most respects be similar to these other plans the major difference is that the discount cards offered under the presidents plan would be medicareendorsed and would provide consumers with comparative information on the formularies and prices offered within the card program another key difference is that beneficiaries could have only one medicareendorsed card plan this report will discuss prescription drug coverage gaps for seniors private sector discount card programs the discount card program the president originally proposed in july and the key differences in the final regulation issued in august 2002 implementation issues of the program as well as asserted benefits and limitations will also be explored this report will be updated as events warrant gaps in senior prescription drug coverage in 1998 an estimated 10 million elderly people or 27 of medicare beneficiaries did not have any form of prescription drug coverage the remaining 28 million medicare beneficiaries had some form of drug coverage for at least part of the year however coverage is not always stable and access to drug benefits for seniors is declining3 medicare beneficiaries are among the highest users of prescription drugs they represent 14 of the total us population and account for 43 of the nations total drug expenditures4 with national spending on prescription drugs rising medicare beneficiaries face increasing challenges in being able to pay for their prescription drug needs although most medicare beneficiaries have some form of prescription drug coverage they still pay portion of their total drug expenses out of pocket in 1998 beneficiaries with coverage paid approximately 33 of their total drug expenses out of pocket average outofpocket drug expenditures for beneficiaries with coverage was 325 in 1998 while expenditures for those without coverage was 546 for those in poor health the outofpocket expenditures for uncovered beneficiaries averaged 820 according to the 1998 medicare current beneficiary survey 2 centers for medicare and medicaid services

outofpocket expenditures for covered beneficiaries increased by almost 18 percent while beneficiaries with coverage had change in expenses5 existing commercial prescription discount card programs prescription drug discount cards are widely available through some private companies and membership organizations such as aarp formerly the american association of retired persons these companies have set up buying clubs that offer savings on prescription drugs and other medical services to attract consumers looking for better price on these items the companies vary from internet mail order service companies to pharmacy benefit managers pbms that offer discount card services such as merckmedco and the aarp member choice program provided through the united health group incorporated with mail order prescriptions filled by express scripts card plans usually require an annual membership fee that can range from 15 to 50 per year and offer discount cards that are accepted by network of drugstores andor doctors6 the plans offer discount to card holders on their prescription drug purchases at retail pharmacies since the announcement of president bushs proposal several pharmaceutical companies formed their own senior discount card plans in early 2002 some of these plans are described in the section below titled senior discount card plans how prescription drug discount card programs work card sponsors arrange network of retail pharmacies that will participate in the program and offer discounts to card holders the retail pharmacies in the network agree to accept the card sponsors reimbursement rate this reimbursement rate is often lower than what retail pharmacies charge cashpaying customers who have healthcare coverage pharmacies generally accept the lower price agreed to in the program because belonging to the program network results in larger volume of business however the lower prices accepted by the pharmacies may result in lower prescription drug revenues for the store the operators of card programs typically control the costs of prescription drug benefit by developing formularies7 formulary is list of drugs that the card sponsor generates to provide the higher benefits to participating members at reduced cost in deciding which drugs to include in the formulary the card sponsor determines which drugs are most costeffective to include in the list discount card programs generally use restricted formularies patients may obtain discounts only on 5 ibid pp 8182 6 the new york times buyers clubs for medical services crop up by milt freudenheim aug 25 2000 7 for more information on formulary development see crs report rl30754 pharmacy benefit managers by christopher j sroka crs4 the drugs included in the formulary offered by the card program and must pay full price for the drugs not included in the cards formulary private discount card programs are similar to other drug benefit programs such as those offered by private health insurance plans in that they generally develop formularies by consulting with an independent pharmacy and therapeutics pt committee number of drugs may be used to treat certain condition or disease such drugs are said to be therapeutically equivalent or belonging to the same therapeutic category formulary does not always include every drug in given therapeutic category but usually includes at least one brandname drug per category the pt committee evaluates the safety efficacy substitutability and cost of therapeutically equivalent drugs the members of the committees and the decision making process vary by healthcare plan but most often include physicians pharmacists medical directors andor health plan staff members some larger drug benefit sponsors however do not allow their staff to participate in pt committees because of potential conflict of interest some health plans say that they emphasize outcomes in choosing formulary drugs while others look more at clinical comparability bioequivalency and cost8 formularies allow card providers to contain the cost of prescription drugs primarily through manufacturer rebates and retail pharmacy discounts drug manufacturers give rebates to the card providers to increase market share andor utilization if manufacturers products are included in the formulary the manufacturer expects the use of its drugs to increase the amount of the rebate offered by manufacturer to sponsor varies by plan these rebates vary significantly across the industry and there is reliable data to suggest the size of such rebates the rebates effectively lower the net prices that the benefit sponsor must pay for the prescription drugs its members use retail pharmacies provide discounts in order to gain access to card plan members in addition to retail pharmacy discounts many card programs offer mail order services to their members mail order pharmacies operate at lower costs than traditional retail pharmacies and tend to be less expensive for the card sponsor some card sponsors encourage their members to use the mail order pharmacy by offering lower prices through the mail order service than are available at retail pharmacies some card sponsors perform drug utilization review dur to evaluate whether patient was prescribed the proper dosage whether the patient is getting the appropriate dosage or if prescriptions are being refilled too frequently dur also screens prescriptions for drugs that may be inappropriate for the patient for dangerous drug interactions for duplicate prescriptions for the overuse of controlled substances and for fraud and abuse actions resulting from incidents uncovered through dur may result in the card sponsor sending educational material to the physician or pharmacist or in dropping coverage for the patient 8 managed care getting serious about formularies by jean lawrence march 1998 crs5 discount card plans for lowincome seniors in 2002 number of pharmaceutical companies started offering

through one card the pharmacies announced that the card will allow seniors to access multiple manufacturer discount and subsidy programs using only one card at the pharmacy of their choice14 this card program is different from the others in that it is open to all drug manufacturers and community pharmacies for participation the pharmaceutical companies issuing the cards stated that they developed the cards to assist seniors who do not have prescription drug coverage while prescription drug benefit is added to medicare critics of these card discount programs argue that the pharmaceutical companies are trying to deflect public pressure away from the rising costs of prescription drugs and attempting to switch consumers to products manufactured by these companies they claim the companies efforts are only marketing tool and would not lower prices15 retail pharmacies have been critical of discount card programs offered by drug manufacturers arguing that discounts come entirely from reductions in the prices charged by pharmacies and not from the manufacturers16 12 eli lilly fact sheets lillyanswers undated for more information see httpwwwlillyanswerscomquestions_answershtml 13

centers for medicare and medicaid services cms on august 30 2002 and published in the federal register on september 4 200217 it is not known when or if the program will be implemented because federal district court ruled on january 29 2003 that the administration did not have the authority to implement the card initiative the administration has said it is likely to appeal the courts decision if the administration decides to appeal the case the outcome of the appeal would determine whether or not the initiative will be implemented the administration may also move forward with the initiative if congress grants legal authority to hhs to implement the program on january 31 2003 representative mark foley introduced bill hr 513 in the house to authorize hhs to endorse prescription drug discount cards for use by medicare beneficiaries this section describes general features of the drug card initiative description of how the program would be administered details of the final rule establishing the initiative and pharmacy participation in the card programs general features of drug card initiative the medicareendorsed card initiative would be voluntary program that is in many respects modeled on existing plans offered by private companies membership associations and pharmacy benefit managers the primary objective of the proposal is to provide medicare beneficiaries immediate prescription drug benefits at discounted prices in his original proposal president bush emphasized that the initiative would be an interim measure and that it was not intended to be substitute for broader medicare prescription drug benefit the drug card initiative would authorize medicare to endorse number of qualified privatelyadministered prescription drug discount cards for medicare beneficiaries each card would offer discounts from the retail prices of certain prescription drugs the card program would be different from existing plans in that consortium of card sponsors would be required to provide participants with comparative information on prices and formularies this would provide medicare beneficiaries with one central source of information to compare features of all medicareendorsed cards including drugspecific discounted prices pharmacy networks enrollment fees and other drug services in addition the card sponsors would be required to follow certain guidelines provided by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the office responsible for administering the program medicare beneficiaries would be allowed to participate in only one medicare endorsed card program at time but could change plans on semiannual basis cms stated that multiple enrollments could weaken the negotiating leverage of each company offering card plans which could lead to lower rebates from drug 17 federal register 42 cfr part 403 medicare program medicareendorsed prescription drug card assistance initiative final rule vol 67 171 september 4 2002 crs8 manufacturers and therefore lower discounts to card holders medicare beneficiaries could enroll in other discount card plans that are not medicare endorsed cms expects to endorse 15 card sponsors if the drug card initiative is implemented it is unknown whether the program would use existing discount cards or create new card programs that qualify for endorsement by medicare18 program administration as outlined president bushs drug discount card initiative would be managed by cms but in general would entail limited government involvement the governments role would mainly consist of providing medicare beneficiaries with information on the card program and facilitating access to the private companies that offer medicareendorsed discount cards cms oversight would consist of certification of card providers based on criteria that would include membership thresholds pharmacy network thresholds and inclusion of all drug classes in the discount program cms has stated that it expects most of the funding for the program to come from the consortium of card providers and that the federal administrative costs would be small the federal administrative costs for the program would be funded through the cms budget upon implementation of the program cms would provide detailed information on each endorsed discount card program to medicare beneficiaries the information provided by cms would include descriptive information on the endorsed discount cards through the medicare website and general information by telephone on the medicare tollfree line cms would promote the cards to beneficiary and consumer groups health care providers states and other interested groups final rule for medicare drug card initiative the final rule for the medicareendorsed prescription

endorsement would be required to submit an application and meet all the requirements outlined in the final regulations19 the final federal proposal includes an effort to coordinate with state programs by proposing that states could partner with private drug card program sponsors by selecting medicareendorsed card program offering its own endorsement and 18 on the original proposal cms received 28 applications from private entities for medicareendorsement of their proposed discount card plans but details of the individual card programs were released 19 for detailed information on requirements

stated that the proposed rule for the card could significantly reduce profit margins of many pharmacies noting that the financial impact analysis conducted by cms was incomplete21 pharmacy groups issued comment saying cms should withdraw the proposed rule pharmacies asserted that the discount card program would hurt pharmacy profits and that cms lacked the statutory authority to implement the plan key differences between proposed and final rule cms announced that in response to comments received during the public comment period the final regulation differs from the proposed regulation published on march 6 2002 in several respects some key differences include the following22 enhanced information on drug prices including information about generic alternatives and other endorsed card

generic drugs the experience requirements changed from five years to three years and from managing two million lives in national pharmacy benefit or drug discount card program to managing one million lives changes to the qualifying criteria would provide increased opportunities for pharmacy and other organizations to offer medicareendorsed card programs endorsed card sponsors would be allowed to offer two program designs providing beneficiaries more choice endorsed card sponsors would have to ensure stable drug formularies and prices they would not be able to increase drug prices or change drugs from their formulary for periods of at least 60 days beginning on the first day of the programs operation new privacy requirements for medicare card sponsors would improve privacy protection for beneficiaries endorsed card sponsors would be required to align their privacy protections with privacy standards under hipaa including the final changes in the recently announced update of those privacy standards 21 bna daily report for executives sba interest groups seek changes in medicare discount card proposal may 9 2002 22 cms media release cms news hhs issues final regulation on medicareendorsed prescription drug card initiative august 30 2002 crs12 pharmacy participation retail pharmacies participating in medicareendorsed card programs would agree to belong to network of pharmacies arranged by the card sponsor on volunteer basis most pharmacies already belong to one or more networks organized by pbms as part of the agreement with the card sponsor retail pharmacies would accept negotiated reimbursement rate from the card sponsor the reimbursement rate could be lower than the usual price the pharmacy charges for drug and possibly result in lower profit margins for the pharmacy however the proposals promoters have noted that pharmacies typically agree to join card networks because they gain access to the large number of members belonging to the card plan which would be expected to increase their customer base and sales volume pharmacies not electing to join network arranged by card sponsors risk losing customers23 expected discounts from card initiative diverse estimates the potential savings provided by the program are expected to come from the market leverage that card sponsors obtain from the formulary and pharmacy network and also from the education attributes of the program24 the educational aspect consisting of the informational material on drug prices formulary content and the pharmacy network offered by the card program is intended to improve the ability of consumers to comparison shop and choose the plan that meets their needs at the lowest cost cms has estimated that seniors would be able to obtain 10 to 13 and possibly up to 15 discount on prescription drug retail purchases through the medicareendorsed card program fact sheet issued by cms states that it projects that the first year of the program would provide medicare beneficiaries between 12 and 16 billion savings on their prescription drug purchases some observers have commented that the administrations proposed discount program would probably provide seniors with at least some savings on their overall prescription drug bill questions have been raised about the actual size of the discounts that would be available specific information is not available on the discount amounts and formularies the potential card sponsors would offer the actual size of retail discounts may not be known until after the first year of program operation while it is possible to compare prices available through existing discount card programs to those at individual retail pharmacies or internet pharmacies one of the constraining factors in conducting this kind of analysis is the lack of widely available data on retail drug prices 23 pricewaterhousecoopersllp study of pharmaceutical benefit management hcfa contract 5009703990097 june 2001 see pp 5758 for discussion of how pharmacy networks are created by pbms 24 cms fact sheet medicareendorsed prescription drug card assistance initiative available on the cms website httpcmshhsgov crs13 the us general accounting office gao completed study in 2002 on prescription drug prices for seniors offered by drug discount card programs local pharmacies or over the internet25 the study included surveys on prices available from five companies that administer large drug discount card programs five internet pharmacies and several retail pharmacies in four different geographic areas washington dc chicago seattle and rural georgia prices listed in the study show that the discounts on brand name drugs offered by the card programs ranged from 6 to 32 on the average retail pharmacy prices the average size of the discount on all drugs was about 12 the internet pharmacy prices on the gao survey varied in some cases the internet prices were up to 19 higher than those available by discount card programs while for other drugs the prices were up to 12 lower the internet pharmacy prices were consistently lower than retail pharmacy prices the retail pharmacy prices obtained by gao demonstrated that prices may vary considerably in different geographic regions for example the average price for 30day supply of 10mg tablets of lipitor was 13 higher in rural georgia than in seattle washington26 critics of president bushs program have disputed past statements made by the administration of potential discounts of up to 25 more recent announcements by cms have stated that discounts would probably be within the range of 10 to13 and possibly up to 1527 retail pharmacy groups consumer groups and some members of congress believe that the program is not likely to produce significant savings for seniors some members of congress argue that based on their interpretation of data collected by gao existing discount card programs do not work and provide more than 10 savings on retail prices28 they have stated that the bush proposal would not offer greater discounts for seniors than those already available in the market in letter to the us department of health and human services hhs six members of congress state that medicare discount card program is unlikely to provide significant discounts on brand name drugs for seniors they cite the price study by gao and say that the study indicates that seniors already have access to drug discount cards and that these programs offer little savings for seniors for commonly used brand name drugs they believe that the findings of the gao price study indicate that unless the proposed medicare discount card program requires significant discount from the drug manufacturers that is passed on to seniors the program would not provide additional benefits for seniors29 25 general accounting office report gao02280r prescription drugs prices available through discount cards and from other sources december 5 2001 26 ibid p 4 27

administration arguments in support of discount card program president bush has emphasized that the discount card program would not be substitute for new prescription drug benefit provision under medicare the discount program was intended to be an interim solution that would provide some immediate cost relief for seniors while other options were under consideration cms highlighted several key elements that the administration believes would make the medicareendorsed cards better than the current discount cards currently available in the market30 the first is that the exclusive enrollment feature combined with the formulary pharmacy network and informational attributes of the programs would provide the card sponsors and their members with the necessary market clout to obtain larger rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers and pass the rebate to the consumer31 cms has said that the market has shown that discount cards can obtain manufacturer rebates but that these programs do not always pass the rebate back to the consumer the administration believes that because the medicareendorsed card initiative would require that card sponsors pass the rebate to the pharmacy and the consumer medicare beneficiaries could obtain larger discounts than those in currently available card programs because the membership in the medicare endorsed programs would consist entirely of seniors and some disabled persons it seems likely that the medicare card program could provide card sponsors with some market leverage in negotiating discounts with the drug manufacturers on the most commonly prescribed senior drugs however information is publicly available on the amount of the proposed discounts or rebates nor on the amount of the rebates that would be passed on to medicare beneficiaries second the administration believes that the comparative price information feature of the medicareendorsed card proposal would benefit seniors in that they would have access to comparative price formulary and pharmacy network information on the various card programs and choose the best plan for their needs discount program participants would be able to switch from one card program to another at 6month intervals although this could result in additional onetime per plan enrollment fees of up to 25 the informational feature is potentially one of the most valuable features of the presidents discount program because it would provide single source of information on drug prices formularies and pharmacy networks of all medicare endorsed discount card programs some existing card programs individually provide information on prices and formularies but information on competing programs is not available in one easily accessible location for the many seniors who do not have 29 continued httpwwwhousegovreformmininves_prescripindexhtm 30 cms fact sheet pp 34 31 ibid crs15 access to computer or the internet however published information would continue to be the most important vehicle for ensuring that program participants realize the informational benefits of the program the success of this aspect of the program would depend on the final details of the individual card programs and how well the companies manage the consortium and provide customer service for easy access to price and pharmacy network information the publication of drug price information could eventually put pressure on pharmaceutical manufacturers pharmacies andor card sponsors to match lower prices offered by competitors although this could result in additional savings for seniors the retail pharmacy industry believes that pharmacies would face reduced profit margins if they were pressured to reduce prices without change in what they pay the wholesalers or drug manufacturers for the drugs while the latter two groups would benefit at the pharmacists expense although the final rule requires that portion of the pharmaceutical rebates or discounts be provided to beneficiaries either directly or indirectly through pharmacies the pharmacies argue that the rule does not specify the amount of the discount that should go to pharmacies another factor to consider is whether the card sponsor plans under the proposed medicare program include drug utilization review dur to determine whether patients are using therapeutically equivalent drugs patients sometimes use drugs prescribed by different doctors to treat the same condition and are not aware of it dur may prevent the duplicative use of drugs that fall within the same therapeutic category thereby enhancing patient safety while lowering prescription drug costs dur can also identify harmful drug interactions that may occur when patient with more than one medical condition treats those conditions with drugs that when taken together are harmful the third item mentioned by cms is that the medicare drug card initiative would require card sponsors to offer broad access to retail pharmacies and only offer mailorder services as an option some existing drug card programs offer only mail order services and do not include retail pharmacy network in their plan the medicare initiative would not endorse these types of plans pharmacy associations assert that while mailorder card programs may provide lower prescription drugs prices these programs do not provide seniors with the personal help they may need from community pharmacists pharmacy associations have also argued that the medicare drug card initiative could be an incentive for medicare beneficiaries to shift their prescription drug purchases from retail pharmacies to mailorder services and that this would come at cost to retail pharmacies cms has stated that the network pharmacy requirement in the medicare drug card proposal would ensure that medicare beneficiaries continue to purchase their drugs from retail pharmacies the final point mentioned by cms is that medicareendorsed card sponsors would be expected to provide clear and reliable educational information services to medicare beneficiaries such as pharmacy counseling generic substitution and dur programs to monitor and prevent drugdrug interactions cms believes that this feature would assist seniors and people with disabilities select quality discount card crs16 program32 as mentioned earlier the informational aspects of the medicare initiative could be valuable in helping seniors lower their drug costs by choosing the card program most appropriate for their needs much however would depend on the quality of service that card sponsors provide because the drug discount card initiative is intended only for medicare beneficiaries features of the program such as customer service marketing material and included drugs would be geared toward medicare beneficiaries the card program it is argued could result in more coordination among companies offering card discount programs and cms which could improve the service and information seniors receive when shopping for their prescription drugs consortium of card sponsors could lead to an improvement of marketing materials and drug price information for seniors however because details of the card programs that would be proposed are not known at this time it is difficult to assess how much of an improvement there would be over existing drug card programs pharmacists challenge to medicare discount card program procedural objections on july 17 2001 the national association of chain drug stores nacds and the ncpa as plaintiffs filed suit in the federal district court for the district of columbia against department of health and human services hhs secretary tommy thompson and the cms administrator tom scully to block the administrations original prescription discount card initiative on july 26 2001 the nacdsncpa asked the court to issue an injunction preventing the bush administration from proceeding with the discount card initiative on the grounds that among other arguments the administration exceeded the statutory authority granted to it by the social security act and that the administration failed to comply with the procedural requirements of the administrative procedure act on september 6 2001 us district court judge paul friedman issued an injunction stating that the pharmacy groups had substantial likelihood of success in winning their case on two grounds that the administration did not have the legal authority to establish the program and that it had not followed the proper rulemaking process33 on october 9 2001 the administration asked the court for stay of the proceedings to allow it to use the formal rulemaking process for new medicare discount card proposal that could be different from the original one announced in july on november 5 2001 judge friedman issued stay of the proceedings to allow hhs to submit its proposed policy for notice and comment pursuant to the administrative procedure act34 at later date the judge stated that the stay of 32 cms fact sheet p

proceeded with the rulemaking process in late 2001 although cms administrator thomas scully acknowledged that the new prescription drug plan would need approval from federal judge or be approved by

final regulation on september 4 2002 on september 13 2002 the department of justice doj filed motion with the us district court for the district of columbia to require pharmacy groups to tell the court by september 20 whether they plan to proceed with the case against cms and the department of health and human services to halt the program doj asked that all motions in the case be filed by october 28 200235 on september 27 2002 pharmacies responded to this motion by rejecting the federal governments schedule for filing motions in the case and suggested their own schedule in which they would file motion to enforce the existing injunction in the case on january 29 2003 judge paul friedman held that the nacd demonstrated it had standing to show pharmacies would suffer economic harm from the medicare discount card initiative judge friedman rejected the argument by hhs secretary thompson that the federal government had the authority to implement the card program under the medicare beneficiary assistance act of 199036 on the day of the ruling cms administrator tom scully announced that cms would be evaluating its options and continue to work with congress to help strengthen medicare and push for comprehensive prescription drug benefit he also stated that the courts decision hastened the course of likely appeal37 economic objections in addition to the procedural issues that the pharmacy associations successfully raised they also criticized president bushs medicare discount card program on economic grounds the coalition of pharmacy organizations which represents all segments of pharmacy practice issued letter on july 11 2001 to president bush opposing any form of prescription discount cards38 the pharmacy associations argue 34 continued discount drug cards

pharmacist owners managers and employees united to continued crs18 that discount card programs put the burden of cost reductions for seniors on the retail pharmacies they say that the card programs do not reduce the prices that pharmacies pay for medications and claim that providing discounts will disproportionately reduce net profits of pharmacies vis vis card sponsors and drug manufactures the final regulation of the medicare drug card initiative is different from the original proposal in that card sponsors would be required to have contractual arrangements with drug manufacturers for rebates or discounts and contractual mechanism for passing on the bulk of the rebates or discounts that are not required to fund operating costs to beneficiaries or pharmacies either through lower prices or enhanced pharmacy services however pharmacies remain concerned that the revised initiative would harm their profits because although the card initiative requires card sponsors to pass discounts to beneficiaries it does not stipulate how much of those savings should be given to seniors39 the associations estimate that the price pharmacy pays for the medications represents about 78 percent of the average prescription price the remaining 22 percent represents gross margins and after accounting for operating expenses results in net profit of only 2 percent the pharmacies also claim that the proposal could limit seniors access to the pharmacy of their choice and that price incentives would encourage the use of mail order pharmacies resulting in an underutilization of lower cost generic drugs40 they argue that the formularies used by the card plans would not always include generic equivalents of brand name drugs and therefore promote the use of brand name drugs it is difficult to assess the statements made by the pharmacy associations because the effect on pharmacies would depend on specific formularies and prices offered by the proposed card programs which is information that is not publicly available the national community pharmacists association ncpa and the national association of chain drug stores filed declaration with the washington dc federal court

the card program would encourage the use of mail order pharmacies which would steer card users away from retail pharmacies schondelmeyer also states that the card discounts would reduce profit margins for pharmacies41 although drugstores profit margins on prescription drug sales may decrease as result of discount cards some analysts believe that overall net profits may increase due to larger volumes of prescription drugs sold and higher sales in non pharmaceutical items while the profit margins of drug stores have fallen considerably since the 1970s recent data suggests that this trend may change in coming years as prescription drug sales increase recent standard and poors sp industry survey42 reported that drugstores gross profit margins were expected to fall again in 2001 as they had in 2000 and 1999 due to increases in prescription drug sales to thirdparty plans43 for the drugstore industry as whole however total sales increased 77 the number of prescriptions dispensed by traditional drugstore chains increased 71 in 2000 while that of independent drugstores increased by 03 the sp report indicated that rising prescription volumes helps increase the sales of overthecounter drugs and frontend merchandise nonpharmacyrelated goods which accounts for the overall net profit increase of 6 for the drugstore industry in 200044 in the larger chains such as cvs and walgreens net income increased an average of 195 although gross margins have been falling in recent years the sp report indicated that these are expected to improve in the long term as drugstore chains negotiate better agreements with thirdparty payers and decline to renew plans that are marginally profitable45 the sp report did not evaluate the potential impact of the administration proposal the lack of available information on the details of the presidents discount card proposal for seniors makes it difficult to assess the potential economic impact on retail pharmacies the administration has issued general statements about the expected size of the discounts and has stated that the administrative cost of the program would primarily be borne by the card sponsors however very little information has been issued on potential card sponsors and their individual programs until the details on individual card programs are available an analysis on the economic impact on pharmacies would be based on speculation of how the administration plans to modify its original proposal and how card sponsors would determine their discounts 41 declaration of stephen w schondelmeyer pharmd phd filed

considered providing coverage for at least portion of beneficiaries drug costs the issue received renewed attention in the 106th and 107th congress however there was consensus on how the coverage should be structured in the 108th congress representative mark foley introduced bill hr 513 in the house on january 31 2003 to authorize the secretary of hhs to endorse prescription drug discount cards for use by medicare beneficiaries the bill would give the administration legal authority to implement the medicare drug discount card initiative while it may not be essential that senior drug benefit be administered through pharmacy benefit manager pbm it seems clear that pbms now play major role in us healthcare delivery according to report prepared by pricewaterhousecoopers llp for the health care financing administration pbms manage the drug benefits of approximately 70 of the united states including approximately 65 of our countrys seniors46 in the debate over the administrations drug discount card plan the central role of pbms has clearly emerged as an issue especially for the retail pharmacy sector the issues that retail pharmacies have raised with pbms go well beyond president bushs medicare discount card proposal in fact the 2001 drug topics redbook characterized the relationship as follows pharmacy benefit managers cant live with em cant live without em most pharmacists would only agree with the first option while insurers and payers might lean more toward the second description survey after survey points to the idea that pharmacists find thirdparty issues to be the toughest they deal with 47 for congressional critics discount cards are not seen as solution to high costs of prescription drugs for uninsured or partially insured seniors they point to the existence of numerous discount programs and argue that even with plans that possibly deliver 10 to 25 discount the problem of high drug prices remains serious one the prices of pharmaceutical products charged by pharmaceutical manufacturers have been identified by some members of congress as special problem requiring congressional action the complexity of drug pricing procedures makes it difficult to understand how the system operates let alone devise policies that make it possible to deliver prescription drugs to seniors at prices comparable to those paid by clients of thirdparty purchasers pbms and their sponsors employers insurers hmos and drug discount card sponsors if the presidents revised discount program proposal manages to resolve the issues raised by the pharmacy industry members of congress may still raise concerns about whether seniors will get prescription medications at affordable prices 46 pricewaterhousecoopersllp study of pharmaceutical benefit management hcfs contract 5009703990097 june 2001 p 14 47 drug topics redbook 2001 p 94 crs21 discount drug programs may provide additional discounts to seniors although it is possible that many of the covered drugs would still remain expensive for low and middleincome seniors who do not have health insurance that covers prescription drugs nevertheless there is anecdotal evidence that suggests that consumers who are willing to comparison shop on the internet for prescription drugs can in some cases match or beat discount card prices the difficulty that the administration and congress face in developing senior drug benefit will be to develop policy that delivers necessary medications to seniors while providing pharmaceutical manufacturers wholesalers pbms and pharmacists with incentives to continue to participate in the marketplace in summary medicareendorsed discount card program might provide some savings on prescription drugs for seniors although the net overall effects are not clear because of the lack of details on the individual card programs the broad effect on the senior population would depend on the size of the discounts and the formularies that the plans offer the size of the discounts would depend on whether the card program would provide sufficient market leverage for card sponsors to negotiate higher manufacturer rebates from drug manufacturers seniors could benefit from certain features of the discount card program such as more access to information on drug prices and formularies offered by the different plans this information could enhance seniors abilities to comparison shop and save money by choosing the plan that would best fit their needs president bushs revised proposal could offer seniors some savings on medications depending on the final details of the various card plans as noted earlier in this report critics of the bush plan believe that the medicareendorsed discount cards would not bring additional benefits for seniors they have argued that the benefit is very minimal and duplicates service discount cards that the marketplace already provides48 the two most important concerns for pharmacists are related to 1 who bears the burden of the cost for the medicareendorsed discount card proposal and 2 the fear that card sponsors would structure their programs in such way that seniors are induced to switch from their local pharmacies to mail order pharmacies for their prescription drug purchases the overall effect on pharmacies would likely depend on the potential agreements they reach with the card sponsors and whether the card sponsors pass portion of the drug manufacturer rebates to the pharmacies seniors are equally concerned that discounts are passed all the way through the system to the ultimate intended beneficiaries the effect on pharmacies would also depend on the response of seniors to the card program and whether they would continue shopping at retail pharmacies for their prescription drug purchases or use more mailorder options to save money while seniors and others who must get prescription filled quickly will continue to patronize their local pharmacies deeper discounting by pbmowned or operated mail order pharmacies could lead to 48 see us house of representatives committee on government reform problems with prescription drug cards prepared for rep henry waxman by the minority staff july 12 2001 the
