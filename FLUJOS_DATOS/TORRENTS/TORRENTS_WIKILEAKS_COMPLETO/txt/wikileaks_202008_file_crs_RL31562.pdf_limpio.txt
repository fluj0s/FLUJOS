20 2008 thomas l hungerford specialist in public finance government and finance division jane g gravelle senior specialist in economic policy government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31562an analysis of the tax treatment of capital losses summary several reasons have been advanced for increasing the net capital loss limit against ordinary income as part of an economic stimulus plan as means of restoring confidence in the stock market and to restore the value of the loss limitation to its 1978 level u nder current law longterm and shortterm losses are netted against their respective gains and then against each other but if any net loss remains it can offset up to 3000 of ordina ry income each year capital loss limits are imposed because individuals who own stock directly decide when to realize gains and losses the limit constrains individuals from reducing their taxes by realizing losses while holding assets with gains until death when taxes are avoided completely current treatment of gains and losses exhibits an asymmetry because longterm gains are taxed at lower rates but net longterm losses can offset income taxed at full rates individuals can game the system and minimize taxes by selectively realizing gains and losses and for that reason the hi storical development of capital gains rules contains numerous instances of tax revisions directed at addressing asymmetry the current asymmetry has grown as successive tax changes introduced increasingly favorable treatment of gains expansion of the loss limit would increase gaming opportunities in most cases this asymmetr makes current treatment more generous than it was in the past although the capital loss limit has not increased since 1978 capital loss limit expansions like capital gains tax benefits would primarily favor higher income individuals who are more likely to hold stock most stock shares held by moderate income individua ls are in retirement savings plans such as pensions and individual retir ement accounts that are not affected by the loss limit statistics also suggest that only tiny fraction of individuals in most income classes experience loss and that the loss can usually be deducted relatively quickly one reason for proposing an increase in the loss limit is to stimulate the economy by increasing the value of the stock market and investor confidence economic theory however suggests that th most certain method of stimulus is to increase spending directly or cut taxes of those with the highest marginal propensity to consume generally lower income individuals expanding the capital loss limit is an indirect method and is uncertain as well increased capital loss limits could reduce stock market values in the short run by encouraging individuals to sell adjusting the limit to reflect inflation since 1978 would result in an increase in the dollar limit to about 8000 however mo st people are better off now than they would be if the 3000 had been indexe d for inflation if capital losses were excludable to the same extent as longterm capital gains were taxable for higher income individuals restorin g symmetry would require us ing about 2 in longterm loss to offset each dollar of ordinary income fully symmetric treatment would also require the same adjustment when offsetting shortterm gains with longterm losses this report will be updated to re flect legislative developments gregg esenwein was an orig inal coauthor of this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31562contents introduction 1 c u r r n t i n c m

treatment of capital losses introduction since the enactment of the individua l income tax in 1913 the appropriate taxation of capital gains income has been perennial topic of debate in congress every session numerous bills are introduced that would change the way capital gains income is taxed congress has also shown continuing interest in the tax treatment of capital losses with the financial turmoil and the volatile stock market many have proposed increasing the limit on capital losses that can be deducted against ordinary income the loss limit for example representative mark kirk introduced the middle class investor relief act hr 7123 on september 29 2008 which would increase the loss limit to 20000 from its current 3000 more recently senator mccain proposed increasing the loss limit to 150001 limit on the deductibility of capital losses against ordinary income has long been imposed in part because gains and losses are taxed or deducted only when realized an individual who is actually earning money on his portfolio can achieve tax benefits by realizing losses and not gains and can hold assets with gains until death when tax will ever be paid the loss limit prevents this selective realization of losses from being significant problem the problem of losses is further exacerbated by the current tax system where the treatment of capital gains and losses is asymmetrical longterm gains are taxed at maximum rate of 15 longterm losses are deductible without limit against shortterm capital gains and net longt erm losses are deductible against 3000 of ordinary income both shortterm capital gains and ordinary income can be taxed at rates of up to 35 this differential allows taxpayers to time their gains and losses so as to minimize income taxes for example by realizing and deducting losses in one tax year at 35 while waiting until the next tax year to realize and pay taxes on gains at 15 increasing the net capital loss deduction would increase the rewards of gaming the system the empirical evidence indicates that capital gains income is heavily concentrated in the upper income ranges it is probable that large capital losses are also concentrated in the same income ranges taxpayers in the middle income ranges tend to hold capital gains produc ing assets as part of ta x favored retirement savings plans the assets in these plans are not affected by the net loss restrictions as ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31562crs2 consequence the benefits of increasin g the net loss deduction would tend to accrue to taxpayers in the upper income ranges it is also unclear whether increasing the net loss deduction would stimulate the economy economic analysis suggests that measures to stimulate the economy should focus on spending or on tax cuts likely to be spent that will directly increase aggregate demand an expanded deduc tion for capital losses has tenuous connection to expanded spending thus presum ably the argument is that such tax benefit will benefit the stock market however it is not at all certain that an increase in loss deduction would increase the stock market it might incr ease sales of poorly performing stocks and depr ess these markets further this report provides an overview of these issues related to the tax treatment of capital losses it explains the current income tax treatment of losses describes the historical treatment of losses provide s examples of the tax gaming opportunities associated with the net loss deduction ex amines the distributional issues and discusses the possible stimulative effects of an increase in the net loss deduction current income tax law under current income tax law capital gain or loss is the result of sale or exchange of capital asset such as corporate stock or real estate if the asset is sold for higher price than its acquisition price then the sa produces capital gain if the asset is sold for lower price than its acquisition price then the sale produces capital loss capital assets held longer than 12 months are considered longterm assets while assets held 12 months or less are considered shortterm assets capital gains on shortterm assets are taxed at regular income tax rates gains on longterm assets sold or exchanged on or after may 6 2003 and before january 1 2009 are taxed at maximum tax rate of 15 for these assets the maximum longterm capital gains tax rate is 0 for individuals in the 10 and15 regular margin income tax rate brackets losses on the sales of capital assets are fully deductible against the gains from the sales of capital assets losses on the sale of principal residence are not deductible and losses on busine ss assets are treated as or dinary losses and deductible against business income however when losses exceed gains there is 3000 annual limit on the amount of capital losses that may be deducted ag ainst other types of income determining the amount of capital losse s under the federal individual income tax involves multistep process first s hortterm capital losses on assets held less than 12 months are deducted from short term capital gains second longterm capital losses on assets held for more th an 12 months are deducted from longterm capital gains next net shortterm gains or losses are combined with net longterm gains or losses httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31562crs3 if the combination of shortterm and longterm gains and losses produces net loss then that net loss is deductible against other types of income up to limit of 3000 net losses in excess of this 3000 limit may be carried forward indefinitely and deducted in future years again subject to the 3000 annual limit historical treatment of capital losses historically congress has repeatedly gra ppled with the problem of how to tax capital gains and losses ideally tax consistent with theoretically correct measure of income would be assesse d on real inflationadjusted income when that income accrues to the taxpayer conversely real losses should be deducted as they accrue to the taxpayer however putting theory into practice has been difficult exercise since 1913 there has been considerable gislative change in the tax treatment of capital gains income and loss to provi perspective for the current debate brief overview of the major legislative changes affecting capital losses follows 1913 to world war ii between 1913 and 1916 capital losses were deductible only if the losses were associated with taxpayers trade or business between 1916 and 1918 capital losses were deductible up to the amount of any capital gains regardless of whether the gains or losses were associated with taxpayers trade or business from 1918 to 1921 capital losses in excess of capital gains were deductible against ordinary income the revenue act of 1921 significantly changed the tax treatment of capital gains and losses assets we re divided into short and l ongterm assets shortterm gains were taxed at regular income tax rates and excess shortterm losses were deductible against ordinary income longterm gains were eligible for tax at flat rate of 125 net excess longterm losse s were deductible ag ainst other types of income at ordinary income tax rates which including surtax rates went as high as 56 this system created an asymmetrical treatment of longterm gains and losses excess longterm losses could be deducted at much higher tax rates than the rates applied to longterm gains this asymmetry was rectified by the revenue act of 1924 which instituted tax credit of 125 for net longterm losses this approach remained in effect w ith only minor modifications between 1924 and 1938 the revenue act of 1938 howev er introduced changes in the tax treatment of gains and losses from the sale of capital assets gains and losses were classified as shortterm if the capital asse t had been held 18 months or less and long term if the asset had been he ld for longer than 18 months shortterm losses were deductible up to the amount of shortterm gains short term losses in excess of shortterm gains could be carried forward for one year and used as an offset to shortterm gains in that succeeding year the carryover could nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31562crs4 exceed net income in the taxable year the loss was incurred net shortterm gains were included in taxable income and taxed at regular tax rates for assets held more than 18 months but less than 24 months 6666 of the gain or loss was recognized for assets he ld longer than 24 months 50 of the gain from the sale of that asset was recognized and included in taxable income net recognized longterm losses could be deduc ted against other forms of income without limit this treatment however introduced new inconsistency into the tax system because while only 50 of any longterm capital gain was included in the tax base 100 of any net longterm loss wa s deductible from the tax base world war ii through the 1950s the next significant change in the tax treatment of capital losses occurred during world war ii the revenue act of 1942 ch anged the tax treatme nt of capital losses in two significant ways first it consolidated the tax treatment of short and long term losses second it established 1000 limit on the amount of ordinary income that could be offset by combined short and longterm net capital loss finally it created fiveyear carry forward for netcapital losses that could be used to offset capital gains and up to 1000 of ordinary income in succeeding years once again this change introduced an inconsistency into the tax treatment of gains and losses because it allowed taxpayers to use 1 in net longterm losses to offset 1 in net shortterm gains si nce only 50 of net longterm gain was included in taxable income including 100 of net longterm loss created an asymmetry for instance if taxpayer had net longterm loss of 100 then it could be used to offset 100 of net shortterm ga ins symmetrical tr eatment of longterm gains and losses however would allow only 50 of net longterm loss to be deducted against net shortte rm gains 100 of net longterm loss could only offset 50 of net shortterm gain this asy mmetry was corrected in the revenue act of 1951 which eliminated the double coun ting of net longterm losses the 1960s through the 1970s the revenue act of 1964 repealed the fi veyear loss carryover for capital losses and replaced it with unlimited loss carryove r net losses however were still deductible against only 1000 of ordi nary income in any given year the tax reform act of 1969 also remove d dichotomy in the tax treatment of longterm gains and losses that had exis ted since 1938 by imposing 50 limitation on the amount of net longterm losses that c ould be used to offset ordinary income under prior law even though only 50 of net longterm gains were subject to tax net longterm losses could be deducted in full and used to offset up to 1000 of ordinary income the 1969 act repealed this provision and established new 50 limit on the deductibility of net longterm losses subject to the same 1000 limit on ordinary income hence it took 2 of longt erm loss to offset 1 of ordinary income in addition the law specified that the nondeductible portion of net longterm losses could not be carried forward to be deducted in succeeding yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31562crs5 the tax reform act of 1976 increased th capital loss offset against ordinary income under prior law net capital losse s could offset up to 1000 of ordinary income the 1976 act increased the capital loss offset limit to 2000 in 1977 and 3000 for tax years starting after 1977 the revenue act of 1978 reduced the tax rate on longterm capital gains income by increasing the exclusion from tax for longterm capital gains from 50 to 60 the 1978 act however did not reduce the limit on the deductibility of net long term losses hence while only 40 of longterm gains were included in the tax base 50 of losses were excluded from the tax base the tax reform act of 1986 to the present the tax reform act of 1986 repealed the net capital gain deduction for individuals both shortterm and longterm capital gains income were included in taxable income and taxed in full at regular income tax rates regular statutory income rates under the act were reduced from maximum of 50 to 33 28 statutory rate plus 5 surcharge the tax treatment of capital losses was changed by eliminating the 50 limitation on deductib ility of net longterm losses losses could be netted against gains and any excess losses whether short or long term could be deducted in full against up to 3000 of ordinary income ne t losses in excess of this amount could be carried forward indefinitely gradually changes were made that caused capital gains to be tax favored again when tax rates were revised in 1990 to eliminate the bubble arising from the surcharge maximum rate of 28 was set for capital gains slightly lower than the top rate of 31 when tax rates were increased in 1993 for very high income individuals adding 36 nd 396 rate this 28 top tax rate on longterm gains was maintained causing wider gap between taxation of ordinary income and capital gains income the growing asymmetry between taxes on capital gains and losses was not addressed the taxpayer relief act of 1997 was th latest major change in the tax treatment of capital gains and losses it established the current law treatment of gains by lowering the maximum tax rate on longterm capital gains income to 20 and creating 10 maximum capital gains tax rate for individuals in the 15 tax bracket the act did not change the tax treatment of capital losseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31562crs6 analysis of the treatment of capital losses under current law the tax treatment of capital gains and losses has changed repeatedly over the years some of the legislative changes that occurred in the past were attempts to reestablish symmetry between the tax treatment of capital gains and capital losses under current law asymmetries between the tax treatment of capital gains and losses remain currently net longterm losses are deductible against net shortterm gains without limit this rule in troduces inconsistences b ecause net longterm gains are taxed at maximum rate of 15 while ne t longterm losses can be deducted against shortterm gains which can be taxed at ra tes up to 35 additionally net longterm losses can be deducted against up to 3000 of ordinary income even though the maximum rate on ordinary income is 35 while the maximum rate on longterm gains is 15 the recent downturn in the stock market has prompted some analysts to suggest increasing the net capital loss limitation as means of softening the downturn for some investors however simply increasing the loss limitation would tend to increase the dichotomy between the tax trea tment of gains and losses given these suggestions review of the rationale behind the net loss limitation may prove valuable the loss limitation was originally enacted because taxpayers have control over the timing of the realization of their capital gains and losses they can elect to sell assets with losses and hold assets with gains thus minimizing their capital income tax liabilities when capital gains income is taxed more lightly than other types of income allowing capital losses to offset other income without limit increases taxpayers ability to minimize income taxes by altering the timing of the realization of gains and losses for example consider the case of taxp ayer who on the last day of tax year wishes to sell two assets the sale of the first asset would produce longterm gain of 20000 while the sale of the second asset would produce longterm loss of 20000 if the taxpayer sold both assets in the same tax year then the two sales would net to zero and there would be taxes owed on the transactions however if there were loss limitation then the taxpayer could significantly reduce his taxes by realizing the gain this tax year and postponing the realization of the loss until the next tax year or vice ve rsa realization of the 20000 longterm gain in the current tax year would cost the taxpayer 3000 in federal income taxes 15 maximum longterm capital gains ta x rate times the 20000 capital gain by waiting and taking the loss the next tax year the taxpayer could reduce his federal income taxes by 7000 35 maximum tax rate on ordinary income times the 20000 longterm loss hence with capital gains loss limitation the taxpayer could reduce his net federa l income taxes by 4000 simply by changing the timing of the realizations of gains and losses it should be noted that current law allows for an unlimited carry forward of excess losses hence taxpayers do not forfeit the full value of excess losses becausehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31562crs7 2 internal revenue service statistics of income individual income tax returns 2006 generally capital gains and losses are reported on schedule d under certain circumstances capital gains if there are losses can be reported directly on the form 1040they can deduct those losses in future years the actual cost to the taxpayer of forgoing the full loss in the current year is the interest that would have been earned on the additional tax reduction that would have been realized had there been excess loss limitation for example consider scenario where taxpayer has net longterm capital loss of 20000 if there were loss limitati on the taxpayer could deduct the entire loss against other income in the first year and assuming the highest marginal tax rate of 35 reduce his income ta x liability by 7000 20000 times 035 now consider the situation with 3000 annual loss limitation if the taxpayer had net capital gains in any subsequent ear then it would take the taxpayer seven years to deduct the full 20000 capital loss 3000 loss deduction for six years and 2000 loss deduction in the seventh year once again assuming the taxpayer faces the highest marginal tax rate of 35 and th at the rate does not change over the seven year period the taxpayer will re duce his taxes over the period by 7000 since money has time value however the 7000 in tax savings taken over seven years is not as valuable as the 7000 in tax savings taken in the first year when there was loss limitation if an interest ra of 5 is assumed then the present value of the 7000 in tax savings over ven years is 6118 so under this worst case scenario in present value terms the annual capital ss limitation would reduce the tax savings in this ex ample by approximately 882 it is also worth noting that if the tax rate on longterm gains and loses were symmetrical at 15 then the full deduc tion of 20000 net longterm loss would reduce the taxpayers income tax liability by only 3000 20000 loss times 15 tax rate hence even with the annua l loss limitation taxpayers with net longterm capital losses receive more tax savings under the current system than if there were symmetrical tax rate on longterm gains and losses in the preceding example where the 20000 was deducted at regular income tax rates over seven years the present value of the tax savings was 6118 versus 3000 tax savings if there were 15 symmetrical tax rate on both capital gains and losses in most cases the current system even without indexing the 3000 loss for inflation is more generous than the system that existed in 1978 distributional effects the empirical evidence establishes that capital gains are concentrated at the higher end of the income range in 2006 the last year that aggregate tax statistics are available the top 3 of taxpayers with over 200000 in adjusted gross income earned 91 of schedule d capital gains2 it has also long been recognized that these concentrations are somewhat overstated b ecause large capital gains realizations tendhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31562crs8 3 leonard burman the labyrinth of capital gains tax policy guide for the perplexed washington dc the brookings institution 1999 4 internal revenue service op cit 5 data from the board of governors of the fe deral reserve flow of funds accounts june 6 2002 to push individuals into higher brackets and an annual snapshot can overstate the concentration one way to correct for this ffect is to sort individuals by longterm average incomes which requires special tax tabulations the most recent study to do so using somewhat different measure of income but reporting by population share indicated that the top 1 who earned over 200000 from 19791988 received 57 of gains and the top 3 who earne d over 100000 received 73 of the gains3 by interpolation we can see that about twoth irds of gains are received by the top 2 of the income distribution the distortion relating to gains works in the opposite direction in the case of losses understates the share of losses going to high in come individuals and may be much more serious thus looking at losses by income class may not be very meaningful for example the top 3 accounted for about 30 of losses4 however there are significant losses in very low income classes that are almost certainly people whose incomes are normally high for exam ple another 10 of losses are realized by individuals with adjusted gross income since gains are normally much larger than losses this distortion can be quite serious and calculations such as these probably do not tell us very mu ch better calculation is the permanent capital gains share which suggests as noted above that about twothirds of gains are realized by individuals in the top 2 of the perman ent income distribution and similar finding is probably appropr iate for losses there are other reasons to expect that lower and middle income taxpayers are unlikely to be much affected by the expansion of capital losses first relatively few low and middle income families directly hold stock bout 14 of families with income below 75000 directly own corporat stock and about 35 of families with income between 75000 and 100000 directly own stock secondly many of their assets are held and are increasingly being held in tax favored forms in 2001 29 of equities held by individuals were held in pensions either private or state and local moreover about of 8 of stock is held in individual retirement accounts assets held in these accounts are not affected by loss restrictions because in the case of traditional iras and pension plans the original contributions have already been deducted from income hence any possible loss on the original investment has been prededucted from taxable income in the case of roth iras since gains on investments are not subject to tax upon w ithdrawal losses on investments should not be deducted from income another 7 are held in life insurance pl ans which are also not subject to tax altogether these assets account for over 40 of equities and they are likely to be proportionally much more impor tant for the middle class5 in addition moderate income taxpayers are more likely to hold equities in mutual funds that have mixed portfolios and typically do not report losse s because they hold so many types of stocks only about 25 of distributi ons from mutual funds are reported on taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31562crs9 6 congressional budget office the contribu tion of mutual funds to taxable capital

major sources of realized capital sses for 1999 the latest year for which this information is available are shown in table 1 the largest source of losses is the sale of corporate stock which accounts for 61 of losses reported in 1999 other securities for example mutual fund shar and options accounted for another 15 in general most of the capital losses are realized on assets that are predominantly

calculations based on internal revenue service statistics of income individual income tax returns 2006 taxpayers with net capital losses can deduct up to 3000 against ordinary income but about 60 are subject to th loss limit and have to carryover the excess losses to subsequent years evidence i ndicates that of individuals who could not deduct their losses in full two thirds were able to fully deduct losses within two years and more than 90 in six years8 recent study concluded that in 2003 more than half of the benefit of raising the exclus ion to 6000 would be received by tax filershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31562crs11 9 william g gale and peter orszag new round of tax cuts brookings institution 2002 10 for further discussion of this issue see crs report rs21136 government spending or tax reduction which might dd more stimulus to the economy by marc labonte crs report rs21126 tax cuts and economic stimulus how effective are the alternatives by jane g gravelle crs report rs21014 economic effects of permanent and temporary capital gains tax cuts by jane g gravelle and crs report rl34349 economic slowdown issues and policies by jane g gravelle thomas l hungerford marc labonte edward v murphy n eric weiss and julie m whittaker 11 increases in capital loss limits increase the xpected rate of return on stocks and would therefore eventually be expected to push up demand and raise prices although the extent to which tax benefits on future losses actually affect the investment decision is not certain note however that any price ffects would be temporary in the long run investment and rates of return would adjust and stock prices should reflect the value of underlying assetswith incomes over 100000 who account for 11 of tax filers9 thus the evidence suggests that raising the capital loss limit would benefit rela tive small proportion of high income individuals economic effects the primary objective of recent economic proposals is to stimulate the economy normally tax benefit that favors individuals with high permanent incomes as does capital gains tax cut is relatively ineffective way to stimulate the economy because these individuals tend to have high er propensity to save and it is spending not saving that stimulates the economy the most effective economic stimulus is one that most closely translates dollar for dollar into spending10 direct government spending on goods and services would tend to rank as the most effective followed by transfers and tax cuts fo r lower income individuals one argument that might be made for providing capital gains tax relief is that it would increase the value of the stock market and thus investor confidence indeed such an argument has been made for capital gains tax cut in the past such link is weaker and more uncertain than direct stimulus to the economy via spending increases or cuts in taxes aimed at wer income individuals indeed it is not altogether certain that capital gains tax relief would increase stock market values the evidence is mixed stock markets rise when increases in offers to buy exceed increases in offers to sell capital gains tax revisions may be more likely to increase sales than purchases in the short run thr ough an unlocking effect and this effect could be particularly pronounced in the case of an expanded capital loss deduction11 although these benefits may stimulate the stock market because they make stocks more attractive investments they also create shortterm incentive to sell and an incentive to sell the most pressed stocks thus if the method of stimulating the economy is expected to work via an incr ease in stock prices such tax revision whose effect is expected via boost in th stock market could easily depress stock prices further overall it is certain method of stimulating the economyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31562crs12 policy options several reasons have been advanced to increase the net capital loss limit against ordinary income as part of an economic stimulus plan as means of restoring confidence in the stock market and to restore the value of the loss limitation to its 1978 level an increase in the net capital loss limit may not be an effective device to stimulate aggregate demand in the short run an increase in the loss limitation could produce an incentive to sell stock which could depress stock prices and erode confidence even further furthermore th empirical evidence suggests that the tax benefits of an increase in the net cap ital loss limitation would be received by relatively small number of hi gher income individuals the restoration of the value of th loss limitation to its 1978 level is more complicated to address but two important comments may be made first there is way to determine that particular time period had achieved the optimal net capital lost limitation although historically the loss limit has been quite small second while correcting the 3000 loss limit to reflect price changes since 1978 would increase its value to about 9500 in 2007 do llars net longterm capital losses are generally treated more preferentially than they were prior to 1978 because of the asymmetry between loss and gain which was never addressed during recent tax changes restoration of hi storical treatment would also require an adjustment for asymmetry this problem with asymmetry has been growing increasingly important through the tax changes of 1990 1993 1997 and 2003 raising the limit on losses without addressing asymme try will expand opportunities to game the system achieving full symmetry in the system requires that the tax rate differential between short and longterm gains and losses be accounted for during the netting process the current rate differential is approximately two to one 35 maximum tax rate on ordinary income and shortterm capital gains versus an 15 maximum tax rate on longterm capital gains given this rate differential symmetry could be achieved in the netting process through the following steps in the case of net shortterm gain and net longterm loss 2 of net longterm losses should be requi red to offset 1 of shortterm gain if net loss position remain s 2 of longterm losses should be required to offset 1 of ordinary income up to the net loss limitation any remaining net loss would be carried forward in the case of net shortterm loss and net longterm loss the simplest way is to begin with shortterm losses which can be used on dollar for dollar basis to offset ordinary income if shortterm losses exceed the limit they would be carried forward along with all longterm losses if net shortterm losses are less than the loss limitation then 2 of net longterm loss can be used to offset each 1 remaining in the net loss limitati on any remaining net longterm loss would be carried forward httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31562crs13 in the case of net shortterm loss and net longterm gain each 1 of net shortterm loss should offset 2 of net longterm gain any net loss remaining should offset ordinary income on dollar for dollar basis up to the net loss lim itation any remaining net loss would be carried forward although the netting principles outlined above may appear complicated they are more complicated to implement on tax forms than the current netting procedures another method for achieving symmetry would be to institute tax credit of 15 or whatever the maximum capital gain tax rate is for capital losses the tax credit could be capped and the cap could be indexed to in flation this will benefit taxpayers in the 10 and 15 tax brackets because the maximum capital gains tax rate is 0 for these taxpayers until 2011 but these taxpayers mostly do not report capital gains and losses this is the basic approach taken between 1924 and 1938
