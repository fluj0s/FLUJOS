the midst of the planning for the realignment of wramc reports appeared in the press relating the experiences of several injured soldiers and their families who felt that they had been offered inadequate housing and suffered inadequate administrative care at walter reed army medical center 6 soon thereafter secretary of defense robert m gates commissioned an independent panel the independent review gro up or irg under the sponsorship of the defense health board to review rehabilitative care and administrative processes at both walter reed army medical center in the district of columbia and national naval medical center in bethesda maryland 7 the panel was established on march 1 2007 and consisted of nine members cochaired by two former secretaries of the army togo d west jr

patient administrative and clinical practices at the two installations nevertheless several of their findings and recommendations dealt with brac and facilities management issues among their recommendations the members of the panel suggested that 1 planned base realignment and closure construction projects should be accelerated in establishing the walter reed national military medical center wrnmmc and of the new ft belvoir medical complex while fully funding existing operations 2 leadership should survey patients and family members to assess quality of services provided and the condition of physical facilities at wramc and nnmc 3 senior facilities engineer should be assigned at wramc to assume the responsibility of maintenance of nonmedical facilities 4 tools for assessing

21st century included among these recommendations was one suggesting the creation of new walter reed national military medical center on the campus of the current national naval medical center in bethesda maryland and the redistribution of military medical functions throughout the national capital region and beyond dod characterized this recommendation as part of the creation of joint modernized medical support structure for the armed forces in executing its various elements dod recommended trimming excess military medical treatment capacity in the national capital area and relocating much of the remaining routine care capacity to new community hospital on ft belvoir virginia the local and professional medical communities expressed number of concerns with the dod recommendation to the brac commission before the realignment was finalized 9 the local community argued that the recommended moves would break up an integrated missionoriented principal military medical facility would adversely impact the economy of the nations capital and could degrade homeland security in the national capital region community representatives also expressed apprehension over the quantity of family housing available on or near the planned wrnmmc insufficient housing they contended would obstruct the efforts of family members to collocate with and support seriously injured service members being cared for at the relocated facility witnesses suggested an alternative to the dod recommendation retaining the current wramc in place and realigning the mission of th nnmc to avoid any potential disruption of wartime casualty care 10 the extended professional civilian medical community expressed its own concerns with the proposed dissolution of the armed forces institute of pathology afip which is currently located at the wramc main post several professional organizations and individuals from various regions of the country submitted statements testimony and

research and medical education resource whose influence is felt far beyond the narrowly focused body of military pathologists the commission acknowledged the importance of many of the expressed community concerns and objections nevertheless the commission judg ed that new facility would offer the most effective means to offer stateoftheart treatment and endorsed the secretary of defenses assessments of military value the commission did require dod to address expressed community concerns regarding the perceived lack of family housing on the bethesda campus of the new wrnmmc the commission also recognized the importance the professional community assigned to the services provided by the afip in the form of radiological resident training continuing medical education and path ology consultations the commissions decisions regarding the redress of these deficiencies were folded into their final list of recommended actions which moved some functions to new locations and

in figure 1 both officers report directly to the army chief of staff imcom includes seven regions northeast northwes t southeast southwest europe pacific and korea it was created in october of 2006 with the consolidation of the former installation management agency ima community and family support center and army environmental center imcom is responsible among other missions for bringing efficient oversight and business practices to the management of the armys installations inheriting this from its predecessor the ima 16 before 2002 the army did not have single cons olidated management agency dedicated to the operation modernization and maintenance of its individual posts and other sites responsibility for the physical plant at any given installation was then vested in senior post commander whose chain of command usually ran upward through division army or other such operational unit because the funds used to maintain and modernize these posts come from the same operations and maintenance om appropriations accounts as funds for training operations and the direct daytoday support of the posts military mission many army managers came to understand that over time infrastructure suffered as funding tended to migrate toward operations and away from maintenance one of the reasons for establishing the ima was to create an institutional advocate for the installations themselves and for the funding necessary for their upkeep and operation ima became the armys landlord and took responsibility for operating posts forts etc it did so by establishing the regions listed above and then by creating garrisons at all installations within each region each garrison was commanded by an officer assigned to the position usually colonel who was accountable for maintenance construction servicing etc on the site or sites constituting the installation funding for the operation of each post was then longer funneled through the operational chains of command but rather through the ima and its regions to the individual garrisons garrison commanders since the creation of the ima and its transition into imcom have supervised the installation of contract guard forces at posts on united states territory military construction and building demolition provision of supplies and services privatization of installation utilities and military housing and the creation of publicprivate partnerships such as the two enhanced use lease projects at the walter reed installation 17 therefore all medical practicerelated functions at the walter reed army medical center are the responsibility of medcoms installation commander while all facility maintenance operations and services are the responsibility of the imcom garrison commander 16 installation management agency was created in late 2002 17 the enhanced use lease eul is real estate financing tool that allows the federal government to lease to the private sector real property land buildings etc that is underutili zed due to condition or lack of construction renovation or demolition funds eul projects are privately financed and execu ted in return the military department receives return as either cash or inkind consideration and reversion of the constructed or renovated asset at the end of the lease term authority for the department of defense to engage in such activities is found in statute

consults and initial diagnosis when the local pathology labs capabilities are exceeded community concerns the washington dc community argued that moving walter reed army medical center to the national naval medical center in bethesda md would disrupt the mission of the premier military medical facility and have negative effect on the economy of the district of columbia and homeland security in the nations capital concerns were also expressed about whether there would be sufficient housing for family members visiting service members recovering from serious conditions or injuries they claimed dod substantially deviated from the brac criteria by incorrectly calculating walter reeds military value underestimating the costs for closure and realignment and ignoring environmental cleanup costs they suggested walter reed remain open and the mission of the national naval medical center be aligned with walter reed to ensure there are disruptions during time of war they also expressed concerns about the disestablishment of the armed force institute of pathology afip which is part of the larger walter reed recommendation the community argued that afip is an irreplaceable resource for disease research and education and disestablishing elements like the tissue repository would have farreaching implications for military and civilian medicine commission findings the commission acknowledged walter reed army medical centers rich heritage and earned reputation as worldclass medical center howe ver the commission found that service members deserve stateoftheart 21 st century medical center and that the secretarys proposal would increase military value the commission considered the communitys concerns that realigning medical services will disrupt walter reeds mission but the commission found that the walter reed legacy will be preserved in the plan for the new facility and that service members would continue to receive needed medical services during the implementation period the commission concurred with the departments objective to transform medical infrastructure within the national capital region however the commission agrees with the communities concern about whether sufficient housing will be available for family members at the bethesda campus and urges the dod to address this issue the professional community regards afip and its services as integral to the military and civilian medical and research community and relies on afip for pathology consultations and the training of radiology resi dents the commission found that dod failed to sufficiently address several afip functions such as the radiologic pathology program with the associated tissue repository veterinary pathology and continuing medical education commission recommendations the commission found that the secretary of defens deviated substantially from final selection criteria 1 as well as from the force structure plan therefore the commission recommends the following realign walter reed army medical center washington dc as follows relocate all tertiary subspecialty and complex care medical services to national naval medical center bethesda md establishing it as the walter reed national military medical center bethesda md relocate legal medicine to the new walter reed national military medical center bethesda md relocate sufficient personnel to the new walter reed
