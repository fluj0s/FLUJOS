succeeds the president in cases of removal death resignation or disability it makes provision for filling vacancies in the vice presidency on sixteen occasions between 1789 and 1967 the vice presidency was vacant in eight instances the vice president replaced president who had died in seven the vice president died in office and in one case the incumbent resigned during these sometimes lengthy periods the office remained vacant and some other officer served as first in line to the president between 1792 and 1886 the presi dent pro tempore of the senate and the speaker of the house were next in line to succeed the president after the vice president between 1886 and 1947 the persons to succeed were the secretary of state and other cabinet officers in the order in which their departments were created the presidential succession act of 1947 placed the speaker and president pro tempore in first and second place followed by the cabinet as before in the postworld war ii era these arrangements were increasingly regarded as inadequate particularly in light of ameri cas greatpower status and the growth of world tensions as the cold war evolved most observers believed the nation needed vice president fully prepared to assume the demands of the presidency at all times the assassination of president john kennedy in 1963 provided dramatic catalyst for change helping stimulate congressional approval of an amendment that among other provisions empowers the president to nominate vice president whenever the office is vacant subject to approval by majority of both houses of congress the 25th amendment became operational in 1967 within decade congress considered two nominees for the vice presidency both occurred at least indirectly because of the watergate affair in 1973 vice president spiro agnew resigned as part of plea bargain to avoid prosecution on political corruption charges and president richard nixon nominated house republican leader gerald ford to succeed him congressional precedents established included the essentially bipartisan nature of the confirmation process full utilization of the federal bureau of investigation in investigating the nominees public life and record and committee assignment to the committee on rules and administration in the senate and the committee on the judiciary in the house ford was confirmed by overwhelming margins in both houses less than year later nixon himself resigned when it became obvious he would be impeached for his actions in the watergate affair ford succeeded to the presidency without incident and nominated nelson rockefeller for vice president although the rockefeller nomination was more controversial due to the former governors extremely complex finances and certain questionable political practices he was also confirmed in both houses by comfortable majorities httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98730contents introduction 1 context presidential and vice presidential

vacancies congressional procedures in the ford and rockefeller nominations introduction throughout most of the nations history there were constitutional provisions to fill vacancies in the office of vice president of the united states if vice president died resigned or succeeded to the presidency the office remained vacant until the next election the 25th amendment to the constitution ratified in 1967 sought to remedy this situation as well as provide for instances in which the president was disabled conceived in the wake of president john f kennedys 1963 assassination the amendment addressed several constitutional contingencies related to presidential succession and disability not anticipated by the founders perhaps chief among these was section 2 which empo wers the president to appoint vice president whenever the office becomes vacant subject to confirmation by majority vote by both houses of congress less than decade later the 93rd congress was called on to discharge its constitutional duty under the amendment when the office of vice president became vacant twice in the course of 10 months the first vacancy resulted from the resignation of vice president spiro t agnew in 1973 and was followed by the nomination and confirmation of representative gerald r ford as vice president less than year later ford himself succeeded to the presidency following president richard m nixons resignation after which his own vicepresidential nominee former new york governor nelson rockefeller was confirmed by congress and sworn in late in 1974 confronted with an entirely novel constitutional and political situation congress established groundbreaking procedures in its consideration of these two nominations processes that could serve as precedent for future implementation of section two of the 25th amendment in the event the vice presidency becomes vacant for any reason this report examines constitutional and legislative provisions concerning vacancies in the vice presidency in historical context it also reviews congressional precedents and actions on the two occasions congress has considered and confirmed nominees for vice presidenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98730crs2 1 according to many scholars this may be due to the fact that the founders envisioned the vice president as only potential acting president who acceded to the powers of the presidency temporarily when that office was vacant and would serve only until special election was arranged by congress for discussion of this point of view see ruth c silva presidential succession new york greenwood press 1968 c 1951 pp 451 by this reasoning there was need to replace vice president under these circumstances since he would return to his original duties once the presidential vacancy was filled the first test of this theory came in 1841 when william henry harrison died and was succeeded by his vice president john tyler tyler took the presidential oath and considered himself to have acceded not only to the powers and duties but also the position of president of the united states after considerable debate both houses of congress implicitly recognized tylers decision by referring to him as the president emphasis added of the united states congressional globe vol x may 31 june 1 1841 pp 35 this question was definitively addressed in the 25th amendment which is discussed later in this report 2 john d feerick from failing hands the story of presidential succession new york fordham u press 1965 pp 4953context presidential and vice presidential succession from 1789 to 1967 for the first 178 years of government under the constitution presidential and vice presidential succession was provided for in the nations fundamental charter subsequent constitutional amendments and statute constitutional provisions the constitution in article ii section 1 clause 6 requires that in case of the removal of the president from office or of his death resignation or inability to discharge the powers and duties of constitutional provisions the said office the same shall devolve on the vice president and the congress may by law provide for the case of removal death resignation or inability both of the presi dent and vice president declaring what officer shall then act as president and such officer shall act accordingly until the disability be removed or president shall be elected as with many sections of the constitution this clause left certain points unstated although it provided for cases in which either the presidency or both the presidency and vice presidency were vacant it did not address situations in which only the vice presidency was vacant nor did it provide mechanism for filling vice presidential vacancies1 while article i section 3 authorized the senate to elect president pro tempore in the absence of the vice president or when he shall exercise the office of president of the united states presidential succession scholar john feerick has noted that the president pro tempore was only to preside over the senate was not replacement for the vice president and had place in the order of presidential succession2 the founders thus made constitutional provision for filling vacancies in the vice presidency consequently whenever the vice president acceded to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98730crs3 3 this timing is explained by the fact that presidential terms ended on march 4 when the succ ession act was passed in 1792 moreover the act provided only for election of the president since electors cast two nondistinguished votes for president during this period prior to ratification of the 12th amendment which specified separate electoral votes for president and vice president while the electoral vote runnerup was elected vice president 4 vacancy in the speakership was due to the fact that the 46th congress had expired on march 4 but the house did not convene in the 47th congress until december 1 1881 as was customary at the time vacancy in the office of the president pro tempore was the result of bitter partisan strife in senate closely divided between the partiespresidency during this long period in american history the vice presidency remained vacant until the subsequent presidential election succession acts of 1792 1881 and 1947 the second congress exercised its authority to provide for presidential inability or vacancy in the succession act of 1792 1 stat 240 congress examined several options but settled on placing the president pro tempore of the senate and the speaker of the house first and second respectively in the line of succession following the vice president they were to serve only temporarily however since the act also provided for special election for president to fill the vacancy provided it fell before the first wednesday in september in the last full year of presidents term of office3 president james garfields death by assassination led directly to revised succession act shot on july 2 1881 garfield lingered for 79 days before succumbing to his wounds on september 19 although vice president chester arthur took office without incident the fact that the offices of both speaker of the house and president pro tempore of the senate were vacant at the time revealed flaws in the 1792 act4 in response to concern about the potential for leadership vacuum congress passed the succession act of 1886 24 stat1 in order to insure the line of succession this legislation transferred succession after the vice president to the cabinet officers in the chronological order in which their departments had been created provided they had been duly confirmed by the senate and were not under impeachment by the house by vesting succession after the vice president in cabinet members the act eliminated the special election provision and made it more likely that potential presidential successors would be of the same political party as the former incumbent the presidential succession act of 1947 61 stat 380 established the order of succession after the vice presidency as it still applies having just succeeded to office on the death of franklin d roosevelt president harry truman in 1945 proposed that congress revise the order of succession placing the speaker of the house and the president pro tempore of the senate in line behind the vice president truman argued that it was more appropriate and democratic to have popularly elected officials first in line to succeed rather than appointed cabinet officers although his proposal also provided for special elections to fill any simultaneous vacancy in the presidency and vice presidency congress passed only its succession aspects under the act the speaker succeeded in the event of vacancies in both the presidency and vice presidency after resigning the speakership and his house seat if there were nohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98730crs4 5 although superseded by the speaker and president pro tempore by the presidential succession act the cabinet officers retain their places in presidential succession in the following order the secretaries of state the treasury and defense the attorney general the secretaries of the interior agriculture commerce labor health and human services housing and urban development transportation energy education and veterans affairs 6 the question of just when person is considered presidentelect whether after the electors cast their votes in december following the popular vote or only after congress has counted and certified the results the following january 6 was not specifically addressed by the amendment the balance of scholarly opinion and the legislative record however indicate that there is presidentelect once the electoral votes have been cast 7 these successions were in chronological order 1841 john tyler on the death of william henry harrison 1850 millard fillmor on the death of zachary taylor 1865 andrew johnson on the assassination of abraham lincoln 1881 chester arthur on the assassination of james garfield 1901 theodore roosevelt on the assassination of william mckinley 1923 calvin coolidge on the death of warren g harding 1945 harry s truman on the death of franklin d roosevelt and 1963 lyndon b johnson on the assassination of john f kennedy 8 these vacancies due to death by natural causes

offices if there were neither speaker nor president pro tempore or if they did not qualify constitutionally then the cabinet officers would succeed under the same conditions as applied in the 1886 act5 the presidential succession act of 1947 remains in force today although the 25th amendment renders recourse to the speaker the president pro tempore or the cabinet unlikely except in the event of catastrophe the 20th amendment the 20th amendment to the constitution ratified in 1933 is primari ly remembered for changing the dates on which new congress begins and the president and vice president are inaugurated however one of its provisions section 3 clarified question of presidential succession by declaring that if the presidentelect dies before being inaugurated the vice presidentelect shall become the president6 vice presidential succession and vacancies prior to the 25th amendment betw een 1789 and 1967 the office of vice president was vacant on fewer than 16 occasions nearly once every decade instances in which vice president succeeded to the chief executive office on the death of the incumbent president are indisputably the best known of these7 there have also been eight instances in which the office of vice president was vacated for reasons other than presidential succession in seven of these cases the incumbent vice president died of natural causes while in the

amendment conception passage and ratification although proposals for revising presidential succession and disability procedures were regularly advanced during the postworld war ii era it is unlikely that any one of them would have come to fruition had it not been for the extra ordinary events surrounding the 1963 assassination of president john f kennedy context for most of the nations history under the constitution vice presidents were traditionally regarded as politically inconsequential chosen more to provide balance to the party ticket in presidential election than for their abilities as potential successors to the presidency american complacency over presidential disability or vacancy was demonstrated by the long disability of president woodrow wilson on october 2 1919 wilson suffered stroke from which he never fully recovered during the 17 remaining months of his term the gravity of his illness was concealed from the press and public and access to the president was strictly controlled by his wife his physician and his secretary vice president thomas marshall remained completely unprepared for potential succession to the presidency throughout the period9 traditional attitudes toward the vice president began to change out of necessity by the time harry truman took the oath in 1945 prior to the truman succession of 1945 the slower pace of transportation and communications coupled with the relative security conferred on the united states by its insulating oceans seemed to obviate the need for standby successor ready to take office at moments notice technological advances and the development of weapons of mass destruction made the world much smaller and more dangerous place nor was the united states able to afford the luxury and safety of isolation as the leading democratic power it was by default the only nation capable of leading and defending the west as the cold war developed in the late 1940s in the opinion of most observers the nation needed vice president fully prepared to meet the demands of the presidency whenever called to do so this necessity was recognized by presidents eisenhower and kennedy

richard m nixon and lyndon b johnson regularly attended cabinet meetings were assigned various independent and official duties and participated in the policy process at the highest levels between world war ii and president kennedys death in 1963 however attention had been focused more on presi dential disability than on succession an interest stimulated by three instances in which president dwight d eisenhower was incapacitated by illness or surgery for varying periods of time in one case the president was hospitalized between september 24 and november 11 1955 following heart attack in 1956 he underwent surgery to remove benign intestinal obstruction and finally on november 25 1957 he suffered mild stroke but returned to work in less than week10 while many observers expressed concern over these events informal procedures worked out between president eisenhower and vice president nixon appeared to cover most contingencies and legislative action occurred president kennedy and vice president johnson also made similar contingency plans providing for temporary transfer of power and responsibilities in the event of disability on the part of the chief executive the kennedy assassination catalyst for change it took the shocking death of president kennedy however to create an awareness of and consensus for the need for swift congressional action to remedy the nowapparent deficiencies in succession and disability arrangements the leisurely discussion of changes in these provis ions was dramatically interrupted by his assassination on november 22 1963 not only was the presidents death an intensely traumatic event for the american people it also aroused deep concern over succession arrangements provided or not provided in the case of vice presidents in the constitution and law few doubted that vice president johnson was well qualified to assume the presidency he had served in congress for 24 years latterly as an effective senate majority leader and exemplified the newly revitalized vice presidency on the other hand it was recalled that in 1955 he had suffered severe heart attack requiring six weeks of hospitalization and three months of restricted activity11 of similar concern were the facts that house speaker john w mccormack next in line of succession after president johnson was 71 years old and senate president pro tempore carl t hayden who followed the speaker was 86 years old and visibly frail12 the primary anxiety about the vice presidential vacancy following president kennedys death however was due as much to concern over

the greatest constitutional crises in american history watergate the watergate affair began on june 17 1972 when agents of president richard m nixons reelection committee were apprehended while placing phone taps in the offices of the democratic national committee housed in the watergate complex in washington although some reporters and politicians claimed that the president or his campaign staff had been involved the charges had effect on nixons successful reelection effort that autumn the watergate intruders who were convicted in early 1973 eventually bowed to pressure from presiding judge john j sirica admitting that the reelection committee and white house staff had been involved in the political espionage plan meanwhile the washington post had published stories asserting that both reelection committee staff and white house officials had known of the burglary in advance and moreover had subsequently orchestrated efforts to conceal their involvement on february 7 1973 the senate voted to establish select commi ttee on presidential campaign activities under senators sam j ervin jr and howard baker to investigate the growing allegations of coverup by the white house

cautioned him that democrats would be less inclined to approve the nomination of figure perceived to be strong candidate for the presidency in that year28 this attitude was not shared by all democrats however senator bayh father of the 25th amendment declared that it did not contemplate caretaker president and that the approval process has to be out of the partisan arena29 nixons final decision was again by his own description compromise between these competing views discarding connally because of democratic opposition and reagan and rockefeller because of their additional potential to split the republican party along ideological lines he settled on representative ford who he believed was acceptable to both houses of congress and would also serve as an active chief executive if necessary

the district of columbia circuit on october 12 after cox rejected both compromise offered by president nixon and presidential directive that he cox make further attempts to obtain tapes or other

abandoned this idea bowing to opinion voiced by many representati ves who expressed concern that house members might be overshadowed in the hearings by the nationallyknown senat ors who would almost

the rules committee and its temporary expansion by six members three selected by the majority leader and three by the minority leader with the majority leader being one of the additional members38 majority leader mansfield and other senior senators however indicated their preference for referral to the rules committee without expansion position which had also been adopted unanimously by the republican conference other senators insisted that the nomination demanded action beyond the status quo senator edward kennedy for instance argued that the situation confronting the senate was completely without precedent and that therefore the standing rules are not dispositive of the issue and the senate is entitled to write as if on blank slate39 according to one account the political orientation of the various committees was at issue liberal senators were alleged to prefer referral to the judiciary committee because it included significant number of senators of liberal persuasion while conservatives were alleged to have supported the more conservative rules committee40 discussion of these questions continued inconclusively on the senate floor for the balance of the day and decision was promised for saturday october 13 by that time however the ford nomination had been announced and its obvious popularity led to withdrawal of alternative proposals in the senate assuring

record lack of experience in foreign affair s and his admittedly conservative political philosophy one witness suggested that congress defer action on the vice presidential nomination until the question of president nixons future was settled while another called for special election to fill the vice presidency47 the final witness urged delay on the grounds that vice president agnew had been

in general and areas of law associated with the ongoing watergate crisis the winterberger allegations were also revisited with the committee arriving at conclusions similar to those made by the senate rules committee house judiciary committee members also critically examined the nominees role in efforts to impeach associate supreme court justice william douglas in 1970 as well as his activities as member of the warrren commission that investigated the assassination of president kennedy54 one objection raised by opponents of the ford nomination concerned the constitutional prohibition against appointment of senator or representative to any civil office which for which the emolument had been increased during his term of office in congress55 it was asserted that the passage of public law 93136 which increased retirement benefits for many federal employees including the vice president was disqualifying constitutional impediment to the nomination since ford had been member of the house of representatives when president nixon approved the legislation on october 24 1973 other members rejected this assertion relying on legislative counsels opinion that the vice president was not civil officer as defined by the constitution56 after completing hearings on november 26 the judiciary committee voted to report the nomination favorably to the house on november 29 in contrast with the senate the decision was not unanimous with eight members voting against favorable report and one voting present the majority report cited many of the same reasons mentioned in the senate report while opponents suggested that the nominees record on civil and human rights his lack of executi ve or foreign policy experience and his role in the douglas impeachment attempt engendered their opposition dissenting members also suggested that the committee should acknowledge the fact that public opinion concerning the nixon administration had changed dramatically since the presidents reelection in

consideration of the ford nomination swiftly followed the hearings and investigation process the senates debate began november 26 the same day the house judiciary committee favorably reported the nomination58 the senate debate consisted largely of statements of praise for and confidenc in the nominee his honesty decency sincerity and candor during the hearings were frequently cited along with his record of service in world war ii and during 24year career in the house of representatives members also noted his willingness to compromise during his career in the house of representatives without at the same time abandoning his principles many remarked that they fully expected ford to assume the presidency within the near future some democratic senators noted political and philosophical differences with the nominee they stated that ford would not have been their choice for vice president but conceded that barring unfitness to serve on the part of the nominee congress should confirm the presidents choice for vice president when the 25th amendment was invoked one opponent noted the alleged article i section 6 constitutional impediment cited earlier in this report but again this was rebutted with legislative counsels opinion that the vice president was not civil officer as intended in the constitution59 the main thrust of opposition centered around the watergate affair it was asserted that the 25th amendment was inappropriate to the situation one in which the vice president had resigned while under criminal investigation and the president himself might well be subject to impeachment and removal from office as senator william hathaway noted an appointed vice president who succeeded to the presidency under these circumstances would be the one appointed by the very leader deposed by the people such result seems contrary to the principles of our entire legal and political tradition further president thus installed would for the first time in our history not be one elected by the people this is inconsistent with the underlying principle of democratic government that sovereignty and legitim acy derive only from the people themselves60

total of six hours equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the judiciary committee after debate the committee rose and reported the resolution to the house for final consideration62 most of the debate followed course similar to that in the senate statements of sometimes fulgent praise for ford by his supporters expressions of admiration for the man but not his politics followed by declarations of support or opposition and some outright disapproval of both the nomination and the nominee african american and hispanic members in particular criticized the nomination citing their interpretation of fords record on civil and human rights legislation and an alleged insensitivity to the plight of poorer americans63 the persistent and apparently organized efforts of fords detractors gave the house deliberations somewhat more of the quality of debate than was the case in the senate some highlights of the house debate included the emoluments question which was raised and definitively addressed by judiciary committee chairman rodino who cited reports by both the justice department and the congressional research service that concluded the prohibition imposed by the constitution did not apply to the ford nomination64 another point frequently emphasized by both supporters and opponents was their expectation that the vice president would soon succeed to the presidency and that congress was in reality actually electing presiden t as representative jerome waldie noted now each of us will be voting for president of the united states one might suggest that we are voting for man whose title is vice president of the united states and that is true but the only functi on of the vice president is in fact to succeed to the presidency so we

shortly after the house added its approval to that of the senate in confi rming him as vice president of the united states69 the rockefeller nomination gerald ford served barely eight months as vice president before richard nixons resignation catapulted him into the presidency on august 9 1974 as many senators and representatives had predicted nixon resigned in the wake of continuing revelations of criminal misconduct during the watergate coverup it was in these circumstances scarcely less dramatic than those leading to fords confirmation that congress considered yet another nomination for the vice presidency that of nelson rockefeller former governor of new york and scion of one of americas richest families although congress followed most of the precedents established for the ford nomination the process was complicated by the fact that rockef ellers personal finances were extraordinarily complex and required lengthy investigation context70 president richard nixon fought losing battle to save his presidency during the first seven months of 1974 he was threatened on several fronts special prosecutor leon jaworski who had replaced the dismissed archibald cox on november 1 1973 continued to press for the release of additional tapes of nixons conversations conce rning watergate after the president citing executive privilege refused tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98730crs23 comply jaworski obtained subpoena requiring their release nixon first asked judge john sirica to overturn the subpoena and after his refusal on may 20 1974 appealed the decision meanwhile on march 1 1974 judge siricas original watergate grand jury issued report citing the president as an unindicted co conspirator in the coverup this report was subsequently referred to the house judiciary committee which had initiated an impeachment inquiry with hearings that opened on may 9 1974 in addition to watergate the committee also investigated various allegations of campaign funding and personal financial irregularities leveled against the president in july nixon received several politically fatal blows on july 24 the supreme court ruled unanimously that the president must obey siricas order to provide the special prosecutor with the tapes he requested shortly afterward on august 3 the house judiciary committee voted to recommend nixons impeachment on three counts obstruction of justice abuse of power and contempt of congress and floor debate was scheduled to begin august 19 the first tapes were turned over to jaworski on july 30 but on august 5 the president stunned the nation by releasing transcripts of three crucial white house meetings indicating that he had participated in the watergate coverup as early as june 23 1972 remaining support for nixon evaporated and senior republican congressional leaders urged him to resign which he did effective august 9 gerald ford was sworn in as president the same day nomination and confirmation on august 20 1974 president ford nominated nelson rockefeller to be vice president rockefeller had served in number of appointive federal positions in both democratic and republican administrations beginning in 1940 between periods of public service he held various jobs in the private sector including rockefell er family interests in 1958 he was elected to the first of four terms as governor of new york post he occupied until his resignation on december 18 1973 he had also been an unsuccessful candidate for the republican presidential nomination in 1964 and 1968 fords choice of rockefeller initially received wide bipartisan praise from senators and representatives rockefeller was hailed for his more than 30 years of public service in particular his extensive executive experience as governor of new york for 15 years although the rockefeller nomination came to be more contentious than fords and consumed more than four months it broke little new ground with respect to precedent setting congressional action

revenue taxati on was detailed to assist judiciary committee staff in evaluating the nominees personal financial statements72 several factors contributed to making the rockefeller nomination process lengthier and in some ways more emotionally charged than fords had been the first was president fords extension of blanket pardon to richard nixon on september 8 although his reason for issuing the pardon was to forestall prolonged and divisive debate over the propriety of exposing to further punishment and degradation man who has already paid the unpreced ented penalty of relinquishing the highest elective office73 it generated just such debate arousing strident criticism from foes of the resigned president some observers suggested that ford had violated an implicit promise given during his confirmation hearings that he would probably not issue pardon under such circumstances although criticism divided largely though not exclusively along party lines many suggested that fords honeymoon with the american people had been brought to an end by his action74 second factor delaying the confirmation process was the 1974 congressional elections in which 33 of 38 members of the house judiciary committee and two members of the senate rules and administration committee faced reelection75 between the press of endofsession legislative responsibilities and reelection campaigning the rules committee was forced to divide its hearings into two widely separated periods the first included three sessions held between september 23 and 26 followed by an additional three held between november 13 and 15 the house judiciary committee postponed its hearings until after the elections these were held in seven sessions on november 21 and 22 25 and 26 and december 2 to 4 the most serious complicating factors however were rockefellers extraordina rily complex personal finances and questions related to his political activities during his long tenure as governor of new york in the case of personal wealth the nominee provided both his personal tax returns for the previous seven years and an estimate of his net worth rockefellers advisors had apparently underestimated his net worth in his initial financial disclosures however when discovered these omissions led to fuller examination which resulted in substantial upward revisions of the nominees net worth from 625 million to 218

subordinates many of the loans were repaid only in part or not at all although legal opinions presented to the committees found nothing in the loans or gifts to be illegal the question was raised as to whether or not governor rockefellers loans and gifts were made for purposes other than as represented by governor rockefeller and the recipients were they made as gestures of affection and friendship or were they made to achieve gain by governor rockefeller or as reward to the recipients for services rendered77 in the final analysis both committees indicated their concern over the nominees practice of extending gifts and loans but barring any demonstrated legal impropriety gave him the benefit of the doubt78 both committees were equally troubled by revelations that rockefeller family interests had underwritten controversial campaign biography highly critical of former supreme court associate justice arthur j goldberg nelson rockefellers opponent in the 1970 gubernatorial election both committe concluded that the nominee had exercised poor judgment in tacitly approving the books publication and rockefeller himself publicly apologized to goldberg finally both committees expressed concern over the amounts contributed by the nominee and his family to his own campaigns for governor and president79 hearings in the senate rules and house judiciary committees involved sometimes pointed questioning of the nominee and were generally characterized by less deference and collegiality than the ford hearings governor rockefeller testified on five occasions for total of over 23 hours before the rules committee and on three occasions for over 17 hours before the judiciary committee notwithstanding substanti opposition from number of witnesses and democratic members the nomination was reported favorably in the rules committee with unanimous vote of 9 to 0 on november 22 in judiciary the margin to report favorably was 26 to 12 with all opposition coming from democr atic members the bipartisan spirit was however demonstrated by the nine democrats who joined committee republicans in providing the majority to report favorably on december 12 as was the case

the senates confirmation debate scheduled for single hour was held on december 10 and ended with favorable vote of 90 to 780 fiftythree democrats and 37 republicans supported the nomination while three democ rats and four republicans opposed it one republican who voted present explained that he had done so because he had received contribut ion from the nominee in his election campaign according to vote analysis democrats who opposed the nomination were generally identified as liberals the republicans who voted against it however were characterized as among the most conservative senators81 the house adopted rules similar to those used in the ford confirmation debate the rule for consideration hres 1519 provided six hours of debate divided evenly between and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the judiciary committee rockefellers margin of approval in the house hres 1511 was the vehicle for approval of the nomination was comfortable 287 to 128 but the result reflected the greater opposition the nominee experienced during the hearings process and the floor debate82 according to contemporary analysis of the vote rockefeller notwithstanding his reputation as mod erate or even liberal republican enjoyed much smaller margin of support among northern democrats than had the more conservative ford winning their vote by narrow margin of 78 to 74

provide succession procedure for occasions when the vice presidency is vacant caused little concern for nearly 150 years of government under the constitution on 16 occasions between 1789 and 1967 the office became vacant due to either the vice presidents accession to the presidency or his death or resignation these vacancies were considered an acceptable risk in an era characterized by smaller less responsible federal government and the relative insulation of the united states from world crises they ceased to be acceptable when the united states acquired great power status in an unstable world and the presidency assumed vastly increased responsibilities notwithstanding these changes it required the impetus of john kennedys tragic assassination to bring to fruition constitutional amendment remedying the original documents oversight only six and seven years later congres s was called on to perform its constitutional duty in considering two vice presidential nominations in successive years under circumstances that have almost universally been described as constitutional crisis in both cases it acted deliberately yet swiftly and without excessive partisan rancor to examine and vote on the presidents nominee for vice president in both cases it also established precedents which would be useful but not prescriptive in any future implementation of section two of the 25th amendment
