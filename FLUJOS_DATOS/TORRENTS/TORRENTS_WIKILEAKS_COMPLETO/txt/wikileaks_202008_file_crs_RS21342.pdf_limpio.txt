report does not track legislation and will not be regularly updated background the purpose of the diversity visa lottery is as the name suggests to encourage legal immigration from countries other than the majo r sending countries of current immigration to the united states the law weighs allocation of immigrant visas heavily towards aliens with close family in the united states and to lesser extent aliens who meet particular employment needs the diversity immigrant category was added to the immigration and nationality act ina by the immigration ac t of 1990 pl 101649 to stimulate new seed immigration ie to foster new more varied migration from other parts of the world1 the current diversity lottery began in fy1995 following three transitional years with temporary lotteries2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21342crs2 2 continued amendments to the ina that ended the country quota system according to 132 of the 1990 act 40 16000 of these transitional diversity visas each year were earmarked for natives of irelandthe diversity lottery makes 55000 visas ava ilable annually to natives of countries from which immigrant admissions were lowe r than total of 50000 over the preceding five years the united states citizenship and immigration services bureau uscis generates the formula for allocating visas according to the statutory specifications visas are divided among six geographic regions acco rding to the relative populations of the regions with their allocation weighted in fa vor of countries in regions that were under represented among immigrant admissions to the united states the act limits each country to 7 or 3850 of the visa limit and provides that northern ireland be treated as separate foreign state recipients of the visas become legal permanent residents lprs of the united states while the diversity lottery has not been directly amended since its enactment in 1990 the nicaraguan adjustment and centra l american relief act of 1997 nacara temporarily reduces the 55000 annual ceiling by up to 5000 visas annually beginning in fy1999 the diversity ceiling became 50000 to offset immigrant visa numbers made available to certain unsuccessful asylum seekers from salvador guatemala and formerly communist countries in europe w ho are being granted lpr status under special rules established by nacara while the offs et is temporary it is not clear how many years it will be in effect to handle these adjustments of status trends in admission in fy2002 there were 42829 persons actually admitted or adjusted as lprs with diversity visas according to the fy2002 usci s admissions data this number represents 4 of all lprs in fy 2002 and is comparable to fy2001 when 42105 diversity immigrants comprised 39 of all lprs the top five countries in fy 2002 the latest year for which detailed data ar available were albania ethiopia nigeria poland and the ukraine as table 1 details these five countries have consistently ranked among the top diversity visa sending countries along w ith bangladesh bulgaria morocco romania and russia citizens of ireland poland and th former soviet uni on won the most visas in the mid1990s but their participation in th lottery has fallen in recent years albania ranks as the top sending country for this tire period followed by nigeria the numbers for russia and ukraine may be understated because

least two years of training or experience4 the alien or the aliens spouse must be native of one of the countries listed as foreign state qualified for the diversity visa lottery diversity lottery winners like all other aliens wishing to come to the united states must undergo reviews performed by department of state c onsular officers abroad and dhs inspectors upon entry to the us5 these reviews are intended to ensure that they are not ineligible for visas or admission under the grounds for inadmissibility spelled out in the ina6 these criteria for exclusion are grouped into the following categories healthrelated grounds criminal history security and terrorist concerns public charge eg indigence seeking to work without proper labor certification illegal entrants and immigration law violations ineligible for citizenship and aliens previously removedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21342crs5 7 for detailed information on the diversity visa pplication process go to the

immigration and naturalization fundamentals by ruth ellen wasemfy2005 lottery the state department announced the fy2005 lottery on august 19 2003 the 60 day application period began on nove mber 1 2003 and ended on december 30 20037 for the first time applications for the diversity lottery must have been submitted electronically entrants r eceived an electronic confirmation notice upon receipt of completed entry form paper forms were not accepted since the objective of the diversity lottery is to encourage immigration from regions with lower immigration rates natives of countries with high admissions are usually ineligible for fy2005 the ineligible countries were canada china mainland born columbia dominican republic salvador haiti india jamaica mexico pakistan the philippines russia south korea the united kingdom and dependent territori and vietnam8 when applying for diversity visa petitioners had to follow the instructions issued by the state department precisely if there were any mistakes or inconsistencies with the petition it may have been dis qualified by the state depar tment in the fy2003 lottery over 2 million of the 87 million applications were disqualified for failure to comply with the instructions9 aliens who submit more than one application are supposed to be disqualified but husbands and wives may submit parate entries even though spouses and unmarried children under the age of 21 qualify as derivativ beneficiaries of successful applicants any derivative beneficiary must be listed on the petition when it is initially filed and the rivative beneficiary visas ar counted against the 50000 visa cap if diversity lottery winner dies before obtaining lpr status the visa is automatically revoked and deriva tive beneficiaries are long er entitled to diversity visa classification10 once all acceptable applications were received by the visa center the winners were selected randomly by computer petitioners who were not selected were not notified by the state department the state department is expected to notify the winners of the fy2005 diversity lottery by mail between ma and july 2004 and their visas will be issued between october 1 2004 and septembe r 30 2005 winning the first round of the fy2005 lottery does not guarantee visa b ecause the state department draws more applications than the number of visas available therefore winners must be prepared to act quickly to file the necessary documentation demonstrating to the state department that they are admissible as lprs the app lications are processed on firstcome first served basis aliens must complete this process before september 30 2005 to receive visas11 in person interviews are expected to begin in october 2004httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21342crs6 issues some question the continuation of the diversity visa lottery given that family members often wait years for visa to immigrate to the united states they state preference that the 55000 visas be used for b acklog reduction of the other visa categories supporters of the diversity visa howev er point to the immigration dominance of nationals from handful of countries and ar gue that the diversity visa provides new seed immigrants for an immigration system we ighted disproportionately to familybased immigrants some are arguing that the ina should be amended to prevent nationals from countries that the united states identifies as sponsors of terrorism from participating in the diversity visa lottery these critics maintain that the difficulties of performing background checks in these countries as well as broader concerns about terrorism should prompt this change supporters of current law observe that lprs coming to the united states in other visa categorie s are not restricted if they come from nations that sponsor terrorism and argue that the po licy should be uniformly applied who should bear the costs of operating the lotte ry has also arisen as issue those aliens who win the lottery pay fee with thei r visa application but some argue that fee should be charged to enter the lottery as well the diversity visa has been criticized as vulnerable to fraud and misuse but the stat department maintains that they are addressing these concerns
