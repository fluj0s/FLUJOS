billion in revenue in fiscal year fy 2006 beginning in 2004 however many taxpayers individual and corporate challenged the legality of the telephone excise tax as it applied to toll long distance telephone services recent court rulings have supported the taxpayers position that long distance toll services are not taxable and have ordered refunds on may 25 2006 the us treasury department conceded defeat and announced that the department of justice will longer pursue litigation and the internal revenue service irs will issue refunds of tax on longdistance service for the past three years on august 31 2006 the irs announced individual taxpayers can file for refund to be included with their returns for the 2006 tax year that varies from 30 to 60 based on family size this decision has initiated further congressional review of the remaining tax on local telephone services options include repealing or significantly modifying the structure of the telephone excise tax complete repeal of the tax both the local and long distance portions had been estimated by the congressional budget office cbo to cost 670 billion over the fy2006 to fy2015 budget window more recently cbo estimated that repeal of the remaining excise tax on local telephone services would cost approximate ly 33 billion over the 2008 to 2017 budget window while the administrations fy2008 budget so proposes the same repeal and estimates the cost at 12 billion over the 2008 to 2017 budget window administering the tax is relatively simple for the federal government as third parties collect the tax and monitor compliance from the standpoint of economic theory the tax is regressive and does not treat similarly situated taxpayers equally in addition economic theory suggests the tax is inefficient

telephone calls also known as the communications tax originated on long distance service under the spanish war act of 1898 pl 55133 the tax was repealed in 1902 but reenacted as the united states prepared to enter world war i under the emergency internal revenue tax act of october 22 1914 pl 63217 in december 1915 the tax was set to expire when congress decided to keep it in force for another year on january 1 1916 the tax did expire though for only little more than ne months at which time it was reenacted under the war revenue act of october 3 1917 pl 6550 in 1924 the tax was repealed it remained so until the passage of the revenue bill of 1932 pl 72154 the enactment of this 1932 law was justified by its proponents as way to pay down the federal budget deficit which followed the decline in income tax receipts during the great depression few months before the united states entrance into world war ii the tax was broadened by the revenue act of 1941 pl 77 250 to include local telephone services since the enactment of the federal telephone excise tax in 1932 the tax has been continuously in effectthough in the 1960s 1970s and 1980s the tax was repeatedly extended on temporary basis in general the laws under which the tax operated called for gradual phasedown in the tax rate before total repeal of the tax often revenue problems surfaced before the repeal date and congress responded by either increasing the rate or maintaining the rate and extending the scheduled date for proposed repeal before passage of the revenue reconciliation act of 1990 pl 101508 the tax was scheduled to expire on december 31 1990 the 1990 act permanently extended the tax at 3 rate the rationale for continuance was that budget deficits precluded allowing the tax to expire over the telephone taxs long history exemptions from the tax have been provided to governmental customers the american red cross nonprofit educational organizations and nonprofit hospitals common carriers and radio and television broadcasting stations among others there was general lull in major legislative events from 1990 until around 2004 when the courts began seeing challenges to the tax see the next

g344g561litigation was the definition of toll telephone service in particular in the tax code toll telephone service means in part telephonic quality communication for which there is toll charge which varies in the amount with the distance and elapsed transmission time of each individual communication4 emphasis added before may 25 2006 the irs had taken the position that the toll charge may vary according to distance or elapsed transmission time however the courts have ruled in favor of taxpayers who claimed that distance and time are required by the law then on may 25 2006 the treasury department announced that the department of justice will longer pursue litigation and the internal revenue service irs will issue refunds of tax on longdistance service for the past three years taxpayers will be able to apply for refunds on their 2006 tax forms to be filed in 2007 5 more precisely collection of the tax on long distance telephone service and bundled local and long distance service including cell phone service ended after july 31 2006 taxpayers who are charged under localonly telephone service plan or plan that separates charges for local and long distance services continue to have the tax collected on their local service charges6 officemax inc v united states argued before the 6th circuit court of appeals on july 29 2005 and decided on november 2 2005 highlights the legal issues and arguments that eventually led to the announcement above terminating collection of the tax on long distance services7 officemax challenged the legality of the excise tax in claims made on april 6 2002 and february 13 2003 and requested full refund of excise taxes paid of 38029672 officemax argued that its phone service provider mci was not providing telephonic quality communication for which there is toll charge which varies in amount with the distance and elapsed transmission time of each individual communication 8 emphasis in the original the officemax toll telephone service charges ie long distance were based primarily on elapsed transmission time and not distance thus officemax argued the phone service offered by mci was not as defined in tax law and therefore not subject to the telephone excise tax on november 4 26 usc 4252b1 irc 4252b defines toll telephone service to mean 1 telephonic quality communication for which there is toll charge which varies in amount with the distance and elapsed transmission time of each individual communication and b the charge is paid within the united states and 2 service which entitles the subscriber upon payment of periodic charge determined as flat amount or upon the basis of total elapsed transmission time to the privilege of an unlimited number of telephonic communications to or from all or substantial portion of the persons having telephone or radio telephone stations in specified area which is outside the local telephone system area in which the station provided with this service is located 5 irs notice 200650 internal revenue bulletin 200625 june 19 2006 6 ibid 7 officemax inc v united states 428 f3d 583 6th cir 2005 on march 30 2006 the court denied the governments motion for

g345g5612 2005 the 6th circuit court of appeals concluded that toll charge must vary by both distance and elapsed transmission time in order to be taxed we thus hold for the taxpayer and affirm9 the officemax ruling was one of several irs losses in court on this issue10 because of the continued irs court losses volume of pending suit s and willingness of the treasury department to eliminate the tax the potential loss of revenue was foreseen and factored into federal revenue projections at the time11 the cbo revenue projection for telephone excise taxes assumed that there is significant likelihoodabout 75 percentthat the irs will acquiesce or lose those cases by 2007 and the tax on toll services will be terminated12 on august 31 2006 the irs announced individual taxpayers would be able to file for standard refund that varied from 30 to 60 based on family size13 the refund request would be filed along with the individual income tax return for the 2006 tax year taxpayers also had the option of analyzing old telephone bills and submitting claim for actual taxes paid since february 23 2003 some taxpayers have challenged the refund method arguing that taxpayers should be able to claim refund for telephone excise taxes paid before february 28 2003 as well 14 the refunds to have been issued in 2007 were expected to approach 13 billion actual refund requests appear to be falling short of expected totals in april 2007 the government accountability office gao released report detailing the telephone tax refund requests by individual taxpayers as of march 24 200715 in this report gao segmented individual filers into those taxpayers who were obliged to file tax returns based on economic activity separate from the telephone tax and those taxpayers who had obliga tion to file taxes approximately twothirds of the returns received from individuals who were otherwise obliged to file included request for the telephone tax refund in contrast only about 2 of the projected 10 million to 30 million requests from individuals without tax filing obligation were received in addition to challenging the refund method in court in at least one case taxpayer has argued that the lower than expected number of requests for refunds received by the irs so far indicates that many of those eligible for refund have not been adequately notified 16 9 id at 58485 10 see am bankers ins

the debate surrounding the future of the remaining excise tax on local phone service continues it is perhaps instructive to evaluate the tax from an economic perspective economists and public finance experts typically evaluate tax using the following criteria first how simple is the tax to administer second is the tax an equitable tax or do taxpayers in similar economic situations encounter dissimilar tax liability equity could also be measured by the change in burden as income rises or the degree of progressivity and third does the tax generate revenue efficiently g3g141g150g146g151g146g156g157g155g138g157g146g159g142g561g5g152g150g153g149g142g161g146g157g162g561 the 3 telephone excise tax is relatively easy to administer because third party telecommunications companies collects the tax for the irs enforcement is also relatively simple as service providers could stop providing service for nonpayment of taxes note however that collecting the telephone excise tax on behalf of the irs does increase the complexity of tax compliance for telecommunications companies the termination of the tax on long distance services could increase the complexity as telephone service providers will need to account separately for long distance and local services nevertheless from the perspective of the federal government the telephone excise tax is simple and almost costless to administer g7g154g158g146g157g162g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 economists usually evaluate the equity of tax in two directions horizontal and vertical the repeal of the excise tax on long distance services has marginally improved horizontal equity while vertical equity has worsened evaluating horizontal equity entails comparing the tax liability of similarly situated individuals evaluating vertical equity entails comparing the tax liability of tax units residing in different income levels the degree of progressivity or regressivity of tax is an oftenused descriptor of vertical equity g10g152g155g146g163g152g151g157g138g149g561g142g154g158g146g157g162g561 the telephone excise tax does not treat similarly situated individuals equally thus deviating from the principle of horizontal equity two families of the same size and income level could pay significantly different federal taxes based on local telephone service charges horizontal equity in public finance means like individuals or families based on income or consumption should encounter roughly the same tax liability with the telephone excise tax two families with roughly the same total consumption or income could pay different more or less federal taxes because of differences in the amount charged for their local telephone services the recent treasury announcement ending the tax on long distance services likely increased the horizontal equity of the tax as the variation in local telephone service costs do not vary as dramatically as long distance services continued 28t irs efforts to publicize information about the telephone tax refunds can be examined in part from information on the irs website available at httpwwwirs govnewsroomarticle0id16403200html

local telephone and long distance local telephone service is generally believed to be normal good necessity and long distance service more like luxury progressive tax regime is characterized by high income taxpayers paying larger share of their income in taxes17 typically economists and political theorists posit that vertically equitable tax regime is progressive tax regime18 excise taxes are almost always classified as regressive taxes since they do not take into account the individuals ability to pay the telephone excise tax on local telephone service which does not vary by level of consumption or income is regressive tax in contrast the now eliminated telephone excise tax on long distance telephone service service which could be considered more akin to luxury was less regressive19 as noted above regressive tax is generally not considered vertically equitable g7g143g143g146g140g146g142g151g140g162g561 repeal of the excise tax on toll and wireless services has on balance improved the telephone excise taxs economic efficiency economic theory and public finance experts posit that tax should not change the consumption decisions of taxpayers changing the consumption patterns of taxpayers results in the skewed allocation of re sources away from the taxed good to other goods the loss in economic efficiency can sometimes exceed the revenue generated by the tax if consumption patterns change significantly on the other hand optimal tax theory suggests that goods with very inelastic demand ie demand that does not change much with change in prices should face relatively higher taxes the logic behind this theory is that in general government should not be influencing economic decisions therefore because tax policy is tool of government tax policy s hould attempt to avoid influencing or changing the economic decisions of individuals the less individuals change their behavior in response to tax ie price increase the more the economic efficiency loss is minimized though compelling in theory for equity and fairness reasons applying optimal tax theory would seem misplaced for telecommunications services generally and local telephone services specifically excise taxes are sometimes justified either to correct for market failure or to discourage consumption of good or service to ultimately benefit society economic efficiency is improved in both scenarios with some type of selective tax the telephone excise tax however is unlike the other prominent selective excise taxes for example the gasoline excise tax is often identified as tax designed to correct market failure in this case the market failure is the inability of the 17 some economists use the term equal sacrifice equal sacrifice relies on the tenet that the last dollar of income is worth less to highincome taxpayer than to lowincome taxpayer 18 the degree of progressivity is not as well settled for purposes he re it is assumed that even mildly progressive tax regime would achieve vertical equity 19 jerry hausman taxation by telecommunications regulation national bureau of economic research working paper 6260 november 1997 p 12 an income elasticity of greater than one means for example that 1 increase in income generates greater than 1 increase in demand for good hausman states that the income elasticity of demand of long distance demand is about 10 this implies that long distance service could be luxury good httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33382g22g145g142g561g22g142g149g142g153g145g152g151g142g561g7 g161g140g146g156g142g561g22g138g161g497

burning fossil fuels the gasoline excise tax it is argued helps correct this market failure through internalizing this cost and is therefore an efficiency improving tax20 excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol on the other nd are not correcting for an explicit market failure supporters of these so called taxes argue that the negative impact on society of alcohol and tobacco consumption merit taxing these goods to discourage their consumption economic theory suggests that if an excise tax does not correct for some market failure or does not intend to achieve some societal goal then the tax almost certainly reduces overall economic efficiency the telephone excise tax does not meet either criterion21 nevertheless if local service is indeed necessity the remaining tax on local telephone services is very efficient in that taxpayers cannot easily change behavior to avoid the tax g22g142g149g142g153g145g152g151g142g561g7g161g140g146g156g142g561g22g138g161g561g20g142g159g142g151g158g142g561 although the telephone excise tax generated 50 billion in revenue in fy2006 this revenue represents just 021 of total federal revenue table 1 reports the revenue generated by the telephone tobacco and alcohol excise taxes since fy1998 these excise taxes individually represent relatively small portion of total excise revenue collected table 1 also reports the projected revenue generated by the taxes in fy2017 and the percentage of total federal revenue generated by the telephone excise tax the cbo estimates that telephone excise tax revenue will comprise at most 100 million of total federal revenue in 2017 this sharp relative decline reflects the cbo belief at the time the estimates were published that the irs will lose the revenue generated by the excise tax on toll telephone services

companion hr 1898 would have repealed the telephone excise tax entirely22 on june 28 2006 s 1321 was approved by the senate finance committee by voice vote the house version was sponsored by representative gary miller and it had bipartisan support with 220 cosponsors as of september 7 2006 in february 2007 the cbo estimated that repeal of the remaining excise tax on local telephone services would cost approximately 33 billion over th 2008 to 2017 budget window23 in the 110th congress s 140 and s 170 would repeal the remaining tax on local services and s 1123 would provide to businesses an extension for filing refund request and safe harbor protection when using the formula for calculating refunds created by the bill in the house hr 1194 continues to add cosponsors currently 116 and would also repeal the remaining tax on local telephone services supporters of the repeal legislation cite the efficiency losses associated with the tax as well as the regressive characteristics of the tax described earlier in this report opponents of outright repeal cite the revenue loss if the tax were completely repealed bolstering this argument is the size of the current

g350g561provisions of economic growth tax and relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 107 16 12 trillion are cited by opponents of further tax cuts such as telephone excise tax repeal25 opponents of repeal also note the administrative simplicity of the tax and its relatively high compliance rate one intermediate option that would improve the economic efficiency of the tax would be to amend existing law so that all communications services are taxed at the same rate without credits or transfers to lowerincome taxpayers however the tax would still fail the test of vertical equity horizontal equity would also suffer as differen t consumption choices would change the burden of taxes across equally situated individuals from an economic perspective the repeal of the excise tax on toll and wireless services has had uneven effects the repeal has increased the regressivity of the telephone excise tax but marginally improved its economic efficiency economic efficiency has been improved because local services are practically speaking necessity and as such individuals would not change their behavior in response to the tax at least in th near term vertical equity suffers for the same reason efficiency is increased local services are typically levied at fixed rate thus lower income taxpayers will encounter the same tax liability as highincome taxpayers horizontal equity may be marginally improved as tax liability would not depend on consumption of long distance services and charges for local services would not vary across taxpayers how telecommunications companies respond to changes in the tax law will likely have significant effect on the overall efficiency and equity of retooled telephone excise tax regime
