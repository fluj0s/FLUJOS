divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30927the federal minimum wage the issue of indexation summary periodically congress has considered proposals to index the federal minimum wage indexation would result in regular automatic adjustments in the minimum wage using changes in an economic measur such as consumer prices the cost of living hourly labor costs or hourly wages if indexation were imple mented the approach dopted could well depend on congress view of the rationale for ving statutory minimum wage several arguments have been made in support of minimum wage these arguments include providing living wage and ensuring that fair wage is paid in labor markets that do not fit the model of perfect competition these reasons do not prescribe the level at which the minimum wage should be set but they do suggest what kind of economic measure could be used for indexation living wage can be defined in either real or relative terms maintaining the real value of the minimum wage would maintain its constant purchasing power to maintain real value of the minimum wage the wage could be indexed to changes in the cost of living or alternatively to changes in the price of consumption goods maintaining relative value of the minimum wage would maintain its value compared to other wages to maintain relative value of the minimum wage the wage could be indexed to measure of hour ly labor costs or hourly earnings the standard of living tends to rise ove r time because of imp rovements in labor productivity and advances in technology th at result in new or improved products therefore maintaining the relative value of the minimum wage would likely increase its real value over time both the real and relative values of the minimum wage have varied noticeably over time therefore the future value of the minimum wage if indexed would depend importantly on the initial value or base period selected the initial value could be the real or relative value of the minimum wage at the time indexation is adopted or as congress has done with othe r federal programs so future or past value could be used using six different economic measures calculations show that if the minimum wage were indexed using its highest or median past real or relative value as the base period the minimum wage in september 2006 or the end of 2005 depending on the measure would have been higher than 515 for four of the six measures the minimum wage reached its peak real value in february 1968 the other two measures were not available in 1968 depending on the measure used if the 160 minimum wage of february 1968 had been indexed the minimum wage in september 2006 would have been between 776 and 946 an hour on the other hand three of the six measures show that if indexation were to use the base period when the minimum wage was at its lowest real value the minimum wage in september 2006 would have been less than 515 this report will only be updated

515 to 725 an hour1 periodically congress has also considered the issue of indexation which would result in regula r automatic adjustments in the minimum wage using changes in an economic measure such as consumer prices the cost of living labor costs or hourly wages2 this report examines several aspects of the issue of indexing the basic federal minimum wage if indexation were impleme nted the approach adopted could well depend on congress view of the rationale for having minimum wage therefore the report discusses the major arguments that have been made in support of minimum wage some economic measures th at could be used for indexation appear to be more consistent than others with the major arguments for minimum wage therefore the report also examines several economic measures that could be used for indexation finally if indexation were adopted the future value of the minimum wage would depend not only on the economic measure used but also on the base period selected ie initial value of th minimum wage using different economic measures and base periods the report illustrates what the minimum wage would have been in september 2006 or the end of 2 005 pending on the

when the minimum wage was raised reasons for minimum wage if indexation were implemented the pproach adopted would likely depend on congress view of the reasons for havi ng minimum wage several reasons have been offered to justify statutory minimu m wage these reasons include to provide living wage to improve the likelihood that fair wage will be paid in labor markets that do not fit the model of perfect co mpetition and to increase aggregate demand9 these reasons do not prescribe the level at which the minimum wage should be set but they do suggest what kind of economic measures could be used for indexation figure 1 value of the federal minimum wagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30927crs4 10 in this report the term goods refers to both goods and services 11 under perfect competition economists say that sellers in this case individuals who are selling their labor services are selling relatively homogeneous good living wage common argument made in support of statutory minimum wage is that worker should be paid less than living wage living wage can be defined in either real terms or relative to the wages of other workers whether defined in real or relative terms living wage could be adjusted periodically through separate legislative acts alternatively the real or relative value of living wage could be adjusted regularly through indexation in real terms living wage can be fined as wage that provides given standard of living this standard of living can be represented by basket of consumer goods consisting of food shelter clothing nd other goods and services the size of the basket of goods could provi subsistence or higher standard of living indexing the minimum wage to maintain its real or constant value would maintain the ability of minimum wage earne rs working given number of hours to purchase this basket of goods10 living wage can also be defined relative to the wages of other workers or more specifically relative to the wages of given category of workers indexing the minimum wage to preserve its relative value would maintain the position of minimum wage workers relative to other workers real wages tend to rise as productivity increases therefore mainta ining the relative value of the minimum wage would likely raise the standard of living of minimum wage workers as productivity increased the minimum wage w ould purchase an expanding basket of goods economic efficiency second argument made in support of statutory minimum wage is that the opportunities for employment are not the same for all individuals and that minimum wage is one way to ensure fair wage for all workers employed in jobs that require limited skills the economic argument for fair wage is that the labor markets for lowwage work may not fit the economic model of perfect competition and that minimum wage is one way to improve economic efficiency fair wage is defined here as the wage paid in labor markets that fit the model of perfect competition the following are the main features of perfectly competitive labor market 1 there are many employers buyers and many workers sellers therefore individual employer or employee is able to influence wages or employment ie em ployer or employee has market power 2 an employer does not prefer one worker over anothe r equally qualified wo rker ie equally qualified workers are perfect substitutes 11 likewise worker does not prefer one employer over another employer who pays th same wage for the same kind of work 3 employers and employees including potential employees have equal access

cited as reynolds et labor economics and labor relations 13 an efficient allocation of resources may nevertheless result in socially unacceptable distribution of income leading many citizens to favor public policies that result in more equal distribution of income 14 for discussion of departures from the model of perfect competition sometimes called market failures see joseph stiglitz economics of the public sector 2nd ed new york ww norton co 1988 pp 7181 15 monopsonist also tends to hi gher fewer workers than woul d an otherwise identical firm in competitive labor market walter nicholson microeconomic theory 4th ed chicago dryden press 1989 pp 63033 639labor market information eg about j ob vacancies and wage rates which is available at little or cost ie there is perfect information 4 investors in order to maximize profits are free to invest where they will earn the greatest return individuals in order to maximize their total satisfaction or utility are free to move in and out of the labor for ce and from one job to another12 according to standard economic analysis perfect competition results in the most efficient allocation of resour ces ie capital labor and na tural resources in turn an efficient allocation of resources pr ovides the greatest amount of output and consumer satisfaction from given supply of inputs13 if labor markets for lowwage jobs do not fit the model of perfect comp etition standard economic analysis indicates that governments could it they choose in tervene to improve economic efficiency it is sometimes argued that labor markets for lowwage jobs may not fit the model of perfect competition14 for instance employers and workers in lowwage labor markets may have une qual market power employ ers and workers may have unequal access to labor market information or some employers may not treat equally qualified workers as perfect substitutes an example of where an employer is able to influence wages is labor market characterized by single large employer called monopsonist in this kind of labor market an employer is able to pay lower wages than would exist in competitive labor market15 an example of where employers and workers may have unequal access to information is labor market where some workers lack the means or ability to communicate effectively with employers or employment agencies eg because of language differences or where lack of adequate transportation limits the ability of workers to find and compare j ob vacancies an example of where an employer may not treat equally qualified workers as perfect substitutes is where an employer or employees for whatever reason discriminate against certain group or groups of persons if it is believed that workers in lowwage labor markets are at disadvantage in obtaining information about jobs or in bargaining over wages with employers one of the ways that governments can attempt to improve economic efficiency is to enact statutory minimum wage see are there other policy options belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30927crs6 16 an overall consensus has not been reached on the employment effects of raising the minimum wage if the minimum wage is raised more when unemployment is rising than when it is falling the effect on job loss may be greater when the shortterm objective is to reduce unemployment from this perspective indexation may be less harmful to employment than policy of enacting larger increases in the minimum wage when unemployment is rising the effect of an increase in the minimum wage on the aggregate earnings of minimum wage workers depends on the elasticity of demand for minimum wage labor aggregate earnings will increase if the percentage decrease in minimum wage employment is less than the percentage increase in the minimum wage ie if demand for minimum wage workers is inelastic most st udies have found that the demand for lowwage workers is inelastic paul samuelson and william d nordhaus microeconomics 16th ed new york mcgrawhill 1998 p 76increase aggregate demand one of the reasons given to justify minimum wage when it was first enacted in 1938 was that it would increase the purch asing power of lowwage workers and therefore increase aggregate demand and reduce unemployment in the 1930s the united states was in period of prolonged high unemployment indexation would probably be inconsistent however with policy of using the minimum wage to manage shortterm aggregate demand firs t when economic growth is slowing or the economy is contracting fiscal and m onetary policy can put more money in the hands of consumers eg thr ough tax cuts increased gove rnment spending or lower interest rates using the minimum wage for this purpose would imply that the minimum wage should be raised only when unemployment is rising or at least that increases should be greater when unemploym ent is rising than when it is falling indexation on the other hand would result in regular adjustments in the minimum wage whether unemployment is rising or falling second indexation could raise the minimum wage less or even reduce it when unemployment is rising than when it is falling wages and prices often rise more rapidly when the economy is expanding and unemployment is falling conversely wa ges and prices often rise more slowly and may even fall when the economy is contracting and unemployment is rising thus although the effect may not be large indexation could result in larger increases in the minimum wage during an economic expansion when unemployment is falling than during an economic slowdown or cont raction when unemployment is rising legislation to index the minimum wage could however include mechanism to accelerate the increase in the wage rate when unemployment is rising and slow the increase when unemployment is falling16 indexing the minimum wage developing legislation to index the minimum wage would involve two basic decisions 1 choosing an economic meas ure to be used for indexation and 2 selecting the initial value of the minimu m wage implementation would involve additional decisions such as how often to adjust the minimum wage and how actually to calculate the adjustment in the minimum wage from the economic measure chosen eg whether to use annual changes in th index septembert oseptember changes or some other approachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30927crs7 17 for more

d at some point in the past selecting an economic measure although the reasons commonly given for having minimum wage do not prescribe the level at which the minimum wa ge should be set they do

some are pr oduced monthly while others are produced quarterly maintaining the real value of the minimum wage if the main reason for minimum wage is to maintain the real standard of living of minimum wage workers the wage could be indexed to changes in the cost of living or changes in the price of consumption goods consumer price index in its simplest form price index measures the change in the cost of given basket of goods between two time periods eg from one month to the next or from one year to the next the consumer price index cpi is probably the most widely known pr ice index the cpi is

business vol 78 mar 1998 p 38 24 the federal government produces many price indexes several of which would be continuedindividual income tax brackets19 one advantage of using the cpi for indexation is that unlike most other economic measures the published index is rarely revised the method for producing the index is revised however20 cost of living index strictly speaking the cpi is not cost of living index cost of living index measures chan ges in the price of basket of goods that maintains constant standard of living or wellbeing21 the composition of this basket of goods is not fixed but changes over time for example the relative prices of goods may change causing consumers to spend more on goods whose prices have fallen relative to the prices of other goods similarly consumer tastes may change or new or improved products may be in troduced the cpi may not immediately capture changes in consumer spending pa tterns thus when consumers switch to goods that have fallen in pr ice relative to the prices of other goods the cpi does not automatically take into account the increas ed consumption of the lowerpriced goods accordingly whether the cpi rises or falls many believe that changes in the index may overstate changes in the cost of living22 the bureau of economic analysis bea of the us depar tment of commerce produces price indexes that are closer to cost of living index than price index that does not take into account changes in consum er spending habits these indexes are called chaintype price indexes the chain type price index for personal consumption expenditures pce combin price index for consumption expenditures based on spending patterns for previous time period with price index based on spending patterns for current time period23 this index allows for changes in consumer spending habits over time24httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30927crs9 24 continued inconsistent with the commonly stated purposes of the minimum wage for example bea prepares two indexes that are based on economy wide changes in prices these indexes are the gross national product gnp deflator nd the gross domestic product gdp deflator gnp includes the sum of personal consumption private investment government spending and net exports gdp is the sum of domestic expenditures for consumption investment and government goods thus while both these indexes capture changes in the prices of consumption goods they also capture changes in prices of investment goods eg buildings and machinery and government spending eg military equipment to maintain its real or constant value th minimum wage could be indexed to changes in measure of constant poverty level of income the federal government publishes official poverty thresholds for families of different size and composition these poverty thresholds are used in estimating the number of poor in the united states the poverty income guidelines used to administer several fede ral programs are developed from the official poverty thresholds the thresholds are adjusted each year using changes in the cpiu thus indexing the minimum wage to changes in the official poverty thresholds would yield the same results as indexing the minimum wage to the cpiu 25 in the long term labor productivity may increase because of increases in physical capital eg equipment per worker and human capita l eg education and training per worker as well as advances in technology shorter term changes in labor productivity may occur because of changes in the utilization of res ources over the business cycle or because of changes in the composition of the workforce eg labor productivity may change if the average age of the workforce increases or decreases 26 reynolds et labor economics and labor relations p 256 27 from about the mid1970s to the mid1990s real average hourly wages fell for production workers in manufacturing and for production workers in the private nonfarm sector the timing and magnitude of changes depend on wh ich price index and which measure of hourly wages are usedmaintaining the relative value of the minimum wage if the main reason for minimum wage is to maintain the value of the minimum wage relative to the wages of other workers the wage could be indexed to measure of hourly labor costs or of hourly earnings indexing the minimum wage to price or cost of living index would maintain the constant value of the minimum wage however the overall standard of living tends to improve over time because of incr eases in labor productivity and because of advances in technology that re sult in new or improved products25 therefore maintaining the relative value of the minimum wage would likely increase its real value over time an index of labor costs or measure of hourly wages may reflect increases in labor productivity perhaps not completely accordingly indexing the minimum wage to such measure would tend to raise the real purchasing power of minimum wage workers26 during some periods maintaining the relative value of the minimum wage could lower the standard of living of minimum wage workers27 this could happen if wages or labor costs increase more slowly than inflation however legislation to index the minimum wage could prohibit re duction in the real value of the wage in addition the real value of the minimum wage would differ if it is indexed to

improving the efficiency of labor markets if the main reason for minimum wage is to improve the efficiency of lowwage labor markets the wage could be indexed to measure of hourly labor costs hourly

following years also the eci and the two measures of hourly earnings generally increased more than the pce or either cpi index the eci and the measures of hourly earnings likely reflect increases in

source calculations by crs note unless noted otherwise calculations of annual percentage changes are through september 2006 calculations of annual percentage changes are through 2005 the initial value of the minimum wage if the minimum wage were indexed its future value would depend not only on the economic measure used for indexation but also on the initial value or base period selected the main reasons given to justify minimum wage do not prescribe the initial real or relative value that shoul d be used for indexation ie they do not prescribe the size of the initial basket of goods for instance single nationwide minimum wage may not provide the same real or relative standard of living in all circumstances families differ in size th number of workers and their hourly wage rates the total number of hours work ed and the amount of nonwage income therefore living wage for single parent of teenage or daughter may not behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30927crs14 44 at the beginning of 2007 over half the states and the distri ct of columbia have minimum wage rates that are higher than the basi c federal minimum wage crs report rl33754 minimum wage in the 110th congress several cities and c ounties have also adopted living wage laws these laws typically appl to employers that receive city contracts or tax benefits and sometimes to the city itself the laws generally require wage that would provide an employee working full time with at least povertylevel of income the poverty level is based on either local or federal standards and is often defined according to the poverty level for family of four living wage is often defined to include health insurance 45 in economic terms firm will hire an add itional worker if the extra revenue is greater than or equal to the workers wage ie ma rginal revenue is greater than or equal to marginal cost unlike firm in competitive labor market however monopsonist is able to influence wages for monopsonist the cost of hiring an additional worker is equal to that workers wage plus the higher wage that must be paid to current workers ie marginal cost is greater than average cost mandated minimum wage can raise the average wage paid by monopsonist if the minimum wage is higher than the average wage that monopsonist would otherwise pay mini mum wage can result in an increase in employment because it can lower the additional co st of hiring an extra worker ie marginal cost may equal average cost it is the wer marginal cost that induces monopsonist to hire more workers ronald g ehrenberg and robert s smith modern labor economics theory and public policy new york addisonwesley 2000 pp 7984 46 ibid p 85the same as living wage for dependent teenager in addition the cost of living varies from one city or state to another however for the federal government single nationwide minimum wage may be easier to administer than several subnational minimum wage rates states and cities can also adopt minimum wage rates that are higher than the federal minimum wage44 if labor markets are not perfectly competitive minimum wage could improve economic efficiency for instance in the case of monopsony minimum wage could raise wages and increase employment45 however determining the appropriate wage may be difficult if the wage is t at too high level monopsonist may hire fewer rather than more workers46 similarly if labor markets do not meet the model of perfect competition because of imperfect information or discr imination the federal government can enact minimum wage for workers who are at disadvantaged in obtaining information about jobs or in ne gotiating fair wage but again it may be difficult to determine what the appropriate minimum wage rate should be here too single nationwide minimum wage may not be the wage that corrects instances of imperfect competition in all labor markets although the main reasons given to ju stify minimum wage do not prescribe the value at which the minimum wage should be set with indexation the future value of the minimum wage would depend importantly on the initial value selected the initial value of the minimum wage used for indexation could be the current january 2007 value of 515 an hour alternatively as congress has done occasionally with other federal programs the ba period could be some futu re or past value of the wage indexation could begin in the year that legislation is enacted or in some future year the minimum wage could be raised and indexation could begin at some time in the future past value of the minimum wage could also be used as the base periodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30927crs15 47 crs issue brief ib86133 tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 by stacey m kean and david l brumbaugh this issue brief is not active but is available from the

personal exemptions and the individual income tax brackets are indexe d for inflation the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 used the value of the pers onal exemption in future year as the base year for indexation the act raised the personal exemptions in three steps from 1080 for 1986 to 2000 for 1989 under the 1986 act indexation began in 1990 using 1989 as the base year47 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 added two new marginal income tax rates eff ective for 1993 indexation of these two tax brackets began in 1995 using 1993 as the base year48 base periods used for illustrations using different economic measures it is not possible to project what the min imum wage would be in the future without projecting what the economic measures them selves would be for instance if the minimum wage were increased it would not be possible to project what the minimum wage would be in five or ten years w ithout projecting what the economic measure used for indexation would be however it is possible to calculate what the minimum wage would be today if it had been inde xed at some point in the past the illustrations below use three historical values for the minimum wage when the minimum wage was at its highest real or relative level when it was at its lowest real or relative level and when it was at its median historical value49 depending on the price index or wage measure in the illustrations below the base period that defines when the minimum wage reached its highest or lowest levels may be month calendar quarter or calendar year als only two of the measures have been available since 1938 therefore the base periods selected are affected not only by differences in the economic measures but also by the availability of data the method used to select the base peri ods is explained in more detail in appendix illustrations tables 2 through 7 show what the federal minimu m wage would have been in september 2006 if it had been indexed using the six economic measures and the three base periods descri bed above the illustrations us economic measures that are consistent with the reasons for having minimum wage however because of differences in the initial values of the minimum wage and in the availability of data the illustrations should not be used to co mpare how the different economic measures would affect the minimum wa ge rate under indexation the results shown in table 2 are based on calculations using the cpiw the first row shows that if the minimum wage were indexed from the point when it reached its highest real value february 1968 the minimum wage in septemberhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30927crs16 2006 would have been 925 instead of 515 on the other hand if the base period was the point when the minimum wage was at is lowest real value the minimum wage in september 2006 would have been 323 if the minimum wage were indexed from the point when it was at its median historical value the minimum wage in september 2006 would have been 614 the results shown in table 3 are based on calculations using the cpiurs this measure is available for the years 1977 through 2005 the first row shows that if the minimum wage

value the minimum wage at the end of 2005 would have been 496 if th minimum wage were indexed from the point when it was at its median historical value the minimum wage at the end of 2005 would have been 578 the price index used in the calculations in table 4 is the chaintype price index for personal consumption expenditures the first row shows that if the minimum wage were indexed at the point when it was at its highest real value the first quarter of 1968 the minimum wage in septem ber 2006 would have been 776 if indexation began from the point when the minimum wage was at its lowest real

been 580 tables 5 through 7 use economic measures that would maintain the relative value of the minimum wage each of th measures was developed after 1938 when the federal minimum wage was first enacted for these measures selecting the highest and lowest values of the minimum wage depends on the availability of data each of the measures shows that the r eal minimum wage in september 2006 or the end of 2005 for the eci was at its lowe st value in september 2006 the minimum wage of 515 was equal to 321 of aver age hourly earnings of production workers in manufacturing and 305 of averag hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers both measures of average hourly earnings show that the minimum wage reached its peak real value in february 1968 in that month the 160 minimum wage was equal to 590 of the average hourly earnings of production workers in manufacturing and 542 of averag hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers if the februa ry 1968 minimum wage

are there other policy options this paper does not examine how the minimum wage or an increase in the minimum wage compares to alternative policy options for achieving the same objectives however some policymakers argue that minimum wage is not the only or best way to address the issues of living wage or of labor market efficiency other ways of providing family with living wage include policies to increase worker productivity examples of these kinds of policies in clude investment in incomeproducing human capital eg education and training increased saving for investment in plant and equipment to increase the amount of physical capital and output per worker and advances in t echnology to improve productivity workers skills or both for most families wages are not the only source of income other ways of providing family with minimum level of income include income redistribution policies examples of income redistribution policies include transfer payments such as those made under the temporary assi stance to needy families tanf program and refundable tax credits like the earned income tax credit eitc and child tax credit ctc the wages of lessskilled workers could also be raised with policies that increase their bargaining power exampl of these kinds of policies include legislation to expand unionization or to improve employment opportunities for minority workers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30927crs20 appendix method used for selecting the base periods to illustrate the effects of indexing the minimum wage given statutory minimum wage this re port does not address the issue of the level at which the minimum wage is set instead for each of the six economic measures considered the illustrations of what the minimum wage would have been in september 2006 or the end of 2005 depe nding on the measure if it had been indexed use three different base periods or initial values of the minimum wage 1 when the minimum wage was at its highest real or relative level 2 when the minimum wage was at its lowest real or relative level and 3 when the minimum wage was at its median real or relative value to explain the method used in selec ting the three base periods consider table 2 to select the months when the minimum wage was at its highest and lowest real values the actual minimum wage for each month from october 1938 through august 2006 was inflated to septem ber 2006 dollars using the monthly cpiw in other words the october 1938 minimum wage of 025 was inflated to september 2006 dollars using the increase in the cp iw from october 1938 to september 2006 likewise the november 1938 minimu m wage of 025 was inflated to september 2006 dollars using the change in the cpiw from november 1938 to september 2006 following this approach the actual minimum wage for each month from october 1938 through august 2006 was inflated to september 2006 dollars the highest and lowest real values of the minimum wage along with the median value were selected from these results in ptember 2006 dollars the highest real value of the minimum wage was the 160 wage that was in effect in february 1968 in september 2006 dollars the february 1968 wage of 160 was equal to 925 the procedure used to identify the highest and lowest values of the minimum wage for table 2 was repeated for tables 3 through 7 the base periods are affected however by the availability of da ta of the six economic measures used only the cpiw is available on monthly basis from october 1938 through september 2006 the other measures are either produced on quarterly basis available on an annual basis for earlier year s or were not veloped until after 1938 if congress were to index the minimum wage the actual implementation would likely follow different procedure than that used here to identify the highest lowest and median historical values of the minimum wage for example if the minimum wage were adjusted each january the ad justment might be based on the annual changes in an economic measure where each 12month period ends with the prior septemberhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30927crs21 appendix b comparison of economic measures figures 2 and 3 show the annual
