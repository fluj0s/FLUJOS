government an introduction summary during the past two decades the privatiz ation of federal ag encies and activities has been much debated that sai d privatization here defined as the use of the private sector in the provision of good or service the components of which include financing operations supplying produc tion delivery and quality control is not recent phenomenon since its founding in 1789 the federal government has used private firms to provide goods and services hence privatization in all its forms which include contracting out vouchers and prize competitions is of perennial interest to congress this report is an introduction to priv atization in the fe deral governmental context it discusses the emergence of privatization on the federal policy agenda in the late 1970s and early 1980s to some priv atization appeared as an answer to the purported failures of big g overnment priv atization attracted political support due to its rhetorically persuasive rationales purported benefits and political attractiveness however privatization also has been controversial critics have complained that privatization is form of union busting and that privatization can have unforseen and unde sirable consequences this report also supplies typology of the various means through which federal agencies and activities have been privatized the typology shows that privatization is not an eitheror proposition rather privatization as this reports definition implies is matter of degree policymaker s may transfer to the private sector one or more of the components of governme nt provision of goods and services however many they deem appropriate next the report explains the dis tinction between privatization and marketization an alte rnative to privatization whic h is the structuring of government agency so that it provides goods and services in the efficient manner of private firm marketization retains an activity within the governmental sector privatization moves the components of an activity to the private sector this distinction is significant because entities w ithin these differing sectors tend to behave differently private sector firms tend to be selfdirecting and profitseeking government agencies tend to be processoriented and pursue the multiple and sometimes conflicting goals assigned to them by congress and the president hence policymakers who wish to improve an agencys efficiency or performance but are leery of privatization may find ma rketization an attractive option finally the report notes that whenever policymakers consider privatizing federal agency or activity fundamental issue arises which activities are essential to the state and should rema in directly accountable to the elected representatives of the people and which ma be carried out by the private sector this question is complex and valueladen definitive answer exists thus the decision to privatize is i nherently controversial this report will not be

around the world3 privatization is an idea that has attr acted both strong dherents and vociferous critics privatization reached the federa l policy agenda in the united states more than two decades ago and each congress features new bills proposing to either expand or halt the movement of federal governmental activities to the private sector in recent years president george w bush has advocated the privatization of military housing and the expansion of oppor tunities for private organizations to provide social and community services as part of his g overnment management agenda4 moreover the president supported the provision of housing and schooling vouchers to persons displaced by hurricane katrina and the creation of medicare prescription drug benefit provided by private firms5

has been of mixed mind regarding privatization enacting policies that both limit and expand the priv ate sectors access to federal funds to provide governmental services congress has enacted statutes eg pl 104193 sec 104 pl 106 554 sec 1 that permit private groups including notforprofits and religious organizations to pply for grants to provide social services such as substance abuse counseling and employment training previously offered by government agencies6 during the 110th congress the house approved bill that would impose one year moratorium on conversion to contractor performance of department of defense functions at military medical facilities hr 1538 section 301 privatization however is not recent phenomenon since the founding of the republic the federal governme nt has hired or contracted with private firms to provide public goods and services for ex ample congress enact ed statute in 1789 that declared that it shall be the duty of the secretary of the treasury to provide by contracts which shall be approved by the presid ent for building lighthouse near the entrance of the chesapeake bay and fo r rebuilding when necessary and keeping in good repair the light houses beacons buoys and public piers in the several states 1 stat 54 hence privatization has b een of perennial interest to congress and likely will continue to be so privatization definition economists political leaders and government officials tend to define privatization differently7 the breadth of activities covered by the term privatization varies greatly the congressional budget office cbo for example has defined privatiza tion narrowly to refer to activ ities that involve genuine sale of assets and termination of federal activity8 the oxford english dictionary meanwhile defines the term mo re broadly to mean the policy or process of makinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33777crs3 9 oxford english dictionary available at httpdictionaryoedcom 10 starr the meaning of privatization p 14 private as opposed to public9 perhaps most commonly privatization is used to refer to any shift of activities or functions from the state to the private sector10 all three of these definitions have valu arguably though it may be possible to define privatization mo re precisely privatiza tion might be defined as the use of the private sector in the provision of good or service the components of which include financing operations supplying production delivery and quality control this definition is useful to policymakers for three reasons first it enables policymakers who wish to improve the provision of good or service to see that privatization is not an eitheror propos ition rather privatiz ation is matter of degrees and there are myriad means as this report explicates through which the private sector may be brought into the pr ocess of the provision of good or service at minimum an agency might purchase office supplies such as printer paper pens and folders from private sector firm supplying alternatively government agency may more heavily utilize the private sector it might also hire notforprofit corporation to raise operating funds and contr act with private firms to assist in the provision of service supplying financing delivery taken furthest an agency might be abolished and privat firms allowed to provide good or service financing supplying production deliver and quality control second utilizing this definition also ma enable policymakers to see that fundamental values questi on lies beneath the issue of privatization whenever government must provide good or servi ce the question arises which components of provision ought to be done by the gove rnment and which might be done by the private sector different approaches to privatiza tion of the components of an agencys provision of goods and service may provoke more or less c ontroversy for example permitting an agency to hire private firm to assess its performance quality control may elicit some concern permitting this same agency to acquire funds by charging citizens fees financ ing may provoke wide spread criticism on the whole then the definition employed in this report may highlight for policymakers both the instrumental eg how and normative eg ought questions involved in privatization background the recent political salience of privatization the sources of the salience of priva tization are manifold but likely include privatizations rhetorically potent ra tionales purported benefits and political attractivenesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33777crs4 11 on the role of ideas and

leads bureaucrats in their own interest to serve the interests of the rest of us gordon tullock bureaucracy in gordon tullock ar thur seldon and go rdon l brady government continuedthe rhetorically potent rationales for privatization host of rationales has been employed to advance privatization as policy collectively though these arguments amount to criticism of the purported failures of big government11 in great part the contemporary priv atization movement has its intellectual roots in free market economic theory and public choice theory12 philosophically free market theory is skeptical of governme nt and is sanguine toward markets as one renowned exponent of markets has written economic arrangements play dual role in the promotion of free society on the one hand freedom in economic arrangements is itself component of freedom broadly understood so economic freedom is an end in itself in the second place economic freedom is also an indispensable means toward the achievement of political freedom13 from this perspective the great danger to freedom is the concentration of power in the hands of government economic freedom protects individual freedom by limiting the extent of political power14 free market theory generally speaking argues that markets not governments are the mo st efficient means for the production of goods and services in arguing for ma rkets and against government provision of goods and services free market advocates argue that gove rnment tends to behave as monopoly provider of goods and services as such it is inefficient inattentive to public wants and slow to reform and innovate public choice theory is near relation to free market economics15 one of public choice theorys criticisms of government is that public bureaucracies should not be viewed as neutral vehicles for delivering government goods and services rather it posits individual bureaucrats should be viewed as selfinterested actors not public spirited civil servants16 as each bureaucrat strives to achieve what he desires hehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33777crs5 16 continued failure primer in public choice washington cato institute 2002 p 53 17 gordon tullock the politics of

america the political seduction of the law new york free press 1990 chapter 2helps produce collective organizational pa thologies often termed government failures17 for example according to public choice theory the head of each administrative division of an agency shoul d be expected to seek to obtain the maximum possible funding for his division in order to justify this budget request he will devise ways to increase projected costs when each administrative head does this the collective result is greatly enla rged agency budget with funding priorities that are neither rational nor necessarily related to achieving the goals assigned to the agency by statute both free market economists and public choice theorists typically believe that the nature of the goods or services to be produced determines whether the private sector or government should produce it if the good is nonexcludable meaning that persons cannot be prevented from us ing it and nonrival meaning that one persons use of it does not dimin ish another persons use of it then it is public good and government should produce it an example of this sort of good is national defense as for goods that do not meet these criteria eg computers bullets housing priced at belowmarket rates for occupancy by lowincome persons free market economists and public choice theorist s tend to hold that private firms should be left to produce these items because they can do so most efficiently since public goods tend to be few this perspec tive amounts to an dvocacy of minimalist government and one that w ould have the government us private firms as much as it can to help it produce public goods there also have been political nd philosophical arguments that have encouraged privatization implicitly and explicitly primarily these arguments have come from conservatives and libertarians w ho wish to shrink the federal government some of these critics have complained bout the growth of behemoth federal government that accretes power at cost to the liberty of citizens18 other detractors of big government complain that th federal government has overstepped the bounds set for it by the constitution19 in both cases the argument is that government is doing things that it should not be doing and that it should desist from doing them these activities then would be left to the private sector which may or may not perform them still other critics of big government have explicitly advanced privatization as means for reducing the size of g overnment and the federal deficit it is the demand for public services that powers the growth of the government and there is systematic political imbalance between those who desire morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33777crs6 20 stuart butler privatizing federal spending new

reinventing government reading ma addison continuedspending and those who desire less an imbalance consistently favoring the prospending lobby powerful coalition of beneficiaries service suppliers political activists and bureaucrats tends to develop around each federal spending program it is in the interest of those coalitions to press congress for an expansion of the federal role20 privatization according to this perspectiv can diminish these political pressures by taking an activity out of the hands of t hose with an interest in its expansion bureaucrats would be replaced by private sector entrepreneurs and recipients of government goods and services would be tr ansformed into customers whereas the former persons had an interest in greater spending it is said the latter will favor low cost services these arguments for privatization have ttracted attention in part because they are rhetorically potent economics history and constitutional law all have been employed to argue against big government and for the superior ability of private firms to provide goods and services21 proponents of priv atization also have portrayed privatization as policy that promotes widelyesteemed values such as freedom and efficiency as tool for fighting the bugbears of intrusive and wasteful bureaucracy and as key to better government purported benefits of privatization proponents of privatiza tion have claimed that it provi des diverse benefits savas one of the earliest and best known proponents of privatization has stated privatization is the key to both limited and better government limited in size scope and power relative to societys other institutions and better in that societys needs are satisfied more efficiently effectively and equitably privatization is both means and an end for pragmatists who want better government and for populists who seek better society privatization is means toward those ends22 generally promoters of pr ivatization believe

growth by opening new areas of activity to entrepreneurs privatizing activities that the private sector can provide has also been justified as means to improve government performance by forcin g it to focus more sharply on its core activities rather than adjunct functions25 political attractiveness of privatization privatization holds appeal to some po licymakers because of its purported utility for addressing at least four salient political issues first some persons in the united states have expressed disillusionment with the federal governments performance as provi der of services and regulator of the economy the roots of this sentiment are deep going back at least to conservative reactions against the expansion of the fe deral government during the new deal and the economic and

persistent budget deficits of the past three decades have encouraged lawmakers and agency managers to devel op new sources of revenue and to reduce costs the search for solutions has stimulated both the federal government and private firms to examine government activities to develop proposals to transfer government functions to the private sector and to make agencies operate more like the private sector30 fourth private sector firms have sign ificant interests in the advancement of privatization31 these firms may reap significant financial benefits for example by purchasing government assets and by wi nning contracts to provide products and services to the government or the public to cite just two instances 1 in 1998 occidental petroleum was willing to sp end 365 billion to pur chase the elk hills naval petroleum reserve from the us government32 recently the company has said that the purchase was an excellent investment33 2 in 2005 the federal governments annual spending on contracts

out may adversely affect women and minorities collectively as they have tended to find jobs in the civil service more readily than in the private sector41 under the american theory of governance political power originated with the people who erected government and entrusted it to use this power in accordance with the law thus the responsibility of those employed by government is to act in accordance with this fiduciary relationship accordingly both the constitution and federal law include oaths to be taken by elected officials and civil servants42 bureaucracies are not merely passive entities that execute the law as enacted bureaucracies interpret the law and sculpt policies thus any effort to shift bureaucratic functions to the private sector may risk transferring away some governing discretion into the hands of private parties who are not accountable to the public and may not have its interests at heart43 one of the objectives of creating civil service was to provide government with stable corps of committed employees federal workers were to be chosen on rational basis as opposed to the favor of an appointee and provi ded with protections and good compensation and benefits that w ould encourage long tenures it was hoped that this arrangement would develop in employees the often peculiar expertise required to carry out governmental activities and instill in them

job for her daughter and future soninlaw with boeing and improperly favored the company in awarding the contract46 the premise of privatization is that the government will benefit when firms in competitive market compete to provide it with products and services compe titive markets however require number of conditions to be met fo r them to function properly to cite just two of them 1 firms must not face barriers to entry in this market and 2 the buyer of the goods and services must possess sufficient information to empower it to make rational purchase if any of the conditions for competition are not met the buyer ie an agency may be exploited in short markets can fail47 especially if there are too few firms to compete for governmentcontracts 48 hiring private firms to carry out government work creates great management challenges for govern ment administrators should an agency fail to have welltraine d personnel and effective oversight procedures in place its utilization

instances private firms have had significantly higher cost overruns than government agencies in the performance of services52 in other instances private firms ve performed work that has been criticized as being grossly inadequate53 privatization then has been criticized as illintentione d and inherently inimical to good government and it has been faulted both in principle and in practice

government acquisitions which it defines as the acquiring by contract with appropriated funds of supp lies or services including construction by and for the use of the federal government 48 cfr 2101b2 the federal government s contracted for goods since its founding in great part contracting for goods is matter of necessity like private firms government agencies face make or buy decision and have limited funds available few would argue that it would be efficient or even pr acticable for an agency to supply itself with all the materials it needs such as staplers and paper clips when the agency can readily acquire them from private producers however it is also the case that the federal government long has had policy that forbids competition with the private sector bureau of the budget bob bulletin of 1955 stated that the federal government will not start or carry on any commercial activity to provide service or product for its own use if such product can be procured from private enterprise through ordinary business channels62 while the idea of government contractin g for goods is rarely questioned the actual practice of contracting has been criticized frequently in many of these instances private firms are alleged to ve failed to produce and provide the goods as agreed federal agencies also have experienced difficulties in overseeing the work of goods contractors and coordinating agen cy activities with those of contractors for example recently government audit identified significant problems in private firms delivery of equipment to be installed in medical

attracted to outsourcing because it can provide costsavings and flexibility additionally outsourcing is means for agencies to handle large infrequent demands for government services for example the general services administration gsa uses private callcenter contractors when it ex pects agencies it supports such as the federal emergency management agency to receive large numbers of tele phone

providing good or service vouchers can do this b ecause they can be designed to have limited pe r capita cost eg 5000 per annum per person to spend on particular good such as housing this contrasts with the possibly escalating costs that can occur when government attempts to produce and provide good eg the cost of an item n eeded in production such as concrete may spike due to some unforeseen

governmental entitiesgoco quasi governmental entities are those entities that possess both private sector and governmental legal attributes74 for example the american national red cross anrc was

types such as government sponsored enterprises eg freddie mac congressionally chartered notforprofit corporations american legion and government venture capital firms eg inq tel and are involved in diverse policy areas from housing to veterans affairs and intelligence quasi governmental entities may be viewed as form of privatization because they are substitutes for fully governmental agencies they are private vehicles for achieving governmentally declared good76 policymakers have been attracted to quasi governmental entities for number of reasons including the popular perception that the private sector is more efficient than governme nt and budgetary constraints ie quasi governmental entitie s usually are offbudget the goco facility is wellknown sp ecies of quasi governmental tity difference though is that goco facilitie s are established to produce goods for governmental not private consumpti on eg military technologies sandia national laboratories one of the federally funded

perusing the forms of aid available to private parties at httpwwwgrantsgov this account of grants does not include mention of the grants provided to states and localities which then direct the monies

grant funds see crs report rl32736 charitable choice rules and faithbased organizations by joe richardson 82 light the new true size of government p 11party removes the federal g overnment from the direct financing of government project or service and replaces it with the private sector so for example government agency mig ht decide that it wants to build new facility to do this the agency might sign an agreement with private company to incorporate jointly special purpose entity or vehicle spe or spv that would own the new facility78 this spe could borrow money in private capital markets to build housing because the agency has agreed to rent the facility under longterm contract thereby guaranteeing flow of revenue fo r many years thirdparty financing has been used to fund various infrastructure projects such as housing on military bases government office buildings and electric power facilities79 agencies see this as advantageous becau they can then record the investment costs of the project in the federal budget ove r the life of the project instead of in full when the investment is made the congressional budget office has criticized this practice arguing among other things that thirdparty financing is more costly to the federal government and understates the si ze of the federal government and its obligations80 grants to private parties the federal government long has utilized grants of funds and property to pr ivate parties for the sake of achieving public purposes for example in 1819 congress enacted privat law to provide tract of land to the privately founded connecticut asylum for th education and instruction of deaf and dumb persons 6 stat 229 the logic behi nd grants as policy is straightforward if private party is undertaking work that provides public benef it then the federal government may wish to support that work the least expensive means to this end may be to provide funds or prope rty directly to this party today the federal governme nt provides grants for enormous numbers of diverse purposes grants are provided to suppor t students pursuing higher education to scientists undertaking researc h to religious groups working with persons addicted to drugs and alcohol to artists producing pub lic performances and to persons operating small businesses81 according to recent estimate between 24 and 28 m illion persons received grant monies per annum between 1990 and 200482 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33777crs19 83 darpa has said it is holding these challenges because it views them as means to achieve goal set by the national

by the federal government perhaps the most well known of these is th grand challenge held by the defense advanced research projects agency darpa held annually since 2004 darpas goal is to develop autonomous meaning unmanned vehicles that can be used in combat theater83 rather than attempt to develop this technology in house darpa offered large cash prizes to the competitor whose vehicle most

permitted the na tional aeronautics and space administration to award prizes to inventors of useful technologies use of volunteers the federal government has relied upon volunteers to perform public services for over century perhaps the most highprofile example is the american national red cross anrc congress first chartered anrc in 1900 charging this private voluntary organi zation to continue

and private firm perform an activity is significant privatizati on moves components of the provision of goods and services out of the governmental sector and into the private sector these two sectors are not identical as the national academy of public administration noted in point of fact there are some fundamental differences between the governmental and private sectors most basic perhaps is the governments distinctive claim to exercise sovereignty to enact and enforce binding laws and to act on behalf of the nation or the community in certain constitutionally prescribed ways89 furthermore the movement of an activity from the governmental sector to the private sector or vice versa has signif icant ramifications most obviously the behavior of the entity carrying out the task will differ because each sector has different incentives and constraints on public administration scholar has suggested that the incentives amount to this g overnment entity may do only what the law permits and prescribes private entity may do whatever the law does not forbid90 speaking to the differing constraints political scientist has observed the following to much greater extent than is true of private bureaucracies government agencies 1 cannot lawfully retain and devote to the private benefit of their members the earnings of the organization 2 cannot allocate the factors of production in accordance with the pr eferences of the organizations administrators and 3 must serve goal s not of the organizations own choosing control over revenues productive factors and agency goals is all vested to an

external entities as result government management tends to be driven by the constraints on the organization not the tasks of the organization91 the private sector firm then has one essen tial goal to pursue profits all other goals are subordinate92 thus it faces strong incentives to undertake activities that promote this essential goal this can prove beneficial to the government should the private firm devise more efficient means of production and devel op new products and services93 this might also negatively affect the government should the private firm lower its costs of production by reducing the quality or quantity of the product or service the private firm in large part is rewarded for achieving results pleasing to its owners and shareholders how it achie ves this may or may not prove beneficial to the government accountability government agencies unlike private firms usually operate under complex accountability hierarchies that include multip and even conflicting goals federal agencies for example are subject to the co rpus of federal mana gement laws these laws serve as means for k eeping executive branch agenci accountable to congress the president and the public94 they also embody principl of democratic justice such as the allowance for public participation and government transparency to name just few the general management laws include the following the freedom of information act 5 usc 552 which provides persons the right to request information about government operations the administrative procedure act 5 usc 551 et seq which prescribes the process for agency rulemaking ie interpretation and operationalization of law public participation in this process and judicial review of rules and the government in sunshine act 5 usc 552b which

privatization 97 see crs report 95717 federal tort claims act cu rrent legislative and judicial issues by henry cohen thus in shifting an activity from the g overnmental to the private sector the nature of government ove rsight is transformed95 as the components of government provision of goods and services are pr ivatized the jurisdiction of federal management laws congress the pres ident and the courts is reduced moreover privatization shifts government administrative management from implementation to oversight as hierarchical oversight may be replaced by contractual relationships government oversight of privatized government activities or third party government on large scale is recent phenomenon and one that many federal administrators and public administration schol ars have found vexatious96 finally the entire question what constitutes governmental action and what constitutes private action becomes am biguous when activities once carried out by officers of the federal government are replaced by private persons the constitution requires all executive and judicial officers both of the united states and of the several states to be bound by oath or affirmation to support the constitution article iv cl 3 contractor and s ubcontractors though need not take such an oath the legal distincti on between officers of the federal government and all other persons is significant as an fficer of the federal g overnment has rights duties powers and liabilitie s different from nonofficers97 thus for example under the federal tort claims act 28 usc 1346 b the government may be held liable for injuries caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of federal employee but what if that person is the employee of private contractor or subcontractor if this individual should say injure somebody who would be liable for damages the employee the contr actor the subcontractor the federal government the answer is not immedi ately obvious which may prove matter of concern to 1 persons who be lieve themselves adversely ffected by the individuals actions and 2 the agency which issued the contract and legislators who may be viewed by the public as responsible for the oversight of the government projects privacy the potential blurring of the differen ce between governmental action and private action may also have ramifications for personal privacy for example an individual who is in dispute with the internal revenue rvice irs over unpaid taxes may find himself receiving tele phone call from private debt collection company under an

operations and activities103 hence this report uses the term marketization to refer to the redesign of government agency in order to make it provide goods and services in the manner of private firm typically marketization involves altering the incentive structures facing government agency in order to make it opera more efficiently an example may prove illustrative for much of its history the us government had department that provided postal services the us post office received large annual appropr iations from congress whose members were deeply involved with its operations including the selection of manageme nt and the pricing of postal services under th is configuration the us po st office ran into operational difficulties and developed reputation for incompetence and corruption104 in the 1960s some critics called for the abo lition of the post office and privatization of postal services in 1970 congress chose less dramatic means for reform it enacted statute that marketized the us post office pl 91375 84 stat 725 et seq the new us postal service u sps became an independent entity of the executive branch with greater freedom to run its operations critically usps was statutorily required to earn sufficient revenue to cover its costs of operation it could longer rely on nnual appropriations105 since its marketization usps has reported considerable productivity growth and is genera lly acknowledged to be better operated106 there are many ways in that an agency may be marketized for example congress might require an agency meet its costs of operations and deny it annual appropriations congress might also per mit an agency to t up bonus programs under which employees may be rewarded fo r reaching productivity targets in short any reform that aims to alter an agencys incentives so that they are more like those facing private firms might be called mark etization httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33777crs25 107 see joseph n coffee creating entrep reneurial

ombs circular a76 p 1a user fee that is sufficient to cover all or part of the cost for providing the service in fy2005 the federal government booked 1852 billion in user fees111 user fees may be employed as means for an agency to raise revenues to help cover costs attributable to particular activity the usda charges quarantine inspection fees the department of state assesses fees for pa ssports and the us postal service requires customers to pay for mail services in other instances an agency may cover all its costs through fees such is the case with the us patent and trade office112 promoters of user fees argue that it is more fair to have those who draw upon government resource pay for it th an to tax both users and nonusers113 they also argue that user fees make agencies more like private firms agencies relying on user fees must undertake activities to attract users they must in short strive to discern and provide for customers furthermore proponents of user fees have argued that fees may discourage the indiscriminate use of service or resource the rationing of service or resource through user fees imposed by public sector authority may achieve balance between use and resource renewal114 this rationale has b een cited by the national park service in charging fees to enter and use the national parks115 similarly the office of management and budget has stated that user fees are means to promote efficient allocation of the nations resources and allow the private sector to compete with the government without disadvantage in supplying comparable services resources or goods where appropriate116 detractors of user fees have argued that government services should as matter of principle be available to the public free of charge they also have claimed that the imposition of fees may inhibit the access of lowerincome individualshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33777crs27 117 crs report rl30365 federal government corporations an overview by ronald c moe and kevin

washington napa 2005 119 in recent years congress has created agencies titled corporations which do not perform commercialtype activities and are almo st totally reliant on regular appropriations corporate bodies in this category include the millennium challenge corporati on the corporation for public broadcasting the lega l services corporation and the corporation for national and community services 120 for example according to the ombs program assessment and rating tool slsdcs operations and maintenance program was deemed an effectivein 2005 this is the highest part score programs so rated set ambitious goals achieve results are continuedgovernment corporations the distinguishing characteristics of government corporation are that it is an agency of government established by congress to provide marketoriented public service and intended to produce revenues that meet or pproximate its expenditures117 at present there are 18 government corporations that cover spectrum from large wellknown corporations such as the us postal service and th federal deposit insurance corporation to small lowvisibility corporate bodies such as the federal financing bank and the valles caldera trust each government corporation is unique each has been granted different exemptions from particular management laws for the sake of providing it with flexibilities similar to those possessed by private firms for example congress has partially exempted the exportimport bank 12 usc 635 amendments from federalemployee classifica tion and payrate restric tions 5 usc51015115 and 53315338 and 53415349 this waiv er may help the bank to offer salaries to attract highly skilled persons who might otherwise work for private financialservices companies in some discussions of privatization proposals to establish government corporation eg reorganizing the us patent and trademark office into government corporation118 are equated with privatization because the term corporation is seen as making it similar to private corpora tion this similarity in titles however is misleading because government corporation is an agency of the us government not unlike the intern revenue service performing mission established by congress and is mana ged by officers of the united states119 these characteristics are not present in private corporations congress has established g overnment corporations fo r variety of purposes government corporations have had mixed success the saint lawrence seaway development corporation slsdc 33 u sc 981 which manages the waterway between

deficits for more than three decades and been criticized for service and operational shortcomings121 competitive sourcing competitive sourcing as described above refers to the process of an agency putting up the performance of one of its functions for competition between the agency and outside parties thus one possible result of competitive sourcing is outsourcing form of privatization however competitive sourcing is form of marketization because it requires agencies to do as private firms do compete to provide service as described above fair and circul ar a76 require federal agencies to compete their commercially available activities the office of management and budget under president george w bush s advocated the expansion of competitive sourcing for example in april 2006 omb announced that activities performed by 26000 government employees would be opened up to competitions fivefold increase over the number competed last year122 this move to expand competitions has sparked controversies government employees not surprisingly may feel their jobs are threatened meanwhile private firms coveting more busine ss opportunities have challenged agencies exclusion of activities from competitions123 marketization clearly is more incr emental reform than privatization marketization alters some of the incentives and constraints faced by an agency in hopes that it will behave more like private sector firm124 however since marketization does not move an activity from the governmental to the private sector it may not produce an entity as likely to ach ieve as many efficiencies and innovations as private firm this is because the marketized government agency unlike the private firm cannot retain profits or compete against other firms125httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33777crs29 125 continued making it monopoly provider of this service 35 usc 2 similarly the private express statutes collections of laws and federa l regulations

mae by mark jicklingon the other hand government overseers may find that marketized agency is less vexatious to oversee and hold accountable this is because the marketized firm remains within the governmental sector though given some operational flexibilities it remains governmental entity with statutorily prescribed mission and subject to all government management laws except those from which it has been specifically exempted the marketized agency also may be less prone to the pathologies that afflict some private firms the contrast between two entities the government national mortgage

secondary home mortgage market ginnie mae is govern ment corporation generally it has been viewed as competently operated126 fannie mae on the other hand is private entity charged with governmental responsibilities while its ccesses are manifold it has been reproached frequently in recent years critics have said that fannie maes pur suit of profits has led it to undertake number of undesirable behaviors in order to protect its profits the firm has been accused of aggressively lobbyin g congress perhaps through questionable means127 it has been criticized for excessively compensating its top executives128 fannie maes efforts to grow its business also have been criticized for threatening tocreate spillover effects that might negatively affect world financial markets 129 recently the

little use to rn to the constitution in hopes of determining say whether private contractor s could be used to grade federally administered academic achievement tests such as the nati onal assessment of educational progressto privatize or not the inevitability of political controversy ultimately in considering whether to pursue privatization as strategy to improve the provision of goods and services the question arises what is the proper role of government few would dis pute that some broad functions should be handled by government and its employees wh ile others should be left to the private sector but which ones definitive guidance is unavailable the constitution enumerates many of the broad functions that are to be carri ed out by the federal government131 however the constitution does not enumerate which of the tasks required to carry out these broad functions must be performed by gove rnmental employees and which may be performed by private persons for example the constitution states that the congress shall have power to establish post offices and post roads article i sec 8 cl 7 however it does not declare whether the federal government must use government employees to build these roads or whether it may hire private contractors furthermore the constituti on is of limited utility because the federal governments activities extend far be yond those listed in the constitution132 federal statutory law pr ovides some guidance fair requires government personnel to perform inhe rently governmental activ ities fair defines inherently governmental activities as t hose so intimately related to the public interest as to mandate performance by government personne l it further defines the term to include activities that require either the exercise of discretion in applying federal government authority or the making of value judgments in making decisions for the federal government including judgments relating to monetary transactions and entitlements an inherently governmental function involves among other things the interpretation and execution of the laws of the united states so as i to bind the united states to take or not to take some action by contract policy regulation authorization order or otherwise ii to determine protect and ad vance united states economic political territorial property or other interests by military or diplomatic action civil or criminal judicial proceedings c ontract management or otherwise iii to significantly affect the life liberty or property of private persons iv to commission appoint direct or c ontrol officers or employees of the united states or v to exert ultimate control over the acquisition use or disposition of the property real or personal tangible or intangible of the united states including the collection control or disbursement of appropriated and other federal funds 112 stat 2382bhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33777crs31 133 ombs circular a76 does offer some elaboration of what sorts of activities that it interprets the phrase inherently governmental to include 134 crs report rl33314 the congressional charter of th american national red cross overview history and analysis by kevin r kosaradditionally fair explicitly excludes some activities from this category the term does not normally include i gathering information for or prov iding advice opinions recommendations or ideas to federal government officials or ii any function that is primarily ministerial and internal in nature such as building security mail operations operation of cafeterias housekeeping facilities operations and maintenance warehouse operations motor vehicle fleet management operations or other routin electrical or mechanical services 112 stat 2382c yet this statutory guidance leaves much unclear133 debates have and will erupt over the application of these terms to specific activities for example currently the federal governments nationa l response plan for mass disasters charges private organization the american national red cross with responsibility to lead and coordinate efforts to provide mass care housing and human services after disasters that require federal assistance134 under fair do such activities constitute the interpretation and execution of the laws of the united states so as to significantly affect the life liberty or property of pr ivate persons if so then ought these activities be carried out by the department of homeland security or to take second example does the aforementione d portion of fair permit the federal government to outsource the housing of federal prisoners moreover this statutory guidance is of limited utility in considering fundamental question beneath the privatization debate fair provides guidance on the permissible extent of private sector participation in current federal activities it does not nor was it intended to provide answers as to which broad activities the federal government should be involved in and which should be left to the private sector should the federal government be involved in commuter rail service as it is with amtrak should the federal government ope rate energygen erating facilities like the bonneville power author ity and those of the tennessee valley authority should federally established tities provide liquidity to the secondary housing loan market should

emerged on the federal policy agenda surveying this policy movement one social scientist has written private and marketstyle mechanisms are increasingly employed to provide what government had taken as duties religious groups join secular nonprofit and for profit providers of services paid for or sought by government decision makers in education health care social services and law constantly cross the boundaries between public and private religious and secular profit and nonprofit136 the very newness of privatization as policy idea likely helped cause some of the confusion over its definition this report defines privatization as the use of the private s ector in the provision of good or service the components of which include financing operations supplying production delivery and qua lity control this definition though imperfect is useful insofar as it enable s one to view priva tization activities upon spectrum that is an agency may more or less privatize its provision of goods and services depending on how many of the components of the provision process have been moved to private sector providers this report also differentia tes privatization from mark etization as described above the ramifications of this difference are significant tities couched within the governmental and private sectors do not behave identically each has its strengths and weaknesses those uncom fortable with privatization may find marketization more attractive option meanwhile t hose favoring privatization may view marketization as half measure that cannot be expected to produce goods and services as efficiently as privatizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33777crs33 it can be expected that privatization will remain controversial idea any attempt to improve the federa l governments provision of goods and services through privatization likely may elicit concerns ove r the intentions and possible consequences of the proposal meanwhile implicit in the debate about privatiz ation lurks the old and nettlesome question w hich activities are essentia l to the state and should remain directly accountable to the elected representatives of the people and which may be carried out by
