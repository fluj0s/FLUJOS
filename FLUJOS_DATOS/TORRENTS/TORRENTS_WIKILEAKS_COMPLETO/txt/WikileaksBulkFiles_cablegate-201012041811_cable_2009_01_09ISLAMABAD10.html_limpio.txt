notes with some concern the report ref that the goi ministry of external affairs plans to release information from its investigation into the mumbai attacks next week to all countries that lost citizens and that therefore any information sharing will be overtaken by events ref says sanitized version will be released and widely disseminated 2 s we believe it is premature for the indians to be considering broad dissemination of information on the attack until the investigation has been completed in this regard we note that the fbi has just presented long list of information it is still seeking from the indians to advance its own investigation most importantly we believe there are still lashkaretaiba let sleeper and other cells in india nepal bangladesh and pakistan as well as many law enforcement leads which need to be pursued to prevent another potential attack we need to keep channels of cooperation and information sharing open we are concerned that the indians premature public dissemination of this information will undermine essential law enforcement efforts and forestall further indopak cooperation our goal is not only to bring the perpetrators of this attack to justice but also to begin dialogue that will reduce tensions between india and pakistan 3 s isi director general pasha has just approved the sharing of tearline information on pakistans investigation with indian intelligence after assurances from cia that information would be tightly held in intelligence channels only gaining gop approval for this release was significant step forward for the pakistanis but as ref notes the question of information sharing may be overtaken by events if pasha is embarrassed by what is essentially public dissemination without the indians providing the results of their own investigation to pakistan it will undercut pakistans ability to pursue its investigation generate public backlash in pakistan and could undermine pasha personally 3 s therefore we believe department should urge the goi to delay the release of information about their investigation until intelligence and law enforcement sharing with the gop and with us has been able to move forward
