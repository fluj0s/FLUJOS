that russia was source of sensitive technology to iran in 1995 russia signed an agreement with iran to finish construction of the bushehr nuclear power reactor transaction worth 800 million or more in

june 23 1998 objecting to low evidentiary thresholds and mandatory sa nctions he forestalled an attempt to override his veto by imposing sanctions on seven russian entities that moscow began to investigate in midjuly for alleged illegal exports to iran the sanctions were imposed under executive order 13094 which expanded the pres idents authority to ban us trade with aid to and procurement

technology to iran powerful new reasons to stop proliferating in additi on it seeks to create new incentives for the russian space agency to cooperate in effo rts to stem the proliferation of weapons

pl 106178 inas section 6 and the iss section 6 of the ina concerns payments by the us government to russia in connection with the iss on july 29 1999 during markup of section 6 by the house science committees subcommittee on space and aeronautics science committee chairman james sensenbrenner explained that earlier this year there were publications of the fact that entities of th russian space agency were violating the mtcr thats why there is section 6 in this bill8 from 1994 to 1998 nasa had paid russia approximately 800 million through several contracts for space st ationrelated activ ities those payments ended because section 6 prohibits the us government from making payments in connection with iss to the russian space agency organizations or entities under its control or any other element of the russian government after january 1 1999 exceptions are made for payments needed to prevent immin ent loss of life by or grievous injury to individuals aboard iss the crew safety exception and for various other payments the prohibition may be lifted if the presid ent makes determination that russias policy was to oppose prolifera tion to iran that russia wa s demonstrating sustained commitment to seek out and prevent the transfer of wmd and missile systems to iran and that neither the russian space ag ency nor any entity reporting to it had made such transfers for at least one year prior to such determinati on neither president clinton nor president bush s made such determination amending the ina pl 109112 on january 14 2004 president bush made major space policy address directing nasa to focus its activities on returning humans to the moon and eventually sending them to mars inspired in part by the destruction of the space shuttle columbia the previous year

measures to be taken transporting as tronauts to and from the iss was carried out only in russian soyuz space vehicles until the shuttle discovery returned to flight in july 2005 in addition the cancellati on of nasas planned crv left the iss dependent on the soyuz as lifeboat for return of crew members in case of an emergency since the shuttle could not be permanently attached to the iss because of power demands russia expected to be paid for the soyuz lifeboat service beginning in 2006 retirement of th shuttle in 2010 would leave the united states without capability to transport as tronauts to the iss until new vehicle is developed as contemplated for the moon mars mission transport to and from the iss will again have to rely on soyuz in the interim because of these developments nasa applied to the congress for an exemption from the ina that would allow it to contract with russian space entities for use of the soyuz for iss missions the response was the iran nonproliferation amendments act of 2005 pl 109112 passage of pl 109112 since the president had not made the required determinati on under section 6b of the ina an amendment was needed to continue american access to the iss senator lugar introduced the amendment as s 1713 the iran nonproliferation amendments act of 2005 debate in c ongress ensued with critics questioning whether exempting payments for the iss would encourage russia to continue alleged proliferation activity supporte rs of the amendment argued that the exemption was strict enough to only allow for issrelate d expenses for temporary period of time and would not impact nonproliferation policy9 pl 109112 passed on nove mber 22 2005 gives an exemption to the nonproliferation certification re quirement for us governme nt payments made prior to january 1 2012 related to the iss as pa rt of the amendment the house applied the nonproliferation pena lties to such trade with syria as well as iran and the act was renamed the iran and syria nonprolifera tion act this addition was reportedly to strengthen and extend the nonproliferation as pects of the law to counterbalance the weakening of the nonproliferation provisions vis vis russia10 the amendment directs the president to submit to the senate foreign relations committee and the house international relations committee report that identifies each russian entity or person to whom the

for resuming flights to the moon and has indicated that such vehicles would also be available for missions to the i ss it has also continued flights of the space shuttle to the iss and plans enough f lights to finish the iss before the shuttle is retired in 2010 under the exemption provided in pl 109112 nasa has also contracted with russian space entities to continue astronaut flights to and from the iss however the exemption runs out in 2012 on april 11 2008 nasa administrator michael griffin submitted proposed amendmen t to inksna that would extend the exemption for soyuz flights for the life of the iss or until the moon flight vehicle or commercial crew transport vehicle is fully operational the exemption would not be extended for the russian progress cargo vehicle11 in letter to chairman udall of the subcommittee on space and aeronautics committee on science and technology and to senator biden chai rman of the senate committee on foreign relations griffin said that fabrication of soyuz vehicles requires 36 months so that nasa must contract with russian entities in 2008 for vehicles to be available in 2012 extension of the inksna exemptions would have to be enacted before such contracting could take place on june 9 senator biden introduced by request s 3103 the international space station payments act of 2008 incorporating the measures requested by nasa

included in hr 2638 the consolidated security disaster assistance and continuing appropriations act 2009 pl 110329 section 125 of the act amends pl 106178 to set the date of expiration for waiver authority to july 1 2016 postshuttle transport options to the iss continued flights of the space shuttle have been necessary to transport number of massive components to co mplete construction of the iss the shuttle has also been the main means of carrying and returning astronauts to and from the iss although the russian soyuz craft has also transported some expedition team members in addition soyuz has been attached continuously to the iss as lifeboat to return iss as tronauts in case of an emergency in the space station this is function that the space shuttle cannot fulfil even while it is still operating because it can only stay aloft for limited time because of power needs after the shuttle retires only the soyuz will be available for transporting astronauts to and from the iss until nasa develops new crew and cargo vessels as part of the vision to return to the moon now scheduled for 2015 or 2016 in addition to crews supplies and re placements for iss components will need transport after the shuttle is retired the russian progress vehicle has been used in the past and would remain available but the amendmen t requested by nasa would not include contracting for the progress in the exemption extension nasa has been investing in efforts by private industry to develop and produce transport vehicles that can take equipment and eventually crews to and from the iss this commercial orbital transportation services cot s program is s till under development another option under development is th european space agencys automated transfer vehicle atv the first of which was launched ma rch 9 2008 and carried out docking demonstrations with the iss in april four more atvs are planned for construction japan expects to follow in 2009 with launch of its hii transfer vehicle htv unlike the space shuttle but like soyuz and progress neither the atv or the htv is reusable vehicle depending on the development of thes options some use of the russian progress vehicle may be necessary for trans porting us equipment and supplies to the iss contracting such services woul d also probably require exemption from the inksna nonproliferation issues involving extending inksna exemption as in 2005 an amendment would be needed before payments could be made to russia since the president has not made determination pursuant to section 6b of the inksna regarding russian nonprolifera tion policy or prolif eration activities to iran north korea or syria this is widely believed to be because the president would be unable to certify an absence of prolifer ation
