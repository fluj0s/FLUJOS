he withdrew in the final weeks and cast his lot with fox and the alliance for change during the campaign opposition parties claimed that the pri was using coercion and vote buying to gain votes by requiring government bureaucrats to support the pri and by offering various inducements to party faithful particularly in rural areas and vicente fox stated at one point that victory by the pri by close margin might not be legitimate given the possibility of corruption pri spokesmen disputed the charges and criticized those casting doubt on the election while also leveling charges in the final weeks of the campaign that fox had received considerable funding from abroad following the tv debates among the candidates in april and may most dailies reported that fox won the debates although some faulted fox for his stubbornness in the negotiations over the arrangements for the second debate according to most of the latest polls released in the second half of june 2000 labastida and fox were in technical tie with the margin of error being greater than the difference between the two candidates although most polls gave fox the advantage in the urban areas and labastida the advantage in the rural areas by the evening of the election of july 2 2000 mexican electoral authorities were able to announce based on series of quick counts and preliminary election results that opposition candidate vicente fox of the alliance for change pan and pvem had won the presidential election by significant margin that same evening pri candidate labastida and prd candidate cardenas conceded the election
