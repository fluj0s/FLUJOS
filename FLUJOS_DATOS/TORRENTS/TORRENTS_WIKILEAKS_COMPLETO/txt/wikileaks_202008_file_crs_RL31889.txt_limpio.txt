the aljazeera news network opportunity or challenge for us foreign policy in the middle east summary aljazeera the arab worlds first allnews network was started by the persian gulf monarchy of qatar it has come to be recognized as key player in covering issues of central importance to us foreign policy in the middle east the conflict in iraq the war on terrorism and the israelipalestinian conflict aljazeera has become so publicly influential that us officials now regularly appear on the network although aljazeera has received praise for its uncensored format and for airing interviews with us and israeli officials as well as arab critics of the policies of arab governments it has drawn criticism from many observers in the united states and elsewhere for perceived lack of objectivity in covering these conflicts including the activities of qaeda for their part officials from aljazeera have claimed that they merely reflect arab popular resentment of us policy in the middle east this paper provides an overview of aljazeera and explores the debate surrounding its objectivity this report also analyzes aljazeeras coverage of events in the middle east specifically its coverage of events in iraq afghanistan and israel and the west bank and gaza strip the final section of this report discusses policy options regarding us public diplomacy efforts in the middle east region this paper will be updated periodically contents aljazeera an overview 1 origins 1 programming 2 objectivity 3 aljazeera and qatar 4 issues of concern for us foreign policy 6 iraq 6 afghanistan the war on terrorism 8 aljazeera and the israelipalestinian conflict 10 aljazeera the arab media 12 policy options for congress 12 the aljazeera news network opportunity or challenge for us foreign policy in the middle east aljazeera an overview origins aljazeera which means the peninsula or the island was founded in 1996 in qatar after the new emir of qatar shaykh hamad bin khalifa althani purchased the rights to the arabic tv division of the british broadcasting corporation bbc news service the bbc had been trying to develop an allarabic television station in conjunction with the saudiowned orbit radio and television service the joint venture failed after the two parties could not agree on issues relating to the new stations editorial independence1 the qatari monarchy which also has closely aligned itself with us policy in the persian gulf region was embarking upon limited course of political liberalization and believed that modernizing arab media was central to its reform effort the emir of qatar provided aljazeera with an initial grant of 137 million2 allowing the station to retain many of the bbcs recently hired arab correspondents many of whom are prominent egyptian and lebanese journalists with western training prior to aljazeera arab audiences could receive their news from either state owned media or from several arab satellite variety channels that broadcast both entertainment and news programming the news on all of these channels was and still is to some degree censored and controlled by state authorities even transnational subscriptionbased arab satellite channels tend to reflect the viewpoints of the governments of the countries in which they are located3 therefore many analysts considered aljazeera to be novelty in the arab world not only because it was the first 24 hour allnews arabic television station but also because 1 iskandar adel mohammed elnawawy aljazeera how the free arab news network scooped the world and changed the middle east westview press 2002 p 30 2 despite its initial aim to be financially selfsufficient aljazeera is mostly dependent on qatari state financing roughly 100 million annually on the whole the economics of arab satellite tv in the middle east makes it difficult for many stations to turn profits jazeeras controversial programming may deter some advertisers from buying air time on the station some observers have noted that the station only averages around 4045 minutes of advertising per day louay bahry the new arab media phenomenon qatars jazeera middle east policy june 2001 3 several arab satellite tv stations are owned by saudi arabian businessmen with close ties to the saudi royal family crs2 it allowed its commentators and guests more latitude in expressing their opinions including criticisms of arab governments than had been previously regarded as the norm in the arab media in fact the creators of aljazeera modeled the stations format after western news services such as the cable news network cnn and the bbc professing admiration for western stations roundtable discussion programs oneonone interviews and documentaries although aljazeera borrowed the format of cnn its creators set out to differentiate aljazeera from its western counterparts many of aljazeeras correspondents were drawn to work for the station because they felt that american and british coverage of the 1991 gulf war was not evenhanded in that it paid insufficient attention to topics of interest to arab audiences such as the plight of iraqi civilians during the conflict thus aljazeera believes that it provides an alternative perspective particularly to the american and british news media jazeeras motto the view and the other point of view reflects its desire to be an uncensored authentically arab news source for arabs programming although aljazeera like most 24hour news networks intersperses news updates with headlines sports and financial news broadcasts throughout the day its regularly scheduled programming is unconventional when compared to other arab networks aljazeera has programs such as the opposite direction without borders the other opinion and open dialogue each of which features well known host who facilitates lively discussion with some callin questions and comments viewers of aljazeera have noted that the stations staff often try to encourage confrontation by pitting guests with opposite viewpoints against one another in debate this approach has proven to be informative and entertaining for many viewers however some arab intellectuals have criticized the approach as being too sensationalistic and heated beyond aljazeeras programming many western critics have accused the station of creating inflammatory leadin segments to news reports which often feature montages of violence in the west bank and gaza strip afghanistan or iraq these short snippets contain flashes of provocative pictures usually of human suffering accompanied by dramatic background music aljazeera called its coverage of operation iraqi freedom the war against iraq and used leadins that showed civilian casualties in iraqi hospitals exploding bombs in baghdad and us soldiers on patrol in civilian areas some suggest that aljazeera is merely following middle eastern tradition of dramatizing news events by appealing emotionally to the viewer according to aljazeeras washington bureau chief hafez almirazi there is feeling in our newsroom that you need to be as realistic as possible and carry the images of war and the effect that war has on people your population shouldnt just eat their dinner and watch sanitized images on tv and video games produced by the technological whizzes in the pentagon and say this is war4 4 in the line of fire washington post april 3 2003 crs3 objectivity since its inception aljazeera has received an enormous amount of publicity for breaking many of the taboos of selfcensorship in the arab media new york times columnist tom friedman wrote that aljazeera is not only the biggest media phenomenon to hit the arab world since the advent of television it also is the biggest political phenomenon5 indeed many middle eastern experts have praised jazeera for creating forum in which arab opposition movements can freely criticize their host governments without fear of retribution according to edmund ghareeb an expert on middle eastern affairs it has raised the level of debate and opened the door for freer and more accurate news in the arab world aljazeera has helped satisfy hunger in the arab world its debates and discussion programs are tumultuous even by western standards6 however for all of the praise aljazeera has received there has been an equal amount of criticism regarding the networks perceived lack of objectivity many western media analysts have asserted that aljazeeras westernstyle format is merely cover for reporting style that is slanted toward popular panarab panislamist viewpoint according to critic fouad ajami of johns hopkins university matter how many americans show up on aljazeera the station will pursue its own oppositional agenda aljazeeras reporters see themselves as antiimperialists these men and women are convinced that the rulers of the arab world have given in to american might these are broadcasters who play to an arab gallery whose political bitterness they share and feed7 moafac harb director of network news for the us governments middle east radio network known as radio sawa has argued that aljazeera feigns its objectivity by inviting us and israeli officials to present their views while carrying provocative analysis in the studio or onesided news stories lacking neutrality prior to or following these same interviews8 us ambassador chris ross fluent arabicspeaker who has appeared on aljazeera several times commented that it aljazeera has clear point of view on the events it is presenting for analysis and discussion with aljazeera what you often get is several people but all at one end of the spectrum so theres work to be done to induce more balance but on the whole the advent of aljazeera and other arab satellite stations has been great step forward in opening up the intellectual and cultural life of the arab world9 in may 2003 britains sunday times reported that iraqi intelligence files uncovered after the iraq war revealed that iraqi intelligence had penetrated aljazeera 5 tom friedman glasnost in the gulfnew york times february 27 2001 6 ghareeb edmund new media and the information revolution in the

aljazeera replaced its chief executive officer mohammed jasim alali who had been ceo of aljazeera since its inception according to press reports the documents which were obtained in baghdad by the iraqi national congress indicated that alali made clear to iraqi agents that coverage would favor the saddam hussein regime alali will continue to serve on aljazeeras board of directors defenders of aljazeera have decried criticism of the station noting that all newspapers and television stations have some degree of bias and that aljazeera has at least given air time to dissenting opinions according to the beirutbased daily star in its coverage of the intifada palestinian uprising and the war in afghanistan aljazeera has actually given voice to every side in the conflict and done nothing more than televise the images its reporters are seeing11 in an interview with the christian science monitor the chair of the department of journalism and mass communication at the american university of cairo remarked that sure the news we get in the arab world is slanted in the same way the news received in the us is biased12 aljazeera and qatar there has been considerable speculation as to why the station has been able to report the news freely given the restrictive media environment in neighboring arab states many commentators have attempted to answer this question by pointing to the nature of the qatari state as well as to the efforts of the emir of qatar to liberalize qatari society while using these political and social reforms to promote qatar itself and increase its regional and global influence qatar is one of the most stable countries in the middle east with per capita income of over 25000 for population of 800000 people only 170000 of whom have citizenship the majority of the rest are foreign workers from south east asia and the phillippines analysts have pointed out that aljazeeras openness and itsmaverick reporting style serves to promote qatar as progressive modern state in the middle east indeed although the qatari government has publicly sought to distance itself from aljazeera in terms of ownership organization and editorial output both the state and the station enjoy mutually beneficial relationship in which the visibility of aljazeera has led to an increase in the prominence of qatar thus aljazeera although functionally independent13 could be said to indirectly serve the foreign policy goals of qatar 10 report alleges that iraqi agents infiltrated aljazeera rferl iraq report vol 6 no22 may 16 2003 11 qatars aljazeera is not prozionist enough fouad ajamis taste daily star november 20 2001 12 world and america watching different wars cnn vs aljazeera seeing is often believing christian science monitor march 25 2003 13 aljazeera is quasiindependent its managers have great deal of freedom in the dayto day operations of the station however aljazeera relies on qataristate financing advertising revenue only covers 3540 of aljazeeras operating expenses meeting with aljazeera producer mr khalid mahmoud january 11 2003 crs5 some experts question whether in the long term aljazeera can maintain independence if it is unable to wean itself off of qatari state financing originally aljazeera executives believed that aljazeera would be profitable by 2001 two factors have prevented the station from generating more revenue first general market conditions in the middle east advertising industry have not been favorable there are already several arab satellite television channels and as more stations come online and the situation in iraq remains uncertain advertising revenue will remain uneven second there is hesitation on the part of arab conglomerates to advertise on aljazeera as they are fearful that aljazeeras shaky relationships with arab governments could harm their business interests because of these obstacles the station is still running annual deficits despite its rather lean workforce of 775 employees worldwide cnn has 4000 and bbc has 3300 several us companies have run advertisements on aljazeera including general motors gillette and procter and gamble14 aljazeeras continued dependence on qatars financial backing has blurred the line between its status as private or public news organization aljazeera has demonstrated characteristics of both privatized and staterun news network as qatar exerts little editorial control over daytoday news reporting while subsidizing aljazeeras annual budget although aljazeera may subtly promote qatars political outlook it does so under the umbrella of regional news provider making it appear less tied to any one arab government nevertheless aljazeeras executives have promoted their channels independent image which raises the following questions as aljazeera remains in an ambiguous position regarding its private or public status will some analysts start to overlook that status and treat aljazeera as just another staterun media outlet albeit one more sophisticated and popular than the rest or will aljazeera secure the necessary advertising revenue to cover costs perhaps leading to looser arrangement with the qatari government although aljazeera has drawn praise for its willingness to discuss aspects of arab politics previously considered off limits in arab discourse15 critics continue to point out that aljazeera does not treat qatar with the same degree of scrutiny as it does other arab governments aljazeera executives have countered that qatar is relatively free of political strife and therefore does not require much attention however according to the asian times it aljazeera softpeddles its domestic critique aljazeera has been dogged in its coverage of financial and political deals cut between arab governments and israel but when allegations came out that qatar had opened trade office in tel aviv the station did not go after the story16 other commentators have asked why the station has not fully explored qatars friendly relationship with the us military although aljazeeras website did cover december 2002 us war game in qatar dubbed operation internal look there have been few attempts to examine the us military presence in qatar 14 wheeler brain aljazeeras cash crisis bbc news online april 7 2003 15 aljazeera often has provided forum for islamist opposition parties to debate government policies practice not widely accepted in many arab states 16 ian urbina aljazeera hits misses and ricochets asian times december 25 2002 crs6 issues of concern for us foreign policy iraq aljazeeras coverage of iraq has drawn both praise and criticism aljazeeras first foray into the iraqus confrontation came in 1998 when iraq and the united states were in standoff over the removal of weapons inspectors from iraq jazeera outmaneuvered other networks most notably cnn by having correspondents in iraq once the united states and britain launched air and missile strikes as part of operation desert fox aljazeera also obtained an exclusive interview with saddam hussein who reportedly wanted to deal with station that could reach wide arab audience some observers have contended that aljazeeras popularity and credibility in the middle east was established at that time on the other hand aljazeeras detractors accused the network of portraying iraq as victim during the standoff focusing more on the detrimental effects of economic sanctions than on saddam husseins disregard of united nations resolutions aljazeeras coverage of the 2003 war in iraq has become story within the wider story of the war following previous patterns aljazeera has been recognized for its access inside iraq17 while being criticized for being sensationalistic and slanted in its coverage of the us military operation some observers have praised aljazeera for keeping several reporters and camera crews on the ground in baghdad mosul and basra and delivering live feeds of wartime footage to which several us news networks including cnn have access through partnership agreements18 according to businessweek during the iraq war aljazeera had more reporters in iraq than any other major news station19 aljazeera also is one of the few stations that has aired press briefings from iraqi officials as well as video footage whose authenticity has been disputed of saddam hussein in meetings with other senior iraqi leaders several us officials and independent analysts have appeared on the station to give commentary on the us war effort prior to the start of the war the pentagon granted aljazeera four embedded slots with the us military however most of aljazeeras reporters on the ground have remained independent of the us military according to georgetown university professor samer shehata the war coverage on aljazeera compares favorably with the war coverage on american networks they have perspective its from perspective of what the war is like for the iraqi people but ive never seen anything favorable to the iraqi regime on aljazeera20 17 unlike many television networks which had operated in iraq under saddam hussein jazeera used mostly iraqi nationals as reporters enabling them to circumvent the regimes restrictive visa policies for foreign journalists see ahmed assya aljazeera under fire once again this time the gcc threatens sanctions transnational broadcasting studies journal fallwinter 2002 18 aljazeera executives accused other stations of stealing their live feed during the war 19 aljazeera in an intense spotlight businessweek online march 26 2003 20 in the line of fire washington post april 3 2003 op cit crs7 negative reaction to aljazeeras coverage of operation iraqi freedom has come from many fronts us administration officials members of congress and some independent analysts were angered that us prisoners of war and several dead us soldiers were displayed on iraqi tv and on an aljazeera broadcast in late march 2003 us officials accused aljazeera of providing vehicle for iraqi propaganda and for actions that violated international rules on handling of prisoners of war in testimony before the house armed service committee on april 4 2003 w hays parks special assistant to the judge advocate general of the army stated that iraqi television and aljazeera have aired tape of us soldiers answering questions in humiliating and insulting circumstances designed to make them objects of public curiosity in violation of the gpw 1949 geneva convention relative to the protection of prisoners of war21 others have pointed to the overall tone of aljazeeras broadcasts labeling them inflammatory emotional and slanted toward covering the suffering of the iraqi people rather than iraqis celebrating the demise of the hussein regime in one broadcast from baghdad hospital where wounded children were shown an jazeera correspondent commented with distress that they said it would be clean war they said they wouldnt hit civilians they said they wouldnt hit infrastructure they said and said and said22 in addition aljazeera has come under fire for its choice of terminology which many commentators have suggested is heavily weighed against the united states for example coalition troops are sometimes called invading forcesand suicide attacks are called martyrdom operations terms that arab governments and the arab media often use to describe the israeli army and palestinians in the united states the new york stock exchange revoked the credentials of aljazeera saying its credentials were only for news that provided responsible coverage23 in addition akamai technologies an internet developer based in cambridge ma cancelled contract to provide web services for aljazeeras new english language website on the other hand iraqi officials demanded that several aljazeera correspondents leave iraq accusing the station of being an extension of us propaganda after aljazeera broadcasted images of iraqis trampling on pictures of saddam hussein in response aljazeera suspended coverage by its correspondents in northern and southern iraq nevertheless aljazeera reportedly has substantially increased its subscriber base since the start of the war and has received much media attention an aljazeera correspondent tariq ayoub was killed in iraq after us missiles struck hotel in downtown baghdad the hotel has been base for foreign reporters aljazeera accused the united states of deliberately targeting its journalists an accusation the 21 statement by w hays parks house armed service committee hearing on iraqs violations of the law of armed conflict april 4 2003 aljazeera officials defended their decision to air pictures of the dead soldiers by saying that they had to air the pictures so that americans can make up their own minds about the iraq war 22 emotional tv coverage feeds popular view of war financial times march 31 2003 23 aljazeera calls on us to ensure free press reuters march 28 2003 crs8 united states denied vehemently during the war in afghanistan in 2001 jazeeras kabul office was accidently struck by us fire despite ayoubs death recent article in the newyorker noted marked improvement in relations between aljazeera and the us military according to aljazeera producer and reporter omar alissawi slowly people at centcom are starting to realize that were not the enemy were not some insensitive monster bent on bashing america24 in postwar iraq aljazeera has continued to slant its coverage against the united states labeling iraqi attacks against us forces as resistance to the occupation25 although many of aljazeeras reports from iraq are factual accounts of the latest events reports are often followed by critical statements of local iraqis without providing the perspective of coalition forces aljazeeras iraq coverage is often introduced by short series of images depicting us soldiers in negative light afghanistan the war on terrorism although aljazeeras coverage of operation desert fox brought the station much notoriety in 1998 it was its proximity to osama bin laden and the qaeda terrorist organization that brought the news network into the global mainstream when the united states began operation enduring freedom in afghanistan on october 7 2001 aljazeera was the only major news network with field office in kabul as was the case in iraq many observers were impressed with the stations ability to get the scoop as western networks were forced to rebroadcast aljazeera transmissions with their now identifiable gold logo in the corner of the screen however aljazeeras considerable access to the taliban and qaeda also brought it high degree of scrutiny from western governments particularly after it aired taped speeches of osama bin laden aljazeera had been airing taped interviews and footage of osama bin laden since 1998 as part of its regular coverage of the region 26 however after the attacks of september 11 2001 and jazeeras airing of bin laden tape only hours after the start of operation enduring freedom some western media outlets began to accuse aljazeera of being mouthpiece for qaeda 27 other observers even accused the station of collaborating with qaeda bush administration officials were displeased with the stations decision to air the tapes as secretary of state colin powell criticized aljazeera for carrying fierce and irresponsible statements from osama bin laden and other qaeda 24 hampton sides doha postcard centcom star the newyorker april 21 28 2003 25 media occasionally distort view of us role in iraq foreign broadcast information

148150 27 one popular london newspaper dubbed aljazeera as bin laden tv crs9 spokesmen28 other officials including national security director condoleezza rice held meetings with the major us news networks to formulate common policy toward future broadcasts of any new bin laden tape aljazeera staffers and others criticized the us government for trying to censor free speech us officials responded by asserting that the broadcasting of bin ladens tapes could pose threat to national security and suggesting that his speeches might contain hidden messages to followers around the world since the initial controversy over the bin laden tapes there have been number of reports as to why qaeda chose aljazeera as conduit for its messages many analysts believe that qaeda was attracted to aljazeeras large arabicspeaking audience observers also speculated that aljazeera eager to make headlines and without rigorous governmental scrutiny was in position to broadcast the bin laden tapes as opposed to the more cautious arab state media some analysts considered that qaeda would have found aljazeera to be sympathetic to its cause based on the networks past coverage of iraq in 1998 one theory explaining the aljazeera bin laden connection comes from aljazeeras london bureau chief yosri fouda who interviewed two of qaedas top leaders khalid sheikh mohammed and ramzi bin alsheeba both are now in us custody fouda had been chosen by qaedas leaders to tell their story according to fouda i asked them qaeda first of all why and they said that there are other journalists both inside and outside of aljazeera who are thought of as having some sort of degree of sympathy with their cause so for that very reason they said they wanted to have this story done by someone more secular in his professional approachso that their message would carry more credibility it confirmed my initial impression that there is someone who understands media and particularly television inside qaeda29 qaeda may have been looking for an outlet like aljazeera knowing that the station was eager to break big story and would be willing to present their point of view without editorializing its content in new york times magazine feature on fouda author peter maass noted that fouda is chameleon he mixes easily at both mosques and pubs he is in this way an excellent journalist because he can pretend to be all things to all people including friend to terrorists30 some commentators have pointed out that aljazeeras coverage of us operations in afghanistan in 2001 was similar in focus to its coverage of iraq year and half later again critics have noted that the station aired taliban claims of military successes on the battlefield with little or response from us officials jazeera also was criticized as placing virtually exclusive emphasis on the plight of 28 aljazeera not to change coverage of afghan events rejects us criticism watan bbc monitoring middle east october 12 2001 29 schleifer

wounded afghan women and children whereas in us government parlance the war in afghanistan was part of larger war on terrorism aljazeeras method for describing the war came with the preface of the war on what it calls terror31 analysts further criticized aljazeeras alleged overemphasis on covering civil liberties violations of american muslims asserting that such violations were the acts of individuals and contrary to us policy aljazeera and the israelipalestinian conflict as one of the most politically divisive conflicts in the world the israeli palestinian conflict has been source of contention for the worlds media challenging the objectivity of western and nonwestern media outlets alike within this context many observers believe that aljazeera is different like other arab networks and newspapers it has covered the conflict from distinctly arab perspective according to one aljazeera correspondent based in the west bank to be objective in this area is not easy because we live here we are part of the people of here and this situation belongs to us also and we have our opinions32 in contrast to statecontrolled arab media aljazeera has taken the controversial step of broadcasting interviews with and statements by israeli officials practice shunned by many arab channels aljazeera has invited israeli leaders such as shimon peres and ehud barak on air for tv interviews israel also has sent officials some of whom are fluent in arabic from its foreign ministry to appear on aljazeera indeed some arab governments newspapers and even palestinian hard liners have accused aljazeera of being in league with israel and acting as an extension of israeli intelligence aljazeera has noted that arab governments tend to vocalize accusations of aljazeeras collaboration with israel during times of tension between the station and foreign arab governments33 despite the novelty of israeli officials on arab television some analysts have pointed out that in covering the israelipalestinian conflict aljazeera follows similar approach to its coverage of the war in iraq and the war on terrorism in afghanistan it uses vivid violent montages of palestinian suffering to introduce news segments it employs language which describes suicide bombings as martyrdom operations and it calls the israeli army an occupation force this approach has caused some experts to suggest that aljazeeras personalization of the news in which it emphasizes arab and muslim victimization is template which has been applied in its coverage of iraq afghanistan and the israelipalestinian 31 see ajami what the muslim world is watching 32 inside aljazeera cbs 60 minutes october 10 2001 33 aljazeera has drawn the ire of many arab governments over the last several years specifically for critical coverage of arab leaders saudi arabia jordan and bahrain among others have used several retaliatory techniques against aljazeera and qatar itself including banning aljazeera in their respective countries expelling its journalists pressuring advertisers and even temporarily withdrawing ambassadors if the slight was considered serious enough aljazeera executives have boasted of having as many official detractors in the arab world as in the united states crs11 conflict mamoun fandy middle east expert and media analyst asserted that in one aljazeera anchors description of the us capture of the baghdad airport during the recent iraq war the anchor mistakenly replaced the united states with the word israel according to fandy you take the americans put the israelis you take the palestinians put the iraqis and the same script goes on34 aljazeeras detractors also have accused it of propagating antisemitic and antiisraeli viewpoints in an attempt to sensationalize its programming and boost its ratings in the fall of 2002 david duke former leader of the klu klux klan appeared on the aljazeera talk show without borders claiming that israeli intelligence knew in advance that the world trade center was about to be destroyed and that it had warned israelis to evacuate the towers before they were hit35 duke made the same argument in palestinian paper in january 2002 aljazeera also has been attacked for broadcasting talk show with the title is zionism worse than nazism in addition to hosting callin show which discussed the validity of the protocols of the elders of zion both shows did present different viewpoints unlike other arab media outlets however some observers claim that the antisemitic viewpoint was given an unfair amount of attention supporters of aljazeera believe that the stations coverage is not biased but merely reflects different perspective of the conflict in which palestinians are locked into war of independence with the israeli military according to jazeeras washington bureau chief hafez almirazi the first palestinian intifada uprising was covered by cnn which directed its coverage to western public and ended up dehumanizing the palestinian struggle and cause but because of our coverage and that of other arab satellite television channels the second intifada influenced arab public opinion more36 aljazeera also has drawn praise for its strong presence in the west bank and gaza strip as the station has been able to broadcast realtime coverage of israelipalestinian violence although the images of aljazeera broadcasts are often disturbing and beyond the norms found on us television proponents of aljazeera claim that they present more realistic picture of the daytoday hardships of life in the west bank and gaza strip during the present conflict other commentators have noted that even the palestinian authority like other arab governments has temporarily shutdown aljazeeras ramallah office when it disapproved of its broadcasts37 34 different language an online newshour transcript with jim lehrerpbs online newshour april 6 2003 35 winners in the war before the invasion of iraq few

has received much attention for its coverage of the war in iraq some observers suggest that despite its popularity it should not be treated as barometer for measuring the arab media as whole currently there are other television stations like the new 24hour news network alarabiya and many pan arab newspapers some of which are published in western capitals which reach wide audience on daily basis according to media analyst david hoffman most americans have heard of only aljazeera38 but in reality arabs get their news from variety of sources many of which are far worse than aljazeera indeed in november 2002 an egyptian television station which is partially government owned broadcast series entitled horseman without horse the story was chronicle of the arab struggle against colonial rule and against the establishment of the state of israel however it included subplot involving forged document the protocols of the elders of zion describing an alleged jewish plot for world domination which was used by the nazis as pretext for the holocaust39 aljazeeras impact on the middle eastern media as whole remains unclear some variety satellite networks have slightly altered their formats to include more debatestyle talk shows as previously mentioned new competitor news network alarabiya has started operating in dubais media city in the united arab emirates alarabiya reportedly has received great deal of financial backing from more conservative sources which may be reflected in its reporting style arab media watchers have observed that as popular as aljazeera has become many viewers still desire local news coverage making aljazeera only one of several news sources for the average viewer in the middle east40 some suggest that aljazeera because of its high subscription cost is equally as popular outside of the middle east as within in the united states subscribers can order aljazeera through satellite dish companies which package aljazeera with several other channels at price of several hundred dollars year policy options for congress aljazeeras ability to cover breaking news to promote its slick entertaining format and to project subtly its panarab panislamist approach to covering the news has sparked some us officials and analysts to suggest ways of promoting response to its distinctive influence others have dismissed calls for policy responses some experts warn that any overt us action could be viewed as heavy handed in region which has traditionally been sensitive to outside involvement in regional or local affairs aljazeera claims that us steps intended to promote more balanced media in the arab world will backfire because arabs will consider it propaganda effort of the us government range of possible actions has been proposed in one
