of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 and its extensions shows their time line and provides general overview of their implications and revenue effects the report focuses on the measures that extend or curtail the key tax relief provisions of egtrra and followup legislation rather than modify the respective parts of the tax code in some new way many aspects of the tax cuts such as revenue feedback effects have been discussed at length elsewhere including other crs reports referenced in the text therefore the details of these issues are left beyond the scope of this report president bush has advanced the idea of acrosstheboard tax cuts as one of the cornerstones of his economic policy since his first presidential campaign egtrra provided such relief but all of the acts provisions are scheduled to sunset revert to prior law levels at the end of 2010 thus congress faces the issue of whether to let the tax cuts expire or extend them and if so how in 2001 egtrra reduced marginal income tax rates provided marriage tax penalty relief provided temporary relief from the alternative minimum tax amt and increased the child tax credit the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 jgtrra pl 10827 accelerated the implementation of certain tax reductions that were being phasedin under the 2001 act the 2003 act also reduced the tax rate on dividend and longterm capital gains income effective through 2008 the working family tax relief act of 2004 pl 108311 extended many of the egtrra and jgtrra provisions scheduled to expire at the end of 2004 the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2005 pl 109222 extended the capital gains and dividend tax reduction through 2010 and the amt relief for one year additional tax reductions and extensions to these tax acts were included in the job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 pl 107147 the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109432 tax increase prevention act of 2007 pl 110166 and the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 pl 110343 number of bills have been introduced to extend all or some of the provisions of these acts notably sconres 70 adopted by the senate on march 14 2008 included amt relief and an amendment samdt 4160 by senator max baucus that would provide more than 300 billion in middle class tax relief the corresponding house measure hconres 312 proposes to subject the extension of the tax cuts to the payasyougo rule the conference agreement approved by both the house and senate in early june 2008 accommodates extending some of the tax cuts in manner consistent with the payasyougo rule this report will be updated to reflect legislative activity

extending some of the expiring tax cuts as well as an amt patch but in contrast to the senate bill subjects them to the payasyougo rule requiring offsetting revenue raisers the conference agreement approved by both the house and senate in early june 2008 supports tax relief consistent with the payasyougo rule its baseline projections propose to accommodate such tax relief items as marriage penalty relief the child tax credit and the 10 bracket and oneyear amt relief14 the budget resolution which is enforced by various points of order may constrain the size of the tax cuts subsequently

relating to the future of the 20012008 tax reductions range from their early recision to unconditional permanent extension several aspects of this decision play key role in shaping the views of many policymakers they include 1 the general desirability of providing tax relief 2 the cost of the cuts in view of budgetary constraints and 3 the distribution of the tax cuts benefits among different income groups of taxpayers in addition the extension of the tax cuts is intertwined with modifying the amt in general taxpayer pays either the amt or the regular tax whichever is higher thus absent congressional action the amt will take back most of the tax relief granted through the regular income tax as the amt becomes higher than the regular tax for many taxpayers 15 hence congress faces not only the issue of whether or not to extend or make permanent the reductions in the regular income tax but also how to coordinate the chan ges between these two parallel tax systems16 modifying the amt is probably the most pressing individual income tax issue currently facing congress it is estimated that if the reductions in the individual income tax are extended beyond 2010 the number of taxpayers subject to the amt will increase from over 1 million in 2001 to about 26 million in 2008 and then to almost 51 million in 2017 17 14 us congress conference committees 2008 concurrent resolution on the

20012008 tax cut provisions due to their diverse nature but economic theory suggests that some of them for example lower marginal tax rates are likely to reduce economic distortionsundesirable changes in behavior of economic agents resulting from imposing tax thus policymakers will weigh the benefits of tax reduction measures against their budgetary costs and other consequences ultimately the conclusion would depend on many factors the specifics of the provisions the time horizon and the financing method to name just few detailed analysis of this issue however goes beyond the scope of this paper 18 in addition tax reductions might be attractive for political or other reasons unrelated directly to economic performance counterbalancing the desire to provide continued tax relief is the concern over the current and projected size of the federal budget deficit the revenue effects of extending or making permanent the tax reductions would be substantial moreover once the costs of fixing the amt are included the revenue costs associated with maintaining the current level of tax relief increase considerably for instance table 1 presents congressional budget office cbo estimates of the cost of extending the egtrra and jgtrra tax reductions and reforming the amt 19 in addition to the direct costs of these policy options the table also presents associated debt service costsindirect costs which would arise if these policies are deficit financed that is if there are offsetting tax increases or spending reductions due to strong interactive effects between various tax provisions and other assumptions these numbers should be treated as orderofmagnitude estimates according to table 1 the estimated total cost of extending the egtrra and jgtrra tax cuts reforming the amt and servicing related debt would be 43 trillion over the fy2009fy2018 period but only 13 trillion over the first five years of this period the projected cost of the second five years would be almost 2½

economic activity generated by lowering taxes would largely offset the cuts cost while many of their opponents might agree that some positive revenue feedback effect is likely they contend that its magnitude is considerably smaller than the direct cost of the tax relief in addition theory suggests that revenue feedback effects depend on the design of the measures implying that feedback for some of the provisions of egtrra and followup legislation would be larger than for others22 partially extending the cuts might represent co mpromise that would continue to provide some tax relief while keeping its costs lower some proposals limit tax reductions by directly setting income limits for their recipients other proposals try to extend only those tax reductions that benefit taxpayers at the target income range for example during the 2008 presidential campaign senators john mccain and barack obama differed in their approach to extending the tax cuts senator mccain supported extending most of them he also advocated unrelated tax policies senator obama limited his support to the elements of the tax cuts that largely benefit middle or lowerincome families for example he indicated his support of extending the reduced marginal tax rates of 28 and below but repealing the reduction of the marginal tax rates above that level among other measures favored by senator obama were also the increased child tax credit and marriage penalty elimination provisions23 since the election the policy preferences of president elect obama might have changed somewhat in response to deteriorating economic conditions but as of this writing they remain unknown table 3 reproduces cbo estimates of extending the tax reductions by individual provision or distinct group of provisions24 the estimates provide the general magnitude of the cost and relative size of extending each provision however because of the interaction between the provisions extending all of the tax provisions would produce greater revenue loss than the revenue loss indicated by summing up the revenue costs of all the extended provisions finally there is always an option of providing tax relief through different set of policies more loosely or not at all related to the 2001 through 2008 tax cuts for example the reductions of some of the marginal rates might be extended while others modified or allowed to expire for years after 2010 large number of possible alternatives are listed in the cbo budget options report 25 as well as in other publications issued by various government and private entities 22 for more

the distributional effects of the enacted measures table 4 presents cbo data on the effective individual income tax rates in 2000200526 by 2005 most of the tax reductions were phased in thus the analysis may serve as reasonably close approximation to the effects of the fully phasedin tax cuts the tax cuts were the key although not the only factor determining the distribution of the tax burden over the time span shown examination of table 4 shows that the effective tax rate for all taxpayers fell by 28 percentage points from 118 to 9 however the gains are distributed unevenly among taxpayers belonging to different quintilesgroups of onefifth of all households arranged by income whereas the lowest quintile received 19 percentage point cut the top quintiles cut was 34 percentage points none of the bottom four quintiles received cut exceeding 25 percentage points but the taxpayers in the top 1 received reduction of 48 percentage points expanding the analysis to include the
