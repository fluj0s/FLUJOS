dentical exist and to t he extent they do assess their impact on provider participation and beneficiary access to care scope and methodology the fiscal intermediary contract and oversi ght division ficod medical dental services branch mdsb conducted an assessment of the status of dentical from both beneficiary access and provider participation perspective data and information was collected from relevant sources regarding the broad areas of provider participation and access to care and compiled into written report baseline data from 2002 2006 was used to demonstrate the affect of changes due to legislation regulation policy changes and court order mdsb utilized data stakeholder input and program speciali sts and dental consultants to substantiate whether or not barriers to ca re in the dentical program exist most of the questions have been answered to the level necessary to draw conclusions dentical was compared to medi caid programs in the states of new york new jersey north dakota pennsylvania and wisconsin becaus these states offered similar levels of adult dental benefits in addition we reviewed program summary information regarding enhancements intended to incr ease beneficiary access that were implemented by the states of washington chigan delaware indiana south carolina and virginia sources utilized to obtain information the principal source of information containe d in this assessment is from the dentical program itself which is administered under contract by the departments dental fiscal intermediary delta dental of california delta dental at the direction of mdsb delta dental dentical staff developed informa tion and provided analytical support in addition sources of information included other state medicaid program s the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the ca lifornia dental association the health consumer alliance the california healthcare foundation the childrens dental health project mdsb staff dental c onsultants and various local health departments 3executive summary the fiscal intermediary contract and oversi ght division ficod dental services branch dsb has conducted an assessment of the medical dent program focused on provider participation and beneficiary acce ss to care and utilization of services the primary issues addressed in the assessm ent with regards to provider participation were rates paid to providers for dentical services the provider enrollment process claims submission requirements and challenges treatment authorization requirements and antifraud efforts regarding beneficiaries the focus was on acce ss to care do beneficiaries know that dental services are available to them and what those services are are they able to find providers who will treat them and to what extent they utilize services in brief the assessment concluded that low provider participation is caused by low payment rates burdensome documentation requirements for claims submission treatment authorization requirements and the perception of inconsistent claims adjudication beneficiary access to care and resulti ng low utilization is impacted by lack of knowledge that medical provides dental services lack of enrolled providers who are specialists particularly in treating young children pregnant women and disabled persons problems locating participating providers in rural or less populated counties and program limitations these conclusions and the corresponding findings are outlined in the following report 4section 1 rates how do denticals rates compare to other medicaid states private payers and usual and customary rates ucr dentical rates for payment of services are established in t he schedule of maximum allowances sma rates are procedure specific and program requirements dictate that dentical payment will be the sma or the dentists usual and customary rate whichever is less almost without exception the sma is the lower rate typically the dentical sma is less than half of the aver age usual and customary rate for dentists statewide for the most part rates have not increased since 2000 providers and provider and benef iciary advocates both assert that dentical rates are too low often do not cover the provider s cost of rendering treatment and impede provider participation and benef iciary access to dental care further they assert that this is particularly true with regard to finding specialists who will treat dentical patients as well as in finding providers in rural areas and those who will tr eat children pregnant women persons with severe disabilities and beneficiaries who are institutionalized findings facts related to dentical rates include dentical rates have not increased since 2000 and have only increased by approximately 5 in the past 13 years further in 2003 rates for sub gingival curettage and root planing were reduced by more than 40 unless provided in longterm care facility the consumer price index cpi published by the department of finance illustrates that california has experienced an increase of 246 from fi scal year fy 9900 through fy 0506 delta dental of california premier average general practice rates selected procedures are 118 higher that d entical rates see table 1 dentical rates are approximately 43 below deltas statewide average preferred provider organization ppo schedule further the delta ppo average rate schedule is 25 30 below delta premier facts related to dental rates in other state medicaid programs mdsb staff gathered and reviewed medicaid dental rate dat from those other st ates that offered adult services when looking at the demographics of states that offered some level of adult services we found new york to compare most closely to california new yorks medicaid dental rates are about 51 higher on average than dentical rates new york increased its medicaid ra tes for dental services in the year 2000 as the result of settlement of lawsuit filed against it by the new rk dental society the court sanctioned settlement resulted in fee increases totaling 154m over two year period for fee for serv ice providers only rate increases were not included for dental hmos hospital clinics freestanding clinics and dental schools which provide treatment to over 40 of new yorks benef iciaries receiving dental services the 5agreement included stipulatio n that fees be increased by an additional 48 million contingent upon acceptable increases in provider participation and recipient access although both the new york dental society and the new york dental advisory committee recommended implementati on of this additional increase the state declined to do so other states most notably washington michigan delaware indiana south carolina tennessee and virginia have also implemented various rate increases specifically washingtons access to baby and child dentistry abcd program which has been operating since 1995 reimburses dentists at 75 of their usual fees for selected services provided to medicaid enrolled children ages 05 michigan settled lawsuit in august 2007 that locked in higher medicaid dental rates for services provided to children delaware increased rates in 1998 to 85 of reasonable and customary which is comparable to commercial rates as of 2006 more than 40 of licensed dentists accept medicaid patients and 30 of medicaid children population receive services indiana increased rates in 1998 to the 75th percentile of rates reported in an ada survey within two years providers tr eating medicaid enrolled children increased by 42 and dental visits by these children more than doubled by fy 2005 almost 40 of the total number of children enrolled in the medicaid program were receiving dental services south carolina tennessee and virgin ia experienced similar results after increasing medicaid dental rate s by comparable amounts each of these states melded rate increases whether all inclusive or for selective procedures with variety of other pr ogram enhancements including reduced administrative burdens for providers aggres sive outreach to the dental community partnerships with university dent schools selective training for providers etc their findings indicate that in combinat ion with these other program enhancements increasing rates results in significant increases in provider participation and beneficiary utilization conclusions the relationship between medicaid pa yment rates and access to patient care is complex however research of other state medicaid pr ograms that have raised dental fees and californias own experienc in implementing court ordered rate increase in the 1990s clark v kiser indi cates that rate increases contribute to increased program participation the result of rate increases in combination with other program improvement measures are that dentists who are already active medicaid providers see more patients more dentists enroll in the program claims activity increases and beneficiary utilization goes up 6 rate increases alone will not sustain provider participat ion over an extended period of time the value of todays dentical rates has declined substantially since 2000 dentical rates are extremely low in co mparison to commercial payer rates and ucr tables table 1 compares dentical rates with the statewide average rates for delta premier the statewide average delt premier rates are 102 hi gher than dentical rates

participation how does the cu rrent provider enrollment process affect dental providers in order to participate in dent ical providers must enroll in the program this is longstanding federal and stat program participation requi rement the enrollment process requires the provider to submit completed provi der enrollment application to the program the enrollment process including the pr ovider enrollment form and participation requirements is governed by st atute and regulations that pertain to all medical providers including dentists dentica l enrollment is conducted by the dental fi under the oversight of the state dental providers and the cda assert that the enrollment process is cumbersome and timeconsuming they also state that t he enrollment forms are not user friendly and contain considerable information that is not relevant to dental provider findings total number of dentical providers is dropping 6749 billing providers are currently enrolled this is 1030 132 fe wer providers than were enrolled in july 2003 the total number of rendering providers on the provider master file is approximately 23000 approximately 10000 provided services in july 2007 dentical providers must use generi c medical provid er enrollment forms the enrollment forms used for dentical are used for all medical provider applicants an appreciable am ount of the information re quested on these forms is irrelevant to dentists over 50 of initial provider applications are returned 55 of initial provider applications and 5 of medical supplement changes are returned to the provider because they are missing information required by medical regulations dentical processes complete enrollment package in 35 days dentical takes an average of 35 days to process complete enrollment application from provider once enrolled rendering providers are longer required to reapply for each service location this provision effective cember 2005 reduced the number of applications rendering providers had to submit to provide services at different locations conclusions there is hard evidence to support the allegations that the dentical provider enrollment process is an impedi ment to participation in the program however dentical statistics show that 55 of provider enrollment applications are returned because they are incomplete eg various licenses proof of insurance permits lease agreements etc are missing note according to the dhcs provider enrollment division approximately 40 45 of all other medical provider 10enrollment applications are also returned bec ause they are incomplete the use of generic medical provider enrollment forms requires dental providers to work through multiple pages of extraneous informati on that do not pertain to dentists if nothing else such forms cause frustrati on and dissatisfaction with the program and could be contributing factor to the high percentage of appl ications that are being returned declining number of providers reduces access to care there is correlation between low provider participation and low beneficiary utilization see access to care however this is much larger i ssue than just provider enrollment recent statutes regulations and policy changes may influence provider participation program changes implement ed since 2000 appear to affect providers willingness to participate in dentical during the period of july 2003 to present dentical provider enrollment has decreased by 1030 or by 132 see appendix one could conc lude that the im position of additional requirements eg pretreatment xrays annual cap on adult dental services increased provider enrollment requirements and restrictions on some laboratory processed crowns to participate in the dentical program when combined with low rates and burdensome documentation requirements has resulted in significant number of providers dropping out of the program 11section 3 cl aims review are there admin istrative barriers that preclude participation such as docum entation burdens inconsistent adjudication attachments paperwork etc in order to receive payment fr om dentical provi ders must submit claim to the dental fiscal intermediary claims must be submitted wit hin six months of the date of service if submitted later the claim pay ment will be reduced accordingly the majority of dental claims are submitted by billing providers andor their bookkeepers in hard copy less than 30 of all claims are submitted electroni cally and those are generally submitted by provi ders with multiple locations and large numbers of dentical patients claims submission requirements for dentical parallel those of the remainder of the medical program ie the sa regulations govern claim submittals program wide standard requirements are provider information such as provider number and location of service and signature patient information treatment provided et c further denti cal requirements are in r egulation including additiona l documentation for certain services or procedures the california dental asso ciation cda and providers in terviewed both inperson and by telephone assert that the program r equirements for submittal of claims are burdensome and impede provider participatio n their complaints include overly burdensome and cumbersome documentation requirements inconsistent processing and adjudication of claims dentical staff are not helpful when providers call with complaints or claims problems eg dentical is often arbitrary and hostile findings general information re lated to dentical claims processing the basic provider and patient information requirements for dentical claims are generally the same as those required by commercial dental insurance carriers during the quarter sampled 2nd quarter 2006 slightly mo re than 50 of dentical claims and notices of authorization noas required only the basic information 37 of claims are autoadjudicated that is once the claim is scanned into the system and auto corrected it is processed automatically by t he california dental management information system cd mmis and does not require manual intervention for calendar year 2006 88 of claims were approved 6 were denied and 6 were modified which usually results in so level of payment to the provider 6 percent of claims are returned rtdd to the provider for more information note there is correlation between cl aims that are rtdd and claims that are modified 12 the most common reason for denying claim service line in 2006 was due to the lack of xrays or photographs additionally modifying xray procedures to the program limitations is the most common re ason for modifying claim service line the five most common reas ons for rtding claim are rtd code 9 verify beneficiarys first and last name ie the name on the claim form does not match fiscal intermediary ccess to medical eligibility fame file 10 of rtdd claims rtd code 3 verify beneficiarys birt hdate monthdayyear ie the birthdate on the claim form does not match fame 9 rtd code 56 submit other cove rage eobra or denial 9 rtd code 57 submit other coverage fee schedule 9 rtd code 5 verify beneficiarys sex ie the sex on the claim form does not match fame 8 note the percentages expressed in t he common reasons for rtding are that percentage of the 6 of claims that are rdtd claims documentation 48 of claims require documentation to be included with the claim based on 2006 second quarter data for the most part commercial plans do not require extensive documentation for significant number of services as does dentical claim documentation require ments are procedurecode specific but generally fall into these categories radiographs specialized dental charts and record s eg handicapp ing labiolingual deviation hld index tracings clin ical photograph plaster study models dc016 ortho and dc054 prosthodontics the dc016 and dc054 forms are unique to dentical if the provider fails to s ubmit required documentation on claim it is denied the claims process stops and the provider re ceives notice of denial for lack of documentation if the prov ider so chooses heshe can submit claim inquiry form with the missing information which results in the claims process starting over appeals from january 2006 and july 2007 an average of 110 providers month 1300year appealed claim denial the most common types of service denials that were appealed were for extractions 49 restorations 24 and root canalscrowns 20 13changes in requirements since 2000 appendix contains listing of legislative and regulator changes that have impacted the medical program since 2000 conclusions almost 50 of all claims require documentation beyond the claim form including x rays and documentation dentical documentation r equirements are viewed as burdensome ie they are many and far exceed what is required by commercial dental payers it should be noted however that commercial plans hav copayments and meaningful yearly maximums ie that is how t hey control utilization because dentical is medicaid program dentical has far mo re utilization control proc edures in place approximately 11 of claimed service lines that require xrays or documentation are denied while the reasons for denial may be valid this is major point of discontentment with providers they are frustrated that such high percentage of their claims are denied for technical r easons that often have nothing to do with whether the service was provided or necessa ry as result t he dentical claims payment process is viewed as an impediment to provider participation and hence barrier to care although providers are offered numer ous avenues to better understand the denti cal claims payment process eg traini ng provided by dentical 800 telephone lines provider bulletins cda seminars etc claim denials remain high leading us to again conclude that the overa ll process is burdensome the conversion of dentica l from the use of local co des dentical specific to national standard codes curr ent dental terminology codes or cdt will provide some billing simplification for providers in that they will be able to use the same codes on dentical claims t hat they use for claims to commercial payers this conversion is planned for december 2007 in addition the conversion to cdt codes will reduce andor eliminate some claims documentation requirement s examples include the elimination of the requirements for submission of final endodontic treatment films written documentation for use of nitrous in children under 13 denture labor atory relines denture tissue conditioning and denture repairs there is anecdotal information from providers and the cda that claims are adjudicated inconsistently in that inc onsistent adjudication is one of the most frequent provider complaints however when mdsb requests specific examples so the allegations can be researched they ar usually not forthcoming thus mdsb has not been able to determine whether those particular complaints are valid as result mdsb dental consultants are curr ently conducting study of random sample of claims specifically to det ermine whether or not claims are being adjudicated inconsistently preliminary fi ndings indicate that there may some legitimacy to these complaints however further study is warranted 14 of the legislatively mandated changes since 2000 that have impact ed dentical the following have had direct impact on claims sbx1 26 enacted july 1 2003 required pretreatment xrays to ju stify medical necessity for restoration 4 or more restrictions on posterior laboratoryprocessed crowns this restriction requires the dentist to treat the patient with prefabricated stainless steel crown an undetermined num ber of providers may refu to put stainless steel crown on tooth in some circum stances it is considered to be below the accepted standard of care for dentistry such si tuations may lead to the provider refusing to treat the patient and in some cases dropping out of dentical in protest ab 131 enacted january 1 2006 impos ed 1800 annual cap on adult dental services per calendar year 15section 4 treatment authorization requests tars are there barriers to obtaining approval of treatm ent authorization requests and if so what are they and what is the impact of delayed treatment for certain procedures providers must subm it requests to dentical for authorization prior to performing the services these are known as treatment au thorization requests tars the purpose of the tar process is to ensure benef iciaries are not subjected to unnecessary services and to prevent prov ider fraud or abuse essentially the process serves as utilization control this is necessary due to th nature of dentical government funded typically shared financial responsibi lity from beneficiaries and in most cases annual monetary limit as result this type of utilization control is necessary to preserve the integrity of the program yet both provider and beneficiary advocates contend that the tar process is too burdensome takes too long impedes beneficia ries access to medically necessary care and often results in patients being bill ed inappropriately for services some providers decline to submit tar and instead encourage patients to enter into payment arrangements through high interest rate dental credit cards this point has been illustrated several times over in conlan claims for dental services additionally providers contend t hat dentical is inconsistent and often incorrect in their adjudication of tars thus harming beneficia ries when treatment is unduly denied findings prior authorization is not requi red for the majority of medic dental procedures for example emergency dental services never require prior authorization and in most cases preventative and restorative treatments do not require tars those services that do requi re prior authorization are hospital care non emergency periodontal services gum disease treatments endodontics root canals orthodontics laboratoryprocessed crowns complete and partial dentures maxillofacial surgical services tar volume has decreased slightly in 2006 this may be attributable in part to the 1800 cap on adult services was implemented in 2006 it is probable that some providers have decided to not go through t he administrative burden of submitting tar and waiting for approval for servic that may exceed the beneficiarys annual cap on services with the implementation of cdt4 codes dentical will longer require prior authorization for denture laboratory relines denture tissue conditioning or denture 16repairs except repairs to cast framewor ks for partials this will decrease the number of tars that are requir ed although not substantially information related to the processing of tars processing times for tars are 90 are processed in 15 days or less 99 are processed in 30 days or less the average processing time for all tars is 15 days if provider fails to submit required docum entation on tar it is not denied rather the tar is pended aka deferred and resubmission turnaround document rtd is mailed to the pr ovider within 24 hours the provider can provide the missing information on the rtd form and retu rn it to dentical for immediate processing failure to respond to an rtd is one of the most common reasons for the denial of tars the most common reasons that tars are rtdd are provider signature missing or invalid verify beneficiarys first and last name submit copy of dmvother credible photo of the beneficiary submit current xraysphotographs provider did not resubmit tar with requested information miscellaneous which includes patient physician documentation of medica l condition that precludes removable appliance missing orthodontic information specialist report or resubmit study models to replace those received broken epsdtss information proof of medicare denialother coverage to clarify conflict between request ed prosthodontic treatment and the justification of need for pr osthetics cd054 form dentical consistently processes tars wit hin the contractually required time frames or less however it should be noted that when tar is rtdd for additional information or requires review by state mdsb dental consultant or clinical screening appointment is requir ed the processing time clock is stopped and the tar is in wait status the majority of tars on wait status are due to clinical screening appointment clinical screening appointment is an i ndependent review of t he medical necessity or appropriateness of the requested treatment by licensed dentist engaged by delta dental who maintains network of clinical screeners to perform these 17functions in this process the b eneficiary is required to attend screening appointment during which t he screening dentist will conduct clinical examination of the patient to determine whether or not the services requested on the tar are medically necessary 2006 statistics show that 85000 clinical prescreenings 2216 post screenings and 20078 convalescent prescreenings were scheduled for total of 107384 of these 107384 tars pended for clinical screening 39 of screening appointments were cancelled which either further dela ys treatment ie the appointment has to be rescheduled or results in the tar event ually being denied and service being provided when dentical makes an approval or deni decision on tar notice of authorization noa is issued the noa includes the procedures that were allowed or denied the provider can only provide t he services that were allowed or the provider can send in the noa for reevaluation whenever service that requires prior aut horization on tar is denied or modified the beneficiary is notified by dentical and has the right to file for fair hearing to appeal the denial of service in the second quarter of 2006 278042 tars were submitted of the tars submitted during this quarter 443 of cl aim service lines csls were denied by dentical note tar may have multiple service lines most common reasons csl on tar are denied 2006 data procedure is adjuctive to denied procedure lack of response to rtd adjudication of tars there is anecdotal information that tars are adjudicated inconsistently ie inconsistent adjudication is one of the most frequent complaints expressed by providers however when mdsb requests specific exampl from providers they are not usually forthcoming as result we have not been able to validate those complaints mdsb dental consultants will be under going detailed review of sample of tars to determine whether these complaints are founded conclusions providers perceptions that dentical tar requirements are burdensome and time consuming may be wellfounded in part because 1 when compared to the commercial world large number of procedur require tars before they can be completed 2 significant number of tard claim services are denied and 3 large number of tars are put in wait status in comparison to requirements for commercial payers where treatment authorizat ion is seldom required the dentical prior authorization process is cumbersome 18 to the extent that the tr eatment authorizatio n process results in delayed treatment or treatment not being provided at all the tar requirement is barrier to care contributing factors include providers failing to respond to tars that have been rtdd lack of beneficiary follow through on clin ical screening appointments leading to denial of the request for treatment authorization once tar is approved it is not unusual for beneficiaries to fail to return for the treatment there may be va riety of reasons for the beneficiary failing to return for treatment including heshe may have moved doesnt have transportation andor are longer in discomfort so they dont feel co mpelled to return for the treatment 19section 5 antifraud efforts what impact if any do dentical antifraud efforts have on provider participation dentical antifraud efforts are part of the surs sur veillance utilization review subsystem function which is mandated function for state medicaids denticals surs and antifraud efforts are carried out by delta dental under their dental fiscal intermediary contract for many years the surs and anti fraud efforts were minimally staffed functions of the state eventually responsibil ity for those functions was transitioned to the fiscal in termediary delta dental in the most recent fiscal intermediary contract the extent of those functions was greatly increased the surs and antifraud efforts in dentical are extensive currently these functions are staffed by 45 full time delta staff thus the number of provider reviews audits and demands for repayment has greatly increased in the last several years this is significant particularly in light of the relatively small size of the program approximately 600 million in claims payments in comparis on with the medical feeforservice ffs program approximately 12 billion in claims payments dentical exp enditures are about 5 of medical ffs expenditures the california dental association cda who represents mem ber providers has expressed serious concerns including in the pr ess about the extent of these activities and the negative impact on prov iders providers who ar not members of the cda express the same concerns dentists who have been longstanding parti cipating dentical providers without significant problems are now complaini ng about the aggressive and punitive and arbitrary and hostile actions as they perce ive them of dentical with regard to surs and antifraud functions further providers and the cda believe that the philosophy of the review and audit process should be to improv quality of care to correct or assist dentists in meeting participation requirements and to identify and prevent fraud instead they feel providers are being run out of the program in fact provider participation is declining and the decline may be due in par t to these issues in addition providers are extremely concerned about requirements to repay the program in cases where the treatment was provided necessary and appr opriate the quality of care was acceptable and the claims submitted refl ect the treatment provided they contend that repayment is inappropriate and punitive under such circumstances lastly providers who have been put on s pecial claims review scr or prior authorization pa as result of reviews or audits say t hey have very little opportunity to dialogue with dentical about their concerns or to receive help in clearly understanding what they must do differently to have t hese administrative sanctions removed the surs and antifraud functions hav been undergoing close scrutiny by mdsb management over the last year several areas of concern hav been identified that necessitated corrections andor changes for example when service was disallowed in an audit for documentation not justifying the level of service billed the entire amount was being disallowed rather than the provider being given credit for the service that was justified by the document ation in other cases services were being disallowed in their 20entirety for insufficient document ation even when it was veri fiable within the chart for example by an xray that the service was provided necessary and billed accordingly these issues have been rectified and others are being addressed findings key aspects of the dent ical antifraud program dentical profiles approximately 500 provider s year this is 13 of active billing providers in this process providers billing patterns and practices are reviewed and compared to other providers with similar practices geographically number of patients types of servic provided etc for purposes of this report providers ear ning more than 10000 year from denti cal are considered active in other words they regularly treat dentical patients to some extent based on the profiling outcome provider may be selected for onsite review andor patient chart review the results of c hart review may be action imposition of special claims review andor prior aut horization andor audit for recovery if the chart review indicate s insufficient documentation of services the provider may be put on scr which is posttreatmentpre payment review to insure that the procedures billed were provided and adequately performed and match the claims information if it is determined that dentist may be pr oviding unnecessary services or higher level services than needed the provider may be put on pa for those types of services this means before the provider can provide those services to dentical patients heshe must obtain authoriz ation to perform the service some providers are put on both scr and pa approximately 250 billing prov iders are on scr and 250 are on pa at any one time initially providers are put on 9 month rms for scr or pa however those terms are often renewed multiple times it is not uncommon for scr or pa to be renewed up to 6 7 and 8 terms the result is prov ider can remain on scr or pa for years providers on scr or pa are now provided wit h contact number to the delta dental consultant in charge of scrpa furt hermore mdsb working with the fi has instituted remedial action provider plan rapp in which extra effort will be directed toward providers when they are initially placed scr or pa depending on the extent of the findings subset of profiled providers may be subjected to full audit for recovery approximately 60 providers will be audited annually 15 of active billing providers providers are selected for audit based upon many factors some of which are profiling data review of sample re cords review of regional screening examinations review of subsequent treat ing dentists claimstars if available 21any past history of beneficiary complaints andor allegations of substandard care and information from other sources such as dhcs or doj investigations the amount of overpayments being issued has increased dramatically in the last few years due to the implement ation of the extrapolation of audit findings to the providers entire dent ical patient population for three years for example if 200 patient charts are reviewed and 10000 in claims are disallowed that 10000 overpayment will be extrapolated to the providers dentical population which exponentially increases the overpayment it is not unusual for the extrapolation to quadruple the overpaym ent and more these extrapolated audits are based on statistically valid samples and are actuarially sound further this conf orms to the standard methodology used by dhcs audits and investigations when auditing the remainder of medical providers despite this conformity to ai audit policies and practices dentical providers view the use of extrapolated audits as being hostile and unfair dentical provider surveys random informal survey of several dozen providers throughout the state was conducted by telephone number of these providers expressed t hat they felt that they were being viewed as potential abusers by the dentical program based on the utilization controls program lim itations claim denials etc while they voiced their understanding of the need for antifraud processes several thought that the demands placed on the providers in the d entical program were unreasonable and resulted in fewer providers for dentical patients on june 18 2007 dentical mailed survey s to 1352 providers regarding recent telephone contacts with the program an equal number of surveys were sent to providers who had been under surs review and those who had not to date total of 567 surveys have been returned and those returns were equally split between the surs providers an d the nonsurs providers of the providers who responded the majority expressed sati sfaction with the written and verbal communications from dentical there was appreciable difference in responses from the two groups conclusions some level of dentical surs and antifraud activities are necessary to preserve the integrity of the program and prevent fraud and abuse the current level of surs and antifraud acti vities may be out of proportion to the size of the program and shoul d be evaluated for resizing overall providers who have been reviewed by surs have indicated that dentical program communications have been satisfactory these activities primarily result in the ident ification of issues with poor or insufficient documentation rendering providers not being enrolled in the program and inaccurate billing practices 22 referrals to dhcs audits and investigations for fraud andor abuse are fairly rare less than 5 based on issues identified in the last year by program managem ent it appears that providers and provider advocates have some legitimate concerns regarding surs activities and antifraud findings further indepth review of these activiti is warranted and further corrections and adjustments may be in order 23section 6 beneficiary access to care on average there are 61 milli on medical beneficiaries per month eligible to receive dentical services in order to access dent ical covered services the beneficiary must obtain treatment from dentical enrolled provider there is concern within the administration and the beneficiary stakeholder community that beneficiaries are not able to access medi cal dental care in part because they do not realize dental services are provided or they dont understand what services are available or they cannot locate provider s who will treat them the health consumer alliance hca an advocacy group representing t he interests of medical beneficiaries recently stated that lack of knowledge and understanding about the availability of denti cal benefits and covered services remains barri er to access to care as evidence of this they cite the california health ca re foundations chcf 2006 dentical facts and figures report they assert that the program does not provide enough education and outreach about the program to beneficiaries as an example they cite the fact that when the legislature and stat have expanded dental benefits such as certain dental services for pregnant women beneficiaries remain unaware of the benefits and therefore do not take advantage of them one complaint that is frequently voiced to ntical is that benefic iaries have difficulty locating provider who will tr eat them hca states there are an insufficient number of dentists and oral health specialists enrolled in the dentical progr am to meet the need for care because only one in four licensed ntists in california accept dentical patients this figure may actually be over stated because many dentists are enrolled providers but treat very few patients there is suggestion regarding what sufficient number would be likewise report entitled putting teeth in to health care reform issued in june 2007 by the dental health foundation states f amilies and advocates throughout the state both in rural and urban areas have very diffic ult time finding dentists accepting medi cal particularly for young children and those who are not english language proficient this is especially true for specialty care such as endodontics periodontics or tooth replacement it is not clear how they arrived at the conc lusion that finding dentical provider is problem in both urban and rural areas which is not consistent with denti cals findings however as it pertains to specialty providers it is accurate currently there are 6767 billing provider s enrolled in dentica l these billing providers have total of 7715 service cations and approximately 13000 rendering providers however not all rendering providers are ac tive treating providers while there is compelling evidence that acce ss to care is significant problem for beneficiaries who reside in rural areas as outlined below it does not appear to be significant problem in the areas where t he vast majority of beneficiaries live findings lack of knowledge or understanding of dentical benefits beneficiaries are notified by the state that dental services are covered at several different points in the eligibility process 24 the medical beneficiary eligibility app lication form identifies dental care as covered service on the front of the form when beneficiaries are deemed eligible and receive their beneficiary identification card it is accompanied by letter that tells them to take the card to the doctor pharmacy hospital or any other health ca re provider you may see however some beneficiaries may not correla dentistry to health care after eligibility is established beneficiari also receive booklet medical what it means to you that provides them with an overview of the program its benefits and how to access care throughout this booklet there are references to dental care as covered service in addition beneficiaries in ngeles and sacramento counties receive information regarding their option to enro ll in dental managed care plans again reinforcing the availability of dental services all of these notifications and other informati on are available in multiple languages in addition dental services are identifi ed as covered benefits on the medical website with link to the dentical websit finally the denti cal website provides detailed information regarding dental servic available to medical beneficiaries in addition beneficiary awareness activiti are included in the dental fiscal intermediary outreach and education progr am examples of activities are distribution of dentical broc hures at health fairs and videot apes distributed to social services agencies and school districts in spite of these notificati ons and available information the fact is that less than one third of beneficiaries utilize dentical rvices which may be an indicator they do not fully understand that dental services are av ailable to them or what those services are even when beneficiaries know that dental care is available there is some evidence that they do not understand those services almost two million beneficiaries utilize dentical every year the dentical beneficiary call center receives over 250000 calls year assuming most of t he beneficiary calls are from unduplicated beneficiaries approximately 12 of all users call the program thirtyfive percent 88900 of those user calls are for general program information and small number are complaints based on the fact that so many calls are for general information it is apparent that many beneficiaries do not understand the program or their benefits in addition to the calls dentical receives directly health consumer centers take approximately 1000 calls year regarding dentical almost third of those calls are regarding beneficiaries ck of awareness with how to use dentical services and or services being unavailable or inaccessible language barriers can also contribute to beneficiaries lack of understanding regarding dental services in the past year language translation line has been implemented in the beneficiary call center to provide assistance to beneficiaries in 25multiple languages an average of 150 callers month use this service the most frequently used languages on the line are russian farsi and mandarin in addition to this the call center is staffed with spanish speakin g operators who handle approximately 38000 year in spanish 15 of all calls inability to locate provider dentical call center statistics reveal that 39 slightly more than 99000 of the calls received annually by the call center are for provider referrals thus ten percent of dentical users call for assistance to find provider conversely 90 of those beneficiaries that utilize dental services do not call for referrals which would indicate they are able to find dentical pr oviders without assistance interestingly enough this if very close to the pe rcentage of beneficiaries who reside in metropolitan areas where 88 of d entical providers do business when beneficiaries do call for referrals t he call center operator s provide them with the names and phone numbers for multiple dent ical enrolled providers in their zip code or as close to it as possible complaints are occasionally made that benef iciaries are referred to providers who longer accept dentical these co mplaints have generally been anecdotal and infrequent in comparison to the number of referrals made on quarterly basis providers are asked to verify that they are still taking medical patients if not they are removed from the referral list as res ponses come in the referral list is updated weekly thus the referral list stays fairly current recently the dental services branch r andomly contacted two dozen providers from the referral list in various counties ll but one of those prov iders was accepting dentical patients as the re ferral list indicated many billing providers treat fairly small number of medic beneficiaries in fact 13 of billing providers treat only few m edical patients year earnings range from 0 to less than 600 year another 27 treat relatively small number earning from 600 to 10000 ear the remaining sixt percent of the billing providers approx 4000 treat the majority of dentica l beneficiaries analysis shows that approximately 85 of beneficiaries reside in just 16 counties typically metropolitan areas the other 15 live in the remaining 42 counties consistent with that 88 of enrolled d entical providers are in the same 16 counties and 12 of the providers are in 38 of the remaining 42 counties five counties currently have dent ical enrolled providers shortage of specialists to serve population of 61m 12 m of whom are users denti cal has approximately 1500 rendering providers who are selfidentified as specialist s in descending order of numbers of providers these specialties are orthodontists oral surgeons pedodontists periodontists and prosthodontists almost all are in the more urban areas virtually specialists are available to t he dentical population in rura l areas further that does not necessarily mean those specialists are r endering services to significant number of 26patients particularly given the fact that 40 of enrolled providers treat very few patients in contrast there are significantly higher nu mber of specialists available to medical beneficiaries enrolled in dental managed care plans 3254 specialists to treat 380000 beneficiaries utilization from 2000 through 2004 the number of benef iciaries utilizing dental services steadily increased this increase levele d out in 2005 in 2006 beneficiary utilization began declining and by the end of fiscal year 0607 it had declined by almost 5 likewise the number of services prov ided to beneficiaries increased from 2001 through 2005 by 15 but in 2006 the number of services provided decreased slightly by 2 from 2002 through 2006 the services most frequently utilized were consistently office visits diagnostics and restorative procedures these services comprise 88 90 of all services since 2002 conclusions overall there does not appear to be signi ficant access to care problem in urban areas the vast majority of beneficiaries 85 reside in the same counties where comparable majority of denti cal providers 88 do business similarly 90 of the users of dentical services do not seek referrals and 10 do access to care in counties with fewer than 100000 beneficiaries the 42 counties where 15 of medical beneficiaries reside is problem five of these counties have dentical enrolled prov iders at all while the rema ining 38 counties have only 1000 billing providers inclusive add to that the fact that many billing providers treat very few patients and access to care is even less available even within less populated counties access vari greatly in counties they are very close to major metropolitan areas such as sonoma placer and marin the ratio of providers to beneficiaries is relatively high conversely in the most remote or rural counties such as norte colusa and inyo access to care is extremely low 27section 7 other medical provided dental care dental managed care approximately 380000 beneficiaries are enrolled in dental managed care plans in sacramento and angeles count ies those plans are r equired to cover the same range of services provided under feeforservi ce utilization in these plans averages 24 which is similar to dental feeforservice utilization as stated earlier access to specialists in the dental managed care pl ans is significantly higher than fee for service this is driven by the fact that the plans are contractually obligated to ensure access to specialist ca re to their medical members as needed federally qualified health centers fqhc although dental services provided at fqhcs are not dentical services they are dental services provided by medical for some beneficiaries who reside in remote or rural counties fqhcs are the only opti on for obtaining medical covered dental services in fy 0506 approximately 156 000 beneficiaries received dental services at fqhcs resulting in payments for dental serv ices totaling 67451949 this is an increase of 65000 beneficiaries and 68 in crease in dental pay ments from fy 0102 28section 8 other states what other states cover adult dental what practices are other states using to increase access to dental care and what can california lean from other states number of states still cover adult dental services to varying degrees however this assessment of the dent ical program only looked at comparisons to the states of new york new jersey north dakota pennsylvani and wisconsin as these states offered schedule of comprehensive adult services that would be most comparable to californias don schneider dds mph former chief dental officer at cms has developed summaries describing medicaid innovations in six other states1 these reports explain what each state did to improve access and how much improvement they obtained through reform ie the reports cite increases in provider participation and beneficiary utilization as referenced in section 1 rates each of these states melded rate increases whether all inclusive or for lective procedures with variety of other program enhancements including various admin istrative enhancements for providers aggressive outreach to the dental community partnerships with university dental schools selective training for providers etc dr schneiders findings indicate that in combination with other program enhancements increasing rates results in significant increases in provider partici pation and beneficiary utilization 1 these six states are delaware indiana chigan south carolina tennessee and
