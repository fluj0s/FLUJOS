broker choicepoint revealed it had sold data on at least 145000 americans to criminals posing as officials in legitimate businesses5 contrary to initial press reports choicepoints computers were not hacked instead the criminals opened about 50 accounts with the company nd accessed the data as customers the disclosure came as choicepoint complied with california law that requires companies with corporate computer networks that do business with state residents to notify individuals if their unencrypted personal information is acquired by an unauthorized person according to testimony to th house energy and commerce subcommittee by choicepoints chairman and ceo derek smith choicepoint employee became suspicious in september 2004 during the cred entialing process for prospective small

that criminals compromised the ids and passwords of leg itimate customers and used them to access certain databases at seisint company that recently had been acquired by lexisnexis at this time it appears that the internet played role in the bank of america case choicepoint used the internet as communi cations medium to pr ovide data to the criminals but it apparently otherwise was not factor the extent to which the internet may have been involved in the xisnexis incident is unclear phishing as noted earlier the internet can play role in identity theft today attention is focused on relatively new scam called phishing phishing refers to practice where someone misrepresents their identity or aut hority in order to induce another person to provide pii over the internet some common phishing scams involve emails that purport to be from financial institution internet service provider or other trusted company claiming that persons record has been lost the email directs the person to website that mimics the legitimate business website and asks the person to enter credit card number and other pii so the record can be re stored in fact the email or website is controlled by third party who is attempting to extract information that will be used in identity theft or other crimes the ftc issued consumer alert on phishing in june 20048 an antiphishing working group indus try association has been established to work collectively on solutions to phishing the group encourages consumers to report phishing incidents via its website http wwwantiphishingorg and provides phishing statistics in january 2005 it reported there were 2560 activ phishing websites and the average monthly growth rate betw een july 2004 and january 2005 was 28 httpantiphishingorgapwg_phi

these laws as they pe rtain to identity theft at march 10 2005 senate banking committee hearing httpbanking senategov_filesmajoraspdf she identified two other laws that are not enforced by the ftc but which also restrict the disclosure of certain types of information the drivers privacy protection act and the health insurance portability and accountability act congress also has passed laws

earlier the act further regulates consumer reporting agencies cras enhances penalties for identity theft and provides assistance for victims9 among other things the fact act requires cras to follow certain procedures concerning when to place and what to do in response to fraud alerts on consumers credit files requires credit car d issuers to follow certain procedures if additional cards are requested w ithin 30 days of change of address notifica tion requires the truncation of credit card numbers on electronically printed receipts and extends the statute of limitations for when identity theft cases can be brought as noted some states such as california have their own identity theft laws see crs report rl31919 and others are considering such legislation continuing congressional issues at march 10 2005 senate banking committee hearing ftc chairwoman majoras emphasized that complicated maze of laws governs cons umer data based on the type of company or institution involved th type of data collected or sold and the purpose for which it will be used she conceded that it is not clear if data brokers like choicepoint come under the ftc s jurisdiction and concluded that additional legislation may be necessary particularly regarding notice and security witness from the secret service also testified about his agency s jurisdiction over identity theft crimes10 many bills have been introduced in the 109th congress see crs report rl31408 legislative approaches include strengthening penalties for identity theft or for the misuse of ssns11 increasing regulation of information br okers such as by requiring them to notify individuals whose pii has been breache d or to obtain consumers consent before selling pii limiting the use of ssns or allowing individuals to choose an identifier other than their ssn for medicare purposes for exam ple or making phishing crime the only legislative action to date in the 109th congress is markup of bill hr 29 that contains an antiphishing provision the bill was ordered repor ted from the house energy and commerce committee on march 9 2005 as discussed already the senate banking committee held hearings on identity theft on march 10 and march 15 2005 house energy and commerce subco mmittee held hearing on march 15 2005 additional hearings are expected
