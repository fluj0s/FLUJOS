from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to iharrisueaacuk subject cruts tmp to 2008 date fri 10 jul 2009 001958 0100 bst replyto tosbornueaacuk cc tim osborn tosbornueaacuk hi harry finally had time to take look at the latest cruts3 run through to 2008 for tmp picked up from crucruts two pdfs showing seasonal national means are attached look at 2008a_vs_2008bpdf first black is your previous update to 2008 pink is the latest one many very similar some small differences presumably due to outlier 34 sd removal note that as these are nationalseasonal means outliers might be quite large yet only show up small in the means if many other stations contribute page 4 the hot spike in guatemala has been removed in the new version that looks much better page 6 page 9 the hot spikes in france italy and austria in jja in 2003 have been reduce slightly too not sure if this is right or not could ask phil what he thinks could jul aug 2003 have been so hot that some observations validly did exceed the 3sd outlier check or do you use 4sd check for tmp anyway this is one to ask phil about there are various other erroneous hot spikes that have now been correctly removed i wont list them all here however there are some cold spikes in both previous and latest 2008 updates see eg mali on page 12 have you turned on only outlier checking for 3sd and not for 3sd some wronglooking cold spikes are still present now look at 2005_vs_2008bpdf black is last years cruts3 through to 2005 i know the files went to mid 2006 but i stopped at last complete year note this isnt cruts21 pink is again the newest version of the update to 2008 there are some early 20th century differences that im not too bothered about though it would be nice to know why they arise one concern is that the mean level is different between the versions see eg jja for various countries on pages 7 and 8 seems to be constant offset its too big to be simple rounding error in my calculations i may have changed from 1 dec place to 2 dec place but some differences are about 05 deg c and these are absolute values so theres dependency on any anomalisationreference period meaning as im not doing any intriguing perhaps some normals have change in some regionsseasons so 1 hot spikes have been corrected 2 cold spikes still there 3 some odd differences in mean level progress tim dr tim osborn rcuk academic fellow climatic research unit school of environmental sciences university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk wwwcruueaacuktimo attachment converted ceudoraattachidl_cruts3_2008a_vs_2008bpdf attachment converted ceudoraattachidl_cruts3_2005_vs_2008bpdf
