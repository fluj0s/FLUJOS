from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to mhughesltrrarizonaedu subject re cool bristlecone etc date fri aug 25 151920 2000 hi again malcolm i am forwarding the data in another message from tim i am sending the whole lot for simplicity please dont pass on until we hear whether the paper is accepted or not remember that although they are strongly correlated with them these data are not identical in the high frequency domain to the equivalent data standardised using say hugershoff function the main purpose here was to extract longtimescale variations and i still consider the inter annual to decadal variability to be better defined using the traditional approach for first look anyway these are fine best wishes keith at 0414 am 82400 0700 you wrote dear keith it was good to talk with you this morning this is reminder about sending your western north america banded record as you suggested i suspect that you are right to think that it would eventually be best to use customized banded set but as start i think it would be good to compare the wnw record with the mean series graybill and idso used in their 1993 paper and with the single site campito mountain record ill start with simple graphical comparison and then move to comparing waveforms extracted by for example ssa my hope is that we can fairly rapidly generate note to something like grl or jocs new short format putting believable version of these records out there for general use please reply to the mhughesltrrarizonaedu address im sending it from my other address as well as beltandbraces approach because of recent email problems looking forward to working on this with you cheers malcolm malcolm hughes professor of dendrochronology laboratory of treering research university of arizona tucson az 85721 5206216470 fax 5206218229
