6206c12 shspec161 middle rudiments when you ask second question or double question pc you are omitting tr2 and q and aing gorgeously tr2 is an auditor weak point an adequate acknowledgement is worth great deal do you have ptp i had fight with my wife what about this is q and in trying not to q and one can err by not getting the auditing question answered it is not q and is comm lag that exists until the pc answers the auditing question this requires that the auditor hear what the pc said so tr2 should include understanding and acknowledging auditors create more arc breaks by failing to understand but pretending to the auditor now has missed withhold just put the onus on the auditor for failing to understand and get the pc to repeat it on tr10 point out something the auditor should know what the pc is pointing at and may need to ask it is fins for him to do so all rudiments must contain an answer to the question asked if they do the auditor must just understand and acknowledge that is all that happens only when it is manifestly impossible to clean it up with repetitive single questions does the auditor resort to ruds process the rudiments are now good enough so that if the pc gets the auditors question and answers it and the meter is cleaned on that exact question and the auditors trs are any good then you dont need any rudiments process in using repetitive rudiment you ask the question acknowledge the pcs answer and check the meter if not clean repeat the question until after cycle of pc answer acknowledgement and meter check the meter is clean this actually acts as process in itself dont wait around for the pc to find eg ptp if the meter is clean when you ask for it if it is null just acknowledge and go on you are actually thereby giving the pc his answer or you are giving him the answer the meter gave the last question is thus answered by the auditor for the pc this completes the communication cycle just repeating phrase to the pc will deintensify it in the bank if it is equivocal because of dirty needle or poor metering check it again let the pc know what you are doing and why do this enough so that the pc isnt left wondering in the dark always keen the pcs r in tell him what is going on pc who is screaming is less arc broken than one who wont talk to you you should put in middle ruds when the pc is having trouble listing more goals give the package question slowly enough so that you can stop and clean whatever reads then go back to listing goals you should attack mid ruds so as to spend minimal time on them so every time listing slows down zip through them every fifth session or so they have enough outofsession nonsense going to benefit from some prepchecking suppose the pc gets resistive in session where you did get beginning ruds in go ahead on middle ruds and prepcheck using middle ruds for zero questions this will pick up things like inval of goals as subject or listing as subject that is the commonest thing that causes the pc to stop listing on pc who is on the verge of telling you what to do all the time critical pc who is continually suppressing suggestions about your auditing you can use she buttons suggest and fail to suggest these fit in well with prepcheck in middle ruds you are only interested in the immediate session to keep the needle clean and readable and to keep the pc in session when doing your fourline list on the goal do midruds between lines in prepchecking you put in middle ruds after each what question is null then recheck the what question this is fancier way to ask for missed withholds so dont also ask for them if she pc is down on havingness consistently you could do middle ruds then havingness then recheck the what question use midruds when the pc has slowed down shut up run into problems etc middle rudiments make an excellent communication bridge you can put anything in with the middle ruds following it if you are prepchecking against prepared sec check list and you get five or six questions cleaning up with only the zero question do the middle ruds in case he is suppressing something if the middle ruds were found to be out you go back and do what you were doing over again except in listing the use of middle rudiments can be extended to specific subject object or activity if you are checking out goal for instance you can put in midruds on that goal keep it fairly specific or you will be getting into prepcheck you could probably put in every other rudiment with the midruds for instance say the pc gives the same ptp twice and it still reads on beginning ruds you could put in midruds on that problem naming it in the commands lrh doesnt advise this but it could be done sometimes you add halftruths etc from end ruds but if you really have to do this it is smarter to end off and restart the session if the pc needs this short sessioning is better anyway you can also do end ruds on prepchecks where they are useful to pick up overts and withholds if you cant get midruds in you can try prepchecking them pc who has somewhat dirty needle and has to have midruds done often will benefit from midruds prepcheck if that doesnt do the job the pc should probably have more cchs and general prepchecks lrh has become expert in fish and fumble ig the pcs needle was dirtying up and not getting cleaner after ruds he would start the session with fish and fumble to clean up the needle before doing anything else he would say after beginning ruds i want you to carefully consider your auditing nothing happens now carefully consider your wife lots of reads now clean it up tracing down only one pattern at time the double tick should be handled first because it is missed withhold it takes bright auditor to clean it well it is necessary to ask something that will keep the read or just to pursue the read one started with or to formulate what question you can really clean it up so the needle doesnt get dirty again the way bad auditing could dirty it up again is for the auditors tr2 to be so bad that everything the pc says is automatically an inadvertent missed withhold fish and fumble procedure is also given as tr in hcob 14jun62 class iic trs one of the virtues of fish and fumble is that it is fast way of cleaning up the needle though it could be overused it is usually necessary only two or three times the vital read to clean up first is the double tick the missed withhold it is pretty easy using fish and fumble just to clean it up fish and fumble make it possible to do goals assessment which otherwise would be virtually impossible it does require the auditor to be inventive in figuring nut what overt might be connected to the read that the pc is telling you about you need to get the pattern of the mind which is that if there is something the pc is reading on he has either done something to or with it if you are doing prepchecking fish and fumble gives you wideopen chance to clean up the needle fish and fumble cleans up the needle so that you can prepcheck and is barbaric cousin to the prepcheck
