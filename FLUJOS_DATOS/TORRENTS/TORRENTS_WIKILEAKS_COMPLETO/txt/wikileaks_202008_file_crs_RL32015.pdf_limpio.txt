policy committees and explains their structure operation and functions created in 1947 the senate republican and democratic policy committees are party leadership structures each is an analytical arm of its respective party leadership their fundamental missions are to achieve policy integration and to promote party unity through the dissemination of information about policy and other senate matters the two policy committees are different in structure and operation contrast that appears to be rooted in different leadership styles within th two party organizations republican leadership has traditionally been shared among senators other than the party floor leader customarily the democratic leadership positions of party floor leader chair of the democratic policy committee dpc and chair of the democratic conference have been posts held by the same person additionally where both policy committees once functioned largely as service agencies peripheral to party leadership today the two party entities have assumed roles more important to the overall leadership structure in the senate the style and activities of the republican policy committee rpc and dpc have over the years been shaped largely by the party leaders particularly when the party is in the opposition this report will be updated if there is change in the leadership of either partys policy committee

democratic policy committees when it inserted provision within supplemental appropriations bill which congress passed in 1947 this act provided for the maintenance of staff for majority and minority policy committees in that chamber as such the policy committees have statutory basis with staff financed by the legislative branch different from other party organizations such as the campaign committees the proposal for creating the policy committees came about during the reform hearings conducted by the lafolletemonroney joint committee on the organiza tion of congress 1946 in its final report 1946 the joint committee recommended that the house and senate establish policy committees for each party consisting of seven members separate from either of the partys respective conferences and with staffs paid through legislative branch funds 1 these entities were modeled after the 19th century party steering committees which leaders employed to achieve an orderly method of scheduling floor actions2 the policy committees initially operated unobtrusively in the senate early meetings were rarely publicized within the chamber often conducted in secret with only policy committee members and the staff directors present the republican policy committee rpc did provide all republican senators with resume of meeting discussions and the committee chair would customarily hold press conferences after meetin gs by contrast communication on what was discussed in the democratic policy committee dpc was done informally through word of mouth between individual democratic senators 3 both policy committees of the senate relied on such early meetings to discuss and generate ideas about policy matters formal votes were infrequently taken and minutes were short and private4

contrast appears to be rooted in the hierarchy of leadership within the two party organizations which continues to influence the composition of the policy committees republican leadership has traditionally been shared among senators other than the party leader 5 different from their democratic counterpart for example the chair of the rpc campaigns for the position and is elected by the republican conference additionally since july 1995 the republican conference limits committee chairs including the policy committee chair to three twoyear terms 1 us congress joint committee on the

existence to the republican policy committee with very few changes in 1947 senator robert taft roh chair of the steering committee became chair of the new policy committee position he retained before becoming majority floor leader in 1953 senator tafts decision not to hold both positions simultaneously prompted the republican conference to elect new policy chair senator william knowland rca who succeeding taft as floor leader followed precedent and relinquished his chairmanship of the policy committee 6 table 1 lists the chairs of the rpc the rpc has undergone considerable change both in size and complexion since its inception changing functions at various times have led to expansion as well as contraction of membership7 there were nine republican senators on the policy committee when it first met in the 80th congress 19471948 with membership consisting of appointments by virtue of office or official position within the party these included the chair and secretary of the republican conference the republican floor leader whip policy committee chair and four additional senators nominated by the chair of the republican conference and ratified by the conference this membership structure remained consistent for the next six years at the start of 83rd congress 19531954 the membership of the committee was expanded to include twothirds of the standing committee chairmen in the following congress 84th 19551956 the policy committee was expanded even more to obtain better sectional representation on the party panel balance between large and small states and all republicans facing reelection who were made members to give them added prestige8 by 1957 the policy committee was reduced to 14 members eight ex officio and six elected by the republican conference9 today the rpc is composed of the republican senate floor leader whip president pro tempore of the senate if republican chair of the policy committee who is elected in the republican conference and chairs of the senates standing committees if in the majority in addition the rpc has its own staff structure separate from the republican conference which includes staff director secretary and professional staff

democratic policy committee and chair of the democratic conference have been posts held by the same person until senator george mitchell dme became majority leader 19891995 democrats permitted their party floor leader to also chair the democratic conference and the policy committee mitchell however appointed senator tom daschle dsd to serve as cochair of the policy panel when daschle became floor leader in 1995 he chose to maintain the cochair arrangement in what appears to be voluntary diffusion of leadership in 1999 the cochair was abandoned and single chair of the policy committee was

resolution authorizing the chair of the conference to appoint the membership of the partys policy committee and the conference chair to appoint the chair of the policy committee10 the conference also declared that the committee would consist of seven members with the whip and the secretary of the conference attending meetings in an advisory capacity11 the first committee chair senator alben w barkley dky selected six relatively junior members on the basis of geography purposefully omitting other leadership positions such as the president pro tempore and committee chairs these junior senators were also chosen because they would be easier for him to work with 12 senator barkleys method of selection set precedent at the beginning of each succeeding congress the democratic leader named members to the policy committee in addition to himself as chairman membership of the policy committee remained virtually the same with the democratic leader filling vacancies occasioned by the death retirement or defeat of committee members 13 members therefore generally served on the committee throughout their service in the senate in 1959 at senator lyndon b johnsons dtx suggestion the dpc started the practice of having the members of the legislative review or calendar committee meet with the policy committee and take part in its deliberations the legislative review committee was an arm of the dpc composed of three freshmen democratic senators who handled calls of the senate calendar for the democratic majority 14 johnson sought to retain the chair of the dpc upon his election to the vice presidency in 1960 an attempt thwarted when democratic senators unanimously decided to give the conference itself the right to confirm or challenge nominations by the new democratic leader mike mansfield dmt to the policy committee15 currently the dpc consists of the chair three regional chairs and 16 additional members it appears that the party leader continues to have the discretion of appointing such members because the floor leadership and policy committee chairmanship were held by the same person for so long the staff of the democratic leader served also as the staff for the dpc as result little staff work was assigned to individual democratic senators but rather was done for the chair preparing legislative status reports compiling quorum records and noting the presence and absence from roll calls and votes 16 under senator robert c byrd dwv the dpc staff who reported directly to him negotiated for the democratic leader with committee chairs and other senators on substantive and procedural matters staff produced some publications but oriented 10 us congress senate minutes of the us senate democratic conference 19031964 edited by donald ritchie washington gpo

than provision of service to all democratic members17 today the dpc staff remains in effect the staff of the democratic conference but they are generally more specialized compared to the past with most policy analysts holding advanced degrees in policy law and business and are chosen largely on the basis of their expertise several staffers specifically track legislation by broad jurisdictional areassuch as trade governmental affairs welfare and education economy and small business and foreign relationsand disseminate information about matters to all democratic member offices 18 g8g158g151g140g157g146g152g151g156g561 the style and activities of the rpc and dpc have over the years been shaped largely by the preferences and expectations of party leaders19 in his 1957 study of the senate citadel washington journalist william s white illustrated how differently the two party policy committees functioned the republican senate policy committee will meet once week but it will do so only upon carefully printed notices circulated to the committees members officially to inform them that there is to be meeting the democratic policy committee will meetperhapsonce week and when it does the thing seems simply to happen and members will stroll in usually late with the air of man dropping into anothers office to have drink and having nothing better to do at the moment to pass the time of day 20 in their formative years the two policy committees functioned as service agencies that prepared material on issues and legislation for party members both party policy committees were peripheral to party leadership how active they were depended on the needs of party leadership as well as on whether their party was in the minority or in the majority 21 the two policy committees generally have become more active in developing and promoting party unity along with assisting the floor leaders and committee chairmen or ranking minority member in designing developing and executing policy ideas within the senate these roles have become more important to the overall leadership structure in the senate22 17 donald c baumer senate democratic leadership in the 101st congress in allen

independence and more opportunity to set the senate republican legislative agenda develop party policy in opposition to the majority provide summaries of republican positions on specific issues research procedural and substantive issues and strategies and draft policy alternatives in the majority or when republican is president the rpc tends to function as party think tank as well as in liaison capacity to bridge differences with the administration in this capacity the rpc maintains research service that provides analytic reports for republican senators the principal function of the rpc in recent years has been to provide an educational forum for republican senators it also participates in the orientation programs for new republican senators and their aides weekly luncheon meetings are held usually every tuesday when the senate is in session here all republican senators are invited to review the senates schedule to discuss policy options and survey partisan strategies committee staff directors and legislative directors for individual senators meet once week in the policy committee office with rpc staff to review pending legislative issues and discuss strategy policy committee staff perform multitude of functions they analyze the legislative record of senators review legislative histories draft bills and produce host of publications important examplesthat are distributedinclude policy papers provide indepth analysis of current policy issues and layout legislative options record vote analysis indicates how members of each party voted on different legislative issues provides description of each vote and highlights of the debate and summarizes pertinent bills in their final amended form rpc monday floorcast is onepage summary of anticipated floor business during the coming week intended to give members sense of the flow of senate action in order to plan their schedules legislative notice summarizes the major provisions of legislation under consideration and provides information about possible amendments that might be offered often contains pros and cons relating to pending measures and is meant to educate members and staffers about policy issues the rpc is especially prominent in the use of new technology to communicate the partys message and agenda its inhouse closedcircuit television station rpctv broadcasts to all senate offices scheduling information and other messages from the leadership whenever the senate is in session the rpc also provides telephone hotline available to republican senators calling on and off the hill it also maintains public website httpwwwsenategovrpc which provides current floor schedule nd summary of pending legislation

it lacked the formality and institutionalization that characterized the republican policy committee23 like its republican counterpart the functions of the dpc have changed over time depending on whether the party is in the majority and who is chairing the committee the first democratic chairman senator barkley very rarely convened the committee 24 his successors such as senators scott lucas dil ernest mcfarl and daz and lyndon johnson dtx used the policy committee somewhat more frequently but not nearly as consistently as their republican counterparts johnson was the first democratic leader to use the dpc for getting democratic senators to support the party position and to develop alternatives intended to embarrass the opposition 25 conversely senator byrd chose not to convene the policy committee26 following 12year hiatus cochairs george mitchell and tom daschle established central role for the dpc in promoting the democratic message inside the senate and in public27 today the dpc works with all senate democrats it plays an important role in facilitating consensus within the democratic party distributing information to democratic senate offices and building public support for the partys legislative agenda dpc briefings lunches and strategy meetings for all democratic senators and some staff and have been used for an assortment of activities these include but are not necessarily limited to providing guidance on drafting speeches press releases newsletters to constituents and radio and television advertisements relevant to specific legislation preparing reports for all senate democrats on the party record and performance and sponsoring annual policy conferences intended to educate members on specific policy issues these forums are used by senate democrats to reach common understanding regarding the partys legislative initiatives 28 when the senate is in session the dpc distributes variety of materials and publications for senate democrats29 most are for internal distribution although some are available to both the public and all senate offices electronically at the committees website httpdemocratssenategov among the more commonly used examples are as follows legislative bulletin s summarize major provisions of legislation under consideration supply pertinent information about amendments that might be offered and frequently present pro and
