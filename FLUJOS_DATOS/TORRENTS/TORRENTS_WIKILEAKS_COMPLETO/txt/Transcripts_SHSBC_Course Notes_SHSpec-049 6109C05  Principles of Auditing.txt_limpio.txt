6109c05 shspec49 principles of auditing there is substitute for understanding and there is understanding without experience in an auditing situation where there is understanding or familiarity there is likely to be established only the reality of war and if the auditor does not have understanding of and familiarity with the pc and his bank he will be at war whether he likes it or not the anatomy of hatred is based on the anatomy of noncomprehension noncomprehension is based on lack of familiarity and observation if you want to not comprehend something by all means dont look at it another condition applies tremendous amount of pretended knowingness and pretended understanding can arise after one has not observed psychiatry and psychology got nowhere because they mostly observed dead tissue when they observed anything the reason lrh made progress in the field of the study of the mind was his novel introduction of the study of living beings youd have to be able to confront motion to do that and you would have to be man of action an auditor has two sources of familiarity in processing 1 subjective reality 2 observation of the pc and meter behavior while he audits he can also live and observe life though this universe is rigged so that if you do too much living in this particular society you wind up with too many withholds and after that your auditor has lot of trouble trying to get you in session there possibly is some phase of life that is not punished but if so lrh hasnt discovered what it is yet certain rules govern auditing but they can go only so far in guiding you along the road to making clears the great oddity is that it can be done at all number of rules can give you familiarity with what is going on in the pc at any given moment you should experience it yourself to gain knowingness on it at that point you will see the reasons value and importance of the rules about 30 of all cases in scientology have never seen mind thats the only source of bad auditing why are auditors difficult to train theyre only difficult to train in those areas where they dont have familiarity so whats needed is process which gives familiarity with the bank and all its aspects and at the same time youd pick up all the hangfired clear cases they are hanging fire because they are not going along the line they should in auditing theyre walking the far edge of the crater so as not to fall in an auditor who doesnt have familiarity with the mind will applaud this tightrope walk and makes sure the pc never falls in because the thing to do is to keep out of trouble all of mans wars sicknesses economic disasters political chaos etc come entirely from one thing keeping out of trouble you are not supposed to keep the pc out of trouble if the trouble is in his bank pc never protests at getting into trouble if it gives him potential familiarity with the bank he protests measures that prevent him from becoming familiar with his bank he protests auditing to audit without curiosity about where the pc is and what he is doing is surefire way to keep him from getting into any trouble if you never find out whats going on you never have to confront his bank and he doesnt have to confront his bank the time can go up to light years and nobody gets any auditing done as general rule any mechanism you introduce into session which permits pc to avoid confronting his bank or takes the pc out of session is going to produce arc breaks heavy problems etc all pc ever objects to is not being audited it has to be the pc getting none not thinking he isnt say the pc has continual ptp with his wife who denies him auditing this creates the arc break how she denies him auditing can vary but the prevention of auditing makes the upset the reason she does it is interesting it is because she cant have auditing so the grades of cases are 1 those that cant have any auditing 2 those that consider their auditing is being prevented 3 those that can have auditing on the first two classes you wont get any clearing so you must remedy havingness of auditing some of the prevention of auditing can result from noncomprehension of what it is missing data of one kind or another those who cant have auditing come under the same heading of scarcity of auditing either it doesnt exist because they have understanding and therefore it isnt anything or if it did occur there would be too many social repercussions because they have too many withholds the pc who is arc breaky or who has ptps is being denied auditing in some way this sounds very monocentric since auditing is new subject but adequate treatment has not hitherto existed on this planet everyones reaction to getting sick or injured is oh ill have to get treatment god forbid the only place where regard for treatment has been lower is in the markab confederacy where medicine was taught with dried tissue samples as the only mass there it got so bad that you werent ever permitted to get new body this was typical of many spaceopera societies this society is moving in the direction of replacing parts with mechanical substitutes because treatment is so ineffective it has to be delivered by callous people who make nothing out of their patients otherwise the treatment would be an overt they are lessening the overt and preclears have been educated into the attitude that there is effective treatment nevertheless large percentage still hopes treatment can take place amazingly the hope must be rather thin by now so if the auditor makes move in the direction of treatment the pc arc breaks so at first you are doing cheerleaders job then when you have him in session let him have treatment how could you prevent him from getting treatment first dont let him put his attention on his case he never protests crude fumbling with his case as long as you do guide him into it all protests and difficulties of the pc stem from treatment auditing you get the violence of an arc break if you prevent the pc from getting auditing because auditing is painful and the basis of the pain is that there is auditing so irreparable damage might occur the pc believes now that auditing can cure any damage but if there is to be auditing then the damage isnt curable so he is in state of anxiety as soon as you violate insessionness another phenomenon is involved in this he is looking at an engram the only space in the engram is brought about by his attention on the engram and until the engram is desensitized he will have to keep some space in it to keep the engram off the end of his nose so if you distract him suddenly from an engram the space may disappear from out of the engram and he finds that engram on the end of his nose you let the engram bite him by taking his attention off the engram he can get somatics then he compounds it with an overt against the auditor there are many ways one can let the pcs attention be yanked out of session one is choosing an auditing room which has action of activity in its vicinity because you then set up auditing as the stable datum around which action is occurring you can get away with lot of this but dont try to audit in the middle of busy street you can run out past auditing in busy areas by asking what has been unknown about the activity of an auditing area this is to handle the 50 cubic yards he was aware of whose motion pinned him down into the half cubic yard of the session so ensure that the session wont be interrupted an auditor who chatters at pc about other things than the session is setting the pc up to pull his attention off his case in the session itself an ineffective process is auditing almost anything we have now run smoothly would keep him in session tech is not source of auditing bustups since it is auditing but the administration of it is the important one the prediction factor involves surprise what is surprise people with low tolerance of unknowns can be surprised more easily than youd think and the degree that person can be surprised is in proportion to his tolerance of unknownnesses the less he tolerates the unknown the more be can be surprised surprise is not having known past tense unknownness what isnt known doesnt run surprises what wasnt known runs surprises the fact had existence before he found out about it and he is shocked that he didnt know about it when it was going on the anatomy of surprise is unpredicted change it registers in the mind only if there was knownness present which the pc didnt know and then finds out later he tries to go backtrack into all that unknownness and gets the impression of floundering around during that time in notknownness which is an invalidation of his knowingness and his permeation that is the only thing thetan ever objects to an invalidation of knowingness he objects on the basis of surprise so he gets future which looks like this all sorts of things going on in his vicinity which he doesnt know about that he will maybe find out about and they will be terrible shock to him so he starts living in state of anxiety because hes had it demonstrated that facts not known to him which are quite destructive can exist in his environment without his awareness hes sucked back into the whirlpool of unknown yesterdays the truth is he knew his environment in those yesterdays but he looks back on it as not knowing his environment so things of horrible portent could be going on at this very moment so thats what anxiety and nervousness is he gets very alert so as not to be surprised this destroys iq iq goes down in direct proportion to the amount of unknownness he conceives the environment to hold this will apply to subject too someone who gets more unknownness in the environment than he can tolerate may manifest the insanity of putting known delusory terminal there thats pretended knowingness on the environment this applies directly to sessions most of what pc is going through is accumulation of unknownnesses that he suddenly found out and nearly everything hes got in the bank is prevention against being caught unawares again so when pc finds out something from the auditor which existed before he discovered it heres what could happen hes interiorized into his bank and the auditor fiddles with the cans and says the meter is out so well have to stop the session the pc is given the data that the meter was out when he didnt know it so there wasnt session when he thought there was one he doesnt know how long this was the case and the mystery pins him in the session or the auditor stops the when the pc thought he was doing all right that gives him an unknown surprise is based on change were interested in the unknown factor which is what sticks pcs in it you can change process fifteen times an hour on pc without damaging him but you can suddenly change process on some consideration he doesnt know about and arc break him across the boards the pc will accuse the auditor in an effort to solve the unknownness which existed before the change you could advise the pc well in advance of what you intented to do so long as you dont yank his attention off what hes looking at if you start running process without clearing it first or letting him know youre going to do it youll probably get away with it unless the process doesnt work well in which case hell think you are impetuous pc is only one kind of victim victim of auditing matter how many motivators show up on his case thats the only one that can cause auditing difficulties he feels an unknown exists he doesnt know about in the session thats why youve got to keep the rfactor up and the knowingness factor in pcs sense the unknowns when one is about to occur turn it into known warn him dont try to gain auditing time by omitting these things you can audit pc without his agreement but you cant audit him without his knowingness arc breaks clear up most rapidly on notknow processing run it always in the past tense not the present because thats where there was an element of surprise the unknown which preceded the found outs model session also provides known structure you can jump it as long as you tell him the unknownness of the pcs bank really impinges on him if you the auditor have reality on its components knownness on its components hell sense you dont know your business your ability to control the session depends directly on your knowingness of the parts of the mind this is of course why lrh audits so effectively the pc feels you see all know all when you seeing where he isnt looking direct his attention to it get familiar with the mind and make the session familiar to the pc and youll be bearcat of an auditor to handle arc breaks you can ask what didnt i know about what you were doing
