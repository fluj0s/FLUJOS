they allow medical provide rs to refuse to provide services to which they have religious or mora l objections supporters of such laws argue that pharmacists should not be forced to engage in activity

at httpwwwnabpnetuntil recently most conscience clause ws were designed to allow medical practitioners to opt out of providing abortionrelated services2 over the past several years however several newspapers have begun to report incide nts in which pharmacists have refused on moral or religious grounds to fill prescriptions for cont raceptives for example in january 2004 in one of the earliest incide nts to be widely publicized pharmacist at an eckerd pharmacy in texas was disciplined by his employer after he violated company policy by refusing to dispense emer gency contraceptives to rape victim3 in some cases pharmacists also have refused to refer or transfer the pr escription to another pharmacist or pharmacy thus preventing some custom ers from obtaining their medications from another person or store4 in response to these reports multip states have enacted or are considering conscience clause laws that would specifically regulate whether or not pharmacists are legally permitted to refuse to distribute contraceptives due to moral or religious objections as indicated above pharmacy conscience cl ause laws were in itially designed to address situations in which pharmacists refused to fill valid prescriptions for birth control or emergency contraception although the em ergency contraceptive plan b still requires prescription for women younger than age 18 the food and drug administration fda recently approved plan b for overthecounter st atus for women aged 18 or older because the fda approval requires that plan b be sold behind the pharmacy counter however some pharmacists may still refuse to sell the drug even if prescription is required while pharmacy conscience clause laws that address access to contraceptives may pertain to overthecounter sales of plan b other laws that govern the filling of prescriptions may not cover situations involving such overthecounter sales currently there are federal laws that address whether or not pharmacist may refuse to fill prescription or sell contraceptives the lack of federal legislation is not unusual given that the practice of pharmacy is generally an issue of state law thus pharmacies and pharmacists are primarily regulated by state boards of pharmacy5 and all of the existing pharmacy conscience clause ws have been enacted at the state level nevertheless several members of congress have introduced bills related to pharmacists who refuse to fill prescriptions for certain drugs one bill hr 1539 would require pharmacies to ensure that if pharmacist refused to fill prescription on the basis of religious beliefs or moral convictions then the prescripti on would be filled by another pharmacist employed by the pharmacy within four hours of such refusal likewise companion bills hr 1652 and s 809 would require pharmacies to ensure that prescriptions are filled without delay by another of thei r pharmacists if one pharmacist refuses and would also prohibit pharmacies from employing any pharmacist who acts with intent to prevent or deter customer from filling valid prescription in addition s 778httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22293crs3 6 68 ill adm code 133091j 7 id 8 gretchen

at nrs 6392353would require pharmacies that receive medicare or medicaid payments to ensure that valid prescriptions are filled without unnecessary delay or interference as noted above several states have enact ed laws regarding pharmacists who refuse to dispense birth control and emergency cont raception these laws vary widely from state to state for example some of these state laws specifically require pharmacists to fill valid prescriptions while other states explicitly allow pharmacists to refuse to fill prescriptions if they have moral or religious objections still other states have statutes and regulations that are silent with respect to pharmacists right of refu sal but that nonetheless contain provisions that offer protections to cons umers whose prescriptions are rejected at least two states illinois and califor nia have laws that require pharmacists to dispense prescriptions under illinois law pharmacies must fill valid prescriptions for contraceptives without delay6 if the contraceptive or suitable alternative is not in stock then the pharmacy is required to either orde r the drug or if the customer prefers to transfer the prescription to another pharmacy or return the prescription to the customer7 the illinois law which was enacted under an emergency rule issued by the governor is being challenged in several lawsuits8 in california pharmacists are prohibited from preventing patients from obtaining legally pr escribed drugs however pharmacists are permitted to refuse to dispen prescription drugs on moral or religious grounds if they notify their employer and if the pharmacy rranges for customers to have timely access to their medication despite the employees refusal9 in contrast to laws that specifically blish duty to fill contraceptive prescriptions many states have general laws that allow pharmacists to refu to fill prescriptions under certain circumstances such as when there are doubts about the validity of the prescription or when the pharmacist believes the prescription poses safety risk10 because such provisions do not cite moral or religious objections as leg itimate grounds for refusing to dispense drugs they could potentially be interpreted as implicitly requiring pharmacists to fill valid prescriptions despite their personal beliefs other states have laws that although th ey do not specifically address the question of whether or not pharmacist can refuse to fill prescriptions appear to offer some protection to consumers whose prescriptions have been rejected for example under recently enacted nevada law pharmacists are required to transfer prescription to another pharmacist at the request of the customer11 thus nevada customers whose pharmacists refuse to fill prescription for contraceptives can have their prescriptions transferred tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22293crs4 12 for example texas law provides that pharm acist may not refuse to transfer original prescription information to another pharmacist and oklahoma law specifies that legally competent practitioner of the healing arts shall re fuse to honor the requests of his patient to have his prescription transferred to the registered pha rmacist or

that deem it to be unprofessional conduct for pharmacist to refuse to dispense pr escriptions that may ordinarily and reasonably be expected to be dispensed in pharmacy by pharmacist to be unprofessional conduct cmr 02392030 minn r 68002250 nd admin code 61040401 16 north carolina board of pharmacy frequently asked questions for pharmacists on conscience clause available at httpwwwncboporg conscience20clauseasp it is important to note however that although such policy interpretation would be likely to be taken into consideration by court this type of agency guidance does not carry the full force of lawanother pharmacy or pharmacist other states have similar mandatory prescription transfer provisions that may offer protection to cust omers whose contraceptive prescriptions have been rejected12 it is important to note that even in the absence of specific laws general pharmacy laws may be interpreted to require pharmacists to fill prescriptions for example many states have laws that govern the profe ssional conduct of pharmaci sts or that generally require the dispensation of drugs pursuant to valid prescription indeed the wisconsin pharmacy examining board recently pursued disciplinary action against pharmacist who refused to fill customers birth control pr escription or to transfer the prescription to another pharmacist finding that the pharmacist had violated rules against unprofessional conduct by engaging in any pharmacy practi ce which constitutes danger to the health welfare or safety of patient or public including but not limited to practicing in manner which substantially departs from the standard of care ordinarily exercised by pharmacist which harmed or could have harmed patient13 the board issued an order reprimanding the pharmacist limiting his license ordering him to attend pharmacy ethics class and requiring him to pay the costs of the legal proceedings14 like wisconsin other states have similar rules of professional conduct that could potentially be applied to pharmacists who refuse to fill or transfer prescriptions for contraceptives15 in addition to wisconsin there are other st ates that have interpreted their general pharmacy laws to prohibit pharmacists from refusi ng to fill or transfer valid prescriptions for contraceptives for example the north carolina board of pharmacy has interpreted the states pharmacy laws to include duty of the pharmacist to promote the good for every patient recognizing that pharmacists have right to avoid participating in activities that violate their morals but that patients have right to obtain their medications the board has interpreted the pharmacy laws to mean that if pharmacist refuses to fill prescription for emergency contraception then that pharmacy has an obligation to get the patient and the prescription to pharmacist who will dispense the prescription in timely manner16httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22293crs5 17 ga comp r regs r

mshealthconscienceclauseshtmmeanwhile at least four states have laws that specifically permit pharmacists to refuse to fill valid prescriptions under georgia law it shall not be considered unprofessional conduct for any pha rmacist to refuse to f ill any prescription based on hisher professional judgment or ethical or moral beliefs17 while the arkansas code specifies that nothing in the law sh all prohibit pharmacist from refusing to furnish any contraceptive procedur supplies or information18 mississippi law also explicitly grants pharmacies and pharmacists the right to refuse to participate in any health care service defined to include the dispensi ng of drugs that violates his or her conscience19 likewise in south dakota pharm acists are not required to dispense medication if there is reason to believe that the medication would be used to destroy an unborn child20 because unborn child is defined as an organism that exists at fertilization21 this provision could apply to some drugs such as abortifacients and possibly emergency contraception that like standard birth control pills which prevent fertilization from occurring in the first place prevent fertilized eggs from implanting in the uterus finally several other stat have general conscience clause laws that do not specifically mention pharmacists but that none theless appear to apply to them for example in colorado private institution physician or agent or employee of such institutions or physician may be prohibited from refusing to provide contraceptives if such refusal is based on mo ral or religious objections22 while in florida doctors or other people may not be prevented from refusing to dispense birth control for religious reasons23 clearly pharmacy conscience clause laws vary widely from state to state while only small number of states have laws that speci fically authorize or ny pharmacists right to refuse to fill valid prescr iptions or sell contraceptives fo r reasons of personal belief number of states are considering such laws24 indeed in minnesota several competinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22293crs6 25 2005 bill tracking mn hb 2597 2005 bill tracking mn hb 3032 26 lisa

sts right to refuse and bill that would prohibit it25 in addition to states local jurisdictions may enact laws as well recently for example the city of austin texas passed law that requires pharmacies that participate in the citys medical assistance program to f ill valid prescriptions without delay even if an individual pharmacist objects for moral reasons26 moreover individual stores and pharmacy chains have their own employment policies that govern such situations in the absence of state laws on the subject and many of these policies appear either to require pharmacists to fill valid prescriptions or to allow their employees to refuse to fill prescriptions only if the employee transfer s the prescription to another pharmacist or pharmacy27 indeed walgreens has policy that requires pharmacists who object to filling certain prescriptions to refer those prescr iptions to another pha rmacist or pharmacy28 and walmart which until recently did not st ock emergency contraception has similar policy regarding employees with moral or religious objections29 such policies echo the positions of several major health associations for example the american medical association supports legislation that requires individual pharmacists or pharmacy chains to fill legally valid prescriptions or to provide immediate referral to an appropriate alternative dispensing pharm acy without interference30 while the american pharmaceutical association recognizes the individual pharmacists right to exercise conscientious refusal and suppor ts the establishment of systems to ensure patients access to legally prescribed therapy without compromising the pharmacists right of conscientious refusal31 regardless of such policy positions the issue of whether pharmacists should be allowed to refuse to fill valid prescr iptions or sell contraceptives is likely to continue to generate great deal of legislative debate in the near future
