of policy to develop both areas the naval petroleum and oil shale reserves were established in the early 1900s to ssure availability of fuels for the navy which was converting its ships from coal to

consisted first of three fields in california and wyoming in 1923 by executive order president warren g harding established fourth petroleum rese rve in northern alaska designated pet4 over time the original rationale for the naval petroleum reserves faded moreover the likelihood of sustained interruption in oil supply diminished and markets had shown capacity to set prices and allocat supply

usgs defines as the volume of petroleum contained in accumulations of at least 50 million barrels of oil equivalent w ithout regard to its recoverability recoverability falls into two categories technically recoverable and economically recoverable reserves technically recoverable resources are defined by the usgs as the volume of inplace resources that may be recoverable with currently available technology and without regard to cost economically recoverable resources are the volume of tec hnically recoverable resources for which the cost of discovery development produc tion and transport including return to capital can be recovered at given market price13 the usgs had estimated in the 1980s th at the npra could hold technically recoverable resources of 820 million 95

million acre 1002 area coasta l plain suggested that there was 95 chance of finding technically recove rable oil resources of 425 billion barrels and 5 chance of finding 118 billion barre ls or more

is distributed in accumulations of moderate size it is unlikely continues the usgs that prudhoe baysize accumulation occurs in npra16 based upon its estimates of field sizes th number of accumulations in various size classes and the possibility that some accumulations may be farther from existing infrastructure than in anwr the usgs also concluded that recovery from anwr is economically more attractive at lower prices for oil see table 317 when market prices are below 35bbl larger volume of technically recoverable oil would be economic in the anwr 1002 area however future oil prices are difficult to predict and predictions ca nnot take into account the pe riodic volatility of prices due to external and sometimes internal events the usgs goes on to note that if prices exceed 35bbl npra and anwr 1002 would have nearly equal volumes of economically recoverable oil18 opec has committed itself to maintaining world prices in range of 2228bbl and if oil producers believe that commitment to be indicative of any sort of trend then production from either npra and anwr or both could provide return on investment the usgs in making its calculations offers prediction of future oil priceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31573crs7 19 some have argued that there has been very little specificity about how this restriction will be applied and that full development of anwr would be
