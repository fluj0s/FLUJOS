commission broadcast media ownership rules are intended to foster the three longstanding goals of us media policycompetition localism and diversity of voices the fcc has the statutory obligation to review these rules every four years to determine if they continue to serve the public interest or should be modified or eliminated in december 2007 the fcc adopted an order that modified only one of its broadcast media ownership rulesthe newspaperbroadcast crossownership ruleand left the other rules intact under the new rule it would be presumptively not inconsistent with the public interest in the 20 largest local markets for an entity to own both major daily newspaper and single television or radio station so long as the television station is not among the four highestrated stations in the market and after the transaction there are at least eight independently owned and operating major media voices otherwise in most situations newspaperbroadcast cross ownership in local market would be presumptively inconsistent with the public interest each proposed combination however would be reviewed on casebycase basis and proposed combinations in smaller markets could be approved fifteen parties have appealed the new rule the challenges have been assigned to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit but several parties have petitioned to move the case to different appeals courts joint resolution of disapproval sjres 28 to revoke the new rule was approved on voice vote of the senate on may 15 2008 and similar resolution has been introduced in the house hjres 79 also the house appropriations committee has passed fy2009 financial services and general government appropriations bill that includes provision prohibiting the fcc from spending funds to implement the rule change in addition s 2332 and hr 4835 would negate the rule because they would require the fcc before adopting any new broadcast ownership rule after october 1 2007 to give 90 days notice for public comment which was not done prior to adoption of the rule in contrast hr 4167 would eliminate the newspaperradio but not newspapertelevision crossownership prohibition in its entirety in its previous quadrennial review in june 2003 the fcc modified five of its broadcast media ownership rules easing restrictions on the ownership of multiple television stations nationally and in local markets and on local media crossownership and tightening restrictions on the ownership of multiple radio stations in local markets those rules have never gone into effect sec 629 of the fy2004 consolidated appropriations act pl 108199 instructed the fcc to modify its new national television ownership rule to allow broadcast network to own and operate local broadcast stations that reach in total at most 39 of us television households in june 2004 the united states court of appeal for the third circuit in prometheus radio project vs federal communications commission found that the fcc did not provide reasoned analysis to support its specific local ownership limits and also that the fcc failed to address the impact of it new rules on minority ownership of broadcast stations and therefore remanded portions of the new local ownership rules back to the fcc and extended its stay of those rules this report will be updated as warranted

longstanding goals of us media policycompetition localism and diversity of voices the fcc is requi red by statute to review these rules every four years to determine if they continue to serve the public interest or should be modified or eliminated2 in addition in 2004 the fcc was instructed by the united states court of appeals for the third circuit third circuit to justify or modify the broadcast local ownership rules that it had adopted in 2003 as part of its statutory periodic review3 the third circuit found that the commission had not provided reasoned analys is to support the specific ownership limits in those rules the commissions derivation of new crossmedia limits and its modification of the numerical limits on both television and radio station ownership in local markets all have the same essential flaw an unjustified assumption that media outlets of the same type make an equal contribution to diversity and competition in local markets we thus remand for the commission to justify or modify its approach to setting numerical limits 4 as result of the third circuits stay and remand of the broadcast local ownership rules that the fcc had adopted in 20035 the broadcast media ownership rules that had been in place prior to the fccs adoption of its order on june 2 2003 were reinstatedexcept that in the interim 1 for detailed discussion of the historical

order that modified the newspaperbroadcast cross ownership rule8 the new rule which cannot go into effect until it has been approved by the courts9 would replace the current rule that prohibits crossownership of newspaper and television or radio station in local market number of such combinations currently exist however because when the fcc first adopted the crossownership prohibition in 1975 it grandfathered some preexisting combinations and in the past few years the fcc has granted number of newspaperbroadcast combinations temporary waivers pending conclusion of its quadrennial review proceeding in its 2007 order the fcc granted permanent waivers to five of those newspaperbroadcast station combinations10 the new newspaperbroadcast crossownership rule is complex every

limits to identify proposed combinations that would be deemed presumptively not inconsistent with the public interest12 specifically it would be presumptively not inconsistent with the public interest for an entity to own both major daily newspaper and single television or radio station in single local market if the combination is in one of the 20 largest local markets13 and if the broadcast station is television station the station is not among the four highestrated stations in the market and after the transaction there still are at least eight independently owned and operating major media voices in the market14 these three bright line numerical limits are straightforward and easy to objectively identify all other proposed newspaperbroadcast station combinations in local market would be deemed presumptively inconsistent with the public interest15 second the new rule specifies two circumstances that if met would automatically reverse negative presumption about proposed combination16 specifically the negative presumption would be automatically reversed if either the newspaper or broadcast station has failed or is failing17 or the proposed combination is with broadcast station that was not offering local newscasts prior to the combination and the station would initiate at least seven hours per week of local news programming after the combination 18 12 ibid at appendix pp 8485 amending 47 cfr 733555d3 13 local markets are referred to as designated market areas or dmas dmas are geographic designations developed by nielsen media research dma is made up of all the counties that get the preponderance of their broadcast programming from given television market the nielsen dmas are both complete all counties in the united states are in dma and exclusive dmas do not overlap in the 1992 cable act congress amended the 1934 communications act to require subject to certain exceptions each cable system to carry the signals of all the local full power commercial television stations within the same television market as the cable system with that market determined by commercial publications which delineate television markets based on viewing patterns 47 usc 534 the dmas represent the only nationwide commercial mapping of television audience viewing patterns each county in the united states is assigned to television market based on the viewing habits of the residents in the county 14 the rule defines major media voices as fullpower commercial and noncommercial television stations and major newspapers where the latter are those newspapers that are published at least four days week within the dma and have circulation exceeding 5 of the households in the dma see 2007 order at appendix p 85 amending 47 cfr 733555d3ii 15 2007 order at

dark for at least four months immediately prior to the filing of the ssignment or transfer application or must be involved in courtsupervised involuntary bankruptcy or involuntary insolvency proceedings to qualify as failing the applicant must show that the broadcast station has had an allday audience share of 4 or lower b the newspaper or broadcast station has had negative cash flow for the previ ous three years c the combination will produce public interest benefits and d the inmarket buyer is the only r easonably available candidate willing and able to acquire and operate the

to objectively identify although the second circumstance cannot be demonstrated in advance of the combination the 2007 order states that broadcast station licenses that are approved as result of this reversal presumption will need to report to the commission annually regarding how they have followed through on their commitment to initiate at least seven hours week of local news19 the 2007 order does not identify however process to use if the commitment is not met third the new rule identifies four factors that would be considered to confirm or rebut the positive or negative public interest presumption about proposed combination to yield final public interest determination 20 specifically for any proposed newspaperbroadcast station combination in local marketwhether it met the criteria for positive or negative public interest presumptionthe fcc would be required to make public interest determination considering the following four factors whether the combined entity w ill significantly increase the amount of local news in the market 21 whether the newspaper and the broadcast outlets each will continue to employ its own staff and each will exercise its own independent news judgment the level of concentration in the dma and the financial condition of the newspaper or broadcast station and if the newspaper or broadcast is in financial distress the proposed owners commitment to invest significantly in newsroom operations where this public interest determination is being made for proposed combination that has negative presumption the applicant must show by clear and convincing evidence that the co owned major newspaper and station will increase the diversity of independent news outlets and increase competition among independent news sources in the market with the four factors listed above informing this decision 22 the discussion in the 2007 order identifies these as factors to be used to rebut negative presumption23 but does not indicate whether the fcc ma consider additional factors or what weight if any it should give these four factors in making its public interest determination these four factors are not always easy to objectively identify or measure three involve commitments on the part of the applicant to future actions neither the rule nor the language in the 2007 order address what recourse the fcc or affected parties would have if the applicant did not live up to its commitments once it obtained the license 19 ibid at 67 20 ibid at appendix p 85 amending 47 cfr 733555d5 and 6 21 this factor which has numerical limits is used to review all proposed newspaperbroadcast crossownership combinations and is distinct from one of the two criteria that would reverse negative public interest presumption that the combination involve broad cast station that has not been offering local news programming but post combination would initiate seven hours of local newscasts 22 2007 order at appendix p 85 amending 47 cfr 733555d6 23 ibid

rule proposed newspaper broadcast combination in top20 market with eight or more independent major media voices and not involving topfour television station although not presumptively inconsistent with the public interest could nonetheless be rejected by the commission similarly proposed newspaperbroadcast combination in nontop20 ma rket or in market with fewer than eight independent major media voices or involving topfour television station and thus presumptively inconsistent with the public in terest could nonetheless be approved by the commission on one hand the complexity of the new rule potentially allows for detailed sophisticated analysis of the public interest implications of proposed newspaperbroadcast station combination on the other hand its complexity and the reliance on commitments to future behavior and subjective factors potentially allows majority of the commission to justify whatever determination it reaches in its order adopting the new rule the commission stated to the extent that proposed combination does not qualify for positive presumption it will have high hurdle to cross to win commission approval24 but in that same order the commission granted permanent waivers to five newspaperbroadcast combinations25 although the combinations did not appear to meet all the criteria to be presumptively in the public interest the brief discussion comprised of single paragraph plus footnotes addressing these permanent waivers did not provide the sort of detailed casebycase analysis that some might expect to be required to cross high hurdle citing these waivers the two fcc commissioners who had dissented from the 2007 order issued strongly worded statement questioning whether the new rule would be interpreted in fashion that would create loopholes that would allow many crossownershi p combinations that are not presumptively in the public interest rather than constitutin g high hurdle to limit such combinations 26

since the third circuit found that the fcc had failed to justify the numerical limits in the rules it had adopted in 2003 and the new fcc rule incorporates number of numerical limits in both its positive and negative public interest presumptions the 2007 order discussed the record evidence underlying each of the numerical elements in its new newspaperbroadcast crossownership rule27 the fcc limited the presumption that newspaperbroadcast combination would be in the public interest to the top 20 dmas because there was evidence in the 24 ibid at 68 25 ibid at 77 26 joint statement by fcc commissioners michael j copps and jonathan s adelstein on release of media ownership order fcc new release february 4 2008 available at httphraunfossfccgovedocs_public attachmatchdoc280001a1pdf viewed on march 6 2008 27 since the new rule creates public interest presumptions based on numerical limits but requires casebycase public interest determinations that can supersede the numerical lim its it may well be that the courts will find that the burden on the fcc to justify the specific numerical limits is lower than the burden required to ju stify the rules in the 2003 order

in terms of the number of independent voices the data showed that while there are at least 10 independently owned television stations in 18 of the top 20 dmas none of the dmas ranked 21 through 25 have 10 independently owned television stations while 17 of the top 20 dmas have at least two newspapers with circulation of at least 5 of the househol ds in that dma four of the five dmas ranked 21 through 25 have only one such newspaper28 the fcc limited the presumption that newspaperbroadcast combination would be in the public interest to markets in which there still would be eight independent major media voices after the combination because it found that these major media voices are generally the most important and relevant outlets for news and information in local markets today29 it justified basing its presumption on the number of major media voicesrather than all media voicesby citing relatively unanimous support in the record for the position that consumers continue predominantly to get their local news from daily newspapers and broadcast television data on the record show that consumers rely mostly on newspapers and television for news and information other media outlets contribute to diversity but those other voices are not major sources of local news or information and thus they are not included in the definition of major media voices 30 the fcc did not provide empirical justification for the bright line numerical limit of eight independent major media voices however it selected the number eight for the major media voice count because we are comfortable that assuring that minimum number of major media voices in the top 20 marketsalong with the other unquantified media outlets that are present in those marketswill assure that these markets continue to enjoy an adequate diversity of local news and information sources 31 it noted that all the top 20 markets have at least eight television stations and one major newspaper and stated that it did not want to allow significant decrease in the number of independently owned major media voices in any of those markets and thus imposed the requirement that there be at least eight major media voices post combination the fcc limited the presumption that newspapertelevision combination in the top 20 dmas would be in the public interest to those situations in which the television station is not one of the top four rated stations in the market because it considered daily newspaper and the top four stations to be the most influential providers of local news in their market thus the combination of newspaper with top four station is likely to cause greater harm to diversity in the market than other combinations 32 moreover the fcc believed that combinations of 28 ibid at 56 the fcc also appears to rely on its finding that the top 20 markets on average have 155 major voices independently owned television stations and major newspapers 878 total voices all independently owned television stations radio stations and major newspapers and approximately 3 3 million television households while markets 21 through 30 by comparison have on average 95 major voices 650 total voices and fewer than 11 million television households comparison of these averages for the top 20 markets and the 21 st through 30th markets however does not address whether the bright line cutoff between the 20th and 21st markets is justified 29 ibid at 57 30 ibid at 58 31 ibid at 60 32 ibid at 61

result in the production of more local news in furtherance of our localism goal33 according to the fcc the available data show that stations below the top four are less likely to carry local news and therefore more likely to carry new news as result of newspaper combination specifically 86 of stations ranked first through fourth in all dmas provide local news averaging 2083 minutes while only 40 of stations ranked fifth and below in all dmas provide some local news averaging 458 minutes 34 while the topfour station numerical limit has intuitive appeal since it conforms with the four major national broadcast television networks abc cbs fox and nbc35 it is not clear that the cited data are relevant to determination that the proper limit is the top four stations the fcc compares averages for the top four stations to averages for all remaining stations and finds sharp differences but these averages provide information about whether there is significant change in the amount of local news provided by the fourth and fifth stations in market moreover the data presented are for all dmas but the presumption is limited to the top 20 markets the commission does not indicate whether the sharp difference in averages between the top four stations and all additional stations that holds when looking at all dmas also holds when looking only at the top 20 markets the fcc would reverse negative presumption toward proposed newspaperbroadcast combination if the broadcast outlet has not been offering local newscasts prior to the combination but would initiate local news programming of at least seven hours per week as result of the combination because the commission has historically considered broadcasters news and public affairs programming to be uniquely nd particularly important and thus positive presumption under this limited circumstance will increase diversity of choices provide more local programming and allow better local service by media outlets 36 in the discussion of this criterion for reversing negative presumption the order provides ex planation for how the commission selected the seven hour numerical limit but in the discussion of factors to be used to rebut presumption the order states without explanation we consider significant increase to be at least seven hours week of additional news in the market37 the discussion in the order does not address whether this criterion might create perverse incentive yet an existing station seeking to be purchased might expect that local newspaper would value that station more highly than other potential purchasers from outside the market and thus might have the incentive to discontinue offering local news programming in order to allow its purchase by that newspaper under the initiates local news programming criterion 33 ibid at 61 34 ibid at 62 35 however the local affiliates of those four networks are not always the topfour rated stations in market in particular in several markets with large hispanic populati ons the local univision affiliate is among the four highest rated stations 36 2007 order at 67 37 ibid at 70

public interest presumption about proposed combination is whether the combined entity will significantly increase the amount of local news in the market38 interestingly it is in its discussion of this factor that the commission references seven hours of programming per week as significant increase but in the rule itself there is mention of seven hours or any measure of significant increase39 moreover it appears that this factor would only consider the impact of the proposed combination on the amount of local news programming offered by the combining newspaper and broadcast station it would not consider the impact of the proposed combination on total local news programming in the local market it is possible however that the combined newspaperbroadcast entity could command advertising revenues and audience share to the detriment of the other broadcasters in the market and that as result those other broadcasters might reduce or eliminate their local news programming which sometimes is expensive to produce the comments submitted in the record by group of consumer organizations 40 included econometric studies that purportedly show that newspaperbroadcast crossownership decreases the total amount of local news provided in market in its 2007 order however the fcc found numerous difficulties with that analysis however and concluded that it cannot rely on its conclusions 41 nonetheless it is not clear why the fcc would not consider the impact of proposed combination on the amount of marketwide local news programming in its public interest determination

interest51 citing its 1999 order creating the current rule the commission found that because the two media serve as substitutes at least to some degree for diversity purposes there remains need to

adopted in 1996 to codify the language in section 202b1 of the 1996 telecommunications act but as result of the third circuit agreeing in rehearing to lift the portion of its stay relating to the fccs new methodology for defining local radio markets those markets are defined using that new methodology specifically the current rules provide that in radio market with 45 or more full power commercial and noncommercial radio stations an entity may own operate or control up to eight commercial radio stations not more than five of which are in the same service am or fm in radio market with between 30 and 44 inclusive full power commercial and noncommercial radio stations an entity may own operate or control up to seven commercial radio stations not more than four of which are in the same service am or fm in radio market with between 15 and 29 inclusive full power commercial and noncommercial radio stations an entity may own operate or control up to six commercial radio stations not more than four of which are in the same service am or fm in radio market with 14 or fewer full power commercial and noncommercial radio stations an entity may own operate or control up to five commercial radio stations not more than three of which are in the same service am or fm except that an entity may not own operate or control more than 50 percent of the stations in such market 63 these numerical limits are applied to geographic markets that are defined according to arbitron rating boundaries which are based on market factors rather than on the signal transmission contours that previously were used to define markets 64 since arbitron boundaries do not cover small radio markets the fcc performed rulemaking proceeding to determine how to define geographic markets in those small markets for which there are arbitron market definitions65 also under current rules when brokering station has joint sales agreement jsa with brokered stationtypically this authorizes one station acting as broker

in local radio markets67 although it employs different rationale for justifying these limits than it used in its 2003 order in the 2007 order it found that by maintaining the current numerical limits we seek to guard against additional consolidation of the strongest stations in market in the hands of too few owners and to ensure market structure that fosters opportunities for new entry into radio broadcasting the number of commercial radio station owners declined by 39 percent between 1996 and 2007 with most of the decline occurring during the first few years after the 1996 act although the average number of commercial owners across all arbitron radio markets currently is 94 the largest commercial firm in each arbitron metro market has on average 46 percent of the markets total radio advertising revenue and the largest two firms have 74 percent of the revenue in 111 of the 299 arbitron metro markets the top two commercial station owners control at least 80 percent of radio advertising revenue the top four commercial firms also dominate audience share and evidence in the record indicates that the increase in concentration in commercial radio markets has resulted in appreciable albeit small increases in advertising rates all of this data in the record supports the conclusion that the current numerical limits are not unduly restrictive and that additional consolidation would not serve the commissions competitive goals footnotes omitted 68 the commission also found by preserving healthy competitive local radio market the local radio ownership rule helps promote our interest in localism aside from the positive effect on localism that ensues from competitive radio market however the commission has never found that the local radio ownership rule significantly advances our interest in localism 69 similarly based on its examination of the record the commission cannot conclude that the local radio ownership ru is necessary to protect format diversity nevertheless we find that retaining the current competitionbased numerical limits on local radio ownership will promote dive rsity indirectly thus it is proper for us to retain the status quo as the ownership tiers serve the public interest in light of competition70 in the 2007 order the commission also found that retaining the current competitionbased amfm subcaps will promote diversity indirectly by facilitating and encouraging entry into the local media market by new and underrepresented parties and we thus conclude that the am subcaps are in the public interest71

percentage of us television households when calculating the total audience reached by an entitys stations the socalled uhf discount is appliedaudiences of uhf stations are given only halfweight73 for example if an entity owns uhf station in market with an audience of two million households that audience would only be counted as one million households when calculating the entitys market reach in its 2007 order the fcc found that the commission is foreclosed from addressing the issue of the uhf discount in this proceeding by the 2004 consolidated appropriations act although the act did not specifically mention the uhf discount the prometheus court observed that the statutory 39 percent national cap would be altered if the uhf discount were modified accordingly we conclude that the uhf discount is insulated from review under section 202h 74 however the commission noted that the third circuit recognized that the fcc might have authority outside section 202h to modify or eliminate the uhf discount and that the fcc had sought public comment on the scope of that authority prior to the third circuits prometheus decision75 the commission therefore decided to separately address the extent of its authority to alter the uhf discount and whether it should retain revise or eliminate the discount g6g158g138g149g561g16g142g157g160g152g155g148g561g17g160g151g142g155g156g145g146g153g561 the dual network ownership rule permits common ownership of multiple broadcast networks but prohibits merger among the top four networksabc cbs fox and nbc76 in both its 2003 order and its 2007 order the fcc retained the rule77 in both reviews the commission found that the rule continues to be necessary to promote competition in the national television advertising and program acquisition markets and th at the rule promotes localism by preserving the balance of negotiating power between networks and affiliates in 2001 as part of an earlier biennial review of its broadcast media ownership rules the fcc had modified this rule to allow the four major networks to own operate maintain or control broadcast networks other than the four majors with this change viacom the owner of cbs was allowed to

about the existing rules the dc circuit in fox television stations inc v federal communications commission stated section 202h carries with it presumption in favor of repealing or modifying the ownership rules81 further in response to petitions for rehearing the dc circuit stated the statute is clear that regulation should be retained only insofar as it is necessary in not merely consonant with the public interest 82 but in the same decision the dc circuit stated that the courts decision did not turn at all upon interpreting necessary in the public interest to mean more than in the public interest and added we think it better to leave unresolved precisely what 202h means when it instructs the commission first to determine whether rule is necessary in the public interest but then to repeal or modify the rule if it is simply longer in the public interest 83 in its 2003 order the fcc majority took this language to mean that the commission must overcome high burden to retain any ownership rule responding to question from senator mccain in june 4 2003 senate commerce committee hearing thenfcc chairman powell stated that the dc circuit interprets the act to be biased toward deregulation and added that for the commission to be in concert with that interpretation it cannot reregulate in response to question from senator dorgan thenfcc commissioner abernathy stated that the dc circuits interpretation directs the commission to minimize regulation as competition develops not to regulate to maximize the number of voices at that same hearing all five fcc commissioners and several senators agreed that it would be useful for congress to provide both the court and the commission guidance on the standard to use for reviewing ownership rules and on whether the act allows the commission to reregulate broadcast ownership subsequently in its prometheus decision the third circuit found while we acknowledge that 202h was enacted in the context of deregulatory amendments the 1996 act to the communications act see fox i 280 f3d at 1033 sinclair 284 f3d at 159 we do not accept that the repeal or modify in the public interest instruction must therefore operate only as oneway ratchet ie the commission can use the review process only to eliminate thenextant regulations for starters this ignores both modify and the requirement that the commission act in the public interest rather than upending the reasoned analysis requirement that under the apa ordinarily applies to an agencys decision to promulgate new regulations or modify or repeal existing regulations see state farm 463 us at 43 202h extends this requirement to the commissions decision to retain its existing regulations this interpretation avoids crabbed reading of the statute under which we would have to infer without express language that congress intended to curtail the commissions rulemaking authority to contravene traditional administrative law principles 84 81 280 f3d 1048 82 293 f3d 539 83

in its 2003 order the fcc reviewed the advantag and disadvantages of implementing bright line rules that incorporate specific limits on the number of media outlets company can own in local market without regard to such marketspecific characteristics as the market share of the postmerger company or the degree to which the merging company is vertically integrated into program production vs implementing flexible yet quantifiable rules that would allow for casebycase reviews that more readily take into account marketspecific or companyspecific market shares and characteristics the commission chose the bright line approach in large part because it identified regulatory certainty as an important policy goal in addition to the three traditional goals of diversity competition and localism 85 the commission stated any benefit to precision of casebycase review is outweighed in our view by the harm caused by lack of regulatory certainty to th affected firms and to the capital markets that fund the growth and innovation in the media industry companies seeking to enter or exit the media market or seeking to grow larger or smaller will all benefit from clear rules in making business plans and investment decisions clear structural rules permit planning of financial transactions ease application processing and minimize regulatory costs 86 it concluded that the adoption of bright line rules rather than casebycase analysis provides certainty to outcomes conserves resources reduces administrative delays lowers transactions costs increases transparency of process and ensures consistency in decisions all of which foster capital investment in broadcasting the commissi on conceded that bright line rules preclude certain amount of flexibility the 2003 order did not explain how the commi ssion would weigh the goal of regulatory certainty visàvis the traditional goals of diversity competition and localism if the former were to be in conflict with one or more of the latter on one hand the commission stated that it would continue to have discretion to review particular cases and would have an obligation to take hard look both at waiver requests where bright li ne ownership limit would proscribe particular transaction and at petitions to deny license transfer where bright line ownership limit would allow particular transaction at the same time however it suggested it would not look favorably upon some petitions bright lines provide the certainty and predictability needed for companies to make business plans and for capital markets to make investments in the growth and innovation in media markets conversely casebycase review of even belowcap mergers on diversity grounds would lead to uncertainty and undermine our efforts to encourage growth in broadcast services accordingly petitioners should not use the petition to deny process to re litigate the issues resolved in this proceeding87 having determined that bright line test was preferable to casebycase review the commission created bright line tests for its broadcast media crossownership and local ownership rules the 85 2003 order at paras 8085 in the section on policy go als there are

line numerical limits approach to broadcast ownership rules was rational and in the public interest88 but found the methodology used by the commission to set those numerical limits arbitrary in its 2007 order the fcc has changed direction opting for rule that incorporates elements of both bright line approach presumptions with specific numerical limits and casebycase approach factors that the commission would cons ider in the casebycase review of both combinations that met the presumption of being in the public interest and combinations that did not the fcc was motivated in part by the fact that elements of the evidentiary record were inconclusive and therefore not supportive of strict bright line numerical limits the commission found the inconclusiveness of some of the data and disagreement as to the outcome of the studies however supports our decision to undertake casebycase review of particular combinations in particular markets rather than providing hard acrosstheboard limits under our method we can consider facts in particular case with presumption in favor of allowing newspaper and radio station or nontop four television station combinations in the top 20 markets and presumption against combinations in all other markets casebycase approach will enable the commission to make more fully informed assessment that proposed transaction in particular market actually will increase the total amount of local news generated by the combined outlets 89 establishing presumptions as opposed to bright line will allow for the evaluation of proposed newspaperbroadcast combinations under defined circumstances on casebycase basis90 at the same time the fcc concluded in its 2007 order that based on the evidentiary record in the proceeding it was appropriate to maintain the current numerical limits in its other broadcast ownership rules91 in that order however the commission did not present data to support all the specific numerical limits in those rules thus currently most of the broadcast media ownership rules have bright line numerical limits but the newspaperbroadcast crossownership rule is more flexible requiring the fcc to make casebycase public interest evaluation there may not be sharp distinction however between rules with bright line numerical limits and rules requiring casebycase evaluations because parties may seek waivers of brightline rules and to the extent the fcc grants such waivers the effect may be to provide equal or even greater flexibility this is particularly apparent in recent fcc waiver decisions involving newspaperbroadcast station combinations in local markets when the fcc adopted its new newspaperbroadcast crossownership rule in the same order it granted permanent waivers to five newspaperbroadcast combinations 92 as explained earlier the combinations that were granted waivers did not appear to meet all the criteria in the new rule to 88 prometheus 373 f3d at 431 89 2007 order at 46 90 ibid at

the litigation concludes whichever is longer presto tribune gets at least twoyear waiver plus the ability to go to court immediately and see if they can get the entire rule thrown out and most

ownership rule this suggests that it may be less important whether the ownership rules have bright lines or require casebycase evaluations both the waiver process for bright line rules and the evaluation process for casebycase public interest determinations appear to give the fcc commissioners significant degree of discretion in their decision making and allow them to choose to enforce ownership limits more or less stringently g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 charles b goldfarb specialist in telecommunications
