current programs and issues introduction directing the use of nuclear weapons is surely the gravest decision president can make the process established for the president to perform this function is nuclear command and control nc2 nc2 is defined as the exercise of authority and direction by the president as commander in chief through established command lines over nuclear weapon operations of military forces as chief executive over all go vernment activities that support those operations and as head of state over required multinational actions that support those operations1 the infrastructure that supports th president and his unified command commanders in exercising this authority is the nuclear command and control system nccs2 the nccs is defined as the designated combination of flex ible and enduring elements including facilities equipment communications pr ocedures personnel and the structure in which these elements are integrated all of which are essential for planning directing and controlling nuclear weapon operations of military forces and the activities that s upport those operations the purpose of the nccs shall be to provide the president with all capabilities required to exercise his authority over nuclear weapons operations3 the nccs supports the presiden ts constitutional responsibilities as commander in chief and is part of continuity of government activities and so may warrant congressional oversig ht and interest congress when authorizing and appropriating funds and in its oversight role reviews department of defenses dods plans to sustain and modernize the nccs in the past dod has conducted reviews of nuclear posture and systems and communicated those findings to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33408crs2 4 the 1998 quadrennial

president has the authority to order the employment of nuclear weapons and the term nca is now used less frequently although it still appears in the literature legislative branch4 increased momentum to implement the 2001 nuclear posture review npr findings as well as the publication of dods 2006 quadrennial defense review qdr could provide an opportunity for congress to revisit the structure and future relevance of the nccs todays nccs architecture still largely bears shape that stems from its cold war origins despite the 14 years since the dissolution of the ussr however as the threat from russia has waned some analysts see the potential for nuclear challenges from china north korea or iran which could drive continued need for robust nc2 but possibly with struct ure different from today ot her analysts note that the addition of nonnuclear responses and ac tive defenses advocated by the 2001 npr could drive additional comple x requirements further the individual platforms that make up the nccs serve in secondary roles that give other user agencies equities in continued support for legacy systems thes equities will need to be reconciled with the recommendations from the 2006 qdr to retire some of these cold war platforms despite its strategic and budgetary impli cations the nccs is often not well understood and receives little ttention from outside the military establishment

indicators most of the nccs centers include an intelligence cell that is linked to classified national intelligence systems this capability can help with anticipating crises although sometimes 24 hour news services such as cnn are the first indicator situation monitoring can also include tracking the weather which can affect aircraft operations tactical warning and attack assessment twaa detecting and analyzing potential attack is one of the most timesensitive functions that contributes to the nccs process it is vital to verify quickly missile launch and discern whether it is false indicati on previously announced space launch potential attack or some other event next determining the origin size and potential targets of the attack should aid decision makers in shaping their response to provide high degree of certainty rega rding this critical information the twaa centers rely on concept called dual phenomenology dual phenomenology means that two different systems in this case satellites and radars are used to verify an attack decision making doctrine recommends that the president consult with senior commanders in making decision to employ nuclear weapons by statute the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff cjcs is the primary military advisor to the president pl 9943317 the president may choose to consult with other advisors as well the system must provide connectivity between the president his advisors and his nuclear commanders as well as continuous situati on updates so that he has the best information possible on which to base decision force management data on the readiness of the nuclear deterrent and supporting forces is important to decision makers both on daytoday basis and in crisis this data could include forces available locations

key leadership force direction this function includes two key aspects of nuclear command and control nuclear surety sometimes called negative control and positive control nuclear surety comprises the

assistant secretary crouch pr oposed that changes in the multinational environment drove the need for the npr he stated that since the cold war was over there was new relationship with russia the administration wanted to encourage positive evolution in that relationship and move away from mutual assured destruction25 he claimed that this evolution would entail reduced dependence on offensive nuclear forces for deterrence meanwhile he also highlighted the npr contention that th us may face multiple political opponents posing newly emerging threats particular ly from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction wmd and ballistic missiles to deliver them26 dod held that these potential new threat s were difficult to anticipate so capabilities based approach was needed the capabilities based concept strove to provide the president with wide range of options to better tailor the national response to potential adversar ies and defeat any aggressor the npr embodied this approach in the architecture of new triad of capabilities27 the first leg of the nprs new triad includes nucl ear and nonnuclear offensive forces active defenses such as interceptor technolog ies and passive defensive forces identification and warning capabilities constitute the second leg of the new triad to increase the range of options and reduce the reliance on ffensive systems responsive

area of emphasis in the new doctrine is deterring the use of weapons of mass dest ruction and acting to prevent or retaliate against their use if required of interest with respect to nuclear command and control are the doctrines discussion of crisis ac tion planning and emphasis on integrating nuclear and nonnuclear offensive forces with defensive forces31 however other press reports indicate that this dr aft update may have been cancelled32 reports suggest that the new joint doctrine would emphasize rapid crisis action planning to respond to unanticipated wmd thr eats this concept is also carryover from the 2001 npr crisis action planning is defined as the time sensitive development of joint operations plans and orders in response to an imminent crisis33 the need for rapid planning has

findings this commission might move that debate forward vital aspect that the npr does not address is the policy for the role and uses of nuclear weapons although it does suggest that pr ecision nonnuclear or even non kinetic weapons might fulfill missions previ ously allocated to nuclear weapons and so permit smaller arsenal however the continued presence of these weapons in the us arsenal

soviet union in certain as pects these systems have changed little since the end of the cold war and subsequent reviews of nuclear posture as the defense department examines difficult resources tradeoffs it is relevant to ask is this infrastructure still appropriate today the postcold war environment could impose new requirements on the nccs that these cold war systems might not best fulfill and that might necessitate spending on new programs the nature of the threat can shape the challenges to the nc2 infrastructure particular problem with re spect to assuring nuclear command and control during the cold war was the threat of decapitation att ack decapitation attack would specifically target national and military leadership with the intent of disrupting the lines of authority required to direct retaliation attack this concern over decapitation was especially pervasive during the 1980s while such an attack could prevent response from the deterrent for ce or at least blunt the cohesion of retaliation effort the greatest concern centered on the potential loss of political control of conflicts escala tion or termination analysts argued that the nuclear command and control architecture needed to be able to continue functioning through an attack in order to ensure government control of the weapons38 this outlook shaped upgrades to nuclear command and control that were implemented in the 1980s such as increased redundancy and survivability of communication links the threat of such strike from russia today is considerably diminished compared to the cold war indeed us policy considers the relationship with russia to be longer adversarial39 the strategic offensive reductions treaty also known as the moscow treaty agreed to by presidents bush and putin in 2002 committed each side to reduce deployed nuc lear weapons to levels between 1700 and 2200 such arms levels represent significant decrease from the tens of thousands deployed during the height of the cold war40 therefore in the current strategic and fiscally constrained envir onment is the overlapping redundancy and expense of command and control architect ure designed to function during major nuclear exchange still justified despite the demise of the soviet union most analysts agree that the united states could face wide range of challenges in the future for example there

china44 some might even argue that highlighting china threat represents the latest effort in the search for great power peer competitorone that the defense establis hment has not found since the end of the cold war era similar to the warnings bout coming war with japan prevalent in the 1990s such threat might be viewed as justifying the development of major weapons systems to satisfy the militarys comfort zone unlike the threat from nonstate actors such as qaeda yet an increasing chinese nuclear capability if accompanied by hostile relations or dipl omatic crisis could pose renewed

closer presidential participation if one desired to require presidential aut horization to release these strikes enforcement of that requirement could pos difficult technical nd operational problems while nuclear weapons are designed with pe rmissive action link c odes to prevent use without presidential author ization conven tional weapons are not so designed66 the process becomes even more

scenarios decision could be needed on what locations to defend and what not to defend71 such grave decision might be viewed as requiring presidential involvement however given what may be fleeting opportunities to respond within defense systems operational envelope taking time to consult with the president could lead to missing the chance to stop incoming missiles therefore some analysts reco mmend that missile defense release authority be delegated to the unified combatant commander perhaps s upported with standing presidential guidance72 in some cases choosing wh ether defensive launch or an offensive strike will form the national response and selecting among the tradeoffs between the two could also require presiden tial consideration it will be vital to choreograph both the

2005for nc2 systems operator requirement s for new capabilities are often not supported in the new systems or modifications purch ased by the acquisition community this problem is compounded by the multiple agen cies with interest or involvement in nc2 systems86 however relying solely on operatorgenerated requirements to guide acquisition programs may also be problematic sometimes these requirements are unrealistic they can exceed the state of the art that is achievable within specific program budget or time line as corollary thes requirements may be achievable but not at cost congruent with other competing military needs additionally the focus on technical capability sometimes ignores total costs of sustainment and operation over systems lifetime87 the debate regarding the interaction between meeting operator needs and managing acquisition pr ograms economically is ongoing third concern is the decline in th number of people with nc2 expertise since the end of the cold war as nucle ar forces have drawn down the number of people in these skill sets has declined further the prestige of being associated with the nuclear mission has also decreased as the military services reduced manpower many people with nuclear operations expertise were required to master multiple additional specialties so positions associ ated with nuclear operations became revolving door as consequence the services have experi enced brain drain of people with expertise in these zero defects disciplines this results in onthe job learning in key nc2 positions that re quire personinthe

requirements that the mccc helped to fulfill the qdr emphasizes that these new command and control capabilities must be survivable in the event of wmd electronic or cyberwarfa re attacks dod also pr oposes that these systems be tailored more specifically to include the mission of wmd elimination90 it will likely take robust communicati ons infrastructure to integrate the activities of these new organizations usstratcom is studying implementation of an internet protocol ipbased communications architecture to link these distributed locations91 however using an ip network in this type of application has not yet been proven to provide the high degree of assurance of rapid message transmission needed for nuclear command and control92 in particular high priority nuclear force direction

aehf communications satellite aehf will replenish the aging milstar ehf satellite c onstellation as those spacecraft r each the end of their service life the milstar satellite constellation used both for st rategic nuclear command and control and for tactical warfighters currently has five satellites with the first having been launched in 1994 the aehf system w ould provide survivable secure antijam communications capabilities at higher data rates and capacities than the existing milstar constellation loc kheed martin and northr opgrumman are the satel lite integration and communications payload contractors for the aehf program the air force requested 6653 million in rdte and 529 million for procurement in the fy2006 budget110 in the fy2006 defense authoriza tion congress fully funded the air force budget request for aehf in the fy2006 defense appropria tions legislation congress also matched the dod budget request for aehf111 in its fy2007 budget proposal dod is not requesting any procuremen t funds as it has already purchased the three satellites proposed for th aehf constellation however the air force is still seeking 633 million for fy2007 for aehf rd112 unfortunately like many air force satellite acquisition programs aehf has suffered from schedule dela ys and cost overruns113 technical shortfalls in the development of the communications encr yption equipment which the national security agency nsa must deliver as government furnished equipment gfe to the satellite contractor are major cause of the schedule slips the first aehf launch is now targeted for 2008

to serve as bridge between milstar and the transformational satellite tsa t program which is expected to incorporate laser communication crosslinks between satellites and internet routing capability this program would first launch in 2013 which represents two year slip from air force plans due to budget cuts and immature technologies underlying its advanced capabilities some are proposing that some of these technologies be tested on aehf satellites first to reduce risk on the tsat program116 for fy2006 congress considered but did not direct the air force to buy an additional aehf satellite to hedge against further tsat program delays congress did direct the air force to prepare an analysis of alternatives report examining the possibility of acquiring additional aehf satellites and modifying the wideband gapfiller satellites to bridge the gap in the event of further tsat delays117 in the fy2006 defense appropriations act congress reduced the fundi ng for tsat by 400 million and directed the air force to fo cus on technology development rather than transitioning to an acquisition program congress approved 436plus million but reserved 120 million for either purchase of fourth aehf satellite or continued systems development for tsat based on the outcome of the analysis of alternatives study118 issues for congress the increased demands on the nuclear command and control system driven by the 2001 npr and subsequent dod policy will pose challenges for the nccs in the future the systems legacy cold wa r architecture will compete for budgetary priority against conventional systems that may seem to some to be more immediately relevant to todays threat environment and the war on terror whether the threat that should shape the nccs comes from chin or some other nuclear armed peer competitor rogue states or terrorism some suggest there is continued value in this robust system others may argue that the systems continued value lies in its ability to fulfill missions often viewed as subs idiary or even beyond the traditional dod purview however the key functions performed by the nccs will likely remain requirements as long as the united st ates maintains nuclear deterrent the dod continues to pursue moderniza tion initiatives across the system but in budget constrained environment th activities will come under competinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33408crs32 pressure from more conven tional missions through the fy2007 budget request the defense department has tinued to focus on evolutionary upgrades of the cold war nccs architecture however u sstratcoms activa tion of functional component commands and some recomme ndations in the 2006 qdr could signal change in direction questions congress may confront include what is the nature of the threat some schools of thought contend that china is rising to be the uss next military peer competitor while others contend that china is growing to be partner in the world community the extent of the threat from north korea iran or terrorist orga nizations whether from nuclear strike or from an emp attack are also subject to debate the capabilities posed by these potential threats may present worst case against which to configure the nuclear command and control system what is the role of nuclear w eapons in us strategy and how might that role aff ect command and control there is competition between those who believe the role of nuclear weapons should be reduced to give non proliferation efforts credibility and those who want to increase their utility to confront proliferators the role of th weapons will shape the command and control system to support them what is the appropriate architecture for the nccs is the current centralized linear system developed during the cold war still the right approach to ensuring presidential positive control and minimizing command and control confusion revisions to the nccs architecture may need to incorporate the additional 2001 nprdriven command and control re quirements for nonnuclear offensive responses and active missile defe nse debate and possibly legislation regarding release authorities may need to precede such archit ectural decisions perhaps more dispersed approach ch as usstratcom now proposes may be better fit for the current threat environm ent that approach might also convey manpower and budget economies in the long run however applying distributed network style approach to nuclear command and control has not yet been tested or proven what level of invest ment in modernization or new procurement is needed or justified all of the nccs mode rnization or procurement initiatives discussed above are projected to continue for years into the future the continued implementation of the 2001 npr and the findings of the 2006 qdr may adjust or add to those requirements the retirement of the e4b naoc and mccc may offer some opportunities for short term savings as all of the services look to recapitalize equipment after the wear and tear from duty in iraq the nccs will be competing against immediate daytoday services needs are the existing nccs platforms adequate to requirements are they still needed what value are the sec ondary uses of the nccs the nccs represents national asset built up over decades can the taxpayer get added value by employing
