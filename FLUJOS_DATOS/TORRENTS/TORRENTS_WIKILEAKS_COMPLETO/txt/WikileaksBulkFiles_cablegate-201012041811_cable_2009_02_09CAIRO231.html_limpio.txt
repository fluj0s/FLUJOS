the secretary classified by ambassador margaret scobey for reasons 14 b and d summary 1 snf madame secretary foreign minister aboul gheit has been looking forward to meeting you since your nomination was first announced the egyptian leadership including president mubarak are encouraged by the administrations immediate attention to the middle east and your and the presidents early outreach to them overall the egyptians believe they did not receive fair treatment from the previous administration and hope to see improvements aboul gheit likely will explain egypts soft powerits ability to influence regional events without benefit of deep pockets he likely will focus more on the strategic challenges of the regionthe peace process and iranbut may also address some pending bilateral matters he may ask for your support for egypt to be part of an expanded g8 or g20 and press the candidacy of egyptian culture minister farouq hosny for director general of unesco he may not raise human rights specifically ayman nour political reform or democratization but you should aboul gheit will want to discuss gaza including smuggling and countertunneling iran and the israelipalestinian peace process on iraq and counterterrorism we and the egyptians see largely eyetoeye intelligence cooperation is close and effective and our militarytomilitary relationship is durable but stuck in forceonforce mindset 2 snf summary continued aboul gheit is smart urbane with tendency to lecture and to avoid discussing egyptian failings with allpurpose recourse to egyptian sovereign pride however because this is his first meeting with you and it is in washington he may be more inclined to listen you should thank him for egypts continuing regional leadership in particular regarding their efforts to bring about ceasefire in gaza and press him for egypt to continue to use their influence and good offices to achieve permanent solution to intrapalestinian infighting and conflict you should also stress the need for egypt to more effectively insure that hamas cannot rearm via smuggling across or tunneling under the border with gaza aboul gheit will press for your attendance at the march 2 gaza donors conference in cairo and may complain about unhelpful qatari and syrian behavior he will also want to explore us intentions towards iran president mubarak told senator mitchell during his recent visit here that he did not oppose our talking with the iranians as long as you dont believe word they say end summary respect and appreciation 3 snf in terms of regional affairs special middle east envoy senator george mitchell struck the right chord during his recent visit to cairo when he told president mubarak that he was here to listen and hear your advice the egyptians have long felt that at best we take them for granted and at worst we deliberately ignore their advice while trying to force our point of view on them you may wish to thank aboul gheit for the vital role egypt played in bringing about ceasefire in gaza and its efforts at making it last you should ask him what the current state of play is between hamas and fatah and have him describe egypts vision of the future for the palestinians both among their factions and vis vis israel note although the egyptians will react well to overtures of respect and appreciation egypt is very often stubborn and recalcitrant ally in addition egypts selfperception as the indispensable arab state is contingent on egyptian effectiveness on regional issues including sudan lebanon and iraq egypt and the israelpalestinian conflict 4 snf although aboul gheit was never enthusiastic about the annapolis peace process resolution of the israelipalestinian conflict remains the primary strategic political goal for the egyptians they are proud of their role as intermediary well aware that they are perhaps the only player that can talk with us the israelis and all palestinian factions mubarak hates hamas and considers them the same as egypts own muslim brotherhood which he sees as his own most dangerous political threat since the cairo 00000231 002 of 004 june 2007 hamas takeover of gaza the egyptians under the leadership of intelligence chief omar soliman the facto national security advisor with direct responsibility for the israelipalestinian account have shifted their focus to intrapalestinian reconciliation and establishment of the hamasisrael ceasefire soliman brokered halfyearlong truce last year which hamas broke in december leading to the israeli invasion of gaza he has recently restarted those efforts with the goal of getting hamas to agree to yearlong ceasefire which should give the egyptians space to bring about their political goal of palestinian reconciliation under technocratic nonpartisan government headed by president mahmoud abbas gaza and tunnels 5 snf smuggling through the sinai peninsula and into gaza is an old and complicated problem for egypt egypt views wellarmed and powerful hamas as national security threat point driven home in dramatic fashion by the january 2008 border breach when hamas bulldozed the old border fence and more than half million palestinians poured into egypt unchecked and hungry since the closure of the egyptgaza border following the june 2007 gaza takeover by hamas most smuggling of consumer goods and weapons has gone underground the narrow corridor between egypt and gaza is as honeycombed with subterranean passageways as gigantic ant colony 6 snf although it is not directly in aboul gheits bailiwick belonging more to the security and intelligence forces nonetheless the issue of tunnels and rearming hamas is the subject of intense scrutiny by israel and the congress and sensitivity by the egyptians long criticized by israel for not doing enough to halt arms smuggling via tunnels the egyptians have stopped complaining and started acting egypt has increased efforts to counter arms smuggling by accelerating its 23 million fmffunded tunnel detection program along the egyptgaza border and requesting us support to purchase four backscatter xray machines to scan vehicles entering the sinai for weapons and explosives note aboul ghait may not be of this egisoriginated request egypt also continues to cooperate with israel especially via intelligence sharing to prevent militants from hamas and other extremist organizations from crossing the gaza border and on thwarting militant activity in egypt egyptian efforts are all justified under president mubaraks pledge that egypt with protect its borders 7 snf egypt will not take any action that could be perceived as collaboration in israels siege of gaza and they have been hypersensitive to any suggestion that foreigners are assisting them or overseeing their efforts to counter smuggling aboul gheit publicly distanced egypt from our january mou with israel to combat arms smuggling into gaza although he knew about it in advance and consulted with secretary rice and about its contents the egyptians do not want to be stuck holding the gaza bag and must be able to point the finger of blame at israel for the plight of the palestinians at the same time egypt has withstood scathing and widespread criticism in the arab world for refusing to open the rafah border crossing to supply gaza even during the height of the december fighting the egyptians only sent medicine and medical supplies through the rafah border all other humanitarian goods went through the israeli crossing at kerem shalom they likewise insist that rafah will only reopen to handle gazan travellers when the gazan side is under pa control with eu observers according to the 2005 ama 8 snf ultimately egypt believes that the only realistic and viable solution to erode hamas power and stop arms smuggling is the return of the palestinian authority to gaza and the opening of gazas border to legitimate trade while in the short term we can best assist the egyptians with technical knowhow and training long term counter smuggling success will depend on reducing the financial incentives to smuggling by providing the sinai bedouin with legitimate economic opportunities and by regularly opening the gaza borders to trade thereby reducing economic incentives to smuggle the march 2 gaza donors conference 9 snf president mubarak told senator mitchell that he cairo 00000231 003 of 004 wanted to personally invite you to the march 2 gaza donors conference in cairo aboul gheit will press hard for you to accept this invitation he is keen to keep up the momentum on gaza reconstruction and for egypt to be seen as taking the lead in helping the palestinians it is very important to him that this conference be at the ministerial level and he will be disappointed if you are unable to accept iraq and iran 10 snf president mubarak enjoys recounting for visiting members of congress how he warned former president bush against invading iraq ending with i told you so and wag of his finger in addition there are egyptian misgivings about nuri almaliki and shia majority rule in iraq egypt therefore will need additional prodding to continue to take steps to help rehabilitate iraq into the greater arab world you should ask aboul gheit when he plans to fully open the egyptian embassy in baghdad and exchange accredited ambassadors with iraq the first egyptian ambassador to postsaddam iraq was assassinated as for iran mubarak has visceral hatred for the islamic republic referring repeatedly to iranians as liars and denouncing them for seeking to destabilize egypt and the region he sees the syrians and qataris as sycophants to tehran and liars themselves there is doubt that egypt sees iran and its greatest longterm threat both as it develops nuclear capability and as it seeks to export its shia revolution nonetheless mubarak told mitchell pointedly that he did not oppose the us speaking to the iranians as long as we did not believe single word they say aboul gheit will be keen to hear your description of us intentions towards iran in his conversation with senator mitchell aboul gheit carefully noting he was speaking personally expressed more interest into bringing the syrians into negotiations again president mubarak was not enthusiastic about dealing with the syrians at this time us assistance to egypt 11 snf the greatest egyptian outrage year ago congressional conditioning of 100 million of us assistance to egypt may now be moot according to our latest understanding of the state of play with the fy2009 appropriations language beyond the issue of conditioning the egyptians resent the us unilateral decision to cut esf in half from 415 million in fy08 to 200 million in fy09 level which the egyptians find embarrassing not because they need the money they say but because it shows our diminished view of the value of our relationship in my view it is important to the us to continue an esf program aimed at health education and poverty eradication to demonstrate concern for the egyptian people as opposed to strictly military assistance program egypt has also been unhappy with the use of these funds to support democracy in egypt it would be useful if you could urge that egypt accept the fy 2009 levels so that we can proceed to program funds to benefit egypt while promising to engage in serious review of the conflicts that exist and desire to resolve them as soon as possible 12 snf concerning military assistance the egyptian political and military leadership feel that they have been short changed by our holding to an fmf level of 13 billion the same level for 30 years despite inflation and which they contrast with increases to our military assistance to israel finally egypt seeks higher profile in international financial circles finance minister youssef boutros ghali was recently named chairman of the imfs policysetting committee the imfc the first from developing country and aboul gheit is likely to ask for your support to include egypt in expanded g8 and g20 fora ayman nour and saad eddin ibrahim 13 snf egypts political leadership considers our public chastisement of their treatment of jailed former opposition ghad party leader ayman nour as interfering with internal affairs and infringement on national sovereignty mubarak takes this issue personally and it makes him seethe when we raise it particularly in public aboul gheits view is that we have made ayman nour freedom martyr and damaging and cairo 00000231 004 of 004 distorting prism through which we view our relationship with egypt much the same can be said about saad eddin ibrahim the outspoken political science professor and democracy activist who is in selfimposed exile in the us because of spurious law suits brought against him for allegedly defaming egypt in negative development in late january egypts attorney generalequivalent took action to advance the only criminal case pending against ibrahim you should press aboul gheit hard on nour and ibrahim and also urge the goe to stop arresting other less prominent political activists nours health is bad and he has served more than half his sentence he deserves humanitarian pardon you may wish to lay down marker for future discussion on democratization and human rights concerns you might note that although you and the president want to improve the relationship egypt could take some steps to remove these very volatile issues from the agenda farouq hosny 13 snf egypt has mounted fullscale international campaign to support the candidacy of culture minister farouq hosny for director general of unesco the arab league and the african union have already publicly stated their commitment to hosny and the egyptians believe they also have the support of several europeans notably the french aboul gheit will also seek us support or at least not to actively oppose the candidacy of farouq hosny as the next director general of unesco the us informed him last year that we could not support the candidacy and urged egypt to put forward another name abould gheit will argue hosnys merits for facing down the islamic extremists who want to narrow the space in egypt for artistic expression us objections have been to statements hosny has made that israel had culture it stole cultural ideas from others and claimed them as its own and other objectionable remarks if we plan to derail the hosny candidacy we must provide credible alternate preferably an arab andor muslim scobey
