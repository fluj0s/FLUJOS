integration and reinforcement capabilities with the new member states17 the european security act states that the administration must not give any state or international organization veto or right f review in nato decisionmaking the founding act establishes permanent joint council between nato and russia to undertake consultations on m atters of mutual interest such as peacekeeping nuclear and biological weapons proliferation terrorism and drugs but states that th consultati ons will not extend to internal matters of either nato nato member s states or russia at the april 1997 senate armed services committee hearing secretary of state albright told senator mccain that the natorussia permanent joint council would not be decisionmaking forum and that russia would have influence over issues such as natos defense posture he asked whether moscow would be obligated to discuss in the council such issues as russias evolving union with belarus its policies towards the baltic states or the deployment of russia n peacekeeping forces in the caucuses secretary albright responded that such issues are discussed bilaterally with moscow and would not be addressed in the council with some exceptions the permanent joint council has met monthly sinc september 1997 nato has sought narrow agenda russia broader one fo r example russian officials have complained that they had not been

som russian concerns that nato seeks to build an aggressive defense alliance near it s borders in contrast ethnic violence and economic dislocation in central europ would raise tensions with russia and furt her the cause of those in russia who believe that moscow must play major perhaps decisive rol in determining the future of the region the outcome of the kosovo conflict may affect the future course f expansion the united states is bearing the brunt of the military effort there it i s possible that issues such as burdensharing and the need for the european allies t develop more mobile forces to fight in outofarea engagements will push enlargement off the nearterm agenda at the same time an opposing sentiment may emerge that ethnic conflicts such as the one in kosovo underscore the need for alliance expansion to accelerate the development of stability nato expansion would most likely enhance security in europe if it occurred in period when the conditions that l ed to the article v commitment to mutual defense had receded and minimal criteria for improvements in central and eastern europes defense posture were required political ly the mission of collective defense coexists uneasily with natos intention to expand to the east which russia does not perceive as defensive initiative th russian political elite continues to view enlargement as an encroachment on russias traditional sphere of influence in contrast supporters of enlargement stress natos posture as defensive alliance and underscore th right of candidate state s to seek membership in political and security institutions that enhance prospects for international stability
