divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30043environmental health and safety tradeoffs discussion of policymaking opportunities and constraints summary policymaker making decision on approving program may face the questions what are the tradeoffs what alternatives are foregone by committing resources to that program this issue s been sharpened in nvironmental health and safety policy because studies indicate that some programs are more costeffective than others suggesting that redirecting resources from less efficient to more effective programs would increase overa ll national economic welfare actually making implied tradeoffs has proved difficult however one reason is continuing controversy over methods for evaluating the risks costs and benefits of alternative programs leaving uncerta inty about exactly what would be gained and lost in tradeoff other constraints affecting tradeoffs include variations in regulatory standards among environmental health and safety statutes and political responses to nonquantifiable values such as quity legislative efforts to revise the statutes or to establish more comprehensiv reviews of tradeoffs have moved slowly two further factors constrain the ability to make tradeoff at particular time and in particular institutional context one consists of institutional structures and procedures that impose limits on possible ranges of decisions within the legislative and executive branches for example an appropriations subcommittee typically weighs spending tradeoffs only among pr ograms within its jurisdiction but not tradeoffs with programs in the jurisdiction of other subcommittees even if the programs are related similarly statutes authorizing environmental health and safety regulations may be written by separate committees leading to variations in costeffectiveness standards for protec ting the public health and environment second complicating factor occurs wh programs alternatives would require shift in who can decide on the use of the resources involved as when regulatory program is consid ered in lieu of taxsuppor ted program deciding to regulate industrial air po llutants mandates spending by industry and consumers choosing not to regulate leaves those m onies available to the industrys executives and consumers who can investspend them according to their own preferences having little control over alternative expenditures decisionmaker tends to focus on each program as selfcontained not to compare options the actual tradeoff faced by legislator or policymaker at particular time and place is constrained by institutional structur and rules and by the fact that most decisions are upordown not between pr ogram options many putative tradeoffs exist only in theoretical sense they are tradeoffs not then and there available to that policymaker making environmental hea lth and safety tradeoffs on the basis of costbenefit analyses implies restructuring decisionmaking processes but such restructuring is very difficult in itself and it is unclear whether the results would more accurately reflect the in formed preferences of the congress or the citizenry this report is unlikely to be

or health or other alternatives4 in the early 1990s the thenhead of the harvard center for risk analysis john d graham together with his student nd colleague tammy tengs went beyond the rhetoric and studied these potential tradeoffs they analyzed the cost effectiveness of 185 lifesa ving interventions incl uding for example laws regulations and building codes for which national cost and benefit estimates were available they found that these interven tions cost 214 billion per year and averted 56700 premature deaths and saved 592000 year s of life annually but there was relationship between the costeffectiveness of the interventions and their implementation tengs and gr aham concluded that if the 214 billion per year were devoted only to the most efficient interventions approximately twice as many lives and years of life could be saved altern atively they found that the nation could maintain the current level of survival benefits averting 56700 deaths per year and save 311 billion over the status quo because there ar many untapped investment opportunities that save both lives and money that is not only would we save the 214 billion that we are currently spending but another 10 billion all the while maintaining our present level of survival benefits5 graham asserted that failing to follow through on the implications of studies showing that tradeoffs could improve the co steffectiveness of h ealth environmental and safety regulations was perverse pattern of investme nt that amounts to statistical murder of american citizens6 graham concluded legislators should pass

knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing new press 2004should reexamine annual appropriations to public health and environmental agencies to determine how reallocations of dollars could offer more health protection and greater costs to the taxpayer or private sector this view has been broadly accepted among those promoting risk assessment and costbenefit analysis as ways of rationalizing regulatory activities for example summarizing volume analyzing riskbenef it tradeoffs robert w hahn longtime student of regulatory costs concluded we could save substantial number of lives and money by reallocating resources from ineffective domestic regulations to other lifesaving interventions in the unite d states or the developing world7 thus going beyond rhetoric analysts like hahn and tengs and graham see quantitative analysis of tradeoffs as practical way of achieving greater societal efficiency for health safety and environm ental protection inves tments graham in particular has been strong advocate of using risk and costbenefit assessments of tradeoffs to improve decisionmaking8 view which since 2001 he has been in position to further as adminis trator of the office of information and regulatory affairs in the white houses ffice of management and budget certainly risk assessment and costbenefit analyses of health safety and environmental policie s have advanced substantially over the past several years leading to efforts at quantifying tradeoffs to identify the most efficientleast efficient ones but legislators and other policymak ers have found it difficult to effect overt tradeoffs among environmental health and safety programs one reason for this difficulty and perhaps the one most often c ited is the perceived inadequacy of the assessments themselves problematic issues include incomplete assessment of costs and especially benefits di scounting future benefits monetization of noncommercial benefits such as health and environmental amenities the resources and time necessary to conduct analyses utilitarian bias to the technique among others9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30043crs4 but leaving aside more detailed discussion of how accurately it is possible to evaluate potential tradeoffs or how fair such tradeoffs might be this paper examines two institutional reasons why policymakers may be disinclined to make tradeoffs or may even find it impossible for even if the tradeoffs can be defined and defended difficulties in effectuating them remain one institutional barrier is the limited authority of policymakers to affect decisions across institutional boundaries for example in part because of independent decisions ma at different times by the relevant congressional committees of jurisd iction the various health safety and environmental statutes manifest differing standards of acceptable risk and differing criteria for assessing them the second barrier arises from the diverg ence in decision criteria applied by the different institutional decisionmakers invol ved in tradeoffs health safety and environmental policies can i nvolve both public financing g grants or loans and regulations that require private sector i nvestments they can involve range of federal state local and private decisi onmakers as tradeoffs change those responsible for making decisions the bases for acting or financing programs shift as well decisionmaker can rarely if ever prescribe that resources freed up by his or her not supporting an environmental protec tion program or not choosing regulatory option or more stringent option will go to more beneficial alternative these constraints that arise from institutional contexts in which legislators and other policymakers address tradeoffs both limit alternatives that can usefully be considered and push decisionmakers to make upordown casebycase decisions rather than to choose among tradeoffs typically decisionmakers only option is to approve or disapprove an action to vote for or against program or to implement or delay regulation with little power to redirect the resources to more cost effective alternative if the choice at hand is rejected institutional and structural limits on choosing among tradeoffs the rules and structures of organizations channel decisions in ways that limit the options of decisionmakers in the congress rules of procedures and committee structures can limit tradeoffs available to members in particular jurisdictional limitations affecting congressional subcommittees and committees choices and procedural requirements governing floor actions including especially the germaneness rule of the house impede treating comprehensively the many environmental health and safety statutes these procedural and structural limits play key roles in determining the availability of potential tradeoffs both among program goals and among alternatives fo r federal expenditures of treasury funds similarly procedures and the bureaucratic structure of the executive branch limit choices of administrator s and program managers appropriations for federal programs the process by which congress consid ers annual appropria tions illustrates how structure can constrain tradeoffs while th president the congress as whole eachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30043crs5 10 at many steps of congressional and admini stration decisionmaking members implicitly or explicitly tradeoff programs issues andor funding but as measured by cost benefit analyses and risk assessments such as tengs and grahams some environmental health and safety programs empirically seem relatively inefficient compared to other programs the question addressed here then is why has the purported identification of superior tradeoffs not led to changes resulting in potentia lly more efficient array of programs 11 for more details see richard munson the cardinals of capitol hill new york grove press 1993 12 the office of management and budget wh ich constructs the presidents budget is analogously split into compartments each of wh ich focuses on tradeoffs within its allotment of the full budget 13 c copeland clean water action plan budgetary initiatives crs report 98745 p 4chamber and the full committees on budget and on appropriations have the ability to view comprehensively funding prio rities and consider tradeoffs only in exceptional cases can those with comprehensive authority devote attention to the level of detail at which mo st environmental health and safety tradeoffs occur10 the house and senate appropriations committees11 each divide the total amount of funds available for discretiona ry spending among their 13 subcommittees as practical matter most tradeoffs am ong programs whether to spend dollars here or there occur within each subcommittees jurisdiction12 for example the subcommittee on the departme nt of veterans affairs va housing and urban development hud and independent agen cies has combined responsibility for va hud environmental protection agency epa national aeronautics and space administration nasa and several other independent agencies the subcommittee may make judgments on the best use of dollar within an agencys appropriation or across agencies within its domain so that epas dollars may be affected by appropriations decisions concerning hud or nasa for example but there is essentially opportunity to judge whether funds to be spent on water quality for example would be best spent by epa by the us department of agriculture or by the department of the interior since each is under the jurisdiction of different appropriations subcommittee thus the unchosen option of spending money through the usda for water pollution control is only theoretically an opportunity cost of choice to spend money on sewa ge treatment grants through epa those choosing to spend the money through epa did not have the option of spending those dollars through usda to illustrate in 1997 the administrati on proposed clean water initiative to improve and strengthen water pollution c ontrol efforts epa and usda working with other agencies develope d coordinated action plan to implement the plan the president proposed total of 568 million in increases for various water programs in the fy1999 budget however these progra ms were under the jurisdictions of five separate subcommittees of each chambers appropriations committee so there is single opportunity for making funding tr adeoffs where the several agencies are concerned eg more for usda less for epa13 in the end each subcommittee weighed its component of the plan agai nst its own priorities so each agencys program was treated parately epas programs got most of its proposed increaseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30043crs6 14 in theory either full appropriations committee could have addressed the funding comprehensively but more often w ould defer to subcommittee decisions 15 the energy daily jan 25 1994 p 4 16 david c king turf wars how congressional committees claim jurisdiction chicago university of chicago press 1997while most of usdas programs did not the coordinated action of the plan was lost14 the competition among alternatives is not just on the basis of relative costs and benefits there is also political reality in an interview about federal research and development senator bennett johnston was asked about r d tradeoffs among departments johnston observed there is research budget as such so what happens at national science foundation the national institutes of health and the department of energy are not connected to each other you know those silly scientists who said kill the ssc superconducting super collider so there would be more money for something else they did not fail economics 101 they failed freshman high school arithmetic i mean the budget pr ocess just does not work that way15 these bounded tradeoffs become explicit in floor amendments to add funds in an appropriations bill as net dollars within the bill cannot ex ceed ceiling offsetting funds must be found elsewhere in the bill for example during consideration of hr 4194 the fy1999 appr opriations bill for the departments of veterans affairs housing and urban development and independent agencies including epa and nasa an amendment was approved by the house to increase va grants to construct state extended care facilities by 21 million and offset the increase from the housing opportunities fo r persons with aids program funding an alternative amendment which was w ithdrawn would have offset the 21 million increase for va extended care facilities with decrease in space station funding thus funds originally allocated to hud aids program were traded off to va in lieu of an alternative proposal that they co from funds originally allocated to the space stati on in this way tradeoffs are typically contained within each of the 13 appropriations bills authorizations for federal programs the situation is analogous for authoriza tions of programs ie the statutes that establish their intent rules and limitations jurisdictions are divided among committees and their subcommittees for environmental health and safety statutes tradeoffs are largely determined by the statutesprograms of the subcommitteecommittee of jurisdiction16 opportunities for tradeoffs across committee jurisdictional lines can be limited especially in the house at one level legislative constraints hinder consideration of tradeoffs between regulatory impacts of programs an example is the separate jurisdictions in the house for air pollution committee on energy and commerce and water pollution committee on transportation and infrastructur at the level of choosing betweenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30043crs7 17 see steven kelman what price incentives boston auburn h ouse publishing co 1981 18 authorizing committees frequently specify nnual appropriations for program for the appropriations committees however the authoriza tion for appropriation is in effect ceiling with actual funding subject to availa ble monies and competing programs 19 the consumer product safety commission th environmental protection agency the federal aviation agency the national highwa traffic safety administration and the occupational safety and health administration 20 tengs and graham p 176policy instruments jurisdiction also has implications although most economists and many other policy analysts believe pollu tion reductions could be more efficiently achieved through economic mechanisms such as pollution taxes than through command and control regulations the latte r have been most often chosen this tradeoff is constrained in large part becau of split jurisdicti onal authorities the committees establishing pollution control programs and policies can authorize regulations but cannot levy taxes doption of pollution taxes would depend on favorable action by another committee an added step with uncertain outcome that the authorizing committee can avoid by employing regulations only17 jurisdiction can also affect choices betw een regulatory programs nd federally funded programs authorizing committees can authorize regulatory programs themselves but when they authorize federally funde d programs the final funding decisions reside with the appropriations committees whose priorities on such programs may differ from the authorizing committees priorities18 one way authorizing committees have effected their view of the appropriate funding prio rity for their programs is to establish entitlement programs which are not subject to annual appropriations tengs and graham tried to take institutional constrai nts into account in their assessment of costeffective alternatives they analyzed savings achievable if five government agencies19 each independently invested its regulatory efforts most cost effectively the analysis examined 134 ag ency rules that result in about 411 billion spent per year by those regulated and sa ve 94000 lifeyears in the analysis the marginal cost per lifeyear saved by each agencys regulations varies from 1510000 for the consumer product safety commission to 11300 for the national highway traffic safety administration but the more costeffective application of those dollars within each agencys regulatory aut horities would mean that the 411 billion in resource consumption would n early double the lifeyears saved to about 18000020 but even this agencybyagency assessm ent of tradeoffs does not fully reflect the limitations on tradeoffs especially for epa epas authorities derive from over dozen statutes jurisdiction over th statutes is divided among several committees in the house while jurisdiction over environmental laws is considerably more concentrated

lead to multiple referral to other committees for consideration of those provisions finally some programs have elements that may be affected by separate legislative enactments such as mass transit programs under transportation legi slation having consequences for clean air act programs tradeoffs are subject to separate legislative panels one result is that each act containing regulatory programs has its own criteria for decisions on setting standards cleanup etc with strong leadership ne gotiations may lead to crosscommittee deals to coordinate program au thorities but this is the exception not the rule thus both legislators and epa offici als have limited opport unities to compare and make consistent standards and decision criteria among statutes the resulting fragmented regulatory structure precludes epa from proceeding with many tradeoffs and from weighing the costs and benefits decisions under different authorities on thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30043crs9 21 concluding that coordinate d decisions among the programs can scarcely be achieved without changes in the authorizing statutes and their diverse standards for decisionmaking some analysts have proposed combining ep as diverse statutory authorities into one comprehensive organic act this idea wa s explored in integrated pollution control symposium but while the contributors raised the issue of epas structure in constraining consistent decisions across media they did not consider the implications of the committee structure of the congress the multip committee jurisdictions make integrating risk reductions as envisioned by an epa organ ic act difficult see frances h irwin an integrated framework for preventing pollution and protecting the environment and david clarke chasing rainbow s is an integrated statute the pot of gold for environmental policy environmental law vol 22 1 1992 176 and 281300 22 eg in the setting of national ambient air quality standards decision by

the ensuing discussion see pp 246265 24 for example they proposed that risk trad eoff analysis be required at some stage of the legislative process it would be conducted by st aff of relevant committee or by one of the congressional support agencies see also timur kuran and cass r sunstein availability cascades and risk regulation stanford law review vol 51 april 1999 p 752 for proposal that congress create congressional risk regulation committee that would be continuedsame scales hence at least for epa tengs and grahams analysis showing that regulatory actions could be more cost effective appears to be more conceptual and hortatory than implementable epa has some power to comprehensively assess the effectiveness of its programs but the exis ting statutory patchwork that shapes epas administrative structure21 goes far to explain the variability in the costeffectiveness of its many programs at least as measur ed by available costbenefit analyses and risk assessments coordinating or centralizing decisionmaking for tradeoffs both the congress and the white house ve tried to bring more coherence and rigor to the regulatory decisionmaking series of executive orders over the past 20 years have led to proce ss for assessing the impacts of regulatory proposals most recently president clintons eo 12866 w ith new implementing guidelines issued by the george w bush administration congress has sought with mixed success to impose risk assessment and costbenefit analysis requirements on the regulatory agencies and to provide some centralized oversight of the process the unfunded mandates reform act pl 104 4 requires agencies to pr epare costbenefit analyses for regulations costing 100 million or more in effect codifying part of eo 12866 however in some cases statutory language prohibits the consideration of costs in regulatory decisions22 agencybyagency attention to the effectiveness of regulations has been heightened by the government performance

produce priorities this committee would have authority over both substantive statutes and the appropriations process in the 105th congress legislation hr 1704 wa s proposed in the house that would have created congressional office to provide the committee on government reform and oversight information that will assist the co mmittee in the discharge of all matters within its jurisdiction including information with resp ect to its jurisdiction over authorization and oversight of the office of information and re gulatory affairs of the office of management and budget this office would also have taken over congressional review of agency rulemaking and prepared an annual report on an estimate of the total costs and benefits of all existing federal regulations 25 for example they argued for the interpre tation that even for statutes that forbid considerations of cost that risk tradeoff assessments should be required under these laws because risk tradeoffs are part of the effectiven ess of the rule in atta ining its riskreduction goals rather than financial cost of the ru they also suggested that those who are disadvantaged when an agency fails to consid er tradeoffs in promulgating rule be given standing to challenge such agency action 26 press releases of the office of information and regulatory affairs provide partial scorecard of actions see

washingt on dc 2003and the executive branch the last have taken on particular salience since graham was appointed by president george w bu sh to head up the office of information and regulatory affairs of the ffice of management and budget for the executive branch wiener and graham suggested more forceful implementation by the office of information and regulatory affairs of the executive orders requiring cost and risk analysis eo 12866 they noted that more radical reform would be to reorganize the executive branch to integrate the array of health and environmental protection agencies further they observed that centralized oversight unit for risk assessments perhap s located in the white house or the us public health service c ould enhance coordination graham has focused particularly on making more transparent the regulatory decisionmaking process on ensuring the soundness of the science underlying decisions and more rigorous co st and risk benefit analyses26 these are essential parts of making not only better decisions but also could lead to consciously made tradeoffs so far however there is example of an explicit practical tradeoff across programs on the basis of the costeff ectiveness of lives saved even with the overarching authority of the white house be hind graham in his role as director of the office of information and regulatory affairs his efforts are constrained by institutional boundaries nd statutory dictates despite executive orders and legislated requirements for costbenefit studies advances in evaluating potential tradeo ffs have not resolved the issue of how requiring risk assessment and costbenefit an alysis can be applied coherently acrosshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30043crs11 27 this was most recently evident in the di fficulties experienced by the house and senate as they realigned responsibilities in order to address the newly created department of homeland security 28 congress recognizes these difficulties and at times has tried to overcome them for example noting the difficulties that congre ss experienced in changing governmental structures which shifted member and committee responsibilities congress granted the president limited authority to reorganize the government 98 stat 3192 when exercised this power which existed during much of the middle of the 20th century often created conflict between the president and the congre ss and ultimately the authority was allowed to lapse see louis fischer and ronald c moe presidential reorganization authority is it worth the cost political science quarterly vol 96 summer 1981 pp 301318the many environmental h ealth and safety programs given the differences among the statutes the decision to diminish resources and effort in one area is usually separate from decision and authority to pply those or related resources and effort in another area reconstituting congressional andor administrative structures to integrate risk reduction so that progra ms now handled more or less independently would go onto the same table for possibl tradeoffs would imply legislators reallocating their aut horities and responsibilities27 this is rare undertaking of uncertain outcome28 federal decision criteria state and local choices and private sector preferences when tradeoffs change decisionmakers controlling resources in choosing among alternative taxsuppor ted federal programs eg grants superfund cleanups federal d ecisionmakers decide where to direct resources from monies they control in choosing among alternative federal environmental health and safety regulatory programs federal decisionm akers mandate expenditures by state and local governments the private sect or andor individuals it can be tempting to pose tradeoffs across these two situa tions between fede rally funded programs and federal regulatory programs thus among the examples cited in the preface immunization infant morta lity and care for poor pregnant women are rhetorically proposed as tradeoffs against clean air mammograms agains t stricter air regulations smokingcessation education of pregnant women against groundwater cleanup and housing or space or health against envi ronmental protection the putative tradeoffs counterpose public programs paid for prima rily by federal s ometimes state tax dollars with environmenta l protection programs paid for primarily by dollars mandated to be spent by individuals state and local governments andor the private business sector the conceptual commingling of federa lly funded programs and of federal regulatory mandates ignores fundamental obstacle to making tradeoffs this obstacle arises from the distinct identities and interests between those who establish the mandate and those who control the us of the money necessary to meet the mandate in the case of tradeoffs among established federally funded programs the decisionmaker for spending monies remains the same for selected alternatives thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30043crs12 appropriator and ultimate ly congress if the congress decides not to spend the money on option it can spend it on option b subject to institutional constraints in the case of tradeoffs between fede rally funded progra ms and regulatory programs or between regulatory programs however the legislative decisionmaker mandating the program and th appropriator ultimately re sponsible for expenditures to meet regulations are separated and the administrator responsible for drafting regulations may find his or her options c onstrained not only by the statutes and by funding but also by explicit congressional directions which can include statutory authorizing language specifying deadlines and the inclusion or exclusion of certain options appropriations language that ear marks or withholds monies for certain options and report language that gives guidance that even if not binding may have considerable sway finally the party which must meet health safety or environmental regulation has to consider the consequences for the business and owners or stockholders ach decisionmaker thus faces set of incentives and options constrained by the institutional context as result the alternative of spending tax monies on federal program versus establishing regulatory program not onl trades off program benefits but also changes the payer who decides on the alternative use of the dollars from the different settings each decisionm aker can be expected to employ different criteria in judging the return on the use of the m onies federal program decisionmaker presumably makes tradeoffs on the basis pr imarily of national va lues and needs state or local program decisionmaker presumably makes tradeoffs on the basis primarily of state or local values and needs private sector business decisionmaker presumably bases tradeoffs primarily on profit and loss cons iderations and an individual presumably bases tradeoffs on personal needs and preferences these differences are shown in table 2 to propose tradeoffs between an envi ronmental regulation and potential alternative federal program disregards the different circumstances of the decisionmakers involved for the regula tory mandate the federal decisionmaker knows what purpose the dollars will be spent on if the federal decisionmaker decides not to impose that mandate those dollars remain available to the statelocal private sector or individual decisionmaker to sp end if the regulatory mandate is not imposed or is rescinded as not costeffective there is little reason to assume that the statelocal private sector or individual decisionmaker controlling those dollars will view an alternative public service program as preferred destination for the monies freed up as practical matter the alte rnative to specific federal regulatory mandate is some unknown op tions on which other decisionmakers responding to other values or pursuing other goals will spend those unmandated dollars it is certainly possible some would say highly likely even indisputable that the some portion of dollars spent to meet federal requireme nts could be better spent otherwise by state

on health if regulations lead to slower economic growth the lower income levels imply there will be statistical loss of life isolating this tradeoff has proven highly problematic the idea of

robert w hahn ed risks costs and lives saved getting better results from regulation washington dc the aei press 1996 pp 159162what seems clear is that even if state and local corporate or private investments in alternatives to pollution control mandates would contribute equally or even more to net national welfare there is little reason to assume the alternatives would be selected from more costeffective environmen tal health or safety programs such as immunization education or car for poor pregnant women as thomas mcgarity student of th legal implications of regulations has noted even under the highly contestable assump tion that costbenefit criterion would eliminate waste vehicle exists for channeling the savings to the most deserving social programs the savings will invariably go to the regulatees who may or may not spend them on activities that benefit society absent some governmental vehicle for directing how regulated entities spend the resources saved by less stringent regulation they will devote resources to things that make their shareholders happy31 the other side of the argument that m oney necessary to meet regulations could be spent more effectively on alternatives32 is that the beneficiaries of regulation also have more money to spend for example if because of an air pollution regulation people avoid adverse health effects an monies that would have been spent on consequent visits to doctors or hospitals are saved and av ailable for alternative uses but again even if these beneficiaries can be identified how they will use the savings is unknown in short there are tradeoffs for each dollar paid out to abate and control pollution but it is not 1 for pollution control versus 1 for some comparable or superior public good rather it is 1 for pollution control on the one hand or 1 for an unknown purpose on the other with the probab ility that the criterion for deciding on how otherwise to spend the money will not be national welfare which is not to say that the alternative expenditure would necessarily fail to equally or better serve national wellbeing one just cannot know as practical matter it is not usually possible to specify

may well be either outside his or her purview or it may be completely open ended in the realm of the marketplace the debate over enactment of the clean air act amendments of 1990 was not over whether the 21 billion tab37 should be spent on clean air or on immunization infant mortality care for poor pregnant women or something else it was over whether to re quire 21 billion to be spent on clean air or more or less or not at all38 similarly the mid1990s bate over proposed nationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30043crs16 38 continued emerged that the bill could impose some 25 billion in costs per year after 2000 some legislators argued that this was too much nd others that this was not enough but as practical matter the majority accepted this as reasonable pricetag for the program given the difficulties in assessing costs and benefits it is not surprising that estimates of costs of the legislation ranged greatly from the low 20s to 90 billion dollars per year eh pechan associates clean

choice is basically upordown and moreorless not on tradeoffs with other programs to turn down the amendment or defer the regu lation does not mean more co steffective environmental health or safety alternatives will take its place it is question of following through or starting the policy process anew with choices tending be upordown and limited only to alternatives germane within re levant jurisdictiona l boundaries proponents of environmental health and safety initiatives are loathe to forego or reduce any program even if its costeffectiveness is questionable because they so seldom can ensure reinvestment of an saved resources in more costeffective alternatives only in the abstract then is any and every alternative an opportunity cost of each federal dollar spent and of every federa l regulation imposing costs in reality the actual tradeoff faced by policymak er at particular time and place subcommittee committee or the floor of congress or commission or agency is effectively limited by institutional structures and rules and by the incommensurable criteria brought by different decisionmakers who would ultimately decide on the actual alternatives for spending any dollars the tradeoffs make available the question how much of this could you buy if one didnt impose regulation x can therefore be an swered in two divergent ways one way is to take an estimated cost of regulation x and divide by the unit cost of this resulting in the equivalent number of mammograms inoculations or whatever that number is information th at may help to give perspective on the magnitude of the cost of regulation x but at the same time it may give sense that tradeoff is feasible when it is not the second way of answering the question is to put the compared costs into context examining whether th monies involved in x and this are really fungible whether those expenditures are truly altern atives depends on the options posed the decisionmakers involved and th institutiona l setting there may be definite options as when an appropriations subcommittee allocates dollars among programs in itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30043crs17 jurisdiction but in other cases the tradeo ff may be between an intended outcome and the nebulous consequence of not opting for that outcome putting the label statistical murder on the failure to make tradeoffs is rhetorically powerful connoting wilful choice to choose less pr otective or more costly option but in reality legislators and administrators rarely if ever are in position to select among the implied options as they authorize fund and implement health safety and regulatory programs the problem is depicted in figure 1 putative tradeoffs among environmental health and safety expenditures presume that all programs repres ented by cones are on the table as shown in figure 1a wh ere the sizes of the cones reflect potential costeffectiveness but the voting legislat or typically has onl one program on the table at time the result of deliberate formal process of agenda setting as shown in figure 1b and the administrator of several programs generally finds each program on separate table with the boundaries of each defi ned by separate statute that gives little or authority to an administrator to compare and reallocate resources across them as illustrated in figure 1c in the end the underlying i ssue of environmental health and safety cost effectiveness is how to foster decision pro cesses and structures that enable tradeoffs that reflect the informed preferences of the citizenry evidence indicates that programs vary in costeffectiveness however given that there is more to comparing programs than just costs one could argue that the current environmental health and safety program mix the result of the present decisionmaking structure may in fact reflect citizen preferences where tradeoffs would appear to result in more consistent costeffective protection of health safety or the environment better information may in the short run contribute to improved decisions in llocating resources but legislators and administrators options are limited there is big gap between identifying potential tradeoff and being able to make the tradeoff the stakes are high for winners and losers especially for those who gain or lose authority to make decisions about expenditures in the longrun better information about desirable tradeoffs may suggest realignments of decision structures leading to different complex and difficult set of institutional decisions in the meantime if an existing or proposed program is identified as insufficiently costeffective and therefore appropriate for trading off there is rarely any way to actually terminate it while concomitantly creating more costeffective one the most likely result of tradeoff would be either to kill one program without gaining the more costeffective alte rnative or to create new more cost effective program while also maintaining the program with inferior cost effectiveness for either option there is stakeholder with natural resistance depending on whether one is more c oncerned about costs or benefitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30043crs18 figure
