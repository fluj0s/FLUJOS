for members of the senate and house of representatives first 110th congresses introduction during the early history of congress turnover in membership was frequent and resignations were commonplace alt hough the constitution provides that us senators serve for term of six years it was not until the 50th congress 18871889 that the average tenure of senators reached six years while the average service of members of the house began to exceed their twoyear term by the fourth congress 17951797 it did not rise bove four years until the 57th congress 19011903 according to political scientist randall ripley in the premodern congress members came and went rapidly there were few senior members life in washington was not pleasant congress did not seem very important and the unstable party situation often made reelecti on difficult to achieve1 political scientist h douglas price wrote that the distinguished senators of the 1st congress set the early career pattern for that chamber they fled the capitol almost as fast as humanly possible car eer data on the early senate is morass of resignations shortterm appointees ective replacements there are notable careers in terms of service2 according to price the lack of incentives for members to retain their seats explains the high turnover in those early years of the house power was fluid in the house the speaker controlled committee appointments there was frequent change in party control and seniority influence3 price also wrote that the congress elected in 1900 was the first in american history in which new members accounted for less th an 30 of the membership4 after the 1880s circumstances changed nd the rise of careerism in congress began in the period from 189019105 the strengthening of the party system

leve l of importance and the demonstration by congress after lincolns death that it intended to play more assertive role in government contributed to many members desire to remain in congress6 subsequently legislative careers becam common and the concept of the c itizen legislator became thing of the past7 some political scientists and others have attributed the demise of the citizen legislator and the stabilization of congressional membership to 1 the importance of the seniority system 2 increased oppor tunities for junior members 3 the ease of traveling between washington dc and home states and dist ricts 4 senior members involvement and ccess in promoting legislative agendas and 5 the advantages of incumbency that allow members to generate publicity serve constituents and receive support in organizi ng their offices and forming agendas that help them be effective legislators8 in recent years the fluctuations in congressional service averages cannot be attributed to any
