states oas is the oldest regional organization in the world the oas evolved from series of interamerican conferences that began in the 1820s and led to the creation of its pred ecessor the pan amer ican uni on in 1910 in 1948 following hemispheric cooperation dur ing world war ii the charter of the organization of american states was signed in bogota colombia by the united states and 20 latin american nations during its first decades the oas dealt primarily with border disputes and collective security si nce the 1960s the oas has evolved through four amendments to its charter into political organization of 35 western hemisphere states that have pledged to promote democracy advance human rights preserve peace andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22095crs2 1 all 35 countries in the

caused by poverty drugs and corruption1 during the cold war the united states often pursued its primary interest in latin america preventing the spread of communism in unilateral manner at the same time many latin american countries were ru led by military dictatorships by the 1980s the oas was widely perceived as weak institution that was mired in dissent and inaction as few of its member states were interested in multilateral efforts on behalf of democracy2 by 1990 the cold war had ended and the vast majority of oas member states had returned to democratic rule as result of new shared commitment to democracy the oas developed mechanisms that would enable it to take action to protect democracy in troubled states some praised the unpreced ented multilateral effort s that have been undertaken by the oas to counter antidemocratic velopments in the region especially under the leadership of secretary general cesar gaviria 19942004 others have noted that while the oas rapidly responded to seve ral crises in the early 1990s recent practice since 1997 points to weakened commitment to take action in time ly and wellplanned manner still others note that oas efforts have often been hampered by limited resources and by an ongoing tension between the need for collective action and the need to respect state sovereignty3 organization the governing body of the oas is the general assembly which convenes the foreign ministers of all member states annually to make consensus decisions on the structure funding and guiding prior ities of the organization the last regular meeting of the oas general ssembly was held in ft lauderdale florida in june 2005 the permanent council which is composed of ambassadors appointed by the member states meets regularly at oas headquarters in washington dc to direct its ongoing actions the chairmanship of the permanent council rotates every three months and each member state has an equal vote in the deci sions of the council another council of the oas the interamerican council for integral development is charged with fighting poverty and promoting economic development two of the other bodies that currently report directly to the oas general assembly are the interamerican juridical committee and the interamerican commission on human rights while the general assembly and the permanent council are political bodies that set broad priorities for the oas the general secretariat implements the ongoing programs and policies of the organization the general secretariat is led by the secretary

within the general secretariat focus on issue areas such as democracy and political affairs human rights integral development and security in october 2004 thensecretary ge neral rodriguez issued an executive order which changed the structure of the general secretariat the structural reforms sought to streamline the organizations functioning and better allocat its limited resources budget and staff into priority areas that fu lfill the oas mission two entities of particular interest to the us government the interamerican drug abuse control commission cicad and the interamerican committee against terrorism cicte retained some autonomy although they are now under the department of mu ltinational security funding the oas budget consists of regular fund as well as specific funds coming from voluntary country contributions for special programs the regular fund supports the general secretar iat and is financed by country quotas as result of financial difficulties incurred by many member states and reluctance to increase quotas the regular fund has remained at approximately 736 million for the past ten years the united states contributes roughly 59 of the regular fund for

employees likely to retire in the coming year since 1997 the oas has raised specific funds for certain projects and programs in order to supplement gaps in its regular fund it raised more than 200 million in specific funds between 2000 and 2004 the primary benefi ciaries of those funds include the unit for the promotion of democracy the secretariat for conferences and meetings cicad and the unit for sustainable development nd environment for example in january 2004 the oas established mission of accompaniment to the peace process in colombia secretary general insulza recently called on member countries to contribute extra funding so that the annual budget of that mission could reach some 10 million the united states has made substantia l contributions to few specific funds developed by the oas through fore ign operations appropriations the oas fund for strengthening democracy supports oas efforts to prom ote democracy and the inter american democratic charte r throughout the

state and to act to resolve that conflict in 1992 the oas ratified the washington protocol to the oas charter becoming the first regional political organization to allow suspension of member state in the event that its democratically elected government is overthrown by force the oas has yet to invoke the washington protocol before resolution 1080 was supers eded in 2001 the oas limited its use to four instances in which either military coup selfcoup by an ected president or severe civilmilitary crisis occurred some observers have criticized the oass failure to invoke resolution 1080 more frequently as in the cas of successful coup against jamil mahuad in ecuador in 2000 ot hers have noted that even in cases when the oas did act under resolution 1080 such as paraguay in 1996 its layed

in ap ril 2002 the iadc was invoked when the oas condemned the alteration of the constitutional order in venezuela that temporarily forced president chavez from power9 although it was utilized in the

summits has focused on different topic affording leaders unique opportunity to discuss issues of common concern and develop initiatives to resolve them nevertheless due to limited funding given to those initiatives or implementing agencies to carry them out some observers contend that summit in itiatives have become unfunded mandates given to the oas and the interamerican development bank11
