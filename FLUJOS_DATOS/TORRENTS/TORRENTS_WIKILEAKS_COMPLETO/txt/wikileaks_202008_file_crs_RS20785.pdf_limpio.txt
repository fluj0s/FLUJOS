were equally divided with overall committee budgets to remain within historic levels4 and discharging measures or matters if measure or nomination was not reported because of tie vote in committee the majority or minority leader after consultation with committee leaders could move to discharge the committee from further consideration of such measure or nomination this discharge motion could be deba ted for four hours equally divided and controlled by the majority and minority leaders after the expiration or yielding back of time the senate would vote on the discharge motion without any intervening action motion or debate and if the committee were discharged by majority vote the measure or matter would be placed on the appropriate senate calendar to await further parliamentary actions agenda control and cloture the agreement prohibited cloture motion from being filed on any amendable item of business during the first 12 hours in which it is debated required both party leaders to seek to attain an equal balance of the interests of the two parties in scheduling and considering senate legislative and executive business and noted that the motion to proceed to any

crs report 98853 the amending process in the senate 7 sen trent lott remarks in the senate congressional record daily edition vol 147 jan 8 2001 p s54supplemental colloquy january 8 2001 on january 8 2001 the provisions of sre s 8 were further clarified and other procedures relating to the powersharing ag reement were announced senator harry reid dnv the assistant democratic floor leader received unanimous consent to enter printed colloquy between senato rs daschle and lott into the congressional record and to direct that the permanent congressional record be corrected to provide for its inclusion with the resolution when it passed the senate last friday5 in addition to summarizing the provisions of sres 8 the colloquy covered severa l additional issues filling the amendment tree limits on floor leaders in perhaps the most significant announcement the two lead ers pledged to refrain from using their preferential rights of recognition to fill th amendment tree in an effort to block consideration of c ontroversial issues6 senator lott on behalf of both leaders declared the policy in the written colloquy it is our intention that the senate have full and vigorous debates in this 107th congress and that the right of all senators to have their amendments considered will be honored we have therefore jointly agre ed that neither leader nor their designees in the absence of the leader will offer c onsecutive amendments to fill the amendment tree so as to deprive either side of the right to offer an amendment we both agree that nothing in this resolution or colloquy limits the majority leaders right to amend nonrelevant amendment nor does it limit the s ponsor of that nonrelevant amendment from responding with further amendment after the majority leaders amendment or amendments are disposed of7 minority senators as presiding officers the party leaders agreed that minority party senators would be permitted to serve as presiding officers of the senate this differed from the usual senate practice under which onl majority party senators serve as temporary presiding officers party access to space in the capitol the colloquy furthe r specified that both parties would have equal access to common space in the capitol complex for purposes of holding meetings press conferences nd other events this supplemented the provisions in sres 8 guaranteeing the minority equal committee office spacehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20785crs5 8 sen trent lott remarks in the senate congressional record daily edition vol 147 jan 5 2001 p s34 9 andrew taylor senate gop to share power cq weekly vol 59 jan 6 2001 p 22 10 for more information on the procedures for arra nging to go to conference in the senate see crs report rs20454 going to conference in the senate 11 sen trent lott remarks in senate congressional record daily edition vol 147 jan 8 2001 p s54 12 more specifically sections 305c2 and 310 e1 of the budget act preclude extended debate on the motions necessary to send measure to conferenceadditional issues the agreement embodied in sres 8 was not comprehensive it did not address many parliamentary issues as senator lott noted in floor remarks it covered the issues on which the party leaders were able to reach agreement in instance after instance senator daschle and i discusse d points argued about points when we could not come to agreement we said we would deal with the rules as they are so we got it down to what really matters8 for example one issue that was not resolved was conference committee composition although the agreement specifi ed equal party strength on the senates standing special and joint committees it did not specify equal party strength on conference delegations some senate republicans were insistent that majority of senate conferees be republicans reflecting the tiebreaking vote of vice president cheney available to approve any conference compromise as one republican senator noted i think its absolutely our position and my position that we have to control the conferences9 the parliamentary stages though which the senate passes to get to conference are usually handled by unanimous consent this particularly includes granting authority to the presiding officer to appoint confer ees based on the recommendations of the committee and floor leaders if objection is raised to granting this authority senate conferees are to be elected by amendable motion debatable under the normal rules of the senate10 senator lott alluded to this possibility in the printed colloquy of january 8 with respect to the ratios of members on conferences we both understand that under previous senate practices those ratios are suggested by the majority party and if not acceptable by the minority party their right to amend and debate is in order the intention of this resolution is not to lter that practice and this resolution does not serve to set into motion any action that would alter that practice in any way11 the senate did not name c onferees through its traditional mechanisms during the powersharing period of the 107th congress during that time the senate agreed to send only two measures to conference committee the budget resolution and the reconciliation bill but it should be noted that conference pr ocedures on these measures are governed in part by the budget act12 in both of these cases majority of the conferees were republicanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20785crs6 conclusion on may 24 2001 senator james jeffords announced his intention to leave the republican party to become an independent and to caucus with the senate democrats with senator jeffordss announcement the mocrats held numerical edge in the senate on june 5 2001 senator jeffords t with senate democrats at their weekly conference meeting on june 6 the senate convened with the democrats as the acknowledged senate majority party the powersharing agreement in effect in the senate from january to june of 2001 was an experiment it differed from many established practices of the senate the agreement was not comprehensive and new issues came before the senate that had to be resolved by informal agreements unanimous consent negotiations or other means the success of any senate organiza tional settlement depe nds in part upon its adaptability and that of its members to changing circumstances
