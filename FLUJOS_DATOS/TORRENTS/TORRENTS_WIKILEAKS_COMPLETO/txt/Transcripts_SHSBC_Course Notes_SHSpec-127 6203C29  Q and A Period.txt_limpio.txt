6203c29 shspec127 q and period when you get ta knob alternating between two different locations it is circulation between two masses this is similar to stage four needle but on the ta it is the case shifting between two valences this is not the same as ta motion it is sudden shift not gradual change if running cch turns on somatic you run it until the somatic turns off if it is not matter of somatics run cchs until the pc can do them all willingly and well run out gross changes somatics are the most gross little objections and raggedness are less gross if you cant detect the somatic by physical manifestations it doesnt exist for the purposes of cchs too many pcs dramatize victims and make up somatics etc if you wanted the greatest possible gain and the least possible blow on pcs who were pretty sensible anyway you would do ruds on the meter along with cchs this makes different breed of cchs when it is done this way you would ease up any tendency to blow and it would make it easier for the pc to stay in session on many cases you cant do ruds but if the pc is fairly upscale it would probably go better with ruds put in details on running 3dxx the pc is his terminal the terminal has pain on it and it is always facing outwards against enemies so you give him an enemy an enemy an enemy and he will get dizzy from too many enemies but on the pain phenomenon he is simply being someone else you wont get 3dxx turning on constant pain if the pc has the same pain grief or fights you for 20 minutes that is change but the pain must be something more than the pcs statement about it you must see some physical manifestation since cchs are nonverbal if the same grief or whatever has gone on for 20 minutes with change it wont just run out so that is why it is ok to leave it why the pain is on the pcs terminal it is just an observation however it doesnt seem too unreasonable that he should get pain as himself if he has created pain he will feel it as himself as the motivator that is highly probable you can run an oppterm flat sometimes and the pc will feel better the terminal will still be live on cchs 3 and 4 you handle pc originations but only out of courtesy you dont really care about how he says he is feeling because what you are running off can cause the pc to say the damnedest things most of them lies it runs out all sorts of countercreates verbal and nonverbal they will throw you all sorts of red herrings pc running cchs never originates he only dramatizes you dont have to get into games condition with the pc just run the process as an rfactor for cchs you can and should tell the pc what you are doing and why you are doing it as sort of rudiment to start the session try to get the pcs agreement before the session starts and then you run the session anyway after session you can talk about the cchs provided you dont evaluate for him if the pc wants to talk about them when cch session goes into screaming fits it is probable that the rfactor could have been established better you can tell the pc anything like its drill im gonna do it lets see if you can do it etc dramatizations on cchs are closely connected to oppterms and terminals but nothing can be read out of it the worst the pc is sitting in will discharge because circuit is unable to 1 duplicate 2 have or 3 be controlled so giving someone control communication and havingness inevitably gets them into 3dxx items that are banging in and out usually there will be one major circuit that tries to discharge via the pcs dramatization the circuit he is sitting in cchs knock out the notis on masses he is sitting in and he will see them for the first time weird things show up from the vanishment of the notis heavy masses he has never had before somatics he hasnt felt etc he will move on the track in the valence he is in to more comfortable position cchs knock out notis you get an is the phenomena you see with the pc is the valence the phenomena that occur around the pc is the oppterm cchs also familiarize the pc with phenomena that he will encounter later on in 3dxx sensation that which is produced by reason of other beingness and dislocations of space pain alteration of form pain is produced by direct contact between the thetan and an identity fain is heat cold electrical shock combined the pc is always more directly connected with the terminal than the oppterm and thus feels pain he must be touching the mass with the idea that he is it in order to feel pain one of the biggest mistakes someone can make is to regard his body as self
