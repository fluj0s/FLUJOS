forwarded to the house which votes on simple resolu tions officially making the assignments individual member rights democratic caucus rules guarantee each democratic member assignment to either an exclusive or nonexclusive committee furt her if members regional representative on the democratic steering committee refuses to nominate the member to the committee of his or her choice the member may ensure consideration by sending letter signed by half of his state delegation to the chair of the steering committee in addition caucus rules provide for separate vote by the entire caucus on particular steering committee recommendations if vote is requested by 10 or more members republican conference rules do not contain similar provisions
