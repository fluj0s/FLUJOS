september 11 2001 and the subsequent anthrax mailings have sensitized the nation to acts of domestic terror the confirmation of terrorist inte rest in weapons of mass struction and the vulnerability of the united states to such attack have highlighted the potential that these weapons may be used as weapons of terror the framework of weapons of mass destruction wmd includes chemical biol ogical and toxin weapons chemical biological and toxin weapons can produce mass casualties if effectively disseminated but ve varying and different ffects chemical weapons predominantly manmade che micals require the largest amounts of material to be effective and cause their effects in minutes to hours biological weapons made of naturally occurring pathogens require the least material to be effective but generally have an incubation period of several days before symptoms show themselves toxin weapons such as ricin che mical agents formed by bi ological processes are intermediate between the two in both amount and timescale trea tment protocols for chemical biological and toxin weapons va ry by agent ranging from weapons with effective treatment and prophylaxis to weapons wh ich have known cure nor protection chemical biological and toxin weapons pose additional concerns beyond mass casualties these weapons may contamin ate the area in which they are used emergency vehicles and first

may lead to death the effects from chemical weapons may occur very quickly after exposure on the order of minutes to hours2 biological weapons are pathogens that cause disease and illness in infected humans because the pathogens multiply within the victim small initial amount of pathogen is sufficient to cause infec tion as consequen ce biological weapons require much less material than chemical weapons to produce equivalent casualties and generally take longer to produce effects biologi cal weapons include diseases that are primarily incapacitating such as q fe ver as well as those that are lethal such as smallpox some biological weapons are contagious pathogens such as smallpox and have the potential to spread the effects of an attack by traveling from victim to victim the symptoms from biological weapon attack would require some time to develop so covert biological attack mig ht not be recognized for several days3 toxin weapons are primar ily illnessinducing chemicals formed from living creatures such as bacteria fungi plants and animals toxins range in effect from disabling to acutely toxic the most deadly compound currently known botulinum toxin is bacterial toxin toxins are mo re potent than chemical weapons requiring less material to produce equi valent casualties but they are not selfreproducing so more material is required than for biological weapon symptoms from toxin exposure typically occur on timescale intermediate between chemical and biological weapons generally appear ing over the course of several hours4 terrorist development of ch emical biological

chemical biological and toxin weapons also differ in their medical treatment and the availability of effective prophylaxis11 chemical weapons with their quick acting effects must be treated as promptly as possible because of the large range of potential effects caused by chemical w eapons there is universal treatment for chemical weapon exposure12 exposure to nerve agents can be directly

event is delayed some viruse s targeted as biological weapons have effective prophylaxis in the form of v accines while others reportedly respond to antiviral drugs13 however some potential biol ogical weapons lack prophylaxis treatment or cure additi onally biological weapons can be engineered with some effort in laboratory to be resi stant to specific countermeasures treatment of injuries sustained from to xin weapons may be more complicated antitoxins and toxoid vaccines can be developed against toxin weapons but the process for doing so is involved and timecons uming consequently stores of these medicines are limited in scope14 and large number of to xin weapon casualties could exhaust local supplies some toxins such as botulinum toxin cause death by paralyzing the muscles used for breathing these toxins can be treated with supportive care through artificial ventila tion and other means until the patients recover for bioterror events it is difficult to project the likely treatment success rate treatment of chemical biological and to xin weapons relies on providing medication within relatively narrow time window if medication is not pr ovided fairly quickly after exposure or the development of symptoms depending on the weapon full recovery is unlikely potential impacts of chemical biological and toxin weapons by their nature terrorist events are

inflict great numbers of casualties may cause terrorists to view che mical or biological weapons as viable means for promoting an agenda of terror and destruction the impact of these weapons may be magnif ied by other factors the use of chemical biol ogical or toxin weapons in terror attacks could complicate emergency response due to the n eed to establish special care facilities for the victims such as decontamination areas and the need to protect first responders from the weapons effects if first re sponders became victims through inadequate personal protective equipment or contamination of emer gency vehicles increased casualties and greater social disruption could result furthermore chemical biological and toxin weapons may produce wide array of effects terrorists may believe they can select chemical biological or toxin weapons to produce specific results for certa in situations they may believe that these weapons increase their operational flexibility16 since for some chemical biological and toxin weapons there exis ts delay before symptoms develop terrorists may feel that their use will in crease the chances of successfully avoiding arrest the variety of potential effects and timing can complicate medical treatment and preparedness as it might not be readily apparent what chemical or pathogen has caused the symptoms nor what antidote will prove most effective17 the use of chemical or toxin weapons could generate di sproportionate public response because of broad public percepti on that their use is akin to poisoning according to experts there has long been fear of and antipathy towards the use of poison it is especially fri ghtening to the victim as the symptoms may seem to appear from nowhere poisons lacking an an tidote may raise concerns further as the victim perceives that there is recourse or cure available the dread generated from the inability to control the situation and oftentimes ones own bodily safety is common to victims of chemical weapons

response to the uncertainty of their medical treatment options health c onditi on and pr ognosis22 trauma associated with being victim of biological attack may itself inhibit unde rstanding and recovery from the illness23 dread may also arise in those who have not been exposed but fear that they may have these anxieties may cause common events to take on new negative meanings for example during the anthrax mailings there were many reports regarding white powders found at peoples workplaces whic h were forwarded to law enforcement authorities the vast majority were not anthrax

the heritage foundation has held briefings and provided po licy suggestions on weapons of mass destruction44 potential policy options for the 109th congress below are some policy options which may reduce the impact of chemical biological or toxin terrorist attack th include preventing terrorist attacks by increasing the difficulty of chemical biological and toxin weapon production developing countermeasures through dir ected public health funding reducing public concern by enhancing public preparedness through outreach efforts and addressing how the media reports on acts of chemi cal biological and toxin terrorism increasing production barriers barriers to chemical biological and toxinrelated terrorism within the united states may be strengthened by further legislation one option to increase such barriers would be to addre ss the development and producti on of chemical biological and toxin weapons this might entail increasing the difficulty of obtaining these weapons by decreasing the ease with whic h dualuse equipmen t is acquired either by regulating its domestic sale or throug h registering owners of such equipment through mechanism similar to that for select agents however this may have an adverse economic impact on those industries w ith legitimate need for this equipment such as the chemical pharmaceu tical and health industries45 directed public health funding one suggestion would be to continue increased fundi ng to the public health system and law enforcement in order to provide greater hospital capacity trained medical and mental health personnel in creased screening and surveillance and sufficient equipment in the case of chemical biological or toxin terrorist attack it has been suggested that continued sp ending on the order of 10 to 30 billion per year would provide sufficient depth of re sponse to reduce che mical biological or toxin attacks effectiveness46 on the other hand some contend that the risk of terrorist attack is so small that money w ould be better spent on ot her safety programs such as highway safety47httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31669crs11 48 this approach has been advocated by the ch ief scientist for advanced

50 some have suggested that the effects of chemical or biological terrorist attack are overstated and that consequently the resultin g panic may be worse than the threat itself steve connor scientists conde mn alarmist official propa ganda over bioterrorism the independent january 30 2003another option to address the threat of chemical biological and toxin weapons is through the development of new antibiotic antiviral or antitoxin medicines while many agents of concern have an acknowledged treatment many can be improved to have higher efficacy alternately further investment in new vaccines or other methods to induce immunity might provide significant deterrence to terrorist groups planning to use such weapon critic s of this approach have suggested that developing treatments for specific agen ts does not lower the overall threat of chemical biological or toxi n attacks but would rather force terrorist to choose different agent some experts urge th at new broadbased methods to develop resistance against wide variety of agents must be developed48 in the 2003 state of the union address president bush announced new program designed to increase the availa bility of countermeasures against terror agents this program called project bioshield would provide government guaranteed market for manufacturers of countermeasures which lack broader applicability49 the project bioshield act

federal govern ment may also decrease the usefulness of these weapons to terrorists the enhan ced impact relative to conventional weapons of chemical biological and toxin weapons might be decreased if the dread felt when considering their effects could be reduced50 if this enhanced impact could be successfully reduced there mig ht be less advantage to using these weapons rather than conventional weapons one possible approach for reducing the terror impact of these weapons is public outreach to convey the likely risks and re lative dangers chemical biological and toxin weapons pose compared to

understanding prior to expos ure and therefore could make rational choices regarding their situation for exam ple treatment options and regimens might already be known to victims and those victims might feel greater control over events lessening their personal anxiety as part of the centers for disease control and preventions efforts in bioterrorism preparedness communication such as community outreach and educationa l efforts are supported some contend that open deba and flow of information regarding chemical and biological terrorism threats lessens the terror aspects of these weapons52 advocates of such information flow suggest that preevent preparation and education will likely reduce casualties and minimize anxiety or panic following an attack on the other hand some have argued that an info rmational campaign while decreasing the psychological effect postexposure may increase general daytoday anxiety53 these critics argue that information not presented in the proper context may becounterproductive to attempts to reassure the public for example the efforts of the federal civil defense administration campa ign of public relati ons and educational programs to prepare the population for th possibility of nuclear war in the 1950s may have increased daily anxiety levels while preparing the population also the success of public outreach plans may be difficult to gauge the government accountability office has recently reviewed several programs containing public outreach components and highlighted the difficulties in assessing outreach effectiveness 54 the dhs began
