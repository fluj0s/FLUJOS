be used to determine th validity of asserted rs 2477 claims are not set out and without clearly stated crite ria and standards it is not clear whether the terms of 315 have been met whethe r

might otherwise qualif for wilderness designation or across lands that are now private or w ithin federal reserves such as parks or national forests created after the hi ghways might have been established many such rights of way have not been controversial because their construction and acceptance as highways was clear other asserted rights of way are controversial either because their timely completion is not clear the standards by which their validity should be determined are debatable or because of the location of the asserted rights of way the potential impacts of claimed rs 2477 rights of way on the management of federal nd nonfederal lands and on st ate road systems could be significant2 validated roads could continue acr oss private lands as well possibly to the

and possibly their health and safety as well6 on january 6 2003 the department of the interior published new final regulations on disclaimers of interest7 disclaimer is recordable document in which the united states declares that it does not have property in terest or interests in lands the issuance of disclaime r can help remove cloud from land title because it has the same effect as though the united states had conveyed any interest it has on april 9 2003 the department of the interior and utah entered into memorandum of understanding mou to establish process to acknowledge as valid certain rs 2477 highway rights of wa within that state and to disclaim the interest of the united states in valid rights of way apparently this means that the united states would disclaim its interest in the highway easement but not title to the underlying lands the new disclaimer regulations were issued under 315 of the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma8 one part of which authorizes the issuance of disclaimers if an interest or interests of the united states in lands has terminated by operation of law or is ot herwise invalid th amended disclaimer regulations at 43 cfr part 1860

some comments on the proposed chan ges to the disclaimer regulations expressed concern that disc laimers would be used to confirm many more rs 2477 rights of way through that means9 the explanatory materials accompanying the final regulations state that signifi cant number of comments asked about the relationship between the proposed rule and rs 2477 and conclude that 315 disclaimers are appr opriate in the rs 2477 context if their issuance would help remove cloud on the title to lands or in terests in lands ar ising from unrecorded rights of way10 the explanatory materials go on to discuss that the rule does not provide standards for recognizing managing or validating rs 2477 rights of way and therefore do not violate 108 of pl 104208 which prohibited rules pertaining to recognition of rs 2477 rights of way11 by what process rs 2477 rights of way will be validated and by applying what cr iteria are controversial issues for years property disputes involving claims to fede ral lands were resolved by the congress in individual legislation or by the courts under the quiet t itle act di sclaimers have been used when there is dispute that the united states does not own property the issuance of disclaimers spares partie s the time and expense of going to court under the quiet title act however give n the significant issues over what law applies to rs 2477 rights of way and what constitutes lawf ul rs 2477 validity criteria use of disclaimers as part of process for validating such rights of way without congressional or judicial guidance on how such claims should be evaluated and resolved may generate further controversy the administration asserts that disclaimers will only be used in re ference to obvious rs 2477 claims12 or claims that satisfy the statutor requirement of constructi on and highway under almost any interpretation of those statutory terms13 however as will be discussed some of the terms of the utah mou may be controversial eg it expressly equates highway with road possibly broadening the rights of way that may qualify by eliminating one deba table element of the 1866 grant from consideration the possible relationship between the ne w disclaimer regula tions and rs 2477 determinations is important because c ongress in 108 of pl 104208 stated thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32142crs4 14 the alaska context presents many special circumstances both because of climatic and terrain conditions and because much of the st ate was subject to land withdrawals for many years possible solutions for the special needs of alaska that may not be adequately met by the right of way provisions of title xi of the alaska national interest lands conservation act and title v of flpma present issues beyond the scope of this paper 15 one press

nchorage daily news september 2 2003 at b3 16 43 usc 1701a1 and 10 rules pertaining to recognition or valid ity of rs 2477 rights of way could be effective unless authorized by congress explanatory materials published with the amended disclaimer rules assert that the issuance of federal disclaimers is completely separate from determining the validity of claims of high way rights of way under rs 2477 but apparently disclaime rs could be an essential part of new process for finalizing claims found to be valid through application of variety of administrative standards the mou with utah establis hes an acknowledgment process whereby rs 2477 rights of way claimed by that stat can be validated and disclaimers to the rights of way issued by the united states some counties in utah and one county in california and the states of alaska co lorado idaho oregon have indicated interest in developing separate m ous regarding rs 2477 rights of way and other states may follow14 any additional mous may or may not be similar to that with utah15 whether this potential for disparate approach to validating rs 2477 rights of way comports with the policies set out in flpma to retain the remaining public lands and to establish uniform procedures for th management and disposal of the public lands16 raises other issues additional questions may arise even if all validation agreements prove to be uniform neither the utah mou nor the supplem ental blm guidance for implementing it sets out the criteria that will be used by the united states to determine the validity of asserted rs 2477 claims the articula tion of criteria and the definitions of key terms are central issues that have generate d controversy in the past for many years as the west was being settled there was little attention paid by the united states to rs 2477 grants meanwhile state courts pplying state laws established their own standards by which to judge whether grant had been accepted by each state for public maintenance and liability in some instances state law or judicial interpretation went beyond termining when right of way was accepted by state or county for those purposes to also artic ulating what constitu ted construction or highway for purposes of determining when the federal grant was completed however these cases typically did not involve the federal government as party and after the repeal of the 1866 act in 1976 ttention was increasingly focused on the elements of the federal grant the constr uction of highways over public lands not reserved as matte rs of federal law congress has addressed the rs 2477 c ontroversy several times in 1991 the house passed hr 1906 bill that would have imposed cutoff date for claims and specified how the department of interior was to process them but senate action

interior shall submit to the appropriate committees of the congre ss report on the history of rights of way claimed under section 2477 of the revised stat utes the likely impacts of current and potential claims of such rights of way on the management of the federal lands on the access to federal lands private lands state lands indian and native lands on multiple use activities the current status of such claims possible alternatives for assessing the validity of such claims and alternatives to obtaining ri ghts of way given the importance of this study to the western public land states in preparin g the report the department shall consult with western public lands states and other affected interests the managers expect sound recommendations for assessing the validity of claims to result from this study consonant with the inte nt of congress both in enacting rs 2477 and flpma which mandated policies of retention and efficient management of the public lands such validity criteria should be drawn from the intent of rs 2477 and flpma the managers further expect that any proposed changes in use of valid right of way shall be processed in accordance with the requirements of applicable law 18 59 fed reg 39216 august 1 1994 19 some felt that the regulations imposed too great burden on the stat claiming rs 2477 rights of way or disagreed with the definiti ons of crucial

departments report was co mpleted in june 1993 one of the recommendations in the report was that regu lations be promulgated to establish single uniform system for validating rs 2477 claims and secretary babbitt proposed such regulations in 199418 however these proposed regulations were controversial19 and elicited congressi onal prohibitions against new regulations20 these were followed by the prohibition in 108 of pl 104 208 an appropriations act against rules pertaining to r s 2477 becoming effective until approved by congress21 similar language had been proposed for the interior

position garnered sufficient support to enact bill as part of the compromise in the 104th congress the administration pledged to send legislative proposal to the hill and proposal was sent in august of 1997 but legislation base d on it was introduced on january 22 1997 secretary babbitt revoked 1988 policy on rs 2477 and put in place an interim policy that dir ected that rs 2477 determinations be postponed unless necessitated by compelling circumstances thereby giving congress more time to resolve the issues lang uage was added to the fy1997 supplemental appropriation bill to nullify the 1997 policy nd to again require that state law be used in evaluating rs 2477 claims however this language was eliminated after the bill was vetoed since that time very few administrative determinations have been completed and disputed claims have been addressed in the c ourts under the quiet title act now with the utah mou as precedent new administrative acknowledgment processes could use the amended disclaimer regulations to validate rs 2477 rights of way under as yetunstated criteria rs 2477 issues may be suitable for re solution by congress because so many interests could be affected and because the law and standa rds that should be applied are debatable hr 1639 in the 108th congress again proposes legislated system for evaluating and determining claims and defines crucial terms in addition the house approved an amendment to the fy2004 doi appropriations bill hr 2691 that would have prohibited implementation of the amendments to the disclaimer regulations in national monuments wilderne ss study areas or units of the national park system national wildlife refuge system or the national wilderness preservation system this language was adopted instead of more general prohibition on implementation the senate bill as reported did not contain provision on disclaimers and the provision was eliminated in conference if there is legislated resolution of rs 2477 issues

regulations allow any entity to file an application for disclaimer and also provide that although most applicants must file within 12 year s this time limitation does not apply to states29 the explanatory materials indicate that this is to make the 315 regulations consistent w ith the quiet title act qta as will be discussed the qta is the exclusive vehicle for resolving title disputes with the united states it contains 12year statute of limitations but states as narrowly interpreted in the qta context are excepted from the limitati on the new regulations add broader definition of state that includes states in the narrow sense and also political subdivisions of state any of its creations and other official local governmental entities30 this language is not elaborat ed on but appears to include any independent commission or body state r even possibly county might create31 because all those who fit within this defi nition of state are exempted from the 12 year statute of limitations under the new di sclaimer regulations these provisions may allow many governmental entities that would have been precluded previously from seeking an administrative disclaimer and who are also currently precluded from initiating qta action in court to now seek an administrative disclaimer although there is legal requirement that 315 administrative disclaimer process parallel the qta the amended regulations purport to reflect and be consistent with the qta32 if the 315 disclaimer pro cess is viewed as completely separate from the qta expanding those who are not timebarred from requesting disclaimer could be beneficial because discla imers are to be used in situations where the united states has interest in property and hence provides means of clearing up unnecessary clouds on title without the time and expense of judicial suits under the qta however neither congress nor the courts have finitively clarified the criteria and law for determining whether and when an interest of the united states in right of way might have terminated or is otherwise invalid within the meaning of 315 disclaiming rs 2477 claims ther efore may be subject to challenge in some

the effect of quitclaim deed but there was elabor ation in the report on the additions36 and explanation as to why the broader house language ultimately passed37 the amendments to the disclaimer regulations broaden the circumstances in which disclaimers may be used so expansion might be warranted by practicalities eg some instances might involve pa rties who are not the title holder of record for example if there were taken survey that erroneously showed the united states to hold title to strip of land but were there any implicit limits on how disclaimers could be us ed in interpreting rs

of sovereign immunity in the qta is to be construed narrowly in favor of the united states41 except as to states the qta bars suits not filed within 12 years of the time an action accrues and an action is deemed to have accrued on the date plaintiff knew or should have known of the claim of the united states42 the block case held that states were subject to the statutory 12year limitation on brin ging suits under the qta but in 1986 congress subsequently provided that states are not generally subject to that limitation though in some circumstances they are43 recent cases have held that the exception for states is to be interpreted narrowly such that counties and other subdivisions of state may not av ail themselves of this exception to the qta44 the new disclaimer regulations contrast with the qta in this regard by including broad new definition of state that includes many entities that would be timebarred from contesting title under the qta and would have been timebarred from seeking disclaimers under the previ ous regulations the administrative disclaimer process and its regulations are separate from judicial qta actions but as will be discussed the new disclaimer regulations purport to be consistent with the qta yet differ significantly in this crucial respect the ninth circuit has held that two conditi ons must exist before district court can exercise jurisdiction over an action under the qta 1 the united states must claim an interest in the property at issue and it need not necessarily be adverse to the interest asserted by the plaintiff and 2 there must be disputed title to real property in the rs 2477 context even if the united states conceded the validity of right of way the united states would retain an interest in the property at least the servient estate over which the easement runs45 in the same litigation the ninth circuit also held that third party may claim title interest on behalf of the united states so long as that claim results in cloud on the title of the plaintiff46 howeverhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32142crs11 47 28 usc 2409ae 48 lee v united states 629 f supp 721 d alaska 1985 amended opinion affd 809 f2d 1406 9th

suit was filed and the court seems to have concluded that 2409ae did not remove the jurisdiction of the court either because in the 5th circuit the time of any jurisdictional inquiry was the date complaint was filed or because although the united states characterized its action as disclaimer the court did not find quitclaim conveyance to be disclaimer contemplated by 2409a other courts have indicated that the circumstances in which disclaimer is issued may be considered arguably disclaimer must be made in good faith and not with intent to whipsaw plaintiff or avoid resolution of the title dispute or court may refuse to confirm disclaimer see lee v united states supra and wh pugh coal co v united states 418 f supp 538 539 ed wis 1976 50 see leisnoi inc v united states 313 f3d 1181

dismissed as moot the motion of third party stratman to intervene despite the fact that there arguably were grounds to question the propriety of the disclaimer the appellate court stated that the decision whether to file disclaimer was tirely the prerogative of the united states however the court also noted that the remaining challenges by stratman to the merits of the district courts judgment were beyond the courts jurisdiction in the appeal from denial of intervention another court characterized donnelly v united states 850 f 2d 1313 9th cir 1988 as holding that while the united states

1171 d or 1998 the court noted at 1170 that there was indication that the disclaimer in that case was invalid or otherwise not in good faith if the united states disclaims the contested interest that is likely to end the suit under the qta the qta was enacted before flpma but also refers to disclaimers the statute provides that in qta lawsuit the united states may disclaim all interest in the real property or interest therein at any time prior to the actual commencement of the trial regarding the property in ques tion and if that disclaimer is confirmed by order of the court further jurisdiction of the court over the title dispute ceases unless there is an independent ground for jurisdiction47 there are few cases involving qta disclaimers but they indicate that usually confirmation of disc laimer by court is formality48 however some cases have indicated that court might refuse to confirm disclaimer of interest in some circumstances eg if disclaimer was not made in good faith49 the relationship of the filing of disclaimer by the united states in qta suit to other possible grounds for action agains t the united states is not clear but disclaimer may not be dispositive of other causes of action even if it may terminate the qta suit50 how courts might view the use of 315 di sclaimers as part of an administrative process for validating rs 2477 rights of wa is difficult to predict and whether andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32142crs12 51 see eg 1877 laws of wyo p 135 and 1886 laws of wyo ch 99 ariz rev stats 2736 2760 1887 idaho code 40501 pre 1985 31805 mt

discussion many states enacted laws that required counties to determine which roads including highways that were cons tructed on unreserved federal lands were accepted for public use and ma intenance and liability51 therefore the status of many roads was clear well before the 1976 re peal of rs 2477 the status of others might not be as clear roa dless reviews and other ac tions may have begun the 12 year statute of limitations period under the qta and the previous disclaimer regulations such that more than 12 years have now passed see the section of this report on statute of limitations issues if so the amendments to the disclaimer regulations by excepting states from the statute of limitations and broadly defining state could work significant change with respect to the ability of counties and governmental entities to raise rs 2477 cl aims enabling those claimants to now pursue claims administratively in instances where they would not have been able to do so before the amendments the original 315 regulations reflect so of the elements of the qta see eg the references to security interests wa ter rights or indian lands that are not in flpma but are in qta52 and the materials accompanying the new regulatory changes refer to making the flpma disclaimers consistent with the qta as discussed the original regula tions barred all claims broug ht 12 years after the claims had accrued the amended regulations broaden those who can apply for flpma disclaimers and avoid the 12year limitation significant departures from the qta the new 315 regulations establish new ad ministrative forum for establishing rs 2477 rights forum that need not parallel the qta but which may be controversial both because the standards th at will or shoul d govern the determination of the validity of such claims are unclear and therefore whether the united states does or does not have an interest in par ticular right of way is unclear and because the consequences of recognition of rs 2477 claims can be so significant to the surrounding federal nds and communities other issues may also be raised s ection 315 authorizes disclaimers of the record title of the united states in the property being disclaimed and it can be asked what the record title of the united states is in the context of rs 2477 disclaimers for most of the west it appears that the record title of the united states would be the title to the public domain lands obtained by the united states through relevant treaties that title would appear to consist of all the property rights encompassed in full fee title other questions are given that the record title of the united states usually is full fee title whether less than full title interest may be disclaimed under 315 at all and whether the rights of way under rs 2477 are such an interest httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32142crs13 53 blacks law dictionary 812 6th ed 1990 54 see the second example of disclaimer submitted with the letter to susan d sawtelle

authorizes the secretary to issue document of disclaimer of interest or interests in any lands as general matter interest could mean general focus of human attenti on or it could be used to refe r to right title or legal share in real property53 from the rest of the secti on its purpose and the references to recordation and to record interest it seems clear that property interests are the subject of the section furthermore by referring to disclaiming an interest or interests it appears that less than full fee title can be disclaimed under 315 in appropriate circumstances for example given the complex history of mineral reservations the united states in some circumstances may wish to disclaim the mineral estate54 in addition many statutes have authorized the acquisition of or grants or conveyances of various types of lessthanfee interests in lands including rights of way or easements and the referen ce in 315 to an interest or interests in lands seems to contemplate that the united states might in suitable circumstances disclaim these interests as well rs 2477 appears to grant an easement across the federal lands and easements are recognized property interest55 considering that 315 states that record interest of the united states may be disclaimed if it has terminated by operation of law or is otherwise invalid it may be argued that it is only easements to which the united states has record interest that can be disclaimed for example if the united states had at some time acquired an access easement across private lands for particular use or purpose but never in fact used it for that purpose thereby raising the question of whether the easement had terminated this could be characterized as situation where there was cloud on the title of the underlying land attributable to the united states that disclaimer of its record interest could help remove56 in the context of rs 2477 rights of way however the record title of the united states appears to be the full fee interest obtained by the united states when it acquired the western territories therefore if the united states were to disclaim an rs 2477 easement interest the united states might be said to be discla iming only one part of its record title ie an interest part that would have to be validated and surveyed in order to be descri bed legally in order to be able to disclaim recordable interest it could be argued on the one hand that this is not the kind of disclaimer situation contemplated by 315 because the interest being disclaimed is not the record interest of the united states on the other hand it could be argued that the traditional way of envisioning property rights is to say that fee title is like bundle of sticks each of which represents some aspect of ownership and enjoyment some or all of which may be conveyed in the context of rs 2477 rights of way the united states granted awayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32142crs14 57 the department of the interior has produced some examples of disclaimers that involved less than full fee interest but none that disclaims right of way the department has provided examples of disclaimers of the reversionary interest of the united

of way and the united states retained the servient estate the rest of the bundle of sticks over which the right of way would run under this line of argument the united states would be disclaiming the easement interest it previously granted examples of either disclaimer of an easement interest in general or of any disclaimers involving rs 2477 have been provided by the department of the interior57 section 315 states that disclaimers may be used when it will help remove cloud on the title of lands where record inte rest of the united states has terminated by operation of law in the rs 2477 cont ext the congress enacted an offer of grant but in some instances whether as factual matter rather than by operation of law the grant was adequately and lawfully accepted and completed is unclear this may be viewed as question of whether based on actions taken by parties other than the united states as opposed to those attr ibutable to the united states title ever left the united states question that depends on both the facts of each case and on the criteria chosen to answer the question if facts remain in dispute and the legal criteria applied are not clarified by rulemak ing congress or the courts some would argue that the qta may be th more appropriate vehicle certain policies of flpma may also cau tion against the use of disclaimers in the rs 2477 context at the current time congress itself has calle d attention to some of the flpma policy concerns when congress directed doi to submit report to congress on rs 2477 issues the committee report directed that validity determinations were to be consonant with the intent of congress both in enacting rs 2477 and flpma which mandated po licies of retenti on and efficient management of th public lands one of the major policy changes of flpma was to put in place policy of retention of the remaining federal lands unl ess as result of the planning processes it is determined that disposal of particular parcel will serve the national interest58 uniform procedures for any dispos of public land also are required59 on the one hand it could be argued that the issuance of disclaimer is not conveyance that the rs 2477 rights of way were disposed of long ago and therefore these flpma policies are not implicated by disclaimers of any interest of the united states in the rights of way now on the other nd given the controversy surrounding the appropriate standards to be applied to validating such rights of way some mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32142crs15 60 it is also the policy of the government that there must be some authority for the disposal of federal property see 18 usc 641 which contains criminal penalties for the unauthorized disposal of federal property clearly rs 2477 granted the highway rights of way interest the standards for ascertaining when such rights of way are valid and the grants legally completed however are not clear where the legal standards are unclear and the policy interests

this act62 similar statutory language was deleted from the interior appropriations act for fy1998 in reliance on the assertion that th language in the 1997 act was permanent law and hence an additiona l enactment was unnecessary63 there have been further statutory prohibitions since and further attempts at direct rs 2477 regulations assuming that 108 is permanent law basic issue is whether the disclaimer regulations are covered by 108 ie wh ether they pertain to rs 2477 the department looks to the legislative histor of 108 to conclude that the congress intended the department to acknowledge rights of way congress enacted section 108 to prevent the department from promulgating final rules and regulations setting out specific standards for rs 2477 rightsofway see hr rep 104625 at 58 1996

being ab to acknowledge or deny such claims65 an ambiguity that might lead to challenges to any such validations or rejections in order to minimize rs 2477 determina tions until congress acted to clarify how such rights of way were to be validated the january 22 1997 policy on rs 2477 instructed the blm to defer processing rs 2477 claims except in cases where there is demonstrated compelling and immediate need to make such determinations and the forest service followed suit this meant that few determinations would be ma pending congressional cl arification and disputes involving rs 2477 rights of way were prima rily to be determin ed by the courts the current administration is taking new approach that does not involve rulemaking to set out validity standards such rules could trigger the prohibition of 108 but is an approach that also c ould greatly expand the number of claims that may be validated this approach will be implemented through changes to the procedures for issuing disclaimers as di scussed the department seems to view 108 as aimed only at preventing rules that set out specific standards for rs 2477 rights of way66 and therefore as unrelated to disclaimer rule changes which may or may not impact rs 2477 rights of way however the actual wording of 108 appears to prohibit all regu lations that pertain to rs 2477 the materials explaining the proposed changes to the disclaimer regulations indicated that the disclaimers might be part of new ag ency adjudication process to clear up rs 2477 claims67 and the forest service stated that the disclaimers could be used for rs 2477 rights of way determinations and that currently there is administrative process available for states or land management agencies like the forest service to resolve such title claims

department reports there have b een only 62 disclaimers issued under 315 since its enactment in 197669 and none involved disclaimer of an easement or involved rights of way claims under rs 247770 however as result of the broad definition of state in the new disclaimer regulations more claimants may now be able to avoid the 12year limitation that appeared in the previous disclaimer regulations which could re sult in many more appli cations for 315 disclaimers related to rs 2477 rights of way the ex pansion of the meaning of state in the amended disclaimer regulations now allows counties and other entities to apply for disclaimers even if they could not do so under the previous disclaimer regulations or the qta in commenting on the proposal some counties indicated an awareness of the opportunity objecting to the costs that might result from their expected hundreds of filings that coul d be involved in some counties71 more recently the utah mou expressly recognizes that additional agreements will be complete d with counties72 it is not clear whether the 1997 rs 2477 policy will be eliminated with respect to these c ounties or what valid ation criteria will be used in implementing any future agreements other states have indicated that they will seek agreements and whether the terms of those agreements and the criteria to be applied will differ from previous ag reements is not known the policies of flpma contemplate uniformity and consistency with respect to the management of the federal public lands in general and with respect to disposal in particular and some may argue that these policies weigh against having varied criteria for validating rs 2477 rights of way in as much as the disclaimer regulati ons have been amended in manner that appears to expand the opportunity for thos entities most likely to claim rs 2477 rights of way to do so that the utah mou indicates that agreements will be negotiated with countie s directly and that there are i

partially repeal 310 of flpma the rulemaking authority and 315 and that repeals by imp lication are not favored by the courts74 however it could be argued that requi rement by congress that regulations on particular subject must be approved by an act of congre ss does not repeal the general rulemaking authority and assuming that certain amendments to 315 disclaimer regulations were found to be so tailored as to pertain primarily to the rs 2477 context and therefore not effective wit hout congressional appr oval this would not necessarily repeal the general authority to utilize disclaimers in sum the new disclaimer regulations present at least two questions 1 whether the rule amendments by significantly expanding the use of disclaimers to process rs 2477 rights of way are proper use of the 315 authority and 2 assuming that the nors 2477regulations language in p l 104208 is still in effect whether the new changes to the disclaimer regulations pertain to recognition and validity of rs 2477 rights of way within the meanin g of pl 104208 and therefore must be approved by congress the utah memorandum of understanding the connection between the recent amendments to the disclaimer of interest regulations and rs 2477 rights of way s recently been clarified by the execution of memorandum of understanding mou on april 9 2003 between the secretary of the interior and the

system or roads administered by another agency unless that agency cons ents to the use of the acknowledgment process the mou does not set out the criteria by which the validity of claimed rights of way will be deter mined as discussed in connecti on with the analysis of 108 of pl 104208 supra this may be to comport with the desire of congress to itself legislate regarding standards for validatin g rs 2477 claims however the subtitle of the mou refers to state and county road acknowledgment the word road is footnoted as follows for purposes of this mou the terms road and highway shall be deemed synonomous sic the rs 2477 grant was for the construction of highways acr oss public lands not reserve d arguably the equating of highway and road in the title of the utah mou eliminates one major issue that the 1866 grant was for highways and not ll roads there is elaboration in the mou on how construction or not reserved will be interpreted it is stated that eligible roads are those 1 that existed prior to enactment of flpma and which are in use at the present time 2 identifiable by centerline description or other appropriate legal description 3 documented by in formation sufficient to support conclusion that the road meets the legal requirements of rightofway granted under rs 2477 and requires that 4 the road was and continues to be public and capable of accommodating automobiles or trucks with four wheels and has been the subject of some type of periodic maintenance paragraph 7 states that the 1997 b abbitt policy is inapplicable to acknowledgment requests sub mitted in accordance with the mou this is presumably because that policy directed that rs 2477 rights of way only be validated in compelling circumstances the 1997 policy repealed an earlier 1988 hodel policy there is clarification in the mou as to whether the department is presuming that the 1988 policy will now gu ide these determinations in utah and therefore whether the 1988 definitions of c onstruction and other elements will apply paragraph 7 states that other states and counties may wish to propose mous for consideration by the department that are generally consistent with the principles set out in this agreement this raise th issue of whether certain rs 2477 validity policies and criteria w ill apply in some states or coun ties as to some claims but not in others as additional states and c ounties negotiate various mous alaska reportedly has sought negotiations for an agreement75 and other states may follow it has been noted that the utah mou was negotiated and fi nalized without public participation but it is unclear whether those that may follow will also be completed in this manner if closed and varied approach is taken with respect to the new disclaimer

statutory terms however as indicat ed above there may be diffe rences of opinion regarding essential elements the guidance sets out what should be in an application including information demonstrating that the claimed right of way existed prior to october 21 1976 and that it was in use as of april 9 2003 and details as to appropr iate description and location information the application also should describe an improvements such as bridges or culverts and other ancillary features existing as of april 9 2003 emphasis added why this is the re levant date to monstrate whether improvements existed

was repealed by uncodified 706 of fl pma the 1866 statutory language was succinct stating simply and be it further enacted that the right of way for the construction of highways over public lands not reserved for public uses is hereby granted80 section 701 of flpma provided that valid rights of way in existence at the time of repeal in 1976 were to be recognized81 similarly section 509 of flpma states that nothing in title v on rights of way shall have the effect of terminating any rightofway or rightofuse heretofore issued granted or permitted therefore rs 2477 rights of way that were valid

that made the roadways identifiable in few states how ever notably utah and alaska there was clear system of acceptance or recorda tion and the existence and maintenance of some highways as factual matter also was not clear and as result which roadbeds might still qualify under the 1866 law has b een controversial the question is important because areas traversed by asserted rs 2477 highways may be disqualified from consideration for possible inclusion in the national wilderness preservation system or might now be private lands or lands in fe deral reserves such as parks or national forests created after the establishment of the rights of way the proper interpretation of cons truction highway and not reserved in the federal grant and the appropriate scope of the role of state law so have been controversial the historical context of the rs 2477 highway grant sheds light on the purpose and importance of the act in the settlement of the west after the united states acquired the vast territories west of the mississippi c ongress debated how best to encourage settlement of the lands rapid settlement was considered desirable both to secure the new lands from foreign encr oachment and to speed the conveyance of lands from federal to state and private ow nership in order to build the new nation although congress enacted many piecemeal laws in furtherance of these goals the westward movement outpaced congressional efforts at comprehensive legislation as result many explorers developers and settlers were already on the western lands by the time the first national homesteading and land laws were enacted comprehensive authority to manage the lands that remained in federal ownership was not enacted until the 20th century mineral development is an example of an area in which federal law was playing catch up with events private indivi duals and companies tered upon the federal public domain lands in search of mineral wealth before there was legislated authorization to do so sometimes the influx of miners was quite significant as when thousands of miners fl ocked to california after th discovery of gold in 1849 because in many areas even territorial governments had not yet been established claimants developed local ru and customs to govern the location establishment of mining claims and priorities among themselves in the 1860s congress enacted severa l pieces of legislation that both legitimized existing occupations of the federal lands and addressed their use prospectively one of these was the homestead act of 186282 which provided system by which citizens could obtain title to public lands for agricultural settlement purposes the mining act of 186683 provided an initial system for the recognition of mining claims and for obtaining title to the lands on which mining claims were established section 8 of th act provided for the granting of rights of way later became section 2477 of the re vised statutes rs 2477 and still later was codified as 43 usc 932 until its repeal in 1976 by 706 of flpma rs 2477 highway grants played an impor tant role in the development of the west many state and county roads in the west today originated

should begin with close textual examination85 and that the plain meaning of provision must guide its interpretation86 the provision reads and be it further enacted that the right of way for the construction of highways over public lands not reserved for public uses is hereby granted succinct though the section is it is clear that rs 2477 is grant of right of way for the construction of highways acr oss public lands not reserved several approaches to possible meanings of these terms will be discusse d because the basic purpose of the grant for highways sheds light on what congress might have meant by construction the term h ighways will be examined first in many discussions of rs 2477 and in the utah mou there is tendency for speakers to use highway and road interchangeably or to substitute other words such as ways or even trails and cease to refer to highways at all arguably this can produce significant shift in emphasis there appear to be distinctions between highway and road and between road and still lesser terms such that only highways the term chos by congress should properly be used like many words in the english language the term highway has more than one meaning unfortunately two of its meanings have somewhat opposite connotations as can be demonstrated fro m numerous treatises and other sources87httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32142crs24 87 continued highway and it has been not unusual for congre ss sic in granting privilege of building bridge to declare that it shall be public highway on the other hand it has reference to some system of law

highway as great road that goes from town to town 92 webster s american dictionary of the english language 1143 1865 emphasis addedone of the principal definitions of the term is generic one meaning any avenue of travel open to the public including rivers and bridges88 congress has used the term in this sense when it has referre d to rivers being free highways89 with respect to ground transportation the term highway similarly can mean any way open to the public even including footpaths the term especially has this meaning in english law when used in the context of prescr iptive rights obtained by the public across private lands and this meaning carried over into some american state law90 under english law too better roads those that were bu ilt up so as to be literally high ways typically connected towns or market pl aces etc and enjoyed better protection for traveler s were known as kings or queens highways this usage gave rise to the second meaning of highway as main or principal road forming the direct or ordinary route be tween one town or city and another as distinguished from local branch or cross road leading to smaller places off the main road or connec ting two main roads91 american dictionaries of common usage published near the time of enactment of rs 2477 indicate that this second meanin g that of principal public roads was evidently the common american meaning at the time of enactment highway was not defined in the generic sense as trav corridor of any kind rather the contemporaneous common usage dictionaries use road as the more generic term and highway at least in the context of ground transportation to mean more significant road according to the 1865 websters dictionary road is riding riding on horseb ack that on which one rides or travels trackway road from ridan to ride place where one may ride an open way or public passage track for travel forming communication between one city town or place and

of road road an open way or public passage ground appropriated for travel forming communication between one city town or place and another the word is generally applied to highways and as generic term it includes highway street and lane 94 highway public road way open to all passengers so called either because it is great or public road or because the earth was raised to form dry path highways open communication from one city or town to another95 although the terms at times have been us ed interchangeably in discussing rs 2477 highways is the term used by cong ress and it is used in conjunction with requirement for construction roads appears to be the more general term and highways the more specific term in other words while all highways are roads not all roads are highways since arguably highways are public and are more significant built up roads96 in which sense congress used the term highway is obviously of great significance in interpreting rs 2477 wh atever the meaning of highway might be in other contexts such as the determinati on of prescriptive rights the question arising from its use in legislation is one of c ongressional intent one writer noted the difficulties entailed by the use of the term highway in legislation it is to be regretted that the term highways has not been more accurately employed by the courts and text writers for it is undeniably true that confusion and sometimes injustice has resulted from the use of this vague and ill defined term whether streets ferries railroads rivers or rural roads are all meant to be included in particular statute can not in many instances be asserted without careful study of the entire statute and full consideration of all the matters which the courts usually call to their ssistance in ascertaining the meaning and effect of legislative enactments word capable of so many different meanings can seldom of its own force and vigor influence the judicial mind engaged in the work of ascertaining and enfo rcing the legislative intention97 for reasons that will be developed it appears likely that congress in the 1866 act used the term highway in the sense of significant or principal road namely

obtain legislation under false pretenses as reproach to public continuedthat was open for public passa ge received significant amount of public use was constructed or improve d and that connected cities town s or other places of interest to the public it is interesting to note that some degree of constructed improvement inheres in this concept of highway in order to support the greater public use that characterizes such roads this comports with congress reference to granting rights of way for the construction of highways of course it must be kept in mind that highways in times past were not 6lane paved roads nd that the historical amount and type of travel in an area and era must be taken into account in evaluating what qualifies as principal public improved road there is legislative history that sheds light on why congress included the highway grant as section 8 in the mining act of 1866 act or on exactly what congress intended by the language of the section the mining act of 1866 established system for the recognition of several practices that had been taking place on public domain lands some of th provisions directly addressed mining other provisions related to the use of wate r and to rights of way these latter provisions addressed practices that were related to mining but had implications beyond the mining context the act legitimized mining claims in accordance with federal laws or regulations state and local law and even the local customs of miners and provided that claimants could obtain full title to the lands on which mining claims were located because water was n ecessary for some types of mining the act acknowledged rights to use water if such rights were recognized by local customs laws and the decisions of courts and 9 of the 1866 act also ddressed construction of rights of way for ditche s for the transport of water the principal focus of the floor deba tes on the act was on alternatives for disposing of the mineral lands of the unite

survey system 574 1982therefore in seeking clarification of th intent of congress in enacting rs 2477 we must look primarily to the words cong ress actually used and to the historical context in which they were enacted while the issue is not free from doubt court faced squarely with the issue is likely to find that the understanding of congress in 1866 was probably of highways in the sense of significant public roads an interpretation supported by the historical context in which the 1866 act was passed99 including other congressional actments as discussed below historical context the creation of roads and access were fundamental problems implicit in the surveying system the federal government us ed to divide and dispose of public lands the federal government applied the same system of surveying since the continental congress passed the land ordinance of 1785 an act that was later reenacted by the new federal government100 under this system prin cipal meridian base standard and guides were first measured and marked and townships squares six miles on side were surveyed the townships were then divided into sections one mile on side each of which contained 640 acres the amount of land allowed under the stockraising homestead act of 1916 these sections were divided into halves the 320 acres allowed under the desert land entr act of 1877 or further divided into quarters the 160 acres allowed under the homesteading act of 1862 or smaller subdivisions allowed under certain other acts these sections and blocks available for settlement and disposal were absolute that is each surveyed subdivision abu tted the next one without access corridors intervening this practice combined with the fact that many sections of lands were granted to the states and other entities fo r school and other public purposes to spur development resulted in checkerboard land patterns and meant that access needs were pressing exigency congress did not resolve the issue choosing instead to acquiesce in whatever access solutions developed on unreserved federal lands access problems typically were resolved am ong settlers as the local topography and circumstances indicated usually settlers simply created roads and ways across lands as needed subsequent ttlers took title subject to tablished roads and ways101 later as areas became more developed access needs were resolved by negotiation and purchase of the necessary rights given the intermingled patterns of landhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32142crs28 102 mackay v uinta development co 219 f 116 118 8th cir

resolution of this difficulty that was inherent in the survey system territorial and state laws also played role in the resolution of access and roads issues as will be discussed court has discussed the problem caused by the surveying system as follows the sections touch at their corners nd their points of contact like point in mathematics are without length or width if the position of the company were sustained barrier embracing many t housand acres of public lands would be raised unsurmountable except upon terms prescribed by it not even solitary horseman could pick his way across without trespassing in such situation the law fixes the relative rights and responsibilities of the parties it does not leave them to the determination of either party as long as the present policy of the government continues all persons as its licensees have an equal right of use of the public domain which cannot be denied by interlocking lands held in private ownership102 in an 1890 case the supreme court declined to enjoin sheepherders from driving sheep across sections owned by plaintiffs in order to reach ope n public lands stating we are of the opinion that there is an implied license growing out of the custom of nearly hundred years that the public lands of the united states shall be free to the people who seek to use them where they are left open and unenclosed and act of government forbids this use the whole system of the control of th public lands of the united states as it had been conducted by the government under acts of congress shows liberality in regard to their use wh ich has been uniform and remarkable103 the court in the course of distinguishing between access rights the federal government might have retained and those of settlers in the context of federal land grant for the construction of railroad also stated congress obviously believed that when development came it would occur in parallel fashion on adjoining public and private lands and that the process of subdivision organization of polity and the ordinary pressures of commercial and social intercourse would work itself into pattern of access roads it is some testament to common sense that the present case is virtually unprecedented and that in the 117 years since the railroad grants were made litigation over access questions generally has been rare104 it is interesting to note that an 1895 solicitors opinion found that the government had always allo wed miners to build access road s without either permit or the payment of feehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32142crs29 105 opinion

usc 1061 1063since it has traditionally been customar for mining locators homestead and other public land entrymen to build ndor use such roads across public lands other than granted rightsofway as were necessary to provide ingress and egress to and from their entries or claims w ithout charge the question whether fee may be charged for such use is not only of broad general interest but to make such charge now would change long practice congress knew when it enacted the mining laws that miners necessarily would have to use public lands outside of the boundaries of their claims for the running of tunnels and for roads the department has recognized that roads were necessary and complementary to mining activities105 the opinion did not mention section 8 of the 1866 mining act rs 2477 as relevant to the discussion of mining road access furthermore if the 1866 act is read as granting individual access this interpretation would controvert the universally recognized requirement that wa be public to be highway106 it is arguable that the better interpretation is that creation of individual access was tolerated as matter of course and that rs 2477 addressed public roads if the 1866 act is read to mean highways in the generic sense of all kinds and types of ways including minor individual access ways one could argue that the act was superfluous since the federal government at that time was allowing such use without requiring grant or permit and did not attach any management si gnificance to doing so and if the 1866 provision was intended to gitimize all transit and access across the public domain this would include individual access road s and trails that were not public however the other meaning of highways as significant public roads arguably is more consistent with other measures congress enacted that both addressed continued easy i ndividual access on the one hand and the development of significant transportation corridors on the other in the unlawful inclosures of public lands act of 1885 c ongress regulated the fencing off of public lands even wh the fences were on private lands107 and prohibited the obstruction of free passage or transit over or through the public lands108 this act prohibits obstruction of any passage over the federal lands whether on established ways or not and is reflective of congress tolerance of such passage during the time of western settlement an indication that special statute on minor access ways was not required if r s 2477 granted rights of way only for highways in the sense of significant pub lic roads the 1885 act serves more of ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32142crs30 109 for example several acts specified an overall right of way 6 rods wide with the roadbed proper to be not less than thirtytwo feet wi

76 14 stat 45function because there would be need for federal protection of all other free passage and transit across the public lands during the time of settlement of the new national lands to the west congress also provided land grants for the construc tion of many tran sportation routes by canals railroads or wagon roads thes grants including those made for wagon roads typically were for the constructi on of particular r outes between named destinations often with some legislated detail as to the type and timing of construction such grants typically include d grants of lands sufficient both for the bed of the transportation route itself and extra lands to be sold so that the proceeds could be put toward completing the work if construction did not occur there typically was language providing for the re version of the lands to the united states several statutes enacted before 1866 provided for construction of wagon roads which were to be we ll constructed roads adequate for the movement of troops and the mail clearly construction of these roads entailed definite physical acts to improve the roadbeds and congress at times required them to be built to very substantial standards involving consider able earthmoving activities even to the extent of leveling hills109 some of these statutes provided simply that the roads were to be public highways others stated that the road mu st remain public highway for the use of the government of the united states free from tolls or other charge upon the transportation of any property tro ops or mails of the united states110 an 1866 statute established process for the dedication of military roads in the district of columbia as public highways as noted above roads suitable for the movement of troops typically were well c onstructed this statute s imply provided process for allowing use of the military roads by the public 111 it is important to reiterate that the problem of securing routine access and constructing minor roads throughout the federal public lands surveying system existed and had been resolved for almost century before congress enacted rs 2477 before and after rs 2477 the federa l government tolera ted the creation of access ways and roads across open federal lands settlement was the principal interest of the federal government in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and allowing individual access was such given th at it was seldom discussed even afterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32142crs31 112 thomas donaldson the public domain its history with statistics 1884 this work of 1343

ady authorized highways across national forests but that the secretary of the interior had interpreted that as not including railroads in fact the act in question had authorized ingress and egress and wagon roads necessary to reach settlers homes but did not use the term highway 32 c ong rec 2800 1899 enactment of rs 2477 the principal work that reviews federa l land grants does not discuss access issues nor mention the 1866 provision112 after enactment of rs 2477 congress adopted many other rights of way provisions for various types of rights of way especially with respect to crossing federal reservations this potpourri of other rights of way acts argues again for an interpretation of the 1866 act as not meaning generic ways of all types but rather as referring to significant roads before enactment of rs 2477 in add ition to acquiescing in the creation of individual access congress had authorized nd made land grants for the construction of transportation arteries including large well constructed roads in some instances we have found only one land grant for wa gon road enacted after the enactment of the 1866 act it is arguable that since th federal government continued to acquiesce in the creation of access ways to individua l properties as settlers spread westward perhaps rs 2477 was an express grant of righ ts of way for all more significant roads those highways that were to be open to the public to serve as important connectors and that were to involve some degree of construction to support such use in 1872 congress revisited the mining i ssues and modified many of the provisions of the 1866 act113 the 1872 act did not change section 8 of the 1866 act on rights of way and there is discussi on of the section or its retention in the legislative history of the 1872 act in 1899 congress enacted provision of permanent law as part of an appropriations act that in the form provided by existing w the secretary of the interior may file and approve surveys and plats of any right of way for wagon road railroad or other highway over and across any forest reservation or reservoir site when in his judgment the public interests will not be injuriously affected thereby114 emphasis added on the face of this provision congress arguably again used highway to indicate significant types of transportation corridors the legislative history of the provision is inconclusive but indicates that it was felt necessary to specify that the new rights of way were for railroads b ecause the department did not construe the term highways as including railroads115 this is noteworthy

wilderness suitability review of the large roadle ss areas under its management although roadless was not defined in the statute the section by section discussion in the house report clarifies that the word roadless refers to the absence of roads which have been improved and maintained by mechanical means to insure relatively regular and continuous use way maintained solely by the passage of vehicles does not constitute road 118 the explanation set out in the committee report was reflected in the regulations implementing the wilderness review which defined roadless areas in part as areas

970 10th cir 1992 stated that it is incongruous to termine the source of interpretative law for one statute based on the goals and policies of parate statute conceived 110 years later in this instance the court was considering an ar gument for current uniform federal rules as to scope of all federal rights of way goal of the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma the court was saying that th is goal does not guide interpretation of the intent of the 1866 grant of highway rights of wa this is different issue from whether plausible interpretation that harmonizes and gives full meaning to both the 1866 act on highways and to flpma which both repealed the 1866 act and dealt with roadless areas should be preferred over an interpre tation that does not compass both statutes congress can be said to have been awar of rs 2477 when it used and commented on the term roadless if the more gene ral term road in 1976 connoted to congress way that had been improved and maintained by mechanical means to insure relatively regular and continuous use this usage is consistent with the use in 1866 of the more specific term highway as constructed and improved road that served as significant public connector121 administrative and judicial interpretation of 1866 act administrative interpretation the federal government hist orically seems to have adopted position of benign neglect of rs 2477 that probably reflect s the acquiescence of the united states on access issues during the settlement of the west and the preflpma absence of coherent policies and aut hority for the management of the public lands application or approval from the government was considered necessary to perfect an rs 2477 grant and the grant did not need to be recorded

this position retains the crucial statutory elements of construction and highways and does not necessarily mean that state interpretations that vitiate or eliminate these elements are valid this issue will be more fully discussed later too much can be read into this silence of the federal government in reviewing the cases it is important to distinguish those decided before flpma when the federal government had much less interest in the validity or existence of rights of way of any type across its lands125 and the statutory manage ment authority over the remaining public domain lands was piecemeal for much of the time before the enactment of flpma it may well simply not have mattered whether particular right of way was highway that qualified under rs 2477 or was some other type of road for which some other federa l permission could readily be demonstrated or obtained since all forms of access and settle ment were being encouraged over the years federal policies increasingly stressed retention of the public lands in national ownership and the affirmative management of the remaining public domain lands to conserve and protect the lands and resources in 1976 flpma expressly recognized policy of retention of the remaining public lands126 repealed many of the piecemeal right of way stat utes including the 1866 act and replaced them with new comprehensive process fo r the

the subject and the fact that they did not come to grips with the central i ssues of what was offered by congress and to whom and how such rights of way were to be perfected the opinion asserts that whether particular highway has been legally established remains question of federal law and that use of the term construction means that some actual building of highway was necessary to comply with the terms of the grant in this regard the opinion noted that not requiring actu construction would be potentially unmanageable because otherwis innumerable jeep trails etc might qualify as public

statutory requirement of construction the phrase in the blm rs 2477 regulations referri ng to construction of highways in accordance with the state laws must mean that state could lawfully require more than mere construction of the highway in order to perfect the rs 2477 grant ie construction is the minimum requirement of federal law but the state could impose on itself additional re quirements in order to perfect grant under rs 2477134 in the initial regulations of the department implementing the new flpma title v rights of way the department ca lled upon persons who d constructed public highways to submit maps locating such highways for notation on the records of the department in order to facilitate the new federal planning and management mandated by flpma here again the department continued to use the same phrasing that which is required by the relevant statute in addition the department incorporated the concept of road improvement by mechanical means set out in flpma committee report as the analysis of wh at could constitute road under 603 of flpma pertaining to roadless areas and w ilderness reviews again to require less for right of way to qualify as highway than is required to be road arguably is inconsistent departmental policy was issued in 1988 that differed significantly from the ferguson opinion135 according to the june 1993 task force report circumstances in alaska drove the new policy on rs 2477 the 1988 doi policy attempting to account for the perceived uniqueness of th alaska situation put forward loose criteria for rs 2477 claims and applied th criteria to all federal lands under doi jurisdiction in all 30 public land states136 among the 1988 criteria was one that set out minimal construction requi rements and stated that removal of rocks and vegetation by hand or the mere passage of vehicles might be sufficient construction is physical act of readying the highway for use by the public according to the available or intended mode of transportation foot horse vehicle etc removing high vegetati on moving large rocks out of the way or filling low spots etc may be sufficien t as construction for particular case137 to the extent this statement means that the mere moving of rocks and vegetation by hand qualifies as construc tion it could be argued that this does not comport with congresss intent in granting rights of way for the construction of principal or significant roads however some argue that it does because depending on thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32142crs37 terrain and the time the right of way was established the mere repeated passage of traffic with only slight modificati ons of the roadbed could suffice the 1988 policy also stated that qualif ying highway could be trail or footpath but did not include any analysis to support that position the 1994 proposed rs 2477 regulati ons defined construction as an intentional physical act or series of intentional physical acts that were intended to and that

established by haphazard unintentional or incomplete actions for example the mere passage of vehicles across the land in the absence of any other evidence is not sufficient to meet the construction

ferguson opinion supra at 8the claimed highway rightofway must be public in nature and must have served as highway when the underlying public lands were available for rs 2477 purposes it is unlikely that route used by single entity or used only few times would qualify as highway since the route must have open public nature and uses similarly highway connects the public with iden tifiable destinations or places the route should lead vehicles somewhere but it is not required that the route connect to cities for example highway can allow public access to scenic area trail head business or other place used by and open to the public routes that do not lead to an identifiable destination are unlikely to qualify141 the position of the department consistently has been that the elements set out in the statute must be complied with namely that there must be construction of highway across unreserved public lands142 however the details of the agencys articulation of these elements have chan ged over the years especially in the 1988 policy which interpreted construction very broadly the contemporaneous and reasonable interp retation of the agency entrusted with implementing law when arrived at thr ough formal rulemaking or adjudication is entitled to deference143 however as noted there does not appear to have been any contemporaneous interpretati on adopted by the department rather it appears that except for the 1898 decision that mere declar ations of highways along section lines without actual construction did not cons titute completion of the grant the 1938 regulation the 1959 solicitors opinion on mining access and few other pre flpma documents the departments analys is has been almost entirely postflpma the department seems to ve consistently taken the position that prospective grantee must comply with the elements of the granting law but the arguably minimal standards of the 1988 policy call into stion the meaning of the construction requirement144 until the 1993 study the department of the interior does not seem to have extensively analyzed the meanin g of highway in the 1866 act145 or to have correlated that definition either with the statutory construction requirement or with the previous congressional enactments on hi ghways the departments own analyses of mining access rights discussed previously or with the use of road for

question that are not contained in rule making or that are inconsistent are not entitled to the same deference as is contemporaneous rulemaking146 an approach that may apply to agency interpretation of rs 2477 if so then arguably agency rs 2477 interpretations while entitled to respect must rest on their power to persuade147 the appendix to this report summarizes the various iterations interpreting the key terms of the 1866 grant judicial interpretation judicial interpretation does not provide conclusive precedent on some important rs 2477 issues for several reasons rs 2477 is federal statute and must be interpreted as matter of federal law148 however federal law may at times apply state law and many argue that this is the case in the rs 2477 context in particular many claimants who feel that state law controls point to the early department of the interior regulation that stated that highway grant became effective upon the construction or establishing of highways in accordance with state laws and to numerous cases holding that st ate law controls others assert that while state law controls as to state concerns it cannot cont rovert the basic elem ents of the federal grant many of the cases predate the actment of flpma which both repealed rs 2477 and put in place new fede ral public land policies nd therefore date to time when the federal government was not concer ned about the rights of way grants in addition the cases were typically in state courts and the federa l government was not party there appear to be two levels of inqui ry that at times become merged 1 what actions are necessary to create public highway under state law for purposes of determining relative property rights and whether stat or political subdivision of state has incurred obligations to mainta in and be liable for the highway and 2 whether public highway established under st ate law is also always highway under rs 2477httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32142crs41 149 hughes v

burlington k swr co v johnson 38 kan 142 16 p 125 1887legitimate issues remain as to the proper interpretation and weight to be given state court holdings on the establishment of rs 2477 rights of way the following section discusses some of the more important issues and the most frequently cited cases involving rs 2477 role of state law the most fundamental and controversial issue is the proper role of state law in validating the establishment of rs 2477 rights of way clearly there is role for state law to play but the proper extent of that role is not clear the grant of highway rights of way under the 1866 act nd the interpretation of that act raise ques tions of federal law149 federal grant us ually is construed in favor of the government however this st rict interpretation has been held to be rebutted with respect to many grants made to assist in the settlement of our country because of the great public interests intende d by those grants courts have applied both approaches with respect to rights of way150 clearly federal law may incorporate or apply state law in some instances and the 1866 act at least to some degree is such an instance it does not specify how the highway grant is to be accepted by stat or locality or the scope of the rights granted and state law can play significant role in defining these and certain other aspects state law is controlling as to state concerns such as relative rights among parties within the state and certainly state law may validly supply details or additional requirements unique to particular state for example with respect to procedures for accepting the highways as public for purposes of maintenance and liability but the extent to which rs 2477 may fairly be inte rpreted as adopting state law as to the elements of the grant itself is the principal controversy whether for example state law can eliminate or otherwise controvert one or more of the terms of the federal grant the same group of cases is frequently cited for the proposition that state law controls especially with respect to the fact that mere passage without construction can suffice to satisfy the grant however as will be discussed it appears from an examination of the principal state cases that the state courts sometimes indulged in dicta nonbinding judicial discussion and the pronouncement of broadly worded rules not warranted by the facts before the court close examination of the facts of these cases often indicates that the roads in question clearly were constructed highways and therefore the broad generalizations or ru for which the cases are cited were not in fact the necessary holdi ngs of the court and hence their value as precedent arguably is sometimes overstate d in addition the cases sometimes are cited for rules broader than those actually fo rmulated by the courts later cases then typically cite the earlier cases as preceden t without further analysis for these reasons the law surrounding many of rs 2477 issues

such that it may contradict or even eliminate the express federal statutory elements of the grant offered other statutory provisions may shed light on this question for example the portions of the 1866 act that pertain to mining and mineral rights expressly recognize and permit state and local law and even local customs to apply if they are not inconsistent with the laws of the united states language missing from 8 of the 1866 act section 8 of the reclamation act of 1902 expressly st ates that the secret ary of the interior shall comply with state laws in carrying out that act but is also silent as to consistency nonetheless the supreme court held that state law cannot contravene that federal law or frust rate its federal purposes151 arguably state law may apply to elaborate on rs 2477 and to indicate when state has accepted the federal grant but cannot contravene its terms the hi ghway grant is succinct but does contain discernible elements the grant is for the purpose of 1 the construction of 2 highways 3 across public lands that 4 ar not reserved at the time of acceptance one of the principal cases cited for the proposition that state law determines when the offer of grant has been accepted by the construction of highways is an arizona case152 this rule is correct with reference to that states law since arizona law required both constructi on and designation of public highways by official action153 indeed the rule would always be correct that state law determines when the offer of grant has been accepted by the construction of highways so long as state law does not contravene the two elem ents of construction and highways154 and so long as the lands across which highway r uns were public lands not reserved at the time the highway was constructed the majority of cases interpreting rs 2477 have been stat cases not involving the federal government an important case that did involve the united states that is cited for the proposition that state law controls is the burr trail or hodel case155 but the holding in this case may not be as broad as is sometimes asserted on appeal the case involved only the scope of an rs 2477 right of way since the valid establishment of the road was not before the cour t this point having been conceded issues as to establishment could invol ve whether the road was constructedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32142crs43 156

regulations should not be interpreted as meanin g that state law contrary to the statutory elements may prevail 159 hodel at 1080 160 see the earlier decision of the secretary that dedication of highways along section lines without construction did not complete the gr ant 26 ld 446 1898 and the discussion of this point in the ferguson opinionadequately was on lands unreserved at the time of establishment or was highway within the meaning of the statute issues as to scope could involve the width and range of permissible uses nd improvements that can be sa id to have been included within the rights of way granted the specific issue before the court was whether proposed subsequent widening of the ro ad was reasonable and necessary under utah law and within the right that was granted although the holding of the court in hodel does not apply to establishment it is sometimes cited as precedent on that issue the appellate court in hodel considered the 1980 ferguson opinion letter and rejected reading of that letter that would result in role for state law the court then correctly noted that the second possibl reading of the letter that it speaks only to what is necessary to perfect an rs 2477 right did not help appellant because only the question of scope was before the court156 the court then stated the third possible reading of this letter would return us to blms regulations as matter of federal law state law has been designated as controlling this third reading we think is most consonant with reason and precedent157 arguably this assertion is further s upport for the conclusion that state law controls on the other hand given the nguage that immediately precedes this quote it could be argued that the court held that state law is controlling as to the scope of an rs 2477 right of way to the extent that the opinion might be read as holding that state law is controlling as to establishment one can argue that that is strained reading of the ferguson letter158 and the 1866 act and is dicta because it is an interpretation not necessary to the decision of the court the court also stated that the federal regulations heavily support state law definition159 yet as noted above the federal re gulations retain th three essential elements of the statute namely construction of highways on unreserved lands in accordance with state laws it is not clear from the face of the regulation that state law inconsistent with these requirements could result in valid acceptance of the grant offer160 the valid existence of an rs 2477 road was in controversy in the lower

public use under terms provided by state law161 the court cited two other federal cases as authority fo r this proposition in one of them united states v 994771 acres of land the court concluded that mine access road was qualifying rs 2477 public highway that resulted in pr ivate property interest in the user that was compensable under the 5th amendment even though the road definitely was not public highway under state law162 this case seems anomalous as to this point and the case did not probe what construction was necessary to establish an rs 2477 right of way but did note facts that i ndicated actual construction had occurred the wilkenson case was also cited by the district court for the rule that state law governs establishment of rs 2477 highways notes that at the time of that decision 1986 there was direct and contro lling precedent for the legal conclusions reached163 it is important to note that the parties in wilkenson were in agreement that the right of way statute was to be applied by reference to state law to determine when the offer of the grant has been accepted by the construction of highways164 the court then pointed out that under colo rado law the term highways could include footpaths that the use of road by si ngle person could suffice and that mere use of highway without construction was sufficient165 by implication the court seems to have meant that this state law was sufficient under rs 2477 even if state law eliminated one or more of the federal requirements such as actual construction or highway being public however the court also probed the road segments in question and concluded that construction on the serpents trail part of the highway connecting the two towns in question that was used by people and livestock was completed before inclusion of the lands in federal national monument the court also noted that the roads in question were described as surveyed and actually built visited by approximately one thousand people year at the turn of the century traveled by wagons built in part under county contract co mpleted with volunteer labor financial contributions from glade park residents and payments from the county and served as connectors between towns and the next state166 these facts appear to satisfy the elements of the federal statute167 and therefore the expansive comments of the court could be characterized as dicta

state law in effect on that date that is applicable where both the relevant state law purported to eliminate the rs 2477 statutory elements and the road in question actually fa iled to qualify under the rs 2477 requirements the state law applied by the courts varied widely some of the western territories and new states expressly addresse d the issue of roads especially after the enactment of the 1866 grant some state statutes clearly artic ulated how highways were to be established nd hence how the rs 2477 grant was to be accepted where state law was clear there ar few disputes today as to which roads qualify under rs 2477 see for example the early arizona law that provided that all roads and highways in the territory of arizona which were located as public highways by order of the board of supervisors or recorded as public highways were declared to be public highways168 many of these laws provided that the counties had the authority to take actions that made ri ghts of way public highways the law of other states is not as clear and hence controversies now exist as to whether valid rs 2477 right of way exists in utah for example evidently there was formal procedure for accepting the highway grant and the status of roads in that state consequently is unclear some states addressed roads in several ways speaking both to establishment of high ways and to roads serving individual properties169 the available federal case law is relativ ely sparse and alt hough general rules as to the applicability of state law are repeated the precedent on the issue arguably is not definitive and clear for the reasons discussed while th 1866 act permits the application of state law as general matter170 and state law at times has been articulated as including generous sta ndards

is construction necessary to comply with the grant the necessity for actual construction is the principal focu s of the issue of the proper role of state law in articulating acceptance of the 1866 gran t offer and has already been addressed in part in the preceding general discussion of the role of state law as was also discussed the plain meaning of 8 of the 1866 act rs 2477 would seem to require actual construction wh ile there is available gislative history of 8 9 of the same act rs 2339 addressed constructi on of ditches as to the use of the term construction in 9 of the 1866 ac t the supreme court has explained that it is the doing of the work the completi on of the well or the digging of the ditch that complied with the statute171 the united states in the suwa v blm appeal asserted that it is basic canon of statut ory construction that identical terms within an act have the same meaning172 however the counties argue that the two instances are not analogous because you cannot have well or ditch w ithout construction but in some areas you can have road without construction and that where the subject matter to which the words refer is not the same in the several places where they are used or the conditions are different the meaning well may vary to meet the purposes of the law173 an important situation in which the construction issue arises is in the context of section line rights of way the amer ican surveying system did not provide for road corridors along section lines in contrast to the american system the canadian system expressly did provide for road corridors along all section and township lines174 some states adopted the canadian appr oach and specified that rights of way existed along section lines south dakota law states there is along

roads created from trails that have been graded and then graveled and then are suddenly maintained by the state or which in fact had been built emphasis added but which might not have been formally

segregated and dedicated for highway purposes or did they need to have been actually constructed by the time of the rescinding of the federal grant the issue is an important one because some states may press such claims now176 the cases usually cited as authority for the conclusion that section line right of way dedications suffice as acceptance of the rs 2477 grant are preflpma cases between state or state s ubdivision and citizen not be tween the federal government and state in this context it is reasona ble that the state dedication of the lands is effective against subsequent titleholder of the lands crossed by right of way even if the highway was not yet constructed when that pers on took title under state law the dedication is the lawful first step of highway

reason for inquiry in pederson v ca nton township 34 nw 2d 172 sd 1948 the south dakota supreme court held that lthough the section line statute constituted dedication of section line highways if part of section line highway was not actually constructed there was duty for the count government to warn motorists under an abandoned highway statute because in f act there never had been highway 178 26 ld 446 1898 ferguson opinion supra 1988 policy statement supra at 2 179 even the more lenient 1988 policy statement required that construction had to have been initiated prior to repeal and actual construction had to have followed within reasonable time 180 284 us 463 467 1932 181 id at 465466 emphasis added this case so reinforces the argument that the roads intended as qualifying under rs 2477 are significant roads considered public highwaysproperty that is good agai nst subsequent titleholders177 however this is not to say that the paper dedication is effective against the federal government if the offer of the federal highway grant is resc inded before construction s been completed better argument appears to be that the roads must have been constructed to comply fully with the terms of the federal highway grant and if they were not at least partially constructed by the time the grant offer is repealed then the opportunity to comply with the grant offer was extinguished upon repeal that section line dedications alone without construction do not complete grants has long been the consistent position of the department178 especially if constructi on was not even begun before repeal of the granting statute179 another difficult question is whether mere use by the public can ever suffice to establish highway under rs 2477 agai n some of the cases cited for the proposition that public use alone can resu lt in public highway appear to be overstated for example central pacific railway v alameda county is frequently cited for the proposition that valid rs 2477 highways could be established by the mere passage of wagons the court in that case noted the original road was formed by the passage of wagons etc over the natural soil180 however the court also had noted that public highway was laid out and declared by the county in 1859 and ever since has been maintained during that time it has served as one of the main arteries of travel between the bay regions of southern alameda county and the livermore valley181 therefore regardless of how the road originated it apparently di d qualify under rs 2477 and the rule for which this case is often cited appears to be either overstated or dicta there are actually two issues involved in some of the cases that may be confused 1 whether public use without some formal acceptance by governmental entity may nonetheless result in public high way within particular state and 2 whether highway established merely by public use without further improvement or construction of the roadwa may qualify under rs 2477httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32142crs49 182 united states v california 332 us 19 3940 1947 texas v louisiana 410 us 702 714 1973 rehearing denied 411 us 988 1973 183 hatch brothers co v black 165 p

first point may be answered wholly by the statutory and case law of the state involved some of the cases may not word the issue correctly as for example by discussing adverse possession against the united states which does not lie182 under the laws of some states public use of sufficient type over sufficient time may result in the creation of public highway in the first sense recognition under state law andor acceptance by state or local governmental entity for maintenance and liability state law might also conclude that valid rs 2477 highway resulted not because citizens are adversely possessing title against the united states but because if public use of certain type and dur ation results in acceptance of public highway under state law this is equate d with adequate acceptance of the federal grant offer183 however this latter approach presents the second issue if public use may result in the creation of public highway unde r state law does the resulting highway qualify under federal law even if the road was not constructed in some of the more arid parts of the country repeated passage may compact roadbed capable of sustaining regular use if road that was never improved or maintained nonetheless served as welltraveled transportation corridor between towns and was recognized as public highway under state law coul d such road qualify under rs 2477 here too in the leading cases usually c ited the roads in question in fact appear to have satisfied all of the elemen ts of the 1866 act in the first hatch case for example the road served several towns and several purposes and citizens had spent considerable private funds installin g ditches bridges and dugways184 hatch ii held that public use alone as pub lic use was described in hatch i without any official action by governmental entity could co nstitute valid acceptance of an rs 2477 right of way because wyoming recognized commonlaw doctrine of establishment of highways by user in this case th court was focusing on whether any official acceptance was necessary under wyoming law at that time to constitute acceptance of the federal grant offer and concluded that it was not recent decision of the wyoming supreme court quoted from hatch ii with approval for the principles that state law controls the establishment of r s 2477 rights of way and that use alone suffices though the court held that highwa right of way in that case did not exist because later wyoming statutes did require official acceptance185 in lindsay land live stock case too utah case that has also been cited for the proposition that public use without construction is sufficient under rs 2477 the road in question appears actually to have qualified under rs 2477 the court in that case actually worded the rule as stated in hatch and noted that improvements had been made even without public funds that the road connected points between which there was considerable public travel and that the use made of the road was as generalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32142crs50 186 lindsay n 183 supra at 648 187 most of the utah cases following lindsay also specifically indicate that the road in question was constructed or improved 188 see n118 and accompanying text supra for discussion in committee report on flpma to the effect that unimproved ways in arid areas were not roads under flpma 189 suwa v blm supra at 1139 and extensive as the situation and rroundings would permit had the road been formally laid out as public highway by public authority186 therefore lindsay does not appear to stand for the proposition that construction or imp rovement of road is necessary to construct public highwa under the terms of rs 2477 this was not the rule stated in the case and wa s not the situation before the court187 it seems unlikely as factual matter that road could be both totally unimproved and still have supported until 1976 the kind of regular and continuous use as significant connector that qualifies as highway188 even in arid areas ditches and grading may be necessary at cer tain places to cope with seasonal rains it also seems unlikely that road would remain totally unimproved once it eventually became formally accepted as public highway and maintained by the local government circumstances that ty pically occurred well before 1976 this is significant because in considering what alternatives may now exist for processing rs 2477 claims it has been sa id that any attempt to adhere to the language and requirements of the 1866 act would be disrup tive of long established expectations yet it may well be that an analytic approach of asking both whether right of way is public highway under state law and whether the road is qualifying highway under federal law in fact will prove to be consistent with most of the case law to date as discussed above the depa rtment of the interior s consistently maintained that some construction must have taken place although at times the department has construed constructi on broadly as in the 1988 policy suwa v blm recently focused again on the pr oper interpretation of rs 2477 and the earlier cases after reviewing the plain meaning of the statutes words as

objective for federal land use policy189 see above and ppendix i for the text of the definitions the counties who also are defendantappellant s on appeal asserted that under utah law construction could be accomplished by continued use and nothing more and that this law should control in response the court probed the use of state cases noted the disparity between some of the broad

however are distinguishable from the present matter the more recent cases to adopt this standard reached that interpretation simply by citing b ack to hodel rather than through independent analysis of

background on this issue may be helpful the 1866 act is silent as to the extent and features of right of way and the regulations of the department did not elaborate on the scope of rs 2477 grants although there have been few federal cases to date in the hodel case involving the burr trail th 10th circuit held that the scope of valid rs 2477 right of way generally is to be determined by the laws of the state in which the right of way is located as they existed in 1976193 under this rule analysis of the scope of particular right of wa will vary depending both on the facts of each case and the laws of the state in which the right of way is located the hodel case addressed only the part of the road in question that was adjacent to wilderness study areas wsas the court discussed the rela tionship of the permissible scope of the right of way under utah law to the management du ties of blm in that context applying utah law the district court in hodel found that valid rs 2477 right of way includes the potential to expand the ri ght of way to width that is reasonable and necessary for the type of use to which the road had been put194 the 10th circuit affirmed on this point adding that reasonabl and necessary must be read in light of traditional uses to which the right of way was put furthermore the court felt that the basic principles of law governing easem ents would control abuses in that owners of the dominant and servient estates must ex ercise their rights so as not unreasonably to interfere with each other195 although the appeals court stated that state law controlled and that state law held an easement was limited to the original use for which it was acquired the court next stated that the countys right of wa was not limited to the use to which it was first put because rs 2477 was an opene nded and selfexecuting grant under which new uses automatically vested the court apparently meant that all the particular highway uses that developed over the year s before repeal in 1976 would assist in determining the reasonable and nece ssary scope of valid expansion196 the court noted that the district court had found expanding the road to promote economic development was within the historic uses of the road as vital link between the countrys major centers of activity197 the district court d directed the county to apply to blm for right of way permit for part of the road segment that needed to be relocated from its historic location th appeals court agreed but added that the blm could not deny the permit or impose all the conditions it

interest in united states v garfield county 199 garfield county had bulldozed part of the burr trail that traverses capitol reef national park for which actions the united states sought damages in trespass the court relying on the hodel cases determined that the scope of the rs 2477 right of way is that which is reasonable and necessary to ensure safe travel for the uses made of the right of way at the time of repeal of rs 2477 including improving the road to two lanes so tr avelers could pass each other200 the court rejected the countys assertion that the width of the ri ght of way included all disturbed area finding that standard to be the mo st singularly unhelpful uncertain and ungovernable approach to answ ering the question of scope201 the issue of the extent to which the county could improve the road led to an exploration of the respective authorities of the two parties the county sserted that it could improve the road without permission from the nati onal park

the act or whether it should be considered as having been established in 1859 when it was layed out and approved by the county if the former it predated the rights of the railroad the court held that the 1866 act sanctioned existing continuedreasonable accommodation of the others duties powers and purposes203 hodel instructs that the initial determination of whether the activity falls within an established right of way is to be made by the federal land management agency having authority over the lands in question204 the court held that garfield county could conduct maintenance wo rk without prior authoriz ation from the national park service but could not perform work constituting construction within the meaning of the nps regulations without first obtai ning permit approval or agreement from the national park service which could regulate that construction work to the extent provided by regulation and statute205 undoubtedly there will be other disputes as to the scope of rs 2477 rights of way and the respective authorities to regulate their improvement and use and it remains for future agency and judicial ex position to flesh out these issues further is rs 2477 retrospective or prospective the court in united states v dunn held that the 1866 act was meant onl to sanction trespasses that had occurred on the public domain before its enac tment the court said that the act was not intended to grant rights but instead to give legitimacy to an existing status otherwise indefinable206 the court reached this result by relying on two previous cases both of which addressed those as pects of the 1866 act that cured past trespasses because those were the facts be fore the court better reading of both cases is that the 1866 act served to gitimize past trespasse s and to establish priorities of occupancy rights that related back to the establishment of the uses rather than only to the 1866 date of enactment207 neither case held that the 1866 act onlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32142crs55 207 continued rights of way rather than creating new ones as of 1866 the court reviewed the jennison case and stated the section of the act of 1866 granting rights of way for the construction of highways less than that which grants the right of way for ditches and canals was so far as then existing roads are concerned voluntary recogniti on and confirmation of preexisting rights brought into being with the acquiescence and encouragement of the general government id at 473 emphasis added quite arguably the court in central pacific corrected the possible reading of the jennison case that it denied possible prospective rights and made clear that both ca ses spoke only to then existing rights finding that they were ratified as of the time the us were established rather than being new rights as of 1866 208 684 f2d 1276 1282 n 6 9th cir 1982 209 united states v gates of the mountai ns lakeshore homes 732 f2d 1411 1413 n3 9th cir 1984 210

majority of judicial interpretation indicates that the act also was prospective in its application the 9th circuit noted the issue as an open question in 1982 opinion in humboldt county v united states 208 however two years later the same circuit noted that the parties to new litigation ag reed that rs 2477 operated prospectively to grant rights of way for highways cons tructed after its enactment the court then stated dunn is questionable authority because it is contrary to the cases cited in humboldt county 684 f2d at 1282 n 6 and appears to misread central pacific railway co v alameda county 284 us 463 52 s ct 225 76 l ed 402 1932209 therefore the better interpretation woul d seem to be that while the 1866 act confirmed preexisting rights of wa it also applied prospectively does rs 2477 apply only to roads for mining or homesteading purposes the ninth circuit also has held that an alternative ground for finding that humboldt county did not acquire right of way under rs 2477 is that right of way could not be acquired under that act for road fo r purposes other than mining or homesteading which purposes did not include the desired purpose of reaching recreation area the court found that alt hough the language of the grant is without limitation as to purpose the statute of which it was part addressed solely mining and homesteading claims the c ourt noted that the holding in wilderness society v morton210 was consistent with this interpretation in that the road in that case would facilitate oil drilling which was completely consonant with congress intent in 1866 to facilitate private mineral development211 although the argument can be made that section 8 is limited to the context of the act of which it is part the language is not so limited on its face and the provision seems consistently to have been interpreted as being of general import the meaning of highway as significant road set forth earlier in this report

1refutes the narrow interpretation furtherm ore when the provision was codified it was not placed with the remainder of the sections pertaining to mineral claims but rather was codified as part of the genera l rights of way provisions as 43 usc 932 although unenacted titles of the united states code are only evidence of the law and cannot change the law212 this code placement is further evidence that the provision should be interpreted as of general import the department of the interior also s interpreted the provision as applicable to other than mining access 1959 solicitors opinion on access to mining claims states that congress understood when it acted the mining laws that miners would have to use the public lands for roads and that roads were necessary and complementary to mining activities the opinion does not mention section 8 of the 1866 mining act rs 2477 as relevant to th discussion of mining roads fact that argues for the interpretation that the highway grant in section 8 was speaking of roads other than mere mining access roads213 it also appears that the vast majority of cases have implicitly found the highway right of way is not limited to the mining and homesteading context214 united states v 994771 acres of land215 held that private entities were entitled to compensation from the united states for the taking of their mine access right of way although th court had discussed rs 2477 as one authority for the mine road the court also concluded that the right of way was not public highway and the case does not stand for any clear characterization of rs 2477 what are unreserved lands the 1866 grant was for rights of way across public lands that were not th reserved public lands are those lands in the public domain basically the western lands th united states obtained from another sovereign rather than from state or indi vidual that were open to the operation of the various public land laws enacted by congress such as the homesteading acts reserved lands are those public lands that are withdrawn and dedicated to particular federal purpose or purposes such as military reservations or national parks the position of the department in th 1988 policy statement was that public lands that are not available for rs 2477 righ ts of way are those that are reserved or dedicated by act of congress executive order secretarial order or in some cases classification actions authorized by statute during the existence of that reservation or dedication or lands preempted or tered by settlers unde r the public land laws or located under the mining laws which ceased to be public lands during the pendency of the entry or claim216 usually it is clear whether fullfledged reservation has occurred the situati on may not be as clear however when classifications and wit hdrawals are involved httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32142crs57 217 act of june 28 1934 ch 865 48 stat 1269 codified at 43 usc 315 et seq 218 humboldt county v united stat 684 f2d 1276 1281 9th cir 1982 see also the burr trail hodel cases which found that in that case road had already been established by the time of the withdrawals in ques tion 675 f supp at 604 848 f 2d at 1079 n10for example the withdrawals and classifications associated with the creation of grazing districts under the 1934 taylor grazing act217 may reserve lands sufficiently to preclude establishment of an rs 2477 right of way the taylor grazing act at 43 usc 315f provides that affected lands shall not be subject to disposition settlement or occupation until after the same have been classified and opened to entry yet 43 usc 315e states that nothing contained in this chapter shall restrict the acquisition granting or use of rights ofway within grazing districts under existing law the 9th circ uit has held that the two sections should be read together such that withdrawals and creation of grazing district precluded establishment of road across grazing district lands unless the entity seeking to acquire right of way sought the reopeni ng of such lands under 43 usc 315f in order to establish the road218 if this reasoning is repeated in other cases it obviously would have great impact on the remainin g rs 2477 validity terminations since the taylor grazing act withdrawals were extensive estoppel an issue that underlies much of the controversy surrounding rs 2477 especially with reference to cons truction issues is that of federal acquiescence in whatever interpretations the states devised the argument can be made that because the agency administering the act allegedly did not assert any federal requirements or dispute state claims for pe riod of over hundred years and because congress also acquiesced in state articulation of all aspects of these grants the federal government may not now assert statutory re quirements that contradict state claims or interpretations therefore the argument continues the valid existing rights that were preserved by flpma are those and only those that are recognized as valid under state law this issue of estoppel by acquiescence was discussed in united states v california case involving disputed ownershi p and jurisdiction over the threemile belt of submerged lands off the coast of ca lifornia the court ruled for the united states position congress later changed by statute despite long history of acquiescence by federal officials in the assertion of jurisdiction by the state even to the point of making federal purchases of rights in the belt the court said as matter of fact the record plainly demonstrates that until the california oil issue began to be pressed in the thirtie s neither the states nor the government had reason to focus attention on the ques tion of which of them owned or had paramount rights in or power over the th reemile belt and even assuming that government agencies have been negligen t in failing to recognize or assert the claims of the government at an earlier date the great interests of the government in this ocean area are not to be forfeited as result the government which holds its interests here as elsewhere in trust for all the people is not to be deprived of those interests by the ordina ry court rules designed particularly for private disputes over individually owned pieces of property and officers who have authority at all to dispose of government property cannot by theirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32142crs58 219 332 us at 3940 see also utah power and light co v united states 243 us 389 409 1917 220 243 us 389 409 1917 221

with the current situation appears clear the federal government had reason to focus on validity of rs 2477 rights of way until after the repeal of the measure and possibly not until the i ssuance of the 1988 policy statement which perhaps encouraged claims that had previ ously not been considered to be valid quite arguably the actions of the federal agents were not as compromising in the rs 2477 context as they were in the california context because the regulation of the department did incorporate the elements of the relevant statute and because of the historical context surrounding rights of way before flpma in utah power light co v united states involving another right of way statute and combination of acquiescence nd overt actions on the part of federal agents the supreme court also held this ground also must fail as general rule laches or neglect of duty on the part of officers of the government is fense to suit by it to enforce public right or protect public interest it by the united states to enforce and maintain its policy respecting lands whic h it holds in trust for all the people stands upon different plane in this nd some other respects from the ordinary private suit to regain the title to real property or to remove cloud from it220 an estoppel argument also was raised in city and county of denver v bergland involving another right of way statute the court quoted from us v california supra with approval and stated that est oppel if applicable at all can lie only against an agency to which congress has delegated the authority to dispose of lands held in trust for the public221 the court did not decide whether some version of estoppel could apply to the agencies re garding the right of way involved in that case because it concluded that plainti ff had failed to make traditional case of estoppel against the united states for reasons that may well also pertain in the current rs 2477 context222 even if the elements of toppel are present when title to public lands is involved polic considerations demand that estoppel not be applied without compelling reasons223 an argument can be made that estoppe l is not appropriate in the rs 2477 situation because the elements required by the 1866 act are evident on the face ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32142crs59 224 under 28 usc 2409ak the notice for the purpose of the accrual of an action brought by

lands or 2 by the use occupancy or improvement of the claimed lands which in the circumstan ces is open and notorious 225 organic act directive n 7615 at 5 december 14 1976the act and have consisten tly been required by the department since its earliest regulation clearly there is legitimate and significant role for state law to play in implementing the statute but it can hardly be assumed that congress agreed with diverse state interpretations of which it was not aware and regarding which it had reason to inquire furthermore congress has acted to address rights of way in legislation since 1866 in enactments that are consistent with an intent in the 1866 act to grant rights of way for the construction of significant roads and therefore it could be argued that congress did not necessarily acquiesce in apparently contrary state interpretations reconsideration of the 1988 policy and the criteria t out in it the argument might continue that resulted in new articulation closer to the requirements of the act would not actually be disruptive of the current status quo because most of the qualifying roads clearly qualified by 1976 fu rthermore an examination of some of the leading state cases indicates that an interpretation that required qualifying roads to be public highways under state law and so to meet the elements of the federal grant would not be at odds with most of the actual rules and facts of those cases statute of limitations except for certain suits by states the quiet title act bars suits that are brought more than 12 years after the plaintiff knew or should have known that the united states asserted title in particular property contrary to their own224 the previous disclaimer regulations had blanket statute of limitations of 12 years the amended regulations llel the qta by providing new exception for state claims but also put in place new definition of state that in contrast to the interpretation of that term under the qta and to the absence of any exception to the 12year statute of limitations in the previous disclaimer regulations includes counties and other political subdivisions of states and other governmental entities thereby broadening those not timebarred from seeking disclaimer court cases have analyzed whether the statute of limitations in the qta context may have run with respect to rs 2477 claims and may shed light on statute of limitations issues in the disclaimer context after congress repealed rs 2477 in its entirety in 1976 new rs 2477 rights of way could be blished and several administrative actions taken after the repeal of the grant in 1976 may have beg the 12year period after repeal blm notified the states that rs 2477 was l onger effective and that all new claims would be under title v of

federal register and the blm directors in each state issued press releases on the classifications and designated areas the names and addresse s of each blm state director were given in the notices which also stated that i nventory maps and deta iled information were available to the public229 arguably this sequence of actions especially the opportunity for public comment on the proposed wilderness inventor procedures and in particular the definition of road that generated such response the public notice of the final wilderness handbook the blm inventories of roadless areas and the subsequent published determinations of which areas were deemed to be without roads may have constituted notice of position of the united states adverse to possible claimed rs 2477 rights in those areas so classified if these actions of blm are found to ve put possible claimants on notice that they should assert rs 2477 claims the st atute of limitations may have run such that some claimants may not be able to contest an advers determination now under the qta however courts may require additional acts in order to find that plaintiff knew or should have known that the united states cla imed title in c onflict with nonfederal right of way230 the argument can also be made that if rs 2477 highways are interpreted as including minor ways that were not ev roads for purposes of section
