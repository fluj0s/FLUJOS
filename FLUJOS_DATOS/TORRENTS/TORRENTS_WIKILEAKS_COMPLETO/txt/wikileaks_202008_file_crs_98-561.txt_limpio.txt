warrant child labor in hazardous occupations onthejob driving by youth workers summary the fair labor standards act flsa of 1938 as amended is the primary federal statute dealing with the minimum wage overtime pay child labor and related subjects in its initial enactment congress established general framework for regulation of child labor but left to the discretion of the secretary of labor the determination of which types of work ought to be considered particularly hazardous for persons under 18 yearsofage where the secretary determined that an area of work was particularly hazardous he was directed by congress to develop regulations under which young persons might be employed or to bar them totally from such employment the result has been the development through the years of seventeen hazardous occupations orders hos for nonagricultural work under ho 2 the employment of persons under 18 yearsofage is restricted in occupations that require operation of motor vehicle such employment must be in conformity with stated safety standards where vehicle operation is required must not involve driving outside of daylight hours and what driving is permitted must be occasional and incidental to the young persons employment with only slight modification that standard has prevailed at least since the 1960s child labor standards may not always have been closely enforced and it is possible that they have not always been clearly understood by employers and workers during the late 1980s and early 1990s the department of labor undertook program of vigorous enforcement of child labor law among those found in violation were group of automobile dealers from the state of washington faced with fines the dealers appealed to their members of congress to have the standard changed permitting broader employment of young persons in work requiring operation of motor vehicles during the 103rd congress legislation to modify ho 2 was introduced by representative mike kreidler dwash the legislation was not acted upon in the 104th congress similar legislation was introduced by representative randy tate rwash and senator gorton hearing on the issue was held in the house subcommittee on workforce protections september 1996 but the legislation died at the close of the congress modification of ho 2 has been endorsed by automobile dealers it has been opposed by the department of labor and by groups associated with childrens advocacy such as the child labor coalition and the national consumers league in the 105th congress representative combest introduced hr 2327 bill structured differently from the kreidlertategorton measure but proposing to alter ho 2 to permit youth workers wider opportunity to drive in the course of their employment the bill with amendment

of persons over 16 yearsofage in nonhazardous work however congress specifically directed that persons between 16 and 18 years of age be excluded from employment in types of work which the secretary of labor shall find and by order declare to be particularly hazardous for the employment of children between such ages or detrimental to their health or wellbeing1 emphasis added how hazardous was to be defined and what elements entered into the definition of hazardous were delegated to the secretary through the years secretaries of labor have reviewed various types of workplace operations for their suitability for the employment of young workers where such operations have been found to be particularly hazardous for such workers the department dol has issued hazardous occupations orders hos excluding from such employment persons under 18 yearsofage seventeen such orders nonagricultural are now in place ho 2 which deals with the operation of motor vehicles by persons 16 and 17 yearsofage has been subject of legislative interest through the past several congresses the evolution of ho 2 and its implications are discussed here as part of broader context of child labor enforcement dol and the issue of child labor though the basic child labor provisions of the flsa had been in place since 1938 their enforcement it appears may not always have had the highest priority among the assorted responsibilities of the department2 within dol child labor regulation falls under the wage and hour division which also oversees diverse range of workplace standards statutes among them minimum and prevailing wages and overtime pay oversight under secretary wirtz 1968 in 1968 labor secretary willard wirtz instituted review of the orders as part of an effort to increase youth employment opportunities wherever this is possible 1 see title 29 usc 203l 2 bureau of national affairs daily labor report march 16 1990 p a14 crs2 without endangering their health or safety3 the review process was detailed and technical the department solicited the views of individuals and organizations safety engineers officials from unions trade association manufacturers etc with respect to specific hazardous occupations orders the secretary recalled over 200 responses were received these responses yielded variety of suggestions in some instances these suggestions were to relax certain aspects of the orders and in other cases it was proposed to extend their coverage after digesting the results the department published notice of proposed rulemaking and invited comment among proposals for consideration was an amendment to ho 2 to allow persons between 16 and 18 yearsofage to operate motor vehicles under certain limited circumstances as part of their regular employment4 taking into account that in most states persons of 16 and 17 yearsofage are newlylicensed drivers lacking experience on the road the department determined that workrelated operation of motor vehicles by 16 and 17yearolds was particularly hazardous and that such young persons ought not to be employed in such activity5 however ho 2 did provide an exemption with respect to incidental and occasional driving by the targeted group stating that the ban shall not apply to the operation of automobiles or trucks not exceeding 6000 pounds gross vehicle weight if such driving is restricted to daylight hours provided such operation is only occasional and incidental to the childs employment that the child holds state license valid for the type of driving involved in the job which he performs and has completed state approved driver education course and provided further that the vehicle is equipped with seat belt or similar device for the driver and for each helper and the employer has instructed each child that such belts or other devices must be used still excluded for persons under 18 yearsofage however was driving that involved the towing of vehicles6 with certain refinements of language

much of the 1970s8 federal regulation of child labor reemerged as highvisibility issue early in the reagan administration on july 16 1982 the department proposed major changes in its structure of child labor regulation allowing 4week comment period9 the proposed regulations did not focus upon ho 2 per but had potentially serious impact for any change in existing child labor regulation on july 28 1982 the house subcommittee on labor standards chaired by representative george miller commenced the first of two days of hearings on the issue the wisdom and timing of the proposals was sharply questioned resolutions were introduced both in the house and in the senate hjres 551 and sjres 223 that had they been adopted would have prevented the secretary of labor from proceeding with the proposed restructuring then just prior to the second day of hearings august 3 1982 the department decided to extend the comment period further consideration by the department of labor would follow10 by early 1983 with the comment period closed some further action on child labor was generally expected federal wage and hour regulators are sifting through blizzard of letters from restaurant operators across the nation supporting the reagan administrations plan to relax child labor restrictions on the employment of young teenagers in foodservice outlets nations restaurant news reported the trade paper also acknowledged that the dol proposals had generated storm of protest from educational groups labor unions and congressmen who expressed outrage over what some described as scheme to enable restauranteurs to exploit school age workers senator moynihan the paper stated had called the departments pending regulations an unconscionable effort to leave teenagers open to exploitation by few unscrupulous employers while senator chafee warned the changes could result in greater risk to the safety of our working youths11 in april 1984 the aflcio stated that laws that have protected children from exploitation by employers for nearly half century will be gutted if the reagan 8 the 1977 flsa amendments pl 95151 included provision allowing for employment of children at young at 10 yearsofage in field harvest however agricultural employers were required to certify that any children so employed would not be harmed by pesticides used in the fields or conversely that pesticides had

labor regulations12 in october 1984 in listing its semiannual regulatory agenda dol included revision of child labor regulations including possible changes in ho 2 the prohibition against employment of minors under certain conditions in the operation of motor vehicles13 but nothing happened in november 1984 the nations restaurant news headlined pols may pull child labor scheme off back burner it said that policy makers in the reagan administration may soon revive number of politically sensitive initiatives affecting the foodservice industry among them the effort to modernize child labor laws to remove unnecessary and arbitrary restraints on the job duties of young workers14 in early january 1985 the same source reported the wage and hour division plans to reform child labor ground rules recalling the controversy that followed the earlier initiative it suggested less controversial version may emerge this year15 in mid1986 the reagan administration dol was still projecting child labor reform including the ho 2 revisions with respect to motor vehicle operation16 but the new child labor regulations were not forthcoming the issue remained controversial developments under the bush and clinton administrations although the proposals of 1982 had been relatively minor in content according to nancy flynn acting deputy director of the wage and hour division they had ultimately been withdrawn because of the controversy they had provoked flynn suggested that it had been somewhat naive of the agency to propose changes without seeking outside input beforehand rather than operating in vacuum17 secretary brock appoints an advisory committee in july 1987 labor secretary william brock tried new approach announcing creation of child labor advisory committee to advise the secretary of the effective administration of the child labor provisions of the flsa secretary brock announced the committee will consist of 21 members representing child advocacy groups employers unions the education community civic organizations state officials child guidance professionals and safety groups the committee will function solely as an advisory body18 12 aflcio news april 28 1984 p 1 13

had been that they have been drawn up to meet industry needs without sufficiently taking into account the views of child advocacy and related groups in part the advisory committee was intended as means through which to remedy this perception crs5 by the time the committee met for the first time on march 9 1988 secretary brock had been replaced by ann mclaughlin wage and hour administrator paula smith advised the members that federal child labor regulations were outdated outmoded and obsolete the committee elected chairperson linda golodner of the national consumers league and divided itself into three subcommittees one of which was to consider ho 219 when the ho 2 subcommittee met on july 6 1988 its agenda included whether definitions under this order and the exemption from the order for incidental and occasional driving need to be refined and whether change should be made in the gross vehicle weight of types of vehicles permitted under the exemption for incidental and occasional driving20 the subcommittees continued to meet into the fall of 1988 when final report was filed which inter alia urged modification strengthening of ho 2 including the incidental and occasional driving standard21 in january 1989 elizabeth dole assumed her duties as secretary of labor in the bush administration momentum grows in may 1989 the national consumers league launched its own yearlong study of child labor in the united states under golodners direction ms golodner indicated that from discussion with people in the field she had found that child labor is often on the low end of the priority list she suggested that the picture will be even bleaker if the department does not get serious about enforcing the law and observed that it is taking very very long for the recommendations of the advisory committee submitted in october 1988 to get through the bureaucracy responding the department noted that the recommendations had only reached down to wage and hour administrator paula smith in april six months after their submission and that they were currently under consideration other more recent suggestions were still moving through the system22 through the period numerous bills dealing with child labor were introduced in the congress and several hearings were held in general witnesses pointed to abuses of child workers and the need for tougher standards while there was some suggestion that greater vigor was needed on the part of the department of labor in march 1990 representative donald pease dohio observed that package of 19 federal register february 17 1988 p 4788 part of ho 2 as noted above dealt with the employment of 16 and 17 yearolds as school bus drivers primarily utilized in two or three states although these bus drivers were the immediate concern of the subcommittee on ho 2 its responsibilities were broader see also bureau of national affairs daily labor report march 10 1988 p a11a12 20 federal register june 14 1988 p 22235

p 25171 22 bureau of national affairs daily labor report may 18 1989 p a10a11 ultimately the term of the advisory committee expired and was not extended the initiative on the part of the national consumers league evolved into the child labor coalition broad umbrella group of organizations with an interest in child welfare and child labor practice both within the united states and within global context crs6 recommendations from the child labor advisory committee sits on the desk of the secretary of labor unanswered since 1988 and he suggested that the actions of the department were finger in the dike23 secretary dole develops strike force child labor has normally been an issue of some interest with the public and within the legislative community however during the late 1980s and early 1990s it achieved unusually high visibility in part the stimulus to interest in the subject may have been inadvertent the proposals of 1982 and creation of the child labor advisory committee each in different ways may have stimulated interest in child labor standards through the period steady stream of bills appeared both in the house and senate with numerous hearings the department of labor reacted with renewed enforcement activity in her annual report for 1988 secretary mclaughlin noted the wage and hour division found 20454 minors employed in violation of the child labor provisions of the flsa during fiscal 1988 and it assessed 214 million in child labor civil penalties against 902 employers who were found to be illegally employing 13838 minors24 with the appointment of elizabeth dole as secretary of labor the department took on role of higher visibility in testimony before the house subcommittee on labor standards in june 1990 secretary dole had praise for employers who legally employ young people within the bounds of the child labor laws and are helping us energize and motivate our most precious resource our human resource but she continued there can be doubt that there are employers violating our child labor laws indeed weve witnessed disturbing 128 percent increase in violations in the past four years secretary dole reacted by increasing substantially the departments child labor enforcement efforts she created series of strike forces which moved in on targeted industries in which children were most likely to be employed the purpose of these initiatives collectively operation childwatch was to promote understanding of child labor law and to redress abuses25 strike forces were directed initially toward the retail fastfood grocery and restaurant industries then toward agriculture and the garment industries with others to follow in her annual report for 1990 mrs dole noted the first strike force in march 1990 utilized more than 500 investigators for two full days the results for strike force one show that 4093 cases were initiated disclosing 16385 underage youth illegally employed and estimated civil money penalties of over 54 million the second strike force initiative was oneday effort involving almost all of the wage and hour divisions investigators this strike force was conducted in june before school was out in most areas and before the onset of summer employment for strike force two results 23 bureau of national affairs daily labor report march 16 1990 p a16 24 annual report of the secretary 1988 p 59 25 us congress house committee on education and labor subcommittee on labor standards hearings on the child labor provisions of the fair labor standards act hearings 101st cong 2d sess june 28 july 19 and august 1 1990 p 1617 crs7 show that the division initiated 2149 investigations and found 5877 underage youth illegally employed estimated civil money penalties were more than 2 million the third strike force was held august 14 and 15 using half of the divisions investigators nationwide this strike force was primarily targeted on four industries garment construction the amusement park and recreation industry and agriculture where harvest activities were in progress and in conjunction with the departments ongoing farm labor enforcement activities the results for strike force three show that the division initiated 1334 investigations in which 2198 underage youth were found to be illegally employed and estimated civil money penalties were more than 580000 the fourth strike force was twopronged initiative that took place during the month of september the preliminary results from strike force four as of the end of fy 1990 revealed that 1782 cases were initiated and 1426 underage youth were found illegally employed 26 secretary dole and in some measure secretary mclaughlin did not promulgate new regulations rather they had chosen to enforce standards long in place but frequently it appears violated with impunity27 continuing regulatory reform in late october 1990 the department published proposed rule suggesting changes in three hazardous occupations orders one of which was ho 2 its concern with ho 2 focused upon the issue of 16 and 17 yearold school bus drivers it moved to end that option arguing that 16 and 17 yearold minors generally have more accidents per million miles and per driver than those over 18yearsofage and that 16 and 17yearold drivers lack experience maturity and have poorer judgment than adults it proposed change in the broader exemption under incidental and occasional28 the final rule was issued in november 1991 by which time former representative lynn martin had been appointed secretary of labor the department reviewed the evidence and statements submitted during the comment period it noted that the school bus issue was now largely dead letter only one school district in wyoming was then exercising the option of twelve comments received only those associated with wyoming endorsed employment of 16 and 17 yearold school bus drivers thus the department opted to allow the washakie county wyoming schools to utilize the program through the close of the 19951996 school year thereafter only drivers over 18 yearsofage might be hired with respect to further changes in the ho 2 requirements ie incidental and 26 report of the secretary of labor 1990 p 6667 27 the use of targeting or strike force sweeps continues to be utilized as an enforcement tool see for example nations restaurant news april 6 1998 p 1 and 90 nations restaurant news may 4 1998 p 45 and bureau of national affairs daily labor report april 15 1998 p a6 28 federal register october 23 1990 p 42813 crs8 occasional the department stated that if any such changes are appropriate they should be made the subject of separate rulemaking29 in may 1994 with robert reich as secretary of labor the department proposed general review of federal child labor regulation somewhat similar to that initiated under the reagan administration though with different orientation it called for comment on any area that might be of interest including the incidental and occasional provisions of ho 230 while the department issued revisions of certain regulations in april 1995 modification of ho 2 was not among them31 more broadly the review commenced by secretary reich is ongoing though secretary reich has left office recent development of the issue if reformers child advocates and some members of congress had applauded the more activist enforcementcompliance initiatives of secretary dole the reaction from some segments of the employer community was not supportive and that reaction came swiftly the 103rd congress in april 1994 representative mike kreidler dwash introduced hr 4304 bill to modify the hazardous occupations treatment of minors between 16 and 18 years of age who engaged in the operation of automobiles representative kreidler protested that violation of what he termed an outdated child labor provision had resulted in fines of 197000 against 59 washington state auto dealers after reviewing the statute and the regulations mr kreidler observed typically lot attendants are responsible for moving cars around the lot and washing and preparing cars for customers and on occasion he added these 17yearold employees also fuel vehicles at nearby gas stations he charged that auto dealers were unable to find definition of incidental and occasional and expressed amazement that the department had with unexplained zeal pursued cases against auto dealers he concluded that the word is out that its safer to fire teenager lot attendants than to risk violating law even the department of labor cant define32 the kreidler bill directed that the secretary of labor within one year from enactment amend the regulation governing operation of automobiles and trucks to eliminate the requirement that such operation be only occasional and incidental to the minors employment and to add the requirement that such operation not be the primary duty of the minors employment as the representative explained it the 29 federal register november 20 1991 p

to the house committee on education and labor action was taken on the proposal the 104th congress on july 20 1995 representative randy tate rwash reintroduced the kreidler bill now hr 208934 companion legislation was introduced august 1 1995 by senator gorton s 1099 noting the value of work for young persons senator gorton charged that the federal government is denying young people the opportunity to work in at least one sector of our economy car dealership he stated what we are talking about today is not exploitation but perfectly reasonable actions to drive cars for short distances say from one lot to another across the street or to nearby gas station senator gorton observed the department of labor for reasons which i cannot fathom has imposed almost 200000 worth of fines on dealerships throughout washington state even though the dealerships did not require their 16 and 17yearold employees to drive often or for long time but only in very limited circumstances he stated that s 1099 will be better for car dealerships and better for kids who want to work35 hearings on the tate bill commenced before the house subcommittee on workforce protections on september 12 1996 following opening comments by subcommittee chairman ballenger representative tate appeared as the lead witness he pointed to the unfair manner in which the department of labor had enforced the federal child labor law and which has prevented employers from hiring hundreds of teenagers in my district dol he charged had shifted its interpretation of the statute from occasional and incidental to rare and emergency with respect to workrelated driving by 16 and 17yearolds an unworkable standard in his judgment the department he suggested should have been pursuing other priorities rather than punishing businesses that provide part time jobs and summer jobs to teenagers36 representative tate was followed by edward fitzpatrick an automobile dealer two dealerships with 75 employees from renton washington representing the washington state auto dealers association he said that he had thought the department of labor would be pleased that private business without government subsidy or funding hired these teenagers but instead he was fined 1200 for alleged child labor violations under the fair labor standards act for allowing 33 congressional record april 26 1994 e780 34 representative tate

i was one of nearly 60 dealers in the seattle area that was fined he argued that these dealers had been unfairly fined the washington state auto dealers association he concluded strongly supports the clarification contained in the tate bill37 linda golodner as president of the national consumers league and cochair of the child labor coalition presented different perspective she stressed the safety hazard for persons newly licensed to drive but lacking experience on the road who drive as part of their employment responsibilities teenagers are at risk every time they get behind the wheel she stated citing accident statistics the insurance institute for highway safety reports that the risk of crash involvement per mile driven among drivers 16 to 19 years old is four times the risk among older drivers that risk is highest at age 16 and 17 she presented similar statistics from the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh and contended teenagers are inexperienced drivers they should not be driving on the job while the case of the national automobile dealers association was the immediate topic the standard ho 2 if weakened could have broader implications for example if youth employed at restaurant were asked to deliver pizza to the home of customer type of work in which the pressure for rapid service is intense ms golodner closed her oral testimony by urging congress to uphold safety standards in the face of industry demands to use cheap teenage labor38 the national consumers league she affirmed was strongly opposed to the tate bill39 questioning from the subcommittee was begun by representative ballenger the washington state auto dealers association had complained that enforcement of ho 2 the restriction of jobrelated teen driving had been both unexpected and retroactive mr ballenger queried how retroactive was it mr fitzpatrick deferred to the associations executive vice president janet ramble ms ramble explained that the department aware that auto dealers hired large numbers of young workers and demonstrating renewed interest in compliance with child labor law had created something called strike force and had targeted auto dealers it wasnt she conceded that penalties had been imposed retroactively but rather that the department had unexpectedly increased its enforcement of long existing standard40 in press statement issued the day of the hearing the national 37 hearing op cit 1996 p 1618 in his prepared statement fitzpatrick denied that there was any significant risk involved before we hire anyone including teenagers for position in which they will do any driving dealers thoroughly check the applicants driving record applicants he continued with poor driving records are not hired lot attendants are acutely aware they are entrusted with the companys vehicles and that their jobs are on the line if they drive carelessly they are proud to accept the responsibility because it is significant step in becoming an adult p 22 he summarized his experience with the department of labor as the kind of overzealous enforcement that makes businesses and the public lose faith in government p 23 38 hearing op

their strong support for the tategorton legislation41 meanwhile those supporting modification of ho 2 growing impatient about achieving direct amendment of the flsa sought action through an alternative route ie the appropriations process in hr 3755 providing appropriations for the department of labor language had been added that would have prevented the department from spending funds for enforcement or the issuance of fines under ho 2 passed by the house the language was stripped from the bill in the senate though the legislation ultimately died at the close of the 104th congress action taken by the 105th congress auto dealers in washington state the new york times reported in the spring of 1998 say it never occurred to them that they could be breaking the law by giving parttime jobs to 16 and 17yearolds and so the times added the auto dealers came to congress for law that would supersede the dol regulation darlene adkins of the national consumers league viewed the situation differently what were seeing is this trend of employers industries and associations getting penalized for child labor violations and instead of saying we need to fix this problem and comply with the law theyre putting pressure on legislators to change the law42 committee consideration in the house on july 31 1997 representative combest43 introduced hr 2327 the bill titled the drive for teen employment act was considered and markedup by the subcommittee on workforce protections march 6 1998 it was ordered reported from the full committee on education and the workforce on april 1 during full committee markup representative fawell cosponsor of hr 2327 argued that the departmental requirement significantly restricts the ability of teenagers to gain valuable experience in the workplace and has created confusion for many businesses as result he stated there have been number of employers primarily automobile dealerships which have been fined thousands of 40 continued was established to review regulations on employment of minors these regulations had remained essentially unchanged for 50 years p 11 ms ramble for the automobile dealers argued that the department had altered its approach to ho 2 but that it didnt notify anyone that they had reinterpreted incidental and occasional to mean emergency only the policy changed internally and they penalized people 41

drive cars from one lot to another or to nearby gas station for refueling he expressed his strong support for the measure44 conversely the bill was opposed by dol secretary alexis herman in letter of committee chairman goodling expressed concern that the result of this legislation may be an increase in the number of automobilerelated injuries and deaths caused by very young and inexperienced drivers on the job she noted that many young persons in the targeted age group 16 to 17 yearsofage will have just been licensed to drive and were the legislation adopted would be spending as much as onefifth of their workweek behind the wheel on public roads and highways she stated that the option would not be limited to auto dealerships sixteen and 17year old youths could be employed to deliver pizzas or to shuttle passengers to and from hotels for example as long as they did not exceed the 20 percent limitation types of work she identified as fastpaced and highly competitive the secretary concluded we believe that responsible public policy dictates that any modifications to weaken child labor protections be carefully weighed against the potential harm to the health and safety of these young people45 floor consideration in the house on september 28 representative fawell moved to suspend the rules and to bring hr 2327 to the floor through the legislative process the earlier kreidler and tategorton and combest bills had been expanded to include much of the regulatory language that dol had earlier developed with certain other restrictive provisions as called up for floor action hr 2327 presented two general thrusts first it provided that under the child labor provisions of the flsa employees who are under 17 years of age may not drive automobiles or trucks on public roadways thus the discretion of the department of labor in establishing conditions under which 16yearolds might drive was eliminated decision that strengthened the child labor protections of the act second occupational driving by 17yearolds was permitted only if certain conditions were met these included such operation is restricted to daylight hours b the employee holds state license valid for the type of driving involved in the job performed and has record of any moving violation at the time of hire c the employee has successfully completed state approved driver education course d the automobile or truck is equipped with seat belt for the driver and any passengers and the employees employer has instructed the 44 statement of representative harris fawell at markup of hr 2327 april 1 1998 45

incidental is more than onethird of an employees worktime in any workday and more than 20 percent of an employees worktime in any workweek the proposed language added the provision that the term occasional and incidental shall apply to all pending cases actions or citations in which final judgment has not been entered except that it shall not apply to any case action or citation involving property damage or personal injury thus certain pending cases flowing from prior dol enforcement actions would be voided46 the legislation representative fawell explained was basically response to what was perceived to have been inconsistent dol policy he recalled that the current interpretation of dol regulations had resulted in enforcement actions 46 congressional record september 28 1998 p h9124h9125 various provisions had been under discussion over the years in hr 1106 of the 103rd congress representative lantos while recognizing the need for some driving by youth workers would have set the age limit at 17 years while requiring that occupational driving be limited to 20 percent of the minors work in any workday and may not exceed 5 percent of the minors work in any workweek again on september 12 1996 representative green of texas had written to subcommittee chairman ballenger suggesting the following changes in the tate bill 1 limit to onethird the time minor is allowed to operate an automobile and 2 limit to 50 mile radius the distance minor is allowed to operate an automobile in the senate the language dealing with the effective date and retroactive immunity would be subjected to technical amendment while retaining its substance see congressional record october 12 1998 p s12397 crs14 against certain employers who had advance notice of what the departments policy was he opined not only is the departments current interpretation not consistent with the regulation itself but it has had the effect of denying important job opportunities for teenagers without any demonstrated increase in safety as result innocent small business owners have been fined by the department of labor on the basis of an interpretation of regulation of which they did not even have notice representative fawell reviewed the legislation that the committee had markedup noting that subsequent negotiations between the sponsors of the bill and the department had resulted in compromise language quoted above which was more protective of youth workers than the original proposal47 representative ford termed the compromise bipartisan and commended the various advocates of protection for young workers for their insights and persistence which had resulted in legislation addressing many of the legitimate concerns that had been raised he took note of the high accident rate associated with younger drivers observed that while 16yearolds would longer be allowed to engage in occupational driving at all the regulations governing such activity on the part of 17 yearolds had been strengthened mr ford terms the result sensible balance48 as debate continued the focus returned to the specific case of the automobile dealers there are many young people male and female who have gotten their start working parttime at an auto dealership representative andrews observed frankly if the young person is not permitted to drive on occasion his or her value to the auto dealer as an employer is rather diminished the bill mr andrews argued is really youth employment bill49 representative blumenauer taking regional focus pointed to the auto dealers of the pacific northwest pretty straightahead folks good public citizens and easy to work with upon whom had been imposed over 200000 in fines for violation of child labor requirements the process by which the new rule was adopted i think was bad the fines were worse but like mr andrews he emphasized the youth employment impact the loss of jobs by teenagers deprived of the option of occupational driving these were jobs that gave young people the opportunity to earn money and gain career building experience mr blumenauer stated50 representative green an early sponsor of legislation to revise the requirements affecting occupational driving by teens applauded the clear definition of the limited driving allowed by the bill and pointed to the clear guidelines for employers who hire such workers his fellow texan mr combest affirmed long interest in reforming regulations that do not pass what i call the stupid test i believe he added the teen driver regulation is poster child for failing the 47 congressional

test like representative blumenauer mr combest pointed to what he viewed as flawed rulemaking system at dol the department of labor made major regulatory change in the working definition of what incidental and occasional meant for licensed 16 and 17 year olds driving in the workplace the department did this with formal rule making and without informing any small businesses businesses first learned of the change when they received fines for non compliance representative combest affirmed that as sponsors of the legislation we simply seek to bring clearer more reasonable standard for workers and business51 members appeared in opposition to the legislation which was adopted on voice vote52 senate action and final passage hr 2327 arrived in the senate on october 1 1998 on october 12 senator jeffords chair of the committee on labor and human resources sought unanimous consent to have the bill brought up for immediate consideration he also proposed technical amendment that altered the wording but not the substance of the provision dealing with the effective date and with retroactive immunity for employers against whom fines had been imposed without objection and without debate the measure was approved53 the amended bill was returned to the house on october 1354 later that afternoon following brief discussion by proponents of the measure the senate amendment was accepted by voice vote the bill was passed55 on october 31 1998 the legislation was signed by the president 51 congressional record september 28 1998 p h9127 representative combest noted that the legislation has been endorsed by the national small business united national automobile dealers association national community pharmacists association and the national association of minority automobile dealers 52

h10796h10798 crs16 some general considerations as signed into law hr 2327 pl 105334 appears to have been product of compromise some regarded it as noncontroversial56 that it was considered both in the house and in the senate under unanimous consent and without recorded vote might confirm that assessment however number of questions may still arise as the statute is implemented rulemaking vs legislation development of standards under which young persons new to the worldof work may be safely employed is complicated undertaking initially in 1938 congress established broad framework for such regulation and left its finetuning to the secretary of labor through the years the secretary has dealt with that issue through the rulemaking process ie suggesting policy publishing proposed regulation inviting comment and after extended evaluation publishing final rule such rule could then be further modified if necessary through the same process even when the regular rulemaking process is followed scrupulously which it may not have been in the case of the teen drivers the result can be time consuming and frustrating general review of federal child labor regulation commenced early in the reagan administration and concluded without achieving its putative intent ie the existing regulations were neither changed nor affirmed to be appropriate then late in the reagan administration the department created special child labor advisory committee which conferred and consulted into the bush administration and expired by the time the clinton administration came into office in 1994 under secretary reich the department commenced another general review of the federal regulation of child labor process that is ongoing it may be that the dol regards the existing child labor regulations that it has developed including ho 2 as functioning well and without need of major change but in the enforcement of existing child labor regulations some have argued that dol has been neither precise clear nor consistent position voiced with some vigor by the automobile dealers associations at the same time some proponents of the regulation believe that it is inappropriate to weaken the system of hazardous occupations orders over issues that are essentially administrative the precise restriction of employment of youth workers within the context of sometimes rapidly changing workplace some might argue may lend itself more nearly to regulation than to statute in the case of young persons employed by pacific northwest automobile dealers who drove as part of that employment it would appear that the system was not entirely responsive as the issue emerged the washington automobile dealers called upon the secretary to reexamine the existing regulations at least in part the automobile dealers suggested that there had been failure of communication between the department and employers that internal interpretive changes in policy 56 congressional record october 13 1998 p h10797 crs17 had not been made known effectively to the auto dealerships prior to enhanced enforcement initiatives57 in march 1994 senator gorton with nine house members from washington had sought secretary reichs intervention to prevent an injustice against large number of auto dealers in washington state who are unintentionally at odds with an undefined department of labor regulation the letter stated that the senator and the signatory members had been advised by the auto dealers one from the department of labor has ever communicated to them an interpretation of incidental and occasional driving that is at odds with this contested practice in fact it was only during the current compliance audit that the dealers first learned of an internal department of labor interpretation meaning driving only in an emergency andor not more than once or twice per year an interpretation found nowhere in law or regulation mr secretary we believe that the vast majority of auto dealers in our state have sincerely attempted to comply with the law and regulation as they are written they have reviewed the law and the regulation they have consulted their national and state trade associations on compliance matters it affirmed we share their frustration that they are being penalized for violating phrase which the department has been unable to define in its own regulations58 in retrospect it appears dol would have preferred an administrative solution in the ho 2 case in september 12 1996 letter to chairman ballenger of the subcommittee on workplace protections secretary reich reviewed the departments opposition to the tate bill and concluded that dol believes that these issues should be dealt with through the rulemaking process59 in march 31 1998 letter to chairman goodling of the committee on education and the workforce secretary herman expressed the same view as general matter it is preferable to address such issues through notice and comment rulemaking rather than legislation60 but some employers and members of congress may have lost confidence in the agency rulemaking option litigation continued with respect to past violators perhaps not an insignificant matter therefore direct legislative involvement resulted the impact for future rulemaking during hearings on another aspect of the flsa the former chair of the senate committee on labor and human resources senator kassebaum

12 1996 60 secretary of labor alexis herman to representative william goodling march 31 1998 crs18 that what was once simple process has given rise to confusing maze of rules and regulations about how the law should be applied in each workplace61 that maze of rules and regulations however did not develop spontaneously rather they have resulted from the form and structure of the legislation dol was asked to implement as development of hr 2327 proceeded some questioned whether the legislation was practical ie were its terms sufficiently precise the impetus for the teen driver bill after all had stemmed at least in part from dols interpretation of the language of existing regulations but even with explicit definitions interpretive questions may well arise some may be rooted in unforeseen circumstances for example if youth were on the road at dusk 30 mile radius is allowed and drove back after dark to his employers establishment would that be violation his operation of the vehicle is permitted only during daylight hours further pl 105334 requires that only onethird of an employees worktime in any workday may be given over to driving similarly more than 20 percent of an employees worktime in any workweek if youthful driver were 25 miles from her place of employment caught in traffic jam and her third of workday expired before she returned to her place of business has violation occurred at minimum such situations seem to imply the need for very careful planning in the utilization of ones workforce and for equally careful record keeping and compliance inspection must the employer review time sheets for youth workers assess length of likely travel time including any mishap and then send out only driver with undeniably ample time to complete the triperrand before expiration of her third of workday and early enough to avoid darkness however defined62 such contingencies may need to be dealt with in regulations or opinion letters developed by dol regulations as free as possible from ambiguity so that they are clearly and easily understood by employers workers and departmental compliance staff each nuance of policy each regulatory provision could provide an occasion were enforcement strict for sanctions judgment will be required both in development and implementation of the regulations for administering pl 105334 on such issues there may well be disagreement and thus some measure of dispute may continue even in the wake of congressional action the safety factor little may be expected from most 17 yearold workers in the way of prior training or skill however in the context of pl 105334 there is one critical skill that such workers must possess ie the ability to drive the question remains as to how safely such teen workers may drive are young persons for whatever reasons more likely to experience risks in the workplace than older persons 61 us congress senate committee on labor and human resources oversight of the fair labor standards act hearings 104th cong 2nd sess february 27 1996 p 1 62 youth worker would still be subject to workhours limitations during periods when school was in session as well as some variation depending upon whether the workday was immediately prior to school day factors further complicating employer calculations crs19 in the state of washington where the issue of teen drivers seems initially to have surfaced an analysis for the period 19881991 found that 16 and 17 yearolds appear to have an overall workrelated injury rate more than three times greater than for adults for each hour worked63 within the 16 to 17yearold cohort it was found that the injury rate for males is almost two times greater than that for females the report speculated that the higher rate of injury among males might result from propensity for males to work in more hazardous jobs and to exhibit more risktaking or reckless behavior64 speaking generally the report suggested that adolescents are highrisk group for occupational injury and explained this increased risk is due to the differences between adults and adolescents in development size maturity experience and judgment risktaking behavior is typical characteristic of adolescence sic as they explore their capabilities but often lack perception of their limitations and vulnerability in workplace setting teens may not feel capable of refusing to do task that is inappropriate or dangerous especially if desire exists to be treated more like and adult than child and the report added they may also believe that they would not be asked to do something if it is considered dangerous65 when in 1990 secretary dole published the proposed rule dealing inter alia with ho 2 the advisory committee had recommended that there be exemption from the age restraints because among other concerns 16 and 17yearold drivers lack experience maturity and have poorer judgment than adults and further that in comparison to adult drivers 16 and 17yearold minors generally have more accidents per million miles and per driver the department observed based upon data from the national transportation safety board the accident rate per million miles for 16 and 17yearold drivers was 127 for 198283 140 for 198384 and 132 for 198485 the accident rate per million miles for 18yearold and older drivers was 81 100 and 9266 more recently the insurance institute for highway safety observed that while the overall driver death rate not accident rate declined during 197596 from 15 to 12 per 100000 licensed drivers that for 16yearolds was trending upward the institute stated the rate increased among 16yearold drivers from 19 per 100000 in 1975 to 35 per 100000 licensed drives in 1996 and the increase occurred among both males and females conversely the death rate among older teens has been declining slightly data arent available to assess why the death rate for the youngest drivers is going up while rates are trending down among older drivers even older teenagers institute vice president allan williams offers what he terms the 63 state of washington department of labor and industries occupational injuries among adolescents in washington state

adults 64 ibid p 37 65 ibid p 1 66 federal register october 23 1990 p 42813 crs20 most plausible hypothesis that 16 yearolds are driving more in highrisk circumstances and he adds maybe 16 yearolds are getting easier access to cars than they used to the institute concluded that restrictions on driving by teens ought to be increased and urged system of graduated licensing as has been adopted in number of jurisdictions67 through the years the data may vary somewhat as they may from one agency to another depending upon methodology but the general pattern appears consistent younger less experienced drivers have relatively high accident rates where driving on public roads or in other public areas is concerned some have argued the bottom line must be safety the safety of our children and of all of us who travel on public thoroughfares68 the department of labor responding to its mandate from the congress has emphasized the safety factor requiring that where young persons are expected to drive as part of their work obligation that requirement should not be more than occasional and incidental should be strictly of limited nature and should not be preferred activity others not wholly in disagreement have suggested that the market may provide its own protection it might be argued that employers with expensive equipment and insurance obligations have vested interest in safe driving practices on the part of their staff there are some of my colleagues who will say that this legislation will endanger teenagers observed representative fawell an active supporter of hr 2327 but the fact of the matter is that teens do drive and they are safer when driving at work with these restrictions than they would be outside of work69 67 statement released by the virginiabased insurance institute for highway safety april 14 1998 the institute pointed out that since 1996 six states california florida georgia michigan north carolina and ohio have adopted programs that include essential elements of graduated licensing such elements include six months or more in learning phase during which supervision is required then theres another six months to year in an intermediate licensing phase during which unsupervised driving isnt allowed in highrisk situations but williams concluded the majority of states still allow quick and easy access to licenses 68 hearings op cit
