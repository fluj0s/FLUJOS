agencys internal management and politic ization after withdrawing the united states continued to participate in some unesco programs on voluntary basis in addition the united states sent observers to all the biennial unesco general conferences and the twice year meetings of the executive board the groups that set the budget and program priorities for unesco the department of state maintained permanent observer mission at unesco in paris and american s have attended most of the important meetings of unesco what is unesco unesco is one of the specialized agencies of the united nations system it is an autonomous international organization with its own constitu tion separate budget and program it is affiliated with the united nations through an agreement signed in 1946 the unesco constitution was adopted as an international agreement at conference held in london in 1945 and it entered into force on november 4 1946 the unesco headquarters is in paris and the organization currently has 190 members the purpose of unesco as outlined in its constitution is to contribute to peace and security by promoting collaboration among member states in the fields of education science

conservation of books monuments and works of art and assist mber states in developing educational scientific and cultural programs unesco provides an international forum for collaboration among nations in educat ion science and culture the unesco website provides information on its programs and fields of activity httpwwwunescoorg unescos structure the unesco organization consists of general conference an executive board and secretariat general conference the general conference composed of representatives of member countries meets every other ear to decide the policy program and budget of the organization unesco decisi ons on important questions are made by consensus all members must agree on re solution before it is adopted the result is that resolutions approved are not very specific even on budgetary items the most recent meeting of the general conferen ce took place from september 29 to october 17 2003 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30985crs4 executive board the executive board consisting of 58 representatives of member states meets at leas t twice year and is responsible for supervising the program adopted by the general conference the united states was elected to the

and the directorgeneral also plays an important role in the negotiations between members over programs budg ets and resolutions unescos budget and programs unescos activities are financed through contributions assessed against member states on sliding scale throug h voluntary contributions of member states to special programs and through funds provi ded by other agencies such as the united

country us participation in unesco us membership in unesco was blished by pl 79565 the joint resolution that authorized the president to join the organization directed him to establish the us national commission fo r unesco and authorized the annual appropriation of funds for unesco us participation in what was to become unesco had previously been urged by congress in identical house and senate resolutions adopted unanimously in may 1945 us withdrawal from unesco 198384 on december 28 1983 the secretary of st ate notified the directorgeneral of unesco that the united states was termin ating membership in the organization us withdrawal took place on december 31 1984 the decision was the result of six month assessment of the agency according to the administration which concluded that unesco programs and pe rsonnel were heavily politicized and that extraneous political discussions had become the major focus of the organization the report also noted that statist theories prevailed over western democratic ideas in the programs and that budget prior ities had not been established so that programs proliferated with rationale many american observers also objected tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30985crs5 selfaggrandizement and hostility to the united states on the part of unesco directorgeneral mbow article 2 section 6 of the unesco c onstitution ou tlines the procedures for withdrawal from the organization under th is section member is required to give written notice of withdrawal to the direct orgeneral of unesco the withdrawal goes into effect on december 31 of the year following the notice of withdrawal the member must honor its financial obligations to unesco during the 1 year of the waiting period issues cited in withdrawal politicization historically unesco has been most often criticized for its actions concerning israel in 1974 and for atte mpts to redefine human rights in way many critics felt favored coll ective over individual rights as well as economic rights over civil and political rights the 18th session 1974 of the unesco general conference adopted three resolutions condemning israel in respons to these resolutions congress amended the foreign assistance act of 1974 pl 93 559 to direct that funds could be obligated or spent to support unesco until the president certified that unesco 1 had adopted policies fully consistent with its educati onal scientific and cultural objectives and 2 had taken concrete steps to correct its recent actions of primarily political character in keeping with th is limitation congress did not authorize or appropriate funds for the rest of cale ndar 1974 and for all of calendar 1975 and 1976 in 1976 congress authorized pl 94 350 and appropr iated pl 94362 3545453 the minimum contribution required to retain the us right to vote in the unesco general conference at the 19th general conference in 197 6 israel was allowed to join the european regional group thereby ending its isolation in the organization however two other resolutions which condemned isr ael remained in force president ford certified that unesco had satisfied the pr ovisions of the foreign assistance act of 1974 and asked for full restoration of unesco contributions congress appropriated only part of the funds required to make up the us arrearage paying for 25 years of the 4year shortfall in 1978 congress appropriate d us contributions to unesco for the rest of the funds ow ed to unesco these included calendar year 1977 and all of calendar year 1978 and 1979 the israel issue continues to be problem throughout the system hostility towards the basic inst itutions of free society the administration was also concerned bout unesco activities in international communications particularly the concep t of the new world information and communications order nwico during the early 1970s developing countries called for new order in in ternational communications these countries contended that small number of veloped countries provide most of the worlds news coverage entertainment and advertising resulting in poor coverage of news in developing countries even within these c ountries themselves this poor coverage the argument continued led to poor unders tanding of these countries their cultures and their development needs many west ern countries including the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30985crs6 conceded that an imbalance existed in global news covera ge but questioned unescos response the unesco initia tives included declaration on the media presented to the general conferen ce in 1976 and modifications added to this declaration at subsequent general conferences one article of the original declaration asserted that s tates are responsible for the activities in the international sphere of all mass media under their juri sdiction this ssertion was strongly opposed by western delegates who saw it as threat to freedom of the press final action was ever taken on the new worl d information order nor have any of the other initiatives calling for licensing journa lists setting codes of ethical conduct for journalists or establishi ng advertising codes been adopted by unesco congress reacted to nwico proposals in the state department authorization bill for fy1982 and fy1983 pl 97241 this law provided that none of the appropriated funds coul d be used to pay the us c ontribution to the assessed budget of unesco if that organization implement s any policy or procedure the effect of which is to license journalists or their pub lications within or among countries or to impose mandatory codes of jour nalistic practice or ethics unrestrained budgetary expansion the third area of concern was unescos lack of adherence to the zero net program growth proposed for all international agencies by the united states the reagan administration came into office with goals for all organizati ons which included restraining budget growth zero net program growth meant new di scretionary costs and an absorption of nondiscretionary costs this meant that there would be real growth in the agencies budgets although allowances were made for fluctuating exchange rates in fact it would have resulted in f unding reduction since automatically rising personnel costs would require reductions in other areas administration spokesmen also criticized alleged management problems and what they described as high overhead costs very large percentage of unesco expenditures were made in its paris headquarters and low pe rcentage were made in the field during hearing of the house science and technology committee on march 8 1984 us ambassador to unesco jean gerard described problem s of duplicative prog rams and confusing and incomplete budgetary information on programs at the 1982 extraordinary session of the general conference which met to establish unescos 19841989 medium term plan the directo rgeneral proposed 9 increase in the budget government legates voted for real growth rate in 1984 and 1985 of 4 to 6 over the 1982 1983 expenditures this was adopted despite opposition from the united states and other major donor countries the countries that abstained or voted against the growth rate at the meeting contributed 85 of unescos assessed budget accordin g to the department of state at the 1983 general conference proposal by the united states and five allies to set the twoyear budget at 3606 milli on was rejected compromise proposal offered by the nordic countries tting the budget at 3744 million was accepted by 126 to 1 united states voting against with 10 abstentions this amount represented real growth rate between 38 and 55 for the twoyear period according to the administration mr mbow in his reply to secretary of state shultz on jan 18 1984 pointed out that in constant dollars the unesco budget had declined from the 19811983 level by 13 the wide difference between these two statements resultedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30985crs7 from using different financia l data such as constant dollars vs current dollars french francs versus dollars etc issues surrounding directorgeneral mbow although it was not reflected in the shultz letter of withdrawal many perceived that large part of the us unhappiness with unesco centered on the directorgener assistant secretary newell on februa ry 22 1984 critic ized mr mbow for not using his office to keep unesco from straying into extraneous political areas on march 5 1984 in meeting of us government nd nongovernmental agencies involved in unesco science programs assistant secretary of state newell also noted critics concern that mr mbow had demoralized the employees of the secretariat he cited an employee survey which showed only 3 of unesco employees felt promotions were based on merit assistant secretary of state newell expressed concern that many funded staff positions remained unf illed for long periods of time and accounting of the mone saved was made us domestic budget issues in order to reduce the size of the budget in time of growing deficits and to accommodate other congressional and administration priorities congress appropriated th amount requested 5077 million for unesco for fy1984 but also pa ssed provision which froze aggregate us contributions to the five largest international organizations including unesco for calendar 1984 appropriated in the fy1984 and fy1985 budgets at the same level as the calendar 1983 contribution spite increased assessments for these agencies this meant that unesco could receive more than the calendar year 1983 contribution unless the contribution to one of the other agencies was reduced the amount provided by the united states as its final contribution to unesco was matter of contention between the unite d states unesco and the other major donors the final appropriation of 254 million was finally accepted as full payment however withdrawal from une sco and the reduced final contribution allowed the united states to contribute to the other four agencies at the assessed level later congress cut the cio appropriation further leading to arrearages in us contributions to many of the organizations in the cio account administrations actions in march 1984 the department of state named 13member unesco monitoring panel which was to report to the secretary of state on the degree and types of changes made by unesco during 1984 to assist the secretary in deciding whether to recommend that the us withdrawal decision be reviewed their final report given to secretary of state shultz on november 27 and released on december 13 1984 outlined several concre steps taken by the unesco membership during 1984 to initiate reform but c oncluded that there was substantial change in the organization the state department also began search for alternatives to carry out the missions of unesco the national cademy of sciences asked to study alternative arrangements for unesco scientific programs noted that there was single alternative to unesco in the scientific field and expressed concern about the possible fragmentation of scientific programs without single agency alternative the academy was also concerned about di sruptions to intern ational scientifichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30985crs8 cooperative programs and us participation caused by us withdrawal it identified needed us expenditures of 14 million to arrange interim funding for programs of greatest interest to the united states response at unesco in may 1984 the directorgeneral suggested several changes he wished to make in the secretariat including 1 the legation to one of his subordinates an american of the power to appoint st aff to vacant positions up to certain professional level 2 crea tion of five working groups to identify program duplication and to establish priorities within the program sectors for consideration during the next budget cycle to revi ew unesco budgeting techniques and make recommendations for improvements nd to review mana gement and make recommendations the unesco executive board established temporary committee of 12 members to examine proposals and sugge stions for reform of unesco us observers noted that some movement towa rd reform occurred at the meeting but disagreed over the significance and permanence of the reform effort the board endorsed the recommendations of its temporary committ ee and extended its life to oversee implementation of the recommenda tions the board also recommended zero growth budget for the 198687 bie nnium and gave the directorgeneral guidelines for preparing his program budget which address us concerns in testimony before congress assistant secretary of state newell stated that the reform effort was inadequate he indicated there was implementing machinery for the temporary committee recommendations the management changes did not go far enough and programs which the united states criticized had not been eliminated or reduced he also stated th at the zero growth budget resolution was amended to leave open the possibility of 2 growth rate for 19861987 finally he noted that us proposals to protect the rights and interests of western governments who are in the minority in unesco were not accepted and alternatives were suggested assistant secretary newell ruled out the possibility that us withdrawal would be postponed for one year he reiterate d that the state department intended to devote the same 47 million to internati onal programs in the unesco areas including several unesco programs by funneling funds through 18 us and international agencies congressional reaction to withdrawal on november 30 1984 the general accounting office gao released review of the fiscal and management activities of unesco the report confirmed the problems noted by the united states in its letter of withdrawal in the area of management it also made observations on the ineffectiveness of the executive board and general conference in controlling and directing the unesco secretariathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30985crs9 2 extract from press conference by the fo reign secretary mr robin cook and the defense secretary mr george robertson at the weu minister ial meeting paris tuesday 13may 1997on march 2 1984 the house adopted hr 5119 the foreign assistance authorization act of 1985 one provision of the act outlined the administrations concerns in unesco and expresse d the sense of congress that 1 the president should create bipartisan panel of experts to review us participation in unesco including the impact withdraw would have on israels participation in unesco and on freedom of the press and report to the congress by october 1 1984 2 the president should upgrade the us mission to unesco and the appropriate office of the department of state in order to ensure fair and thorough examination of unescos willingness to implement needed reforms and 3 the president shall not make or announce final withdrawal decision until the relevant committees of the congress have been fully consulted representative leach introduced two proposals on unesco one which amended the original unesco implementing legislation to require the president to have specific legislative authorization before withdrawing from unesco and one which would postpone us withdrawal from unesco by 1 year to december 31 1985 none of this became law during 1984 house and senate committees held several hearings on unesco most of the private witnesses at all these hearings disapproved of us withdrawal from unesco despite the universally acknowledged problems existing in that agency withdrawal by the united kingdom on december 5 1984 the government of the united kingdom formally notified unesco of withdrawal from unesco on december 31 1985 the notification acknowledged that there had been prog ress toward reform during 1984 and outlined nine specific areas where further reforms would be necessary to change the decision of the british government britain was accused by other members including some western governments of basing its deci sion on the misleading information provided by us ambassador to unesco jean gerard during secret lobbying trip in november the united kingdom rejoined unesco in 1997 with foreign secretary robin cook stating that unesco is ve ry important international organization covering the educational cultural and scientific world he indicated that it was important that britain because of its ow n very wide international links should be part of

will need to continue over the long term if unesco is to fully implement our recommendations and solidify its recent management improvements4 after an interagency review the department of state recommended to the national security council in june 1993 that the united states rejoin unesco at the next general conference october 1995 in letter to the secretary general in november 1995 president

president bush nominated louise v liver as permanent us representative to unesco on september 17 2003 and the unite d states rejoined the organization on october 1 2003 issues of rejoining many observers are convinced that th political concerns raised during the 1970s and 1980s which led to the us wit hdrawal have either been addressed or have disappeared from the international age nda for other reasons such as the end of the cold war issues surrounding israel while not currently problem in unesco are perennial system problems which are likely to continue until the situation in the
