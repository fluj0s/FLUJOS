from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to keith briffa kbriffaueaacukphil jones pjonesueaacuk subject fwd mbh98 date wed 12 nov 2003 110122 0000 xflowed keith and phil you will have seen stephen mcintyres request to us we need to talk about it though my initial feeling is that we should turn it down with carefully wordedexplained reason as another interrim stage and prefer to make our input at the peerreview stage in the meantime here is an email copied below to mike mann from mcintyre requesting data and programs and making other criticisms i do wish mike had not rushed around sending out preliminary and incorrect early responses the waters are really muddied now he would have done better to have taken things slowly and worked out final response before publicising this stuff excel files other files being created early or now deleted is really confusing things anyway because mcintyre has now asked mann directly for his data and programs his request that we send mcintyres request to mann has been dropped i would have said anyway so its just the second bit that we review part 2 of this response that needs to be answered cheers tim from steve mcintyre smcintyrecgxenergycom to michael mann mannvirginiaedu cc tim osborn tosbornueaacuk ross mckitrick rmckitriuoguelphca subject mbh98 date tue 11 nov 2003 233946 0500 november 11 2003 professor michael mann school of earth sciences university of virginia dear professor mann we apologize for not sending you copy of our recent paper mm in energy and environment for comment as we understood from your email of september 25 2003 that time constraints prevented you from considering our material we notice that you seem to have subsequently changed your mind and hope that you will both be able to clarify some points for us and to rectify the public record on other points 1 you have claimed that we used the wrong data and the wrong computational methodology we would like to reconcile our results to actual data and methodology used in mbh98 we would therefore appreciate copies of the computer programs you actually used to read in data the 159 data series referred to in your recent comments and construct the temperature index shown in nature 1998 mbh98 either through email or preferably through public ftp or web posting 2 in some recent comments you are reported as stating that we requested an excel file and that you instead directed us to an ftp site for the mbh98 data you are also reported as saying that despite having pointed us to the ftp site you and your colleague took trouble to prepare an excel spreadsheet but inadvertently introduced some collation errors at that time in fact as you doubt recall we did not request an excel spreadsheet but specifically asked for an ftp location which you were unable or unwilling to provide nor was an excel spreadsheet ever supplied to us instead we were given text file pcproxytxt nor was this file created in april 2003 after we learned on october 29 2003 that the pertinent data was reported to be located on your ftp site ftpholoceneevscvirginiaedupubftpholoceneevscvirginiaedupub and that we were being faulted for not getting it from there we examined this site and found it contains the exact same file pcproxytxt as the one we received bearing date of creation of august 8 2002 on october 29 2003 your ftp site also contained the file pcproxymat matlab file the header to which read matlab 50 matfile platform sol2 created on thu aug 8 101819 2002 both files contain identical data to the file pcproxytxt emailed to one of us mcintyre in april 2003 including all collation errors fills and other problems identified in mm it is therefore clear that the file pcproxytxt as sent to us was not prepared in april 2003 in response to our requests nor was it prepared as an excel spreadsheet but in fact it was prepared many months earlier with matlab it is also clear that had we gone to your ftp site earlier we would simply have found the same data collation as we received from scott rutherford would you please forthwith issue statement withdrawing and correcting your earlier comments 3 in reported comments you also claimed that we overlooked the collation errors in pcproxytxt and slid the incorrect data into our calculations statement which is untrue and made without reasonable basis in mm we described numerous errors including but not limited to the collation errors indicating quite obviously that we noticed the data problems we then describe how we firewalled our data from the errors contained in the data you provided us by recollating tree ring proxy data from original sources and carrying out fresh principal component calculations we request that you forthwith withdraw the claim that we deliberately used data we knew to be in error 4 on november 8 2003 when we revisited your ftp site we noticed the following changes since october 29 2003 1 the file pcproxymat had been deleted from your ftp site 2 the file pcproxytxt longer was displayed under the sdr directory where it had previously been located although it could still be retrieved through an exact call if one previously knew the exact file name 3 without any notice new file named mbhfilledmat prepared on november 4 2003 had been inserted into the directory obviously the files pcproxymat and pcproxytxt are pertinent to the comments referred to above and we view the deletion of pcproxymat from the archival record under the current circumstances as unjustifiable would you please restore these files to your ftp site together with an annotated text file documenting the dates of their deletion and restoration 5 we note that the new file mbhfilledmat is an array of dimension 381x2016 could you state whether this file has any connection to mbh98 and if so please explain the purpose of this file why it has been posted now and why it was not previously available at the ftp site 6 can you advise us whether the directory mbh98 has been subdirectory within the folder pub since july 30 2002 or whether it was transferred from another possibly private directory at date after july 30 2002 if the latter could you advise on the date of such transfer we have prepared 3part response to your reply to mm the first which we have released publicly goes over some of the matters raised in points 25 above the second is undergoing review it deals with additional issues of data quality and disclosure resulting from inspection of your ftp site since october 29 2003 the third part will consider the points made in your response both in terms of data and methodology and will attempt careful reconciliation of our calculation methods hence the necessity of our request in point 1 thank you for your attention yours truly stephen mcintyre ross
