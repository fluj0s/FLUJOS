deputy secretary of energy poneman and ambassador met december 10 with prime minister hamad bin jassim thani hbj to discuss energy research and development critical infrastructure protection and iran hbj indicated qatars interest in bilateral critical infrastructure protection partnership the pm was skeptical about the plausibility of iranian acceptance of nuclear compromise saying he would be shocked if iran abided by deal to ship lowenriched uranium leu out of iran the best way to deal with the iranians he said is to get them to dictate the terms of any such deal the us and its partners should strive to get the iranians to put the details in writing including timetables for implementation hbj characterized qatars relationship with iran as one in which they lie to us and we lie to them according to hbj the goq tells iran that it should listen to the wests proposal or there will be military action if not by the us then by the israelis by the middle of next year end key points 1 c deputy secretary of energy daniel poneman and ambassador met december 10 with prime minister hamad bin jassim thani also present on the american side was state department coordinator for

critical infrastructure protection 2 c the deputy secretary extended usg appreciation to the prime minister for qatars support for the victims of hurricane katrina the pm observed in response that we might have our own katrina an apparent reference to security concerns arising from qatars relationship with iran deputy secretary offered us help to qatar in protecting its critical infrastructure and in addressing its broader security concerns expressing interest in critical infrastructure protection hbj said he would talk to the ministries of energy and interior on how best to take advantage of us assistance science and technology investment 3 c the deputy secretary raised science and technology investment noting doe interest in partnering with the goq on energyrelated research and development projects as an example of possible cooperation depsec poneman cited computer simulation emphasizing that the doe national laboratories are international leaders in the field 4 c the deputy secretary reported that doe had recently invested in nanotechnology program and cited this as another possible area of cooperation telling the pm there are additional opportunities for goq partnerships with private labs shaykh hamad immediately expressed strong interest in nanotechnology and asked the depsec to provide him with paper on that subject the depsec agreed and added that he would be pleased to host shaykh hamad at the sandia nanotechnology facility or another national lab 5 c turning to genomics and solar technology as they relate to food production and qatars national food security program shaykh hamad told the deputy secretary that he supported research in those fields but expressed his opinion that qatars investment in food and solar technology must be done on commercial basis s irans nuclear program 6 s depsec poneman asked hbj for his views on irans nuclear program the deputy secretary noted that the usg had entered into recent discussions with iran not out of naivet but as an effort to address humanitarian concern the need for medical isotopes while also attempting to remove meaningful amount of special nuclear material even though the effort had not to date resulted in iranian agreement it had borne fruit in the form of russian and chinese support for the most recent resolution of the iaea board of governors in vienna the pm expressed his skepticism that the west would be able to reach deal with irans leaders saying id be surprised and shocked if the iranians do deal you always think you have deal with them and then you dont he continued the eu chirac and solanathey all thought they had deal solana said two weeks i advised him it would take two years 7 s asked for his advice on how best to approach the iranians hbj said it is imperative that the iranians commit to draft any deal including timetable he reiterated that it is important to make them tell you what they will do otherwise they will say yes but and the but will be worse than the deputy secretary countered that they dont want to make proposal to which hbj responded you dont understand even mousavi cant make deal poneman pressed the issue saying the us would not be offering better deal than what is currently on the table the prime minster said i know but this is the way they are 8 s referring to the current proposal on the tehran research reactor trr deputy secretary poneman stressed this is fleeting opportunity if they dont take this deal what comes next is worse the pm noted that the iranians frequently press the qataris to have dialogue on their shared natural gas field and attempt to expand the dialogue to include other subjects hbj said that the qataris are always throwing cold water on their ideas 9 s on qatars close ties with iran the pm added that he knows the us becomes upset at times by what it hears about the qatariran relationship however he characterized the relationship as one in which they lie to us and we lie to them poneman replied by underscoring that it would be helpful if everywhere they went they the iranians heard the same thing the pm said for qatars part he had told iran that it should listen to the west s proposal or there will be military action if not by the us then by the israelis by the middle of next year poneman observed that the russians had pressed the iranians hard during the vienna negotiations reinforcing the view that iranian failure to accept the tehran research reactor deal would lead back to the security council the pm asked if the us believes the russians were in agreement with the us on the possibility of harsher measures poneman replied that for now the russians appear to be holding similar line to the usg on the trr deal and we remain in close contact with moscow 10
