the changes in united states law that are required to permit united states adherence to the more than 100year old madrid agreement for international registration of trademarks as supplemented by 1989 protocol the substantive provisions of the madrid protocol and the changes proposed in hr 769 are apparently noncontroversial at least there is known opposition to the substantive provisions the bill would allow united states trademark applicants to obtain trademark registration abroad by filing single international application with the us patent and trademark office pto if the united states adheres to the madrid protocol the treaty apparently grants both the european commission and its separate national governments the right to vote on treaty issues at international meetings hr 769 was

organization in geneva switzerland critical provision is that each country has only one year from publication of the international application to declare the reasons why it cannot grant protecti on to the mark in its territory absent declaration the international registration has the effect of national registration 2 the united states has never adhered to the madrid trademark agreement because the us trademark law differs from the treaty obligations in 1989 international negotiators developed protocol to supplement the madrid agreement largely to accommodate the concerns of the united states and make it easier for the united states to adhere to this venerable agreement on international registration of trademarks among the new features of the protocol are the following the international application can be based on an application to the national trademark office without waiting until the national registration is completed country may take at least 18 months to declare its opposition to an international application and even longer under certain circumstances the madrid protocol went into effect in april 1996adheres to the protocol2 the effective date of the legislation is the date the madrid protocol would enter into force with respect to the united states hr 769 would add new title xii sections 6074 entitled the madrid protocol following the final section 51 of the lanham trademark act of 1946 section 61 establishes eligibility criteria for an international registration based on us trademark application in accordance with the madrid protocol the applicant must be

of protection to declare that protection cannot be granted in the us the 18 month period can be extended in cases of opposition for period of 7 months after the beginning of the opposition period or for 1 month after the end of the opposition period whichever is earlier unless the request for extension of protection is duly refused under section 68 the pto issues certificate to the international

22 1997 amendment of the protocol has been considered but would be difficult task since new diplomatic conference would have to be convened to amend protocol the state department representative testified that the united states is exploring with the european commission ec the possibility of gentlemans agreement under which the ec could vote if one of its member states did not vote at the same time there are difficulties with this solution also according to mr donnelly these include perception that this solution constitutes us endorsement of an independent vote for the ec and that it fails adequately to address the competency issue ie which party is responsible for legal implementation of treaty obligations if the ec and its member states disagree over their respective responsibilitiesprotection section 72 incontestability of trademarks section 73 and the conditions under which an extension of united states protection to an international trademark registration conveys the same rights as an existing us registration for the same mark section 74 the conditions set by section 74 are that the same person owns the extension of protection and the existing us registration the goods and services listed in each are the same and the certificate of extension is issued after the date of the existing registration hr 769 was favorably reported by the house judiciary committee on march 24 1999 and on april 12 the committee issued house report 10681 on april 13 motion was made to suspend the rules and the bill was agreed to by voice vote on april 14 the bill was received in the house and referred to the committee on the judiciary the bill in the 105th congress hr 567 passed the house but there was senate action because of concerns about the voting rights of the european union arguments for and against hr 769 there is current apparent opposition to the substantive provisions of hr 769 or to the 1989 madrid protocol3 the amendments to the trademark law would not take effect unless and until the united states ratifies and becomes bound by the protocol the legislation together with ratification of the protocol would allow us businesses and individuals to obtain onestop international trademark protection by filing single international application rather than applying separately in each country where protection is desired this onestop international application procedure is arguably especially beneficial to small businesses which do not have the resources to obtain trademark registration world wide at the national level the clinton administration has not forwarded the treaty to the senate to request its advice and consent because of concerns about the voting rights of the european union4 representatives of the aipla and the inta have criticized the administration for its delay in requesting advice and consent to the treaty on the ground of the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98423crs4 5 administration continues to resist

same ec voting rights problem as the madrid protocol the implementing legislation pl 105330 was signed by the president on october 30 1998objection to the voting rights of the european commission these representatives argue that the ec voting rights issue is an aberration and that ratification of the madrid protocol would not represent any precedent on ec voting rights for other agreements5 they point out that the more recently developed wipo copyright treaty and performances and phonograms treaty contain voting rights clauses acceptable to the united states the administration continues to negotiate with the ec and wipo about compromise solution that accommodates the concerns of the united states although treaties are normally concluded among states the united states welcomes the participation of regional economic integration organization like the ec provided there are certain safeguards these include prohibitions against concurrent voting and against counting accession of the regional organization toward bringing the agreement into force provisions that avoid any imprecision in allocating the competence between the regional organization and its member states and provisions strictly limiting the types of intergovernmental organizations that are allowed to become parties to the agreement6
