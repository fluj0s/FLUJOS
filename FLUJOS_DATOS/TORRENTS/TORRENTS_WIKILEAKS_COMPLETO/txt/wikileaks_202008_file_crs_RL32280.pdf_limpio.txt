professional s port without national governing body1 regulation of the sport has traditionally resided in the states with the result that rules can vary significantly from state to state2 the federal government became interested in creating more uniform system of boxing regulations in the 1960s and has passed two laws to that end since 1996 th professional boxing safety act of 1996 pbsa3 and the muhammad ali boxing re form act of 2000 the ali act4 after brief overview of the sport of boxing this report analyzes the federal regulatory framework created by these two laws and the bills before the 109th congress before examining the federal governme nts regulatory role it is first important to understand how the boxing world operates background it is the interaction of five distin ct groups which determines the shape of american boxing the boxers managers promoters state boxing commissions and sanctioning organizations5 the manager is generally responsible for handling the boxers business affairs arranging for tr aining and negotiating with promoters for various fights the manager and the trainer who prepares the boxer for the fight itself generally split percentage of the boxers purse for each fight6 the dominant figure outside of the ring is the promoter even nationally known fighters need promotion contracts in orde r to compete in the ring creating power balance that tends to favor the promoter7 the promoter sets up the bout between thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32280crs2 7 continued 2002 8 revenues from each fight generally come from three sources the ticket

not normally receive percentage of either fighters purse but rather is compensated by the difference between the total revenues generated from the fight and the total expenses incurred in promoting it8 one important consequence of the typical fighterpromoter arrangement is that the promoters financia l interest can run counter to that of the fighter in that the smaller the fighters purse the greater the promoters profits given that fighters generally have little bargaining power relative to the promoters promoters have in the past been able to coerce fighters into signing contracts that maximize promoters profits while minimizing those of the boxers9 as will be discussed later this conflict has been serious area of focus for federal boxing legislation state boxing commissions are respons ible for regulating the matches themselves and the commissions promulga policies to keep track of boxers medical records conduct medi cal examinations and select officials and judges for nonchampionship bouts10 currently 44 states have boxing commissions or similar bodies to regulate fights and their effec tiveness varies greatly those states that consistently host wellpublicized fights g nevada new york florida california and new jersey have relatively strong state commissions and strict medical regulations as well as comprehensive re quirements governing qualifications for boxing match officials11 conversely other states ve comparatively lax regulations or in some cases none at all12 in the past the disparity among state regulations along with the lack of informationsharing between state commissions allowed boxers who were suspended in one state to journey to other states to fight13 some have even charged that the profitability of holding boxing matches has encouraged state commissions to enter race to the regulatory bottom in order to encourage promoters to set up fights in their respective states14 in recent years the state boxinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32280crs3 14 continued safeguards may well have the fewest boxers to protect states with little regulation and perhaps few fans will attract an increased share of boxing

uniformity with the formation of the voluntary association of boxing commissions abc15 the sanctioning organizations rank the top tentotwenty contenders in each weight division and are only involved with championship and titleelimination matches16 these organizations lend an air of importance to fights that they sanction as championship bouts in addition ev though state boxing rules make exceptions for championship bouts sanctioni ng organizations are usually allowed to choose the judges for those fights17 the three most widelyrecognized sanctioning organizations are the international boxing federation ibf the world boxing council wbc and the world boxing asso ciation wba while each sanctioning organization has its own rules generally champion is required to face the top contender at least once every nine months and can only defend the title against the top fifteen contenders18 there is widespread perception that in the past the rankings often reflected the subjective judg ments of the sanctioning organizations competition among those organizations and improper relations hips between the sanctioning organizations and the various promoters19 the evolution of boxing regulations early attempts at regulation although boxing has been around since the time of the ancient greeks until relativel recently in its history matches were unregulated and incredibly violent the fi rst modern rules took root in nineteenth century england in the form of broughtons rules and the marquess of queensbury rules20 both early examples of boxings attempt to regulate

the united states in the early 1900s and with this newfound popularity came calls for stricter regulation of the sport this groundswell of support for governme nt intervention was largely confined to the states where boxing was most popul ar and consequently state governments led the way in drafting boxing regulations at the forefront was new york which after experimenting briefly with banning the sport altogether passed in 1920 the nations first comprehensive boxing law commonly known as the walker law which created state boxing commission ins tituted certain medical safeguards and limited fights to fifteen rounds21 other states soon followed suit establishing tradition of primary regulation at the state level in the 1940s and 1950s boxings entangle ment with elements of the criminal underworld became increasingly apparent prompting senator estes kefauver to launch four years of hearings in the 1960s with an eye toward establishing federal regulations22 several pieces of legislation to that end were introduced in the wake of kefauvers hearings but the movement lost momentum following the senators death in 196323 legislation to establish federal oversig ht of boxing was introduced sporadically over the next three decades with succe ss in the mid1990s however interest in federal regulation of the sport grew as criticism of the sport mounted on variety of grounds including the exploitation of boxer s fixing of fights criminal influence on the sport and inade quate state regulation24 beginning in 1994 legislation attempting to address these concerns was introduced unsuccessfully every year until 1996 when congress passed the pbsa and tered into the rea lm of professional boxing oversight the pbsa focused on th physical wellbeing of boxers and four years after its enactment congress addressed the economic wellbeing of boxers with the ali act these two laws form the current federal regulatory structure the primary characteristic of this structure

enforcement report of the sena commerce science and transportation committee found that both the pbsa s amended by the muhammad ali act and state laws have not been adequate ly enforced by federal and

the central governing body in the department of labor as in the original bill s 275 as passed in the nate would have placed this body in the department of commerce one of the most controversial aspects of legislative efforts to reform boxing has been the question of how to bring certa in powerful interests surrounding boxing match most notably tele vision networks under th regulatory
