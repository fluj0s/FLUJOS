012939 0500 open letter to members of the party nsm party comrades i am addressing this publically but it is directed at active party members when i first joined the nsm i knew it would be something i would stick with the rest of my life it was not club gang or some fleeting thrill for the moment it was commitment to way of life and direct link to many of our forefathers who fought for blood and soil fellow party members most of you have taken the oath of loyalty to the party and those that have not yet taken your oath as read in the membership handbook are expected to do so as soon as possible it is commitment and proves your serious about helping us to bring about changes in our nation it also creates solidarity and kinship with your fellow brothers and sisters in our struggle in this modern day materialistic society to some an oath or pledge of loyalty means nothing for those of us that live by the old ways breaking an oath defiles your honor and leaves you with nothing but an empty shell that once held your life force if man can not stay true to his oath then he is man but rather castrated maggot devoid of any trace of purity or an aryan soul your oath also holds you to the battlefield until this fight for our race and nation has been won i often reflect about socalled comrades that have abandoned their oaths to the party and i wonder how they can live with themselves as the rest of us face such large scale enemy in zog and they give up without fight or before the fight is finished we at party hq always hear multitude of excuses from the oath breakers sometimes their reasons are based in serious issues still there is reason serious enough to break your oath but more often than not it is trivial matters such as personal problems with another member so and so had their feelings hurt or this or that person was not thanked enough for their work or did not get promoted or did not like certain rule in the chain of command or religion or insert excuse here ____ these same oath breakers often claim to take great pride in the 3rd reich and claim they are national socialists truth be known had they lived during the 3rd reich and broke their party oaths there especially in the war years they might have met the hanging judge roland freisler and be dangling from piano wire it comes down to this comrades and prospective party members if you are not serious about our party leave now i am opening the door now for any current member to leave with their oath in tact i want to shake out any of the uncommitted nonserious members right now considering they are not needed as we move forward to the frontlines to the prospects and probate nsm members this message is for you also if you are not in this fight with us to the bitter end now would be the time to walk away furthermore the nsm does not operate as democracy your pledge of loyalty is to the party and its leadership honor you oath and your pledge of loyalty to the party or get out of our ranks now while you still can to the rest of you the party faithfull the warrior archetypes you men and women forged in iron and steel ready to stand against the zionist hordes and their beloved illegal slave laborers your party salutes and honors you providence has already promised us victory in our fight and your ancestors march alongside of you in spirit the men who fought at valley forge stand along side of us as do the brave men of the alamo as do the thousands that perished on the eastern front fighting communism and every other meaningfull battle where our racial kinfolk have sacrificed their lives let those who abandon us and break their oaths run away quickly with their tales between their legs if they can live with that shame and dishonor so be it for the rest of us duty calls new stormtroops and party members gave their oaths to the party at the successfull missouri october fest this weekend more details and full report coming soon from nsmmo check
