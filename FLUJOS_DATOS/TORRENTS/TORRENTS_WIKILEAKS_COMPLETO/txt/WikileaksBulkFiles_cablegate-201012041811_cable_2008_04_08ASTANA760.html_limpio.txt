reasons 14 b and d summary 1 c kazakhstans political elites appear to enjoy typical hobbies such as travel horseback riding and skiing not surprisingly however they are able to indulge in their hobbies on grand scale whether flying elton john to kazakhstan for concert or trading domestic property for palace in the united arab emirates this cable recounts several instances in which embassy officers have learned of or witnessed the recreational habits of kazakhstans leaders end summary sun and horses 2 c president nazarbayev like many of his countrymen has strong affinity for horses in 2007 emboff visited the presidential horse farm xxxxxxxxxxx the farm is located on the outskirts of astana in residential area but is surrounded by highfence and security guards inside the gates are large stable indoor and outdoor riding arenas and clubhouse with pool table sauna and exercise room emboff toured the stable and saw approximately forty horses from various parts of the world xxxxxxxxxxxx told him that nazarbayev visits the horse farm on occasion though not too frequently xxxxxxxxxxxx said that nazarbayevs wife sara nazarbayeva never accompanies him xxxxxxxxxxxx taszhargan an opposition newspaper printed sympathetic article about sara nazarbayeva xxxxxxxxxxxx 3 c nazarbayev is also fond of traveling to warmer climes in the region the uae ambassador told emboff that nazarbayev had traded property in borovoe mountainous resort area of kazakhstan north of astana and sometimes likened to switzerland for palace in the emirates he did not make clear whether the transaction was permanent arrangement or only temporary one the head of turkeys liaison office in astana orhan isik told emboff that nazarbayev has mansion in antaliya which he visits 45 times year isik claimed that nazarbayev received the property as gift in the early 1990s and now plans to use part of the land for the construction of luxury hotel dancing at the nightclub 4 c on march 7 two days after his trip to the us was cancelled prime minister masimov was spotted by emboff at chocolat one of astanas trendiest nightclubs masimov entered at approximately 1130 pm accompanied by presidential administration head kairat kelimbetov astana mayor askar mamin three middleaged kazakh women presumably their wives and security detail although the club offers vip area masimov chose to sit at table in full view of all of the clubs patrons emboff lingered close to masimovs group xxxxxxxxxxxx masimov led his companions on to chocolats dance floor soon after their arrival the dance floor holds approximately 100 people and at the time perhaps 50 patrons were dancing however masimov himself chose to dance on an empty stage above the dance floor his companions quickly tired but masimov remained dancing alone and animatedly on the stage for another 1520 minutes at approximately 100 am masimov and his retinue left the club skiing with the oligarchs 5 c in september 2007 kazakhstani oligarch aleksandr mashkevich the cofounder of metals and mining giant eurasian natural resources corporation and according to astana 00000760 0024 of 003 classified by polecon chief steven fagin reasons 14 b and d forbes magazine the 334th wealthiest man in the world hosted dinner at his house in almaty for two visiting us congressmen only two kazakhstanis attended the event state secretary kanat saudabayev and his assistant judging from sipdis the friendly banter between saudabayev and mashkevich the two have quite cordial personal relationship mashkevich told lengthy anecdote about ski vacation that he and saudabayev had taken together in europe 6 c saudabayev had hosted codel at that same almaty residence in 2005 without mashkevich in attendance at that time when the ambassador asked saudabayev whose house it was he would only say that it belonged to friend saudabayev has twice hosted visiting usg officials for meal at mashkevichs astana residence both times without mashkevich it is not clear what mashkevich is spending his billions on but it is certainly not culinary talent on all four occasions the ambassador has eaten at one of his houses the menu has been similar and focused on beshparmak boiled meat and noodles and plov the wait staff appeared to be graduates of soviet cafeteria training academy the wine at least was somewhat upscale with reasonably good french vintage bottles uncorked for the guests the astana residence has wooden plaques on the doors that would fit in nicely in wyoming hunting lodge but are somewhat out of touch with the upscale euroremont that is so popular among the kazakhstani elite private concerts with the stars 7 c in 2007 president nazarbayevs soninlaw timur kulibayev celebrated his 41st birthday in grand style at small venue in almaty he hosted private concert with some of russias biggest popstars the headliner however was elton john to whom he reportedly paid one million pounds for this onetime appearance note the british ambassador relayed slightly different story with an unknown but obviously wellheeled friend arranging and paying for sir eltons gig end comment there have been separate reports that nelly furtado performed at the august 2007 birthday bash for kulibayevs wife dinara nazarbayeva kulibayev also appears willing to spend his fortune on others according to turkish diplomat isik when the kempinski group recently built luxury villas in bodrum turkey kulibayev bought up number of them at cost of 45 million dollars each and doled them out as gifts to friends and family sports and politics mix 8 c sports and politics mixed seamlessly in almaty on april 2 when some of kazakhstans most prominent political figures participated in the beijing olympics torch relay torchbearers included president nazarbayev presidential administration business affairs head bolat utemuratov nur otan party first deputy chairman adilbek dzhaksybekov and agency for the regulation of natural monopolies head mazhit yesenbayev all of these bigwigs except nazarbayev himself could justify their participation in the relay based not on their highranking political offices but rather on their prominent official positions in the kazakhstani sports world utemeratov just happens to head kazakhstans tennis federation while dzhakysbekov chairs the football federation position previously held by exnazarbayev soninlaw rakhat aliyev yesenbayev heads the judo federation kazmunaygaz chairman uzakbay karabalin who heads the boxing federation and nazarbayev soninlaw timur kulibayev who heads the golf federation also shared in the glory of carrying the olympic torch one prominent sport federation president who missed the torch call was defense minister daniyal akhmetov he is head of the scandalridden cycling federation xxxxxxxxxxxx relaxation the good old soviet way 9 c kazakhstans political elites also have recreational tastes that are not so exotic some in fact prefer to relax the oldfashioned way defense minister akhmetov selfproclaimed workaholic appears to enjoy loosening up in the tried and true homo sovieticus style ie drinking oneself into stupor while most of our accounts of akhmetovs indulgences with the bottle are hearsay we do have eyes on for one episode which supports the rumors in june 2007 akhmetov showed up in grand form for meeting with visiting senior us defense department official making attempt to conceal his condition slouching back in his chair and slurring all kinds of russian participles akhmetov explained to this very senior guest that he had just been at cadet graduation reception toasting kazakhstans newlycommissioned officers who was toasted more the defense minister or the cadets is matter of pure speculation akhmetovs excesses do not solely extend to the bottle an insider at astanas radisson hotel recently told us about preparations for the unbelievably lavish and expensive wedding of akhmetovs in the kazakh tradition the parents of the groom are responsible for the wedding so it would seem that akhmetov must have footed the bill ordway
