address the recently recognized phenomenon of patented tax strategies these legislative initiatives respond in different ways to the grant of exclusive intellectual property rights by the united states patent and trademark office uspto on methods that individuals and enterprises might use in order to minimize their tax obligations many commentators trace the rise of tax strategy patents to the 1998 opinion of the federal circuit in state street bank v signature financial group which rejected per rule that business methods could not be patented in recent years the uspto has issued number of patents that pertain to tax strategies and numerous other patent applications remain before that agency at least one of these patents the socalled sograt patent has been subject to enforcement litigation in federal court the impact of tax strategy patents upon social welfare has been subject to spirited debate some observers are opposed to tax strategy patents these commentators believe that patent protection is unnecessary with respect to tax avoidance techniques due to high level of current innovation others believe that patentbased incentives to develop tax avoidance strategies are not socially desirable they assert that patents may limit the ability of individuals to utilize provisions of the tax code intended for all taxpayers interfering with congressional intent and leading to distortions in tax obligations others have expressed concerns that tax strategy patents may potentially complicate legal compliance by tax professionals and individual taxpayers alike other experts believe that these concerns are overstated and also make the affirmative case that tax strategy patents may provide positive social benefits they explain that patents on business methods have been obtained and enforced for many years they also observe that the grant of patent does not imply government approval of the practice of the patented invention and that professionals in many spheres of endeavor have long had to account for the patent system during their decisionmaking process they also believe that the availability of tax strategy patents may promote innovation in field of endeavor that is demonstrably valuable further such patents might promote public disclosure of tax strategies to tax professionals taxpayers and responsible government officials alike in the 110 th congress two senate bills s 681 and s 2369 and two house bills hr 1908 and hr 2136 would prohibit the issuance of patents on tax strategies hr 1908 passed the house of representatives on september 7 2007 another bill hr 2365 would take an alternative approach limiting the remedies available for certain infringements of tax planning method other legislative responses including oversight of the uspto promotion of cooperation between the uspto and the irs and the encouragement of private sector contributions to the patent examination process are also possible

provisions of the tax code interfering with congressional intent and leading to distortions in tax obligations5 others assert that tax strategy patents potentially complicate legal compliance by tax professionals and taxpayers alike6 still others believe that the patent system should not provide incentives for individuals to develop new ways to reduce their tax liability7 other commentators explain that patents on business methods have been obtained and enforced for many years8 legislation enacted in 1999 that accounted expressly for patents claiming method of doing or conducting business arguably approved of such patents9 in addition some commentators believe that tax strategy patents present positive development potentially improving the public disclosure of tax shelters for the attention of congress and federal tax authorities10 they also observe that many kinds of patents on subject matter ranging from automobile seat belts to airplane navigation systems potentially involve legal compliance11 although views on tax strategy patents vary eviden ce suggests that numerous applications that arguably cover tax planning methods have been filed at the uspto12 some of these applications 1 this report uses the term tax strategy patents to refer to this category of patents various sources referenced within this report identify these sorts of patents as pertaining to

the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to inventors the exclusive right to their discoveries15 in accordance with the patent act of 195216 an inventor may seek the grant of patent by preparing and submitting an application to the uspto uspto officials known as examiners then determine whether the invention disclosed in the application merits the award of patent 17 in determining whether to approve patent application uspto examiner will consider whether the submitted application fully discloses and distinctly claims the invention18 in particular the application must enable persons skilled in the art to make and use the invention without undue experimentation19 in addition the application must disclose the best mode or preferred way that the applicant knows to practice the invention20 the examiner will also determine whether the invention itself fulfills certain substantive standards set by the patent statute to be patentable an invention must meet four primary requirements first the invention must fall within at least one category of patentable subject matter according to the patent act an inventi on which is process machine manufacture or 13 id 14

of matter is eligible for patenting21 second the invention must be useful requirement that is satisfied if the invention is operable and provides tangible benefit22 third the invention must be novel or different from subject matter disclosed by an earlier patent publication or other stateoftheart knowledge23 finally an invention is not patentable if the subject matter as whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains24 this requirement of nonobviousness prevents the issuance of patents claiming subject matter that skilled artisan would have been able to implement in view of the knowledge of the state of the art25 if the uspto allows the patent to issue its owner obtains the right to exclude others from making using selling offering to sell or importing into the united states the patented invention26 those who engage in those acts without the permission of the patentee during the term of the patent can be held liable for infringement adjudicated infringers may be enjoined from further infringing acts27 the patent statute also provides for an award of damages adequate to compensate for the infringement but in ev ent less than reasonable royalty for the use made of the invention by the infringer28 the maximum term of patent protection is ordinarily set at 20 years from the date the application is filed29 at the end of that period others may em ploy that invention without regard to the expired patent patent rights do not enforce themselves patent proprietors who wish to compel others to respect their rights must commence enforcement proceedings which most commonly consist of litigation in the federal courts although issued patents enjoy presumption of validity accused infringers may assert that patent is invalid or unenforceable on number of grounds the court of appeals for the federal circuit federal circuit possesses nationwide jurisdiction over most

characteristic of the new knowledge that results from innovation is that it is public good public goods are nonrivalrous and nonexcludable for use of the good by one individual does not limit the amount of the good available for consumption by others and one can be prevented from using that good32 the lack of excludability in particular is believed to result in an environment where too few inventions would be made absent patent system free riders could easily duplicate and exploit the inventions of others further because they incurred cost to develop and perfect the technology involved copyists could undersell the original inventor aware that they would be unable to capitalize upon their inventions individuals might be discouraged from innovating in the first instance the patent system ameliorates this market failure by providing innovators with timelimited exclusive interest in their inven tions thereby allowing them to capture their marketplace value 33 the patent system purportedly serves other goals as well the patent law encourages the disclosure of new products and processes for each issued patent must include description sufficient to enable skilled artisans to practice the patented invention34 at the close of the patents twentyyear term35 others may employ the claimed invention without regard to the expired patent in this manner the patent system ultimately contributes to the growth of the public domain even during their term issued patents may encourage others to invent around the patentees proprietary interest patentee may point the way to new products markets economies of production and even entire industries others can build upon the disclosure of patent instrument to produce their own technologies that fall outs ide the exclusive rights associated with the patent 36 the regime of patents has also been identified as facilitator of markets absent patent rights an inventor may have scant tangible assets to sell or license in addition an inventor might otherwise be unable to police the conduct of contracting party any technology or knowhow that has been disclosed to prospective licensee might be appropriated without compensation to the inventor the availability of patent protection decreases the ability of contracting parties to engage in opportunistic behavior by lowering such transaction costs the patent system may make exchanges concerning information goods more feasible 37 32 see dotan oliar making sense of the intellectual prop erty clause promotion of progress as limitation on congresss intellectual property

mechanisms the patent system can act in more socially desirable way than its chief legal alternative trade secret protection trade secrecy guards against the improper appropriation of valuable commercially useful and secret information in contrast to patenting trade secret protection does not result in the disclosure of publicly available information that is because an enterprise must take reasonable measures to keep secret the information for which trade secret protection is sought taking the steps necessary to maintain secrecy such as implementing physical security measures also imposes costs that may ultimately be unproductive for society 38 the patent system has long been subject to criticism however some observers have asserted that the patent system is unnecessary due to market forces that already suffice to create an optimal level of innovation the desire to obtain lead time advantage over competitors as well as the recognition that passive firms may lose out to their more innovative rivals may provide sufficient inducement to invent without the need for further incentives 39 other commentators believe that the patent system encourages industry concentration and presents barrier to entry in some markets40 because the relationship between the rate of innovation and the availability of patent rights is not well understood we lack rigorous analytical methods for studying the impact of the patent system upon the economy as whole as result current economic and policy tools do not allow us to calibrate the patent system precisely in order to produce an optimal level of investment in innovation thus each of these arguments for and against the patent system remains open to challenge by those who are unpersuaded by their internal logic

linked to the grant of patents on the broader category of business methods41 prior to 1998 several judicial opinions could arguably be read to hold that patents could not be granted on method s of doing business for example in the 1908 opinion in hotel security checking co v lorraine co 42 the court considered method of and means for cashregistering and accountchecking designed to prevent fraud by waiters and cashiers 43 at one point the court stated that system of transacting business disconnected from the means for carrying out the system is not within the most liberal interpretation of the term an art that could be patented44 however the court also explained that the invention claimed in the patent would occur to anyone conversant with the business and that it was unable to discover

court meant to establish categorical rule that business methods were not patentable subject matter or merely state that the particular invention before the court would have been obvious in any event the uspto issued some patents that were arguably directed towards business methods during its long history46 this long period of ambiguity over the patentability of business methods ended with the 1998 opinion of the us court of appeals for the federal circuit in state street bank trust co v signature financial group 47 the patent at issue in that case concerned dataprocessing system for implementing an investment structure known as hub and spoke system48 this system allowed individual mutual funds spokes to pool their assets in an investment portfolio hub organized as partnership according to the patent this investment regime provided the advantageous combination of economies of scale in administering investments coupled with the tax advantages of partnership 49 the patented system purported to allow administrators to monitor financial information and complete the acco unting necessary to maintain this particular investment structure in addition it tracked all the relevant data determined on daily basis for the hub and each spoke so that aggregate year end income expenses and capital gain or loss can be determined for accounting and tax purposes for the hub and as result for each publicly traded spoke50 litigation arose between signature the patent owner and state street bank over the latter firms alleged use of the patented invention among the defenses offered by state street bank was that the asserted patent claimed subject matter that was not within one of the four categories of statutory subject matter51 and hence was invalid the district court sided with state street bank52 the trial judge explained at bottom the invention is an accounting system for certain type of financial investment vehicle claimed as means for performing series of mathematical functions quite simply it involves further physical transformation or reduction than inputting numbers calculating numbers outputting numbers and storing numbers the same functions could be performed albeit less efficiently by an accountant armed with pencil paper calculator and filing system 53 the trial court further relied upon the longestablished principle that business plans and systems are not patentable54 the court judged that patenting an accounting system necessary to carry on certain type of business is tantamount to patent on the business itself55 because 45 id at 471

methods of doing business or as mathematical algorithms56 the patent was held to be invalid following an appeal the federal circuit reversed the court of appeals concluded that the patent claimed not merely an abstract idea but rather programmed machine that produced useful concrete and tangible result57 because the invention achieved useful result it constituted patentable subject matter even though its result was expressed numerically58 the court further explained that today we hold that the transformation of data representing discrete dollar amounts by machine through series of mathematical calcul ations into final share price constitutes practical application of mathematical rithm formula or calculation because it produces useful concrete and tangible resulta final share price momentarily fixed for recording and reporting purposes and even accepted and relied upon by regulatory authorities and in subsequent trades 59 the court of appeals then turned to the district courts business methods rejection opting to take the opportunity to lay this illconceived exception to rest60 the court explained restrictions upon patents for methods of doing business had not been the law since at least the enactment of the 1952 patent act the federal circuit then concluded that methods of doing business should be subject to the same patentability analysis as any other sort of process 61 the holdings of state street bank were reached nearly decade ago absent reconsideration of the issue by congress the supreme court or th federal circuit itself business methods remain patentable subject matter62 should particular method of doing business meet the other statutory requirements including utility novelty and nonobviousness then patent may issue numerous patents that arguably claim business methods have issued from the uspto 63 and several have been the subject of litigation in the federal courts64 congressional reaction to the patenting of business methods has to this point been limited in 1999 congress enacted the first inventor defens act as part of the american inventors protection act65 that statute provides an earlier inventor of method of doing or

patent infringement in certain circumstances in enacting the first inventor defense act congress recognized that some firms may have operated under the view that business methods could not be patented prior to the state street bank decision as result they may have maintained their innovative business methods as trade secrets having used these trade secrets in furtherance of their marketplace activities for period of time however these firms may be unable to obtain patent upon their business method further should competitor later independently invent and patent the same business method the trade secret holder would potentially be liable for patent infringement following the confirmation of the patenting of business methods by the state street bank court the creation of the first inventor defense was intended to provide defense to patent infringement in favor of the first inventortrade secret holder 66 by stipulating that the first inventor defense applied only to method of doing or conducting business congress arguably recognized the validity of these sorts of patents67 the first inventor defense act did not define the term method of doing or conducting business however to date published judicial opinion addresses the precise scope of this defense68 g18g138g157g142g151g157g156g561g152g151g561g22g138g161g561g21g157g155g138g157g142g144g146g142g156g561 although the state street bank opinion rejected per rule denying patents on business methods the invention claimed by the signature patent was arguably motivated by desire to reduce tax liability69 in some sense then state street bank may be seen as the first tax patent case some commentators believe that the increase in the number of tax strategy patents requested and approved by the uspto came on the heels of state street bank 70 notably at least one observer rejects this view attorney andrew schw artz has opined that although business methods may be patented following state street bank the conclusion that tax and other legal methods are patentable subject matter does not result mr schwartz has asserted that while most if not all novel business methods either save time or harness law of nature for human benefit71 legal methods instead manipulate positive law in order to achieve their advantages72 according to mr schwartz legal methods including tax strategies therefore do not qualify as inventions within the meaning of the patent act it remains to be seen whether this view will gain more widespread acceptance 66 see generally david h hollander jr the first inventor defense limited

member of the holder the method comprises establishing grantor retained annuity trust grat funded with nonqualified stock options the method maximizes the transfer of wealth from the grantor of the

the issuance of tax strategy patents is improvident as matter of both innovation and tax policy some observers believe that innovation in tax avoidance techniques has flourished absent the stimulus of patent protection for example the tax section of the new york state bar association has stated that our experience suggests that tax advisors do not need the protection of the patent laws to develop tax strategies or to comply with their obligations to represent the interests of their usually paying clients 80 the views of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa are similar according to the aicpa people already have substantial incentives to comply with tax law and lower their taxes81 other observers go further believing that to the extent that tax patents encourage further innovation in developing innovative tax avoidance strategies such an incentive is not socially desirable william drennan member of the law faculty at southern illinois university contrasts the grant of tax strategy patents with recent treasury department regulations that in his view reduce the economic incentive to create tax loopholes82 mr drennan thus explains one government agencythe treasury departmentis taking action to discourage loopholes in contrast the patent office at the direction of the federal circuit is providing new incentive to create loopholes since the treasury

g343g343g561administration of the us tax system the treasury departments views on sound tax policy should be given greater weight than the view of the patent office on this subject83 as summarized by the joint committee on taxation some may argue that innovation is either not socially beneficial or requires special protection to encourage its undertaking and thus fundamental premise behind patent system is missing 84 other experts believe that tax strategy patents are inappropriate because they are said to inject private control over system of public laws85 under this view patent may potentially grant one individual the ability to prevent others from using new tax provision in turn private actors may effect the ability of federal state and local governments to raise revenue influence taxpayer behavior and otherwise achieve the intended purposes of the tax laws86 these concerns were voiced by the aicpa in the following way tax strategy patents also preempt congresss prerogative to have full legislative control over tax policy congress enacts tax law provisions applicable to various taxpayers and intends that taxpayers will be able to use them tax strategy patents thwart this congressional intent by giving tax strategy patent holders the power to decide how select tax law provisions can be used and who can use them 87 tax professionals have also expressed concerns over the impact of tax strategy patents upon their own practices as well as taxpayers in general some observers believe that the burdens of investigating whether taxpayers planned course of action is covered by tax strategy patent determining whether the patent was providently granted by the uspto and potentially negotiating with the patent proprietor in order to employ the strategy will be costly and impractical for many taxpayers 88 further because compliance with the tax laws and its self assessment system is obligatory for all citizens of the united states the scope of this burden could be considerable89 some commentators have also opined that the grant of patent may mislead taxpayers they believe that issuance of patent may be seen as the governments imprimatur that particular technique may be useful in limiting an individuals tax obligations because the uspto does not necessarily evaluate the legality and comparative effectiveness of particular tax strategy as part of its decision to issue patent however such an impression would be mistaken as the aicpa has stated 83 id 84 staff of the joint committee on taxation background and issues relating to the patenting of tax

may be misled into believing that patented tax strategy bears the approval of other government agencies such as the irs and therefore is valid and viable technique under tax law this is not the case 90 finally some commentators have expressed concerns that the uspto does not have sufficient expertise to assess whether particular tax strategy meets the patentability criteria of novelty and nonobviousness91 as ellen p aprill member of the law faculty of the loyola law school of angeles has asserted it is the duty of patent examiners in the pto to make the determination that patent is novel and not obvious in order to review the validity under the patent law of applications for tax strategy patents patent examiners need expertise not only in software and finance but also of course tax they need to understand the conceptual basis of range of areas of tax financial products estate and gift tax pension and deferred compensation to name few where tax strategy patents already exist such expertise is difficult to obtain few tax practitioners have such broad knowledge in such varied aspects of the tax law most work very hard just to keep up in developments and changes in the law in their areas of specialization yet the patent examiners evaluating these tax strategy patents are trained as engineers with few having some additional financial education such as an mba they are not tax lawyers or accountants 92 in addition identifying state of the art knowledge may present complications within the tax field tax return information is maintained in confidence93 and communications between taxpayers and their advisors may also be subject to legal privilege of nondisclosure94 due to these circumstances reportedly tax practitioners are concerned that many of the patents that have or will be issued for tax strategies will inevitably involve techniques that have long been accepted as routine95

patents on tax strategies some of these commentators believe that previously articulated concerns about tax strategy patents are overstated others make the affirmative case that tax strategy patents will produce positive social benefits some experts disagree that patents will necessarily prove ineffective in encouraging the development of new tax strategies patent attorney michael sandonato is reported as explaining of course tax advisers will give their best advice but if they can patent it and have some exclusive rights to it you may see the extra level of activity that patents can motivate 96 others observe that new ways to reduce tax liability can be both costly to develop and the source of considerable value for particular inventor97 as with more traditional sorts of patents

patents may reward these efforts and differentiate products and services among competing tax advisors98 tax strategy patenting is also said to lead to the affirmative social benefit of enhanced public disclosure each issued patent is required to incorporate full description of the patented invention99 as result patents may provide an effective mechanism for disseminating information regarding the current state of the art in particular disciplines although existing regulations require that certain tax shelters be disclosed to the department of the treasury 100 the patent system could arguably improve the availability of information regarding tax strategies to tax professionals and regulators alike101 some commentators further discount stated concerns that tax strategy patents potentially allow someone to appropriate method of complying with the law they observe that variety of patented inventions could be described in this manner as explained by patent professionals stephen t schreiner and george wang many different types of patentable inventions involve manner of complying with the law but they are not prohibited from patenting for that reason 102 schreiner and wang explain that such inventions as an improved catalytic converter childs safety seat and machine for weighing trucks may relate to laws governing automobile emissions transportation safety and highway traffic because each of these inventions is nonetheless eligible for patenting schreiner and wang assert that eligibility for patent protection should not turn on whether the inventions pertain to compliance with the law 103 observers also note that professionals in many spheres of endeavor have long had to account for the patent system during their decisionmaking process chemists biologists engineers computer scientists and medical doctors are among those individuals who may obtain patents but must also be mindful of the patents of others during the course of their professional activities these observers find persuasive justification for treating tax professionals differently as schreiner and wang state some seem to have taken the position that tax attorneys and wealthy tax clients should simply not have to be burdened with tax patents however this is not persuasive if doctors and patients must observe patent restrictions on new medical techniques and new medicines that may have lifealtering consequences we can think of moral legal or policy basis for why tax attorneys and their clients should enjoy special exemption while those in the medical profession do not 104 patent experts also explain that patents do not provide the affirmative right to use the patented invention but rather the right to exclude others from doing so105 as result in their view the

that the grant of patent implies that the patented invention is effective and approved for use is simply incorrect this situation is commonplace in other fields of endeavor for example the uspto commonly issues patents on pharmaceuticals and medical devices that have not yet received marketing approval from the food and drug administration106 in the view of these experts if taxpayers mistakenly believe that the grant of patent implies government approval of the patented strategy then the proper response is to promote taxpayer awareness not to limit or prohibit tax strategy patents altogether 107 observers further note that the uspto has consistently been called upon to address new categories of inventions throughout that agency s long history for example contemporary uspto examiners must respond to cuttingedge innov ations in fields such as nanotechnology by developing technical expertise and establishing documentation regarding the state of the art the uspto potentially faces similar challenge with respect to tax strategies but many observers believe that there is nothing particularly noteworthy or unusual about this task 108

strategy patents is satisfactory then action need be taken if c ongress wishes to intervene however number of options present themselves in the 110th congress four bills have been introduced that would limit either the availability or the enforcement of tax strategy patents the first of these bills hr 1908 passed the house of representatives on september 7 2007 this legislation titled the patent reform act of 2007 is comprehensive patent reform measure one of its provisions would prevent patent fr om issuing on tax planning method which is defined as plan strategy technique or scheme that is designed to reduce minimize or defer or has when implemented the effect of reducing minimizing or deferring taxpayers tax liability but does not include the use of tax preparation software or other tools used solely to perform or model mathematical calculations or prepare tax or information returns 109 this provision would take effect on the date of enactment of the act and would apply to any patent filed on or after the date of the enactment of this act or filed before that date if patent or reissue patent has not been issued pursuant to the application as of that date hr 1908 expressly states that it shall not be construed as validating any patent issued before the date of the enactment of this act110 this provision would appear to be relevant in the event that the compliance of tax strategy patents with the statutory subject matter utility or other patentability requirements is called into question before the courts uspto or other fora in such circumstance this statutory language indicates that the legislation should not be construed as 106 see john r thomas pharmaceutical patent law bureau of national affairs 2005 7 an award of marketing approval by the fda and the grant of patent by the pto are distinct events that depend upon different criteria 107 schreiner and wang supra at 2 108 figg supra at 3 schreiner and wang supra at 2 109 hr 1908 at 10b2a 110

prohibition would apply to any application for patent that has not been granted as of the date of enactment of the bill 112 another bill s 2369 was introduced on novemb er 15 2007 that bill would not

these bills hr 2365 was introduced on may 17 2007 that bill provides in part with respect to the use by taxpayer or tax practitioner of tax planning method that constitutes an infringement under subsection or b of section 271 the provisions of sections 281 283 284 and 285 shall not apply against the taxpayer the tax practitioner or any related professional organization with respect to such tax planning method 115 under these provisions although an individual may obtain patent on tax planning method such patent would essentially be unenforceable the patent owner would not be able to bring civil action against individuals it believes are practicing the patented tax planning method without authorization116 nor would any of the remedies available against adjudicated infringers including damages injunctions and in exceptional cases attorney feesbe available117 this limitation on enforcement would apply to any action for patent infringement that is filed on or after the date of enactment of the bill118 other legislative responses are also possible in furtherance of its oversight over the uspto congress could continue to track that agencys activities with respect to tax strategy patents in this vein commentators have proposed several reforms including uspto hiring of examiners with expertise in taxation and related disciplines 119 congress could also encourage continued cooperation between the uspto and the irs with respect to tax strategy patents 111 s 681 303a hr 2136 303a 112 s 681 303b hr 2136 303b 113 s 2369 1a 114 id at 1b 115 hr 2365 1a the term tax

environment122 others contend that the affirmative case for granting patents on business methods remains weak and that patents on tax strategies present uniquely deleterious social consequences123
