3ga assessment lecture given on 25 september 1962 okay lecture two 25 sept ad 12 saint hill special briefing course and well talk to you about 3ga well you know all about it of course theres nothing much to learn about it the first thing you should know about auditing is auditing is what you get away with thats it and that sometimes is disastrous because you get away with something and then you never get away with it again now the best auditing i think youll agree is very standard auditing theres somebody here right now that was screaming about the woundup doll character of saint hill graduate got twentyfive hours from one and thought man saint hill auditing is the most when youre on the receiving end of good stable standard highskilled auditing it makes all that difference it is recognizable miles away now the difficulties of goal finding are generally put there by the auditor the pc is perfectly willing to be audited but the pc has bank that is very often unwilling to be audited and the first step of any auditing activity is to make the pc auditable now thats quite interestinghe makes the pc auditable now thats quite important because the pc has got to be in very auditable condition before you can do very much with finding goals and if you ever want to have hard time take some pc who isnt very auditable who has an antiscientology goal dont improve the pcs auditing quality in any way and try to find the goal now you justi dont know i dont know how the devil you could do it itd just be too wild for words now you take somebody who is quite auditable but has goal that he conceives to be an overt against scientology or the auditor or something of this sort youll find thats tough enough without adding the fact that the pc has familiarity with auditing and isnt grooved in in any way thats really asking for trouble now the best way to make pc very auditable is to give the pc very accurate sessioning i cant emphasize this too much if the pc feels all selfauditish and all run around and messed up and that sort of thing after some auditing the reason for that lies with the auditor there arent arc breaky pcs you must remember this there arent difficult pcs you must remember this there are auditors who cant handle pcs and this will come home to you with crash you should have seen poor wing angel after he got out of here by the way wings goal was completely listed out and he was checked clear couple of days ago and its time that he was because hes handling the academy in washington for few weeks and i went in and i saw the quote id auditors walking around you see very stiff with your right hand touch that wall thank you ruf ruf ruf ruf ruf and i said my god wing and he says listen boss hes always calls boss gag he says you shouldve seen them yesterday well someday youll be handling some situation like that and itll just aboutyoull always have somebody coming up to you saying this is very difficult and very bad pc that i am auditing this pc is very arc breaky this pc will not stay insession this pc this and this pc that and blame the pc blame the pc whenever you see that kind of situation you just know that lousy auditing is going on and you concentrate on training the auditor up better thats the answer to it because if youve been at this long enough you find out that there arent bad pcs or good pcsthere are pcs that are more auditable than others this is for sure but the auditors job of course is to make the pc auditable not blame the pc now its very funny thing you take some pc thats been very roughly auditedaudited with the rudiments out auditor has been cleaning cleans madly you know and missing the reactions and the very things that youre struggling with and this has been going on for several sessions and man this auditor is just getting the pc so the pc is kind of coming up the leads you know of the emeter you know the pcs crowding into the session and the pcs falling back out of the session again and the pcs trying to keep his own rudiments in and all these various things which you occasionally see when youre moving in on this now this pc is weird this pc is arc breaky and had lots of problems and appears to be leading very messy life and ifs all very upsetting all right you take that pc just as an experiment and you just give him three sessions each one about thirty to forty minutes long thats within the hour limit of the session just give him three letterperfect sessions dont do thing for the pc you understand dont try to do anything for thisdont try to handle the pcs problems or anything of this sort see nothing extraordinary just give this pc about three sessions see on monday tuesday wednesday or week one week two week three you see i mean just three sessions and watch the difference in that pc because good positive auditing is pure magic this pc all of sudden will stop trying to keep his rudiments in this pc will relax this pc will say this is good auditor this pcll say this and that hell give you praise you probably dont deserve see you could even miss rudiment or two and still get pc into marvelous condition but you havent run anything on the pc this is what im trying to make point of youve not run anything on the pc youve not taken up this pcs constant and continual worry about his lumbosis see youve not done anything for this pc you could even go so far as to just well prepcheck the buttons careful and agreed upon not even suppress you see sincewell i dont know pick some random datesince last tuesdayjust any old last tuesday you know and thats all you ran in the body of the session see you maybe just cleaned one of them you know see or since saturday or since this morning we dont care what you did see you werent really doing anything now all you did was get in those three rudiments up front and clean up this one button for some short period of time and then get your end rudiments in and end the session just do this for three consecutive sessions and youll find yourself looking at different pc you should get good reality on that because itll keep you from keeping auditors in the lineup untrained if you recognize that this is true then you wont put up with some auditor monkeying up pc you see you wont say oh well i dont know its just poor oldpoor old billikins therepoor old billikins just has terrible time gethes unlucky he always gets bad pcs now somehow or another billikins always gets bad pcs and so forth thats not true you see you see if you dont know for sure what ive just told you then you will keep billikins in there and not do anything about billikins see he just isnt auditing pcs thats the only adjudication you can make out of it ive had the experience few times oh well right here in your tv demonstrations ive had pc tell afterwardspc hadnt had any cleans cleaned on him hadnt had any reactions called when there were none you know i mean the pc was just given fairly straightforward sessiontell afterwards yeah well that was marvelous session you know never had such auditing i didnt do anything for the pc see except just give straightforward scientology session thats all without any monkey business now the worse off an auditor is the more he figures now thats stable datum that you can put down the worse off an auditor is the more he figures and the conclusions he draws will hold at dismay the origins and answers of the pc the pc is always talking up against foregone conclusion see the auditor has got it all figured out every time the auditor never sits there as just ayou know he receives the origin acknowledges and so on hes wearing himself out man hes just working you talk about work you never saw so much work as this oh god the foot pounds of energy being put in by this auditor there if added to steam engine would drive locomotive the length of thegreat britain or drive the queen mary halfway across the atlantic thats steam you know figure figure figure figure figure figure now lets see figure figure figure figure figure figure figure figure and then some morefigure figure and figure figure figure figure figure figure figure figure the auditor says do birds fly you see and as soonjust before the auditor did that he said well i know what this pc will answer the pc is going to answer the fact that birds dont fly because actually hes got hes sort of flighty you see and hes going to havehes going to have all this and so forth and therefore thatsthats the cause of his long long nose and so forth and when hewhen he answers up it doesnt matter whats running iiii know what the answer is got it all figured out in advance so he says all right do birds fly and the pc says i dont know i guess so havent given any thought to it at all and the auditor says see i told you confirms it and so forth well actually this auditor hasnt received any communication from the pc hes received proof of his own conclusions and of course hes never in communication with this pc and after an auditor has been at it for while and hes done an awful lot of auditing hes getting pretty smoothed out about the thing well he says do birds fly and its all right with him if he gets positive answer and its all right if he gets negative answer and its all right if he gets screwy answer its also all right if the pc doesnt answer the auditing question the auditor just tells him to answer it and its very relaxed emanation coming out of this sessionif you want to specialize in emanations its very relaxed see the theta waves are very smooth in that vicinity and the pc knows he knows hes talking to somebody he knows somebody is talking to him and that theres not lot of crisscross going on see there are not lot of crosscurrents going on now this doesnt say that an auditor never has to figure out pcs case because he does but the thing to figure out and figure on are the important things not the unimportant things now let see this is the fifth consecutive list of detested people and things that we have drawn up without single one of them slamming now what the hell is wrong here whats going on see and he has to come up with the right answer he has to do something that is effective about this so its only when an auditor is being ineffective that he starts working it all out heotherwise he could just sail through like breeze he knows his stuff he knows whats happening and so forth the pcs he audits the person sits down therewell its just the fact that the session is very smooth routine session and it all comes off all right and the pc winds up at the other end and the auditors heard what he said and the pc has answered what was given him and the rudiments are all straight and nothings gone out of line and there it is and the pc starts building up big lot of confidence and he doesnt put all these think think figure units you know to work and get all stuck in the session and get to fighting and batting around and so forth the pc just cheerfully goes on and becomes pc thats very important because in that state hell give you the right answers and hell be able to look into his own items and units and head and hell give you goals and withholds and in other words auditing really gets done if the persons being audited you understand what im talking about now if that kind of an auditing session cannot exist you havent got dogs chance of finding somebodys detested person dynamic goal itemanything and these things are just not findable because the pc is just you know all nervedup and knocked around god hei wont talk to about this becauseyes i will talk abouti cant find any other difficulties im not willing to talk to him about difficulties difficulties what are difficulties that i wodadada ibut ive told you all the answers well you say it still reads on the meter but ilets see difficulties i cant think of any other difficulties that im unwilling to talk to you about have you seen something like that heavy pc will go around the bend now thats frame of mind to be looking for dynamic and an item and goal man so the first requisite of 3ga is that the auditor can carry on smooth routine unworried unharassed auditing session thats the first requisite and it takes lot of training to get an auditor into that and it takes lot of selfdiscipline and that sort of thing to get up to that point some auditors just seem to be naturals they seem to be naturals and other auditors seem to behave hell of time to achieve it but they can all achieve it as far as discipline is concerned youd be amazed that every now and then i have to take myself by the scrap of my neck and audit exactly by current procedure and i do i work it around and audit by current procedureexactly current procedure you see sometimes i audit just little ahead of current procedure for instance im asking two questions now you heard in the demonstration last wednesday probably baffled several of you there is done in the first end rudiment did you hear it as it went by audience yes mmhm now it was more important to ask that one than it is to ask the old one see put done in that first rudiment to impress is there anything youve done to impress you know have you done anything to impress thats the idea done anything its not said anything to impress but done anything to impress youll find out its much more effective and also criticalwell if theres anything misunderstood in the session the pcs going to be critical so its much more beneficial to ask them in this session was there anything that was misunderstood and youll find out this will work out much better as the session goes well those are little changes and so forth and i just get so flat out i dont have the time to issue them to you and its not terrible important and i know ill get around to it sooner or later and youll catch up with them but of course you do this to yourselves its all your fault you know because you scream like mad every time i change comma on you but otherwise i audit with very standard approach i can give very very standardvery very standardsession extremely so and groove it in clean cleans miss readjust give one of these sessions quite interesting what happens in it when i think of the times in the past twelve years whenor longer than that for methat i have sat down and utterly sweated blood over pc trying to figure it all out and not being aware of what conclusion was going to be reached by the end of session and all of this sort of thing well golly i would have given lot over these years to have been able to audit this very smooth quiet approach that we audit with today and man if you do it right it holds pc insession as though you had him tied down and threatened with wild bulls they dont move you really get them into session these days well its that attitude of auditing the calm effective certain hopeful approach you know what you can do sometimes you do it sooner and sometimes you do it later but you know you can do it that approach is fundamental for 3ga if youre still in frame of mind where you sit down and audit pc and uhhhh i dont know how this is going to come out and so on and i know what this pcs going to say i know what his goal really is his goal is tohis goal is to catch black catfish i know what his goal is because he says hes colorblind and then obviously i mean and so on and et cetera et cetera et cetera figurefigureduring the session see youre under big strain all during the session how is this going to come out well just to that degree this strain is communicated to the pc and the pc is incapable of producing the things which you want you understand that now thats something to cultivate in 3ga if you havent already got it down you got to be relaxed hopeful positive effective auditor youve got to know your business in order to emanate the fact that you know your business in order to get the pc to do exactly what you want him to do and that is how to get pc to getto do what you want him to donot hit him with your fist but hit him with total competence and youd be surprised how far youd get in that frame of mind but for the nervedup uncertain questioning technique all slipping out of his fingers you know like greased pencils uhhh it doesnt go across its auditing attitude its auditing accomplishment its auditing effectiveness you actually should be up to position where you can sit there and hand out rudimentshavingness session and just know that by the time youve given your pc two or three or four such sessions hes just going to be calm as millpond you just get up to point where you know that and youre ready to hand out 3ga that auditing attitude is important all right its something that cant be neglected and thats the basic reason why youre not going to get good accurate goals finding and so forth amongst halftrained poorly trained uncertified auditors and that sort of thing the discipline is just not adequate to it well now what im pointing out to you is there is an actual auditing result as result of calm competent effective auditing now thats what im pointing out to you see its on that fundamental that 3ga is built and lacking that fundamental youre not going to get another thing done you could have the data memorized by the mile be able to spit it out by the geyserful and you would not find any goals or make any clears do you understand that audience mmhm yes so there is something on which clearing is built its competent calm effective auditing and thats your first requisite and trick will get you over that zone so everything i tell you about 3ga is based understood upon that fundamental now the next thing that you need in 3ga is luck see you want luck well you dont have to have luck to succeed but it makes it so nice its so nice now look total competence will breed luck but it takes some luck just on its own hook too every now and then lets say youre running clearing coaudit and youre lucky on fifteen pcs out of fifty youre just lucky you know the person just laid the goal in your lap you knowbang but there it is and it rocket read and everything was fine youthe pcjust before you started listing dynamics on the pc the pc was waiting for you and hes sitting there reading magazinethis is what i mean by luckreading magazine it was time magazine which is companion piece to dogs life and they just happened to be reading this magazine and they opened it up and they were reading the obituaries which i think is their most common commodity that they pedal in that magazine obituaries see obituaries see he was reading that and he comes in and offhandedlygiving the dynamics and he says well theres god and theres obituaries and theres so on and so on and you assess it all outbang bangand my god its obituaries and it just falls off the pin you see crash crash crash terrific rock slamso on and you start checking around hurriedly and he hadnt given you the dynamic hed given you an item and youre already there and all you have to do is list few goals against the obituaries and its there see thats what i mean by luck you know it always takes just little bit of that luck you see it didntand thatall luck does for you is just shorten it little bit thats all its going to do its not going to make it you dont have to have luck to find the goal but it shortens it it makes it more rapid and you sit down in session and your pc has done an old goals list and hes found this old goals list and he drags it into the session and he gives it to you and he says look he says theres three goals on there i just happened to see before you go into the arduous listing of about hundred goals the pc has theres these three goals and i wrote this about year and half ago and i just happened to find it there and i thoughtand its very funny thing but the first three goals on that are all overts against that dynamic haha and you look at it and its the first one on that list it rocket reads three times you clean it up you have it checked out and that was the pcs goal you get what i mean its all in the direction of time shortening now its not in the direction of total consequence because youre going to find the pcs goal dont worry about that thats why id like to see you find several goals on pcs because you suddenly start getting insufferably cocky about the whole thing and listen you can be as insufferably cocky as you please im not going to put any bulletin out about being insufferably cocky so you see what i mean by the element of luck its there its there you find the goal at the beginning of the list instead of at the end you see the pc opens his mouth and you say what is thewhat person or thing have you detested in this lifetime something like that the pc says uncle joe and you say yeah all right give another one dont have to give you another one uncle joe thats the one youre looking at the meter man thats the one its slamming itself off its pins you say uncle joe and it renews its activity you dont get any listyou never get chance to you got your detested person and you say well who or what did uncle joe represent to you see which is proper question there and the pc says spiritsalways talking about spirits and youre looking at the meter and its rock slamming at this moment were twelve minutes deep into the body of session and you say spirits huh well what else did he represent and so forth well mostly spirits bang there it is you see you say well thats good thats good now what do spirits represent to you and the pc says undertakers an undertaker undertaker yeah its an undertaker yeah it represents an undertaker thats spirit to haha there it is fifteen minutes deep into the body of the session you got the item you see and you say to him carefully well what goalyou dont want to stretch your luck at this point you say what goal would it be impossible to achieve if you were an undertaker and the pc thinks for minute and he thinks for minute and you see couple of small rocket reads you see pc is thinking hard about it and thinking hard about it and finally says to live yeah rocket reads crash crash check it out thats the goal twentytwo and half minutes deep all right well you could be dodging around you see against fifty hours for theexactly the same result see now the element of luck has shortening time value now the next pc after this pc youre going to do slower than you would have done if you hadnt had all of this luck because you say to the pcthis next pcyou say who or what have you detested and the pc gives you 425name list and the item of detestation isnt on it the list is not complete theres not single slam on it anyplace well the thing to do in the face of this much luck brings us to our next step which is certainty now were not dealing in you might find the goal and you might not find the goal see that is not what youre dealing with at this time youre dealing with how easy is it going to be how hard is it going to be to find this pcs goal thats the quotient youre stacked up against it isnt am i going to find it or am i not going to find it youre going to find it and you go by the rules of the game that weve got right this minute and youll find that goal its question of how long its going to take now the length of time it takes is to some degree influenced by your certainty that the goal will eventually be found you follow this audience mmhm yes because when you become uncertain you will start doing things that are unusual and extraordinary and which may very well lead you into some backwash that is going to take you hours and hours to get out of you say well i dont know if im doing the procedure that will find the goal or not if that thought is occurring to youi dont know if im going to find this pcs goal or notif youre in that frame of mind youre going to make mistakes so its up to you and you will perhaps acquire this somewhere up the lineparticularly if i mention it to you youll get to point after youve done few successful assessments youll realize it isnt whether or not youre going to find the goal its question of how hard it is going to be to find the goal that is the measure or the yardstick by which you measure pcs when you achieve that you will be in very good situation as an auditor because it will reinforce the first requisitesthe calm competent aspect of the auditor and it will also tend to breed luck its as highwayman looks very very dangerous to the degree that he has tremendous reputation i imagine some poor little old highwayman has gotten out on thealongside the track and the mail coach has come along and this highwayman has stepped out into the road and tried to flag the coach down and said something or other im timmy simpson stand and deliver you know and the coach goes by and not only does it go by but it throws mud all over him its disheartening sort of thing thats the difference between dick turpin hes sitting there on big black horse and he hasnt even got pistol in his hand and the coach comes up the slope to the top of the grade and sees him sitting there and the coach stops and they stand and deliver they even volunteer to carry it distance for him this time thats sort of the difference of reputation competencethat sort of thing thats the difference it makes its big difference now im not trying to give you an aspect of fagin teaching his boys but the aspect of well its just inevitable youthereyoure going to give the dope and youre going to give the withhold and youre going to give this and youre going to give that and there it all is and thats it bing dmdm inevitable youre going to do this and that certainty actually can take pc and the pcs that doesnt ever enter his head that hes going to withhold anything from you and tremendous amount of the battle is won see comes into session sits down says well i stood armed guard last night while bank was robbed you know there it is he gives up the withhold in other words crash now thats different you box around with this pc and you say what is this fall yes well since the last time i audited you have you done anything you are withholding yeah well i ate breakfast and you say thank you since the last time i audited you have you done anything you are withholding ive been hearing this lately said different ways im just throwing that in gratuitously and the meter goes clank and he says well i tsk tsk nothing very well ill check that on the meter since the last time i audited you you done anything you are withholding it still reacts well i dont know what it could be see this is not climate of auditing in which youre liable to get too much done you see as your competence goes up your luck increases see and as your luck increases why the whole thing adds up to greater certainty you finally get insufferable and thats just fine fine ive heard person or two say recently well whatever else i can do i can audit by god i can audit you know they know that i heard myself saying it one day yep and they can too now there is stage of course before theyve been trained when they believed that too theres small valley about the depth of the grand canyon between that state and the next state of competence now certainty youre going to find the pcs goal thats going to be done because thatll keep you at it until you do it thats whats important itll keep you at it and if you havent got any real belief that youre going to find the goal youre liable to be kind of weak and staggerish about it now ill admit that at the end of about thirty or forty hours of slog on some pc who gets alternate dirty needles and that sort of thing and that is kind of hard to read and is stacking up lots of withholds and it slams on you like mad you start getting little laggardly about these things you know and you dont really pitch it in too hard you have tendency to slow down little bit and the more you slow down why the less certainty is entered into the session the less certainty youve got and the less likely you are to finish your job off you must always finish the job off you owe it to your own morale to finish the job off that is the whole thing so it took seventyfive hours to find aunt mabels goal kick her in the head afterwards if you must but spend the seventyfive hours you got the idea dont go stacking up bunch of people whose goal you didnt find you understand thats almost fatal along the line now lets get into the technology itself this is fairly well settled now ill just go over this very rapidly on dynamic assessment you ought to have your 850 goals audited on the pc just to have good backlog supply of goals it should be you can violate that your pc should be prepchecked and be very auditable sometimes you will violate that but for sure you enter into your next steps they go something on this order and this is current and this routine is susceptible to being changed and if i find any shorter shortcuts youre sure going to get them but it runs something like this its who or what have you detested now its usually not necessary to add in this lifetime but you can if you wish and you finally get yourself list and if youve got very very close eye to the meter youll see that some of them slammed youll see that some of these names slammed sometimes it comes the first one on the list after youve been totally spoiled and realized that every time you ask thisany person who he detests that you get the item the first timebecause its in the majority of the cases you doyou then run into the pc that the item is 436 down the list that makes citizen out of you again and there you are but you get this detested person and this slams and you take this slamming detested person and you find what part of existencethis is paraphrasing its almost any phrasing of thisdoes that person represent to you you dont say what iswhat part of existence does this person consider the dynamics to be or what dynamics does this person consider to be ive made that error two or three times and it never works its always what part of existence so you say what part of existence does this person represent to you and the person will give you usually dynamic list and this list is going to have some slams on it probably of one kind or another and youre going to get long list there and you may not get slam that you run out on that particular one you seethats possibly not slamming your first list of detested people only had few slams on it you had dwindling slam or anything like that it just slammed once in while you know and you got this list of dynamics and it just slammed once in while and it isnt necessary that you have any dwindling slam yet because you havent entered that zone or area now you assess that on consand all of these assessments are carried on with consider committing overts against or some such phrase think of doing bad things to theres lot of these things those are not optimum someday well get better phrasing for that because the pc thinks youre telling him to do something and he always tries to do it and sometimes gets all gummed up on it we dont know better one though than at this particular time than consider committing overts against that is the assessment question so we find this thing and then having found this slamming item on this list we then know we have or think we have the dynamic and now having the pcs dynamic we want who or what would this represent to you see this dynamic see well lets say the dynamic was families see well what do families represent to you see now youre going to get yourself slamming now is the first for sure dwindling slam youre going to get if youre right youre going to get dwindling slam now what do we mean by dwindling slam you take the item the dynamic in this case you take the dynamic you get it so it reads now the rule is if youre going to list anything you get it to read first if youre going to list from anything you get it to read first i can tell you lot about how to get things to read but you get this thing reading and mosta lot of your lack of success is is you have this thing so suppressed or so unsuppressed or something that it wont read and you dontyou find the item on tuesdayi mean the dynamic on tuesday and its families and it slams like crazy and you pick it up on wednesday to continue your session and it doesnt even tick so you tiger drill it couple of minutes to see if itand you finally get it so it gets little tiny dirty needle and now you go ahead and you list from this thing youre going to lay an egg man you want slam in that thing you want that item slamming just as before before you go on listing from it you understand now when you list that item down on what does that item represent to you the pcyoure going to get dwindling slam and thats going to start wide and item by item it is going to diminish now sporadic slam is different than dwindling slam these things are enormously different dwindling slam diminishes item by item written thing by written thing you get dwindling slam its less and less and less and less and finally dirty needle and it isnt even dirty needle and gone now when we say dwindling it may start two inches wide and then itll be an inchandthreequarters wide and then few items later youre watching this thing and it will be an inchandahalf wide and then itll be an inch wide and then itll be halfaninch wide and then itll be quarterofaninch wide and its just little dirty needle and then its disappearing and then you complete the list you bleed the meter you ask the pc are there any more and if you see reaction here you write it down you see and you got that thing complete now that is dwindling slam that is different than sporadic slam sporadic slam is you write down you know what does families represent to you see and oooooo it goes bang bang bang bang and you write the next item down and theres reaction you write the next item down theres reaction you write the next item down theres reaction and then you write down an item and you get big bang bang big slam so forth and then you write down another item and theres reaction and bang bang bang another slam you see and when you finally finish the thing up ityou arent getting any slams anymore but if you cleaned up the original thing from which it proceeded you would get the slam back again you understand in other words this slam has not been listed out this slam is occasionally turned on and theres where an auditor is fooled more than anything else and its most heartbreaking to sit there and watch something that youre absolutely sure would list and the darn thing theres slam about every third or fourth item and then you list eight items in row they all slamsame width not diminishing and then you list seven more after that and theres slam on those and then you list an item and it slams you see nah thats not dwindling slam you understand but this nice interesting phenomenathe dwindling slamwill occur now when you finally got the item what do you do with the item you want to know what goal might you have thatd be an overt against and lets say its diapers thats good one for families and so on so its diapers and what would be an overt against diapers and man theres your dwindling slam again if youre right and that is the right item itll be your dwindling slam of course youve assessed this item list of course with consider committing overts against just like you did anythe dynamic list just like you did the person list you see everything that is anlooks like dynamic or an item or detested person or thing you see that is always assessed with consider committing overts against youre assessing with slam for slam therefore its dynamic assessment by rock slam and you turn this thing on that way now when you list those goals out you list dwindling slam and itll dwindle down just as ive described to you to dirty needle and drift out that doesnt mean the goal is on that list thats just proved the fact that its the item and that dwindling slam is the proof of the pudding the main thing that youre going to do wrong is youre going to ride th is horse to death see youre going to get this long list and youre going to assess this thing and itstheres nothing slamming anywhere on the list you know its consider committing overts against and you got your rudiments in and theres nothing slamming and its all dirty needleeverythings got little dirty needle little instant dirty needleand you finally pick out this little instant dirty needle thing and now thatyet you say that must be the item and see youve read all the way through this 329 list and you assessed it all and oh man youve worked like mad now the horse drops dead see about the time youve been through it once and nothing has slammed on the whole list that horse is dead man and yet youll continue to ride the horse youll go over it again you saw do it about two or three times on tv on the research sessions remember those were just research sessions seeno reason why you should do it all right now whats going to happen here this horse falls dead and then you get off and you take your canteen and you fill up sponge and you wash out the horses mouth and you groom him and so forth and you polish all of his harness you know and you sleek him up you comb his mane you know what are you doing you had business around there get yourself another horse grooming dead horses youre going to often find yourself doing that because youre so hopeful you say well at any minute now slams going to turn on see and were going to go through this 389 list and its only taken us five sessions to do it because it takes so long to get the rudiments in and all you get out of it is dirty needles and all that sort of thing and youre just nowhere see well ill tell you although i may do this myself once in whilei tell you i know when to get off that horse now i unload before the horse drops dead i know he isnt going any further and i drop into the sand and go find mystart whistling for another horse because i know he isnt going anyplace hes got kansas city or wichita on his nose now youve got tremendous list but this is why dynamic slams arewhy you have trouble with them they havent got the item on them your rudiments could be desperately out in the sessionwhich isnt very probable not at the auditing skill level youre inor the item isnt on the list so actually the answer is the item wasnt on the list thats it the item isnt on the list if you can just get that through your ead of course youprobably everyone of you have to learn as hard as i did ive just done assessment after assessment after assessment after assessment on and on and so forth and carry each one through to its final total completion of finding out not one stayed in there i am sitting there or one is giving little tiny slam of some kind but wont list see the item wasnt on the list thats all and i found that to be true every time now ill tell you how i do it these days i go over the list once and if i get slam i stop right there and we go on about our business i advise you to go over the list twice because sometimes if pc is somewhat out of session the item will skip around one will slam and another one will slam then itll settle down on something i was reviewing pc fewcouple three weeks ago thatd already been done and had gotten the wrong item on the pc wrong item but there was one item on the list that was slamming so i just read down the list came to the slamming itemi would like to tell you that i finished up the list but in actual fact i didnt this item was slamming man boom bow see like dropping hot shell into powder magazine you know boow see all the rest of it dead calm you know and heres this one bow and i just stopped right there i said well thats that the reason i stopped there is because the pc cognited twoandthree quarters yards worth youll learn that the pcs interest follows the slam and the pcs cognitions follow the right items pcs sitting there you know holding the cans you knowsitting there doing nothing sitting there pc is sitting there and you saying hogwash and dillywumps and buffaloes and whatever the item and the pc sits there you knowhogwash and so forth and all of sudden you hit crackerjack see and you say crackerjack and the pcyou know i had an uncle once who was in the cracker jack business manufactured cracker jack i used to eat so much of those used to always make very sick cracker jack always used to always make very sick and its very interesting thing that that ties in with the supreme being very well now i havehave two or two or three instances here where the supreme being is tied in with cracker jack there are several instances on record where cracker jack has been very very interesting that reminds of goal i had once too you read down the list you see and theres the pc you know all of sudden you know what the hell what are you going on any further for the meter slams the pc slams everything slams see the pcs interest suddenlybzzzzzzz ah go down to the bottom of the list and go down again and youll find youryoull eventually find out that youre right and youll get very great confidence youll find that item slams every time you go by it you should know the item far earlier than the pc ever dreams of it you should know that the item is on the list first pass through and if youre insufferably cocky youll just pick it off the first pass through youll be going on down the line and read on down to the end but you already know its cracker jack and you just lay the whole thing aside and say all right well now cracker jack cracker jack that slams very nicely all right now were going to take this now thanks and pc is saying and my uncle joe once had cracker jack factory and so forth and you say all right thank you very much now were going to take this piece of paper here and were going to write on down the line here now who or what represents cracker jack to you you know we dont care what exact question we ask him as long as we get represents in it to you and we get it stretched out there and weve got our next list or weve got our goals list now thats the way its done the goal isordinarily occurs on list 6 and it occurs one two three or four on list 6 which i think is fabulous if you were cracker jack what goal of yours would be impossible to achieve if youre lucky itll be in the first three or four of list 6 if it isnt your luck was out that day and you better follow the next plan of action which is to tiger drill the positivenegative buttons versus cracker jack your goalwould your goal suppress cracker jack would your goal invalidate cracker jack you just take the thirteen buttons would your goal be careful of cracker jack also you add few buttons of your own selection you say cracker jack thats very interesting all right well put in devour on our button list and spit out and buy and well put give away and then of course well have ignore you get the idea just add them to your buttons list you make up your own thats what ive been doing lately is making up my own prehav assessment for the thing and its quite interesting so you sayyou take the itemthis items well provedand you say would your goal positivenegative seewould your goal suppress cracker jack would your goal not suppress cracker jack would your goal invalidate cracker jack would your goal not invalidate cracker jack and all of sudden youre going to be looking at great big rock slam youve got it there it is now you have the pc list goals which would not invalidate cracker jack and hell give you four or five and if your luck is in its on that list maybe the first one or two got it seems to do something to his mind got that as method of finding goals ive talked to you long time about this using the prehav scale to find goals well ive been doing it lately and its been very successful looks good looks good now theres another shortcut you cant find yourself the dynamic all you can find is something that goes flitter and thub and dirty needle and disappears and you cant find anything you can do this horrible shortcut but i dont advise it or advertise it but this horrible shortcut is just skip the detested person skip the dynamic skip the item and you just list straight out flat outyou say what do you wish wasnt part of existence you make great big long list get the pc well grooved in make thirty or forty fifty items on this list and then throw it away that gets him well grooved in and you ask him right sequitur to that what isnt part of existence and you go on down the line and his item will be on it because the characteristic of all of these items is that they arent part of existence the pc has too many overts on them so naturally theyre totally unreal so therefore they arent part of existence you got the idea now you take that and you do the same button trick on it and so forth lets say and then youll find out this isthis is how you got cracker jack it wasnt part of existence and there it is slamming all you do is consider overts against that what is not part of existence list do you understand supposing you wind up with dynamic and you cant find the item well the dynamic was probably the item so youafter you cant prove it out you abandon the whole thing and list goals against the dynamic you got the idea whatyou list goals against what youve got you didnt get dwindling slam of goals nothing but you notice finallyheres the last desperate trick this is the end trick and the most desperate and the last appeal and if you got this far id be ashamed of you but you just find something that the pc slams against you happen to notice in prowling around that the pc every time you say cheesecake slams like mad every goal that has cheesecake in it slams like mad everything that has cheesecake in it slams like mad so you just take cheesecake and list goals against it thats desperation with capital d semidesperation is what isnt part of existence you see that all right thats your existing technology today thats about the way it goes if youre very clever auditor if youre very well trained if youre lucky if you audit with certainty and you follow the standards of the procedure ive just given you you wind up with the pcs goal every time and you cant avoid it you understand therefore goals finding is actually pretty easy today but i will say after doing lot of it myself that it requires these elements theres got to be some luck connected with it you got to be able to think on your feet and keep your eyes open theres substitute for it think on your feet and keep your eyes open you suddenly realize that this pc is not completing any lists you never get any item on any list that you can have anything to do with but you do have an itemyou got to know when to throw in the sponge and do semifinal action dont you see you got to know when to quit on these things you got to know when to take advantage of these things in other words you got to do some inspection and thinking for yourself within the broad framework of exactly how its done there then is substitute on top of itand ill give you the last qualification which is clever auditor and then you just find goals by the bucketloads okay male voice yes its tremendously therapeutic to find detested person on pc its therapeutic to find dynamic on pc its therapeutic to find the item on the pc therapeutic to find the goal on the pc and the last comment i will make is the pc will throw you for loss every time by telling you how good he feels and how wonderful he feels or how bad he feels how much he hurts ive been telling pcs lately thank you very much im very glad of that now thats very nice im very happy to hell with it now lets get on with the session i dont care how they feel were not doing these things to make the pc feel good because we have this enormous gain coming straight up thats greater than anything any man on earth has ever experienced before us so the pc doesnt have headaches anymore well thats dandy is he flying yet well lets get on with the assessment okay all right thank you very much good night
