this is very clear and very useful thanks keith at 1521 19012007 susan solomon wrote keith peter isaac ron thanks to all of you for helping out keith the audience for the presentations is the policy makers who will be present in paris as you have already seen from the comments many of them are not scientists the presentations need to be pitched at nonscientist level number of the policy people will be lawyers and number will be legalistically looking to find anything that can advance their position most of them will however just be looking to ask questions and to better understand and many will be constructive in how they use the information provided so it is quite mix they should not be given input that distracts from the job at hand therefore these presentations should not bring in new issues not raised in the comments figures from material outside the report etc i hasten to say that all of us hope there will not be big problems in going through the presentations the presentations are being carefully prepared by excellent people so my expectation would be for quite minor changes all of the above has been discussed with those preparing the presentations so primary role in cochairing this session is to lend constructively critical eye seeking to advance the goal of clarity conciseness and sticking to the report rather than straying if needed the outcome is not formal approval statement of the presentation the outcome is to guide the collective subgroup to clear consensus on what should be changed before the presentation is passed in to the tsu if there are things that majority of the group wants to see changed but others do not you will have chairmans job to do in finding solution everyone can live with it would probably be helpful if you could keep some notes on the agreed changes since that will help you ensure that you have been clear enough in stating the conclusion too often there is thrash and closure good chair gets agreement with the group thanks again susan at 100 pm 0000 11907 keith briffa wrote hi susan et sorry for delayed response just back from paris or so i originally thought as the meeting i was at turned out to be 3 hours away by train i too am happy to act as you request though i am still uncertain as to who the specific audience will be and more particularly what you expect as an outcome of the session formal approval statement or recommendation for amendments cheers keith at 0031 18012007 susan solomon wrote dear peter isaac ron and keith i am writing to let you know that the agenda for our cla meeting to take place in paris on saturday and sunday jan 2728 will have your names listed for proposed role and i hope you will be able to accept at the end of the second day of the meeting we will go over the set of longer science presentations that will be given informally during the lunchtime sessions there will be two parallel sessions from 46 pm on sunday and i am hoping that peterkeith can chair one dealing with drivers obs and paleo whle ron and isaac can chair one on attributionsea levelprojections earlier on satsun we will also have gone over the shorter formal presentations that will be used to start each section of the spm during the meeting see below for some more information clas requested for preparation of the shorter presentations an important point is that the short and long presentations should be consistent and should strongly support the spm approval process see below we are seeking tough chairmen who could keep to strict time schedule and avoid slippage b ensure that clear statement is made about what the group conclusion is eg if the group feels that particular presentation should be changed that needs to be made clear to the person who will hand in the final presentation to the tsu and c helps the group to focus on the need for these presentations to communicate with policy people not overly technical and help address the comments received not to digress in short to be tough fair constructive and well organized thanks in advance for considering helping with this if you feel you cannot do it let know but i will assume silence is agreement to serve best

xbrightmailtracker aaaaaa xrcptto ssolomonaztecalnoaagov xdpop version number supressed dear clas we are writing to address the two types of presentations shorter and longer that are to be given in paris number of you have asked about the shorter presentations in particular and we want to clarify that here we would like to ask the people who served as section coordinators for each section in our tsspm meetings to coordinate pulling together the shorter presentations of not more than 10 slides ramaswamy on drivers bindoff on observations hegerl on attribution stocker on projections many of you have kindly already sent around draft material for the longer science presentations and that has been very helpful these will occur informally during lunch breaks or before the morning sessions at the plenary and will not be subject to simultaneous translation the most interested delegates will typically find these very helpful and will want to use them to ask you questions in addition during the regular formal sessions and prior to presentation of each of the major sections of the report drivers observations attribution and projections we will benefit from very short presentation that introduces the section the speakers words will be subject to simultaneous translation we suggest that the paleo ice core material be covered as part of the drivers that the paleo observations be covered as part of the observations etc to speed things up we can switch speakers but keep slides in the same file these shorter presentations are extremely important in setting the stage they must be very short we will have an absolute limit of not more than 10 minutes preferably 5 minutes for the shorter sections of the report namely drivers and attribution please do not include more than maximum of 10 slides questions will be strictly limited by the session chair susan or dahe to matters of clarity eg if an axis isnt clear we will go over both the shorter and the longer presentations jointly at our preparatory meeting at the unesco center on satsun jan 2728 so please come prepared to do that an agenda for the preparatory meeting will be circulated to you shortly the shorter presentations can largely be derived from the longer ones they will be most helpful if they do seek to provide general sense of how the section is meant to fit together and some key highlights they present the figures and tables used in the spm section to follow but do not include figures from the chapters unless absolutely essential including figures from outside the report could create problems and should be avoided they avoid raising new issues or suggesting changes from the distributed spm as some of us have seen in the heated discussions via email about the moc sticking to the agreed consensus obtained in the chapter teams is something our colleagues who will not be in paris would appreciate our doing as much as possible we will need to agree to all changes to be presented by us to delegates as team in our preparatory meeting on jan 2728 they will choose to seek more and that is what we will have to jointly manage they have very little text on them as simple as possible they do not try to cover each bullet you may wish to consider whether it is helpful to alternate speakers between your science presentation and these short presentations so that more of you get chance to speak some of you asked for sample presentations you are probably aware that we completed special report on hfcsozone in 2005 the short presentation on our section section 2 at that session worked extremely well and is appended here as an example in case you want to glance at it along with the spm itself we had much less material to cover of course and more time to do it this is more than 10 slides but dont be tempted as that was different situation but we hope this is still helpful we look forward to seeeing you and discussing all of the presentations on jan 2728 best regards susan
