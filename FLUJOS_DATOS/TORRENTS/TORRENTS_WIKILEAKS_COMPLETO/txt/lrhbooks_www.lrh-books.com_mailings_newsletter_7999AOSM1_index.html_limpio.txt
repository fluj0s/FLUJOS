anatomy of the spirit of man date increasing the ability of spiritual being if you continue to validate the materialistic aspects of existence and only validate those things and if you continue to neglect the spiritual abilities which are inherent in the being you forecast and predict for your auditing and for what you are doing failure all the way along the line were not talking about healing science were talking about science of ability and part of that ability happens to be incidentally being wellpart of the ability if we took huge disk here and we cut it up into an infinitely small number of pie slicesan infinite number tiny little pie slices that you couldnt see with microscopeone of those would be the ability to stay well and the rest of them would be important therefore the direction of processing is successful so long as the auditor is knowingly aware that he is increasing the ability of spiritual beingas long as hes aware of this increasing the ability of thetan to handle existence this excerpt was taken from anatomy of the spirit of man congress your power of imagination and invention an article by l ron hubbard excerpted from the anatomy of the spirit of man congress lectures and when you were little kid running around the world looked real bright and that stick you had was horse and that doll you had was live baby and that house you had was castle years later you take look at these objects and what do you see you see stick doll and very small house whats happened why does the world look bright to child more and less than this child assigns meaning and an adult has gone on oneway flow so long that he lets everything assign meaning to him he looks over there he sees wall so thats wall he looks at another person and he says just personbody certain amount of education certain amount of liability hes saying to himself now i know you know now i know all about everything in other words ive stripped the meaning out of everything i have the exact proper assignment to everything and then we get what we get person who has very dull world around him well now there are meanings there definitely are meanings the woof and the warp of the meanings of the world and as long as you are anxious about what things really mean and as long as things are upsetting to youthat is to say you know they might mean this and they might mean thatas long as you have these feelings about your surroundings why you have tendency to be rather unhappy about meaning you just keepwhat is the actual meaning of that wallyouve got nuclear physicist he takes look at nonexistent atom which exists by agreedupon postulate and so forth and he says now this meansand he has total agreement of its meaning see its just as nicegot it all settled its all buttoned up he knows exactly what it is but its damn lie and all he can do with it is blow things up do you see this he then has invented unknowingly along with all other inventions some new meaning and then has agreed upon it and then has said that this thing is the truth and thereafter refuses to let himself put any other meaning into it now he has learned his textbook hes all set you see well the funny part of it is is there is an exact way in which that wall got there in which that man got there and so on there is this exactness but listen just because there is an exact way it all got there is reason for you to lay aside your power of imagination and invention because thats all the fun youll ever have if nuclear physicist could look at an atom and say what nice baking soda that definitely means that if i mix it up with professor i will get an agency if he had the freedom to do this he could come home at night and pat the little kids on the head and be nice to the wife and eat dinner without following it with bicarbonate of soda but he doesnt do that he stays in the laboratory all the time and the fact that the gamma goes by the square root of the beta which goes under the lambda and this is all agreed upon and is all niceonly its kind of desperate mystery only hes got to find out more about these extant lies and he says it means just soandso and its all mathematical and ive got it all down in my notebook and he comes home and he slaps kid and he sits down and hewhat you got for dinner rrrf and takes the baking soda says to hell with the world lets blow it all up why does he do that hes lost his power to put any meaning into it he doesnt know where it came from hes agreed with lot of lies and hes stuck with it l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture group processing

congress lectures always coincide with something i am doing on different dynamics ive been listening to the congresses in order since they came out there is something i noticed that i noticed in the late 80s when i was doing the lower levels as an auditor at that time i was also listening to the pdc lectures i was surprised to find that the data on these lectures was paralleling what i was learning on the levels in present time the congress lectures always coincide with something i am doing on different dynamics im on an advanced course and i cant tell you how many times datum has been applicable to what i was doing as an auditor the lectures gave more data on the objectives i was running at that exact moment there is never only one reason why you should listen to rons lectures so
