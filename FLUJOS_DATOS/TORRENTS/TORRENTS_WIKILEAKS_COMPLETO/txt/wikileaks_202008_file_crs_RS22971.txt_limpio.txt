agency epa makes changes to its enforcement of the caa introduction congressional and consumer interest in natural gas vehicles ngvs for personal transportation has grown rapidly in recent months especially in response to higher gasoline prices concerns over the environmental impact of petroleum consumption for transportation and policy proposals such as the pickens plan1 although natural gas passenger vehicles have been available for years they have been used mostly in government and private fleets very few have been purchased and used by consumers larger ngvs mainly transit buses and delivery trucks also play role in the transportation sector especially due to various federal state and local incentives for their use however high upfront costs for new ngvs as well as concerns over vehicle performance and limited fuel infrastructure have led to only marginal penetration of these vehicles into the personal transportation market current market the energy information administration eia estimates that there were roughly 116000 compressed natural gas cng vehicles in the united states 1 on july 8 2008 t boone pickens announced plan calling for reduced petroleum imports through the expanded use of natural gas in transportation for an analysis of this plan see crs general distribution memoradum the t boone pickens energy plan preliminary analysis of implementation issues by jeffrey logan william f hederman and brent d yacobucci crs2 in 2006 and roughly 3000 liquefied natural gas lng vehicles2 roughly twothirds of ngvs are lightduty ie passenger vehicles this compares to roughly 230 million conventional mostly gasoline lightduty vehicles3 further of the roughly 165 million new lightduty vehicles sold in 2006 only about 2000 001 were ngvs4 for model year my 2008 only one ngv was available for purchase by consumers the cng fueled honda civic gx5 lifecycle cost issues currently natural gas vehicles are significantly more expensive than comparable conventional vehicles for example the incremental price between conventional honda civic ex and natural gaspowered honda civic gx is nearly 60006 although some of this difference is made up through tax credit for the purchase of new alternative fuel vehicles if taxpayer qualifies he or she may claim credit of up to 4000 for the purchase of new honda civic gx7 this tax credit is set to terminate at the end of 2010 it should be noted that with higher production this incremental cost should decrease but the likely extent of that decrease is unclear since the number of natural gas refueling stations is limited only about 400 to 500 publicly available nationwide8 compared to roughly 120000 retail gasoline stations9 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22971 the purchaser of new ngv would likely also install home refueling system according to consumer reports fuelmaker phill system costs 3400 plus roughly 500 for installation10 natural gas vehicles for america ngvamerica estimates that the phill system costs roughly 4500 plus installation11 however taxpayer can offset 2 us energy information administration eia alternatives to traditional transportation fuels 2006 may 2008 tables v1 and v4 3 stacy c davis

likely annual fuel savings in switching from gasoline to natural gas using recent average retail gasoline and residential natural gas prices annual fuel cost savings could be nearly 80013 between july 2008 and october 2008 the price of both gasoline and natural gas have declined substantially but the spread between them has remained relatively steady assuming 7 discount rate the current payback period for the cng vehicle is just over eight years depending on how long consumer keeps new vehicle this payback period may or may not be acceptable to that consumer assuming smaller differential between natural gas and gasoline prices or the expiration of the existing tax incentives can significantly increase this payback period assuming larger difference in fuel prices assuming smaller discount rate or assuming incremental natural gas vehicle prices decrease in the future this payback period could be shorter httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22971 other potential benefits and costs in addition to the lifecycle cost difference between cng and conventional vehicles there are other costs and benefits associated with natural gas vehicles which may not have defined price tag for example any reduction in petroleum dependence beyond the pergallon cost savings is not represented in the above payback period estimate some consumers may place value on displacing petroleum consumption and thus imports14 further natural gas vehicles in general have lower pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions than comparable gasoline vehicles although this may or may not be true for specific vehicles and pollutants15 key potential benefit raised by proponents of ngvs is that while the united states imports the majority of the petroleum it uses most natural gas is domestically produced further domestic output is higher than once thought likely due to recent growth in unconventional natural gas sources eg coal mine methane shale gas16 12 epact 2005 pl 10958 sec 1342 13 savings based on the following assumptions 15000 annual miles traveled both vehicles 29 miles per gallon mpg fuel economy for gasoline vehicle 28 mpg equivalent for natural gas vehicle 384 national retail average for regular gasoline 1831 per thousand cubic feet of residential natural gas 1215 cubic feet of natural gas per gasoline gallon equivalent therefore current residential natural gas prices are roughly 221 per equivalent gallon fuel economy estimates from doe fueleconomygov fuel price estimates are from eia 14 however it should be noted that reduction in domestic consumption will likely not lead to onetoone reduction in imports since reducing domestic consumption is also likely to reduce domestic petroleum production 15 doe afdc natural gas benefits httpwwweereenergygovafdcfuelsnatural_gas_ benefitshtml accessed september 16 2008 16 it should be noted that high natural gas prices may be needed to sustain some of this output otherwise the united states may need to import natural gas to meet growing demand crs4 but there are also several potential and measurable drawbacks to natural gas vehicles many related to vehicle performance and acceptability for example cng engines tend to generate less power for the same size engine than gasoline engines thus ngvs tend to have slower acceleration and less power climbing hills17 also because cng has lower energy density than gasoline cng vehicles tend to have shorter range than comparable gasoline vehicles18 in addition for passenger vehicles the larger natural gas storage tanks often occupy space that would otherwise be used for cargo generally in the trunk of sedan and in the bed of pickup truck19 again these considerations may or may not play into individual purchasers decision but could affect the overall marketability of the vehicles ngv conversions key question raised by those interested in the expansion of natural gas for automobiles is whether existing vehicles can be converted to operate on natural gas from technical feasibility standpoint there are few problems with converting vehicle to operate on natural gas most existing engines can operate on the fuel and most conversions involve changes to the fuel system including new fuel tank new fuel lines and modifications to the vehicles electronic control unit20 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22971 however converting an existing vehicle is more problematic from practical standpoint in the united states ngv conversions or any other fuel conversion can potentially run afoul of the clean air act caaall new vehicles gasoline or otherwise must pass rigorous tests to prove they will meet emissions standards over the life of the vehicle these tests tend to be very expensive although the marginal cost spread over full product run thousands to hundreds of thousands of vehicles are minimal after vehicle has been certified by the environmental protection agency epa any changes to the exhaust engine or fuel systems may be considered tampering under the caa section 203a3a21 states that it is prohibited for any person to remove or render inoperative any device or element of design installed on or in motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine in compliance with regulations under this title prior to its sale and delivery to the ultimate purchaser or for any person knowingly to remove or render inoperative any such device or element of design after such sale and delivery to the ultimate purchaser 17 the cng honda civic is rated at 113 horsepower hp while the gasoline civic ex is rated at 140 hp both have 18 liter engines carscom vehicle comparison

are modified versions of conventional gasoline vehicles presumably if there were enough consumer demand natural gas vehicle designed from the ground up could address the problem of cargo capacity 20 ngv conversion inc frequently asked questions accessed october 10 2008 httpngvuscompindexhtml 21 42 usc 7522a3a crs5 epa generally interprets this to mean that any change to vehicles engine or fuel systems that leads to higher pollutant emissions constitutes tampering under section 203 in 1974 epa issued guidance memorandum 1a to automaker and auto parts suppliers on what constituted tampering in terms of replacement parts under routine maintenance22 the guiding principle epa has used in enforcing the antitampering provisions for alternative fuel conversions is that such changes are allowed as long as the dealer has reasonable basis to believe that emissions from the vehicle will not increase after the conversion instead of requiring all converted vehicles to undergo testing equivalent to new vehicle testing epa allowed vehicle converters flexibility in certifying their emissions however in the 1990s epa received data from the national renewable energy lab that many vehicles converted to run on natural gas or liquified petroleum gas lpg and certified under the flexibility provisions might be exceeding emissions standards23 therefore in 1997 epa issued an addendum to memorandum 1a tightening the testing standards for these conversions the original decision required compliance with new httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22971 testing procedures starting in 1999 subsequent revisions extended the deadline thorough march 2002 currently certifying vehicle conversions can be very expensive for small producers since each vehicle must be independently certified for example converter must test the emissions of the conversion of specific engine families eg my2008 46l v8 ford vehicles each different engineemissions system combination must be tested independently eg my2009 vehicles or vehicles with different engines therefore the production and use of universal conversion kits is effectively prohibited under the epa enforcement guidance24 to allow market for conversion kits the caa would need to be amended to allow for these conversions regardless of vehicle emissions or epa would need to conclude that the conversions do not increase emissions ngvamerica estimates that it can cost as much as 200000 to design manufacture and certify conversion for single engine family25 some companies have completed the required testing on limited number of vehicles and offer conversions ngvamerica maintains list of the companies that currently sell ngv conversion equipment and the vehicles that have been certified by those companies26 in addition to the civic gx produced by honda ngva lists four 22 epa office of enforcement and general counsel mobile source enforcement memorandum 1a june 25 1974 23 epa office of enforcement and compliance assistance addendum to mobile source enforcement memorandum 1a september 4 1997 24 to make conversion kit that would work for all vehicles manufacturer would need to certify the emissions of the conversion on every engine family for all model years an very expensive proposition 25 stephe yborra op cit 26 ngvamerica guide to available natural gas vehicles and engines updated september 3 continued crs6 companies that convert ford and general motors vehicles mostly lightduty trucks such as pickups and vans according to epa requirements vehicles must be converted by the original manufacturer of the conversion equipment or by retrofitter trained and qualified by the conversion manufacturer ngvamerica estimates that converting passenger vehicle can cost over 10000 eg they estimated 13500 for ford crown victoria although specific costs would be determined by the manufacturer andor retrofitter27 conversions would be eligible for the 4000 alternative fuel vehicle tax credit see lifecycle cost issues above some have questioned whether vehicle conversion would void the original manufacturers warranty however only those vehicle systems directly modified by the conversion would raise warranty concerns in those cases the conversion manufacturers warranty would warranty the modified systems for systems not affected by the conversion eg suspension climate control the original manufacturers warranty would still apply28 conclusion higher gasoline prices and concerns about us oil dependence have raised interest in ngvs energy policy proposals such as the pickens plan have further httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22971 raised interest in these vehicles however currently the number of new vehicles capable of operating on natural gas is relatively low and there are limited opportunities for converting existing gasoline vehicles to run on natural gas the market for natural gas vehicles will likely remain limited unless the differential between natural gas and gasoline prices remains high in order to offset the higher purchase price for natural gas vehicle conversions of existing vehicles will also continue to be restricted unless the caa is amended or if epa makes changes to its enforcement of the caa
