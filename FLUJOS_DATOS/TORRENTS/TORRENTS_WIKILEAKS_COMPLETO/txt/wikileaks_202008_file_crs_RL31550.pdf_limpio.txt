1997 congress enacted the amtrak re form and accountability act the goal of which was to promote amtraks selfs ufficiency with respect to operating funds within five years the law has provisions directing amtrak to make plans for its liquidation in the event that it does not reach the goals set forth it directs the amtrak reform council to present congress plan for restructuring in tercity rail passenger service it also directed the general accounting office to report on the implications of amtraks possible liquidation many years have passed nd amtrak has realized ne ither profit nor operational selfsufficiency although liquidation has not been proposed the threat of shutdown has arisen this report examines the railroad re organization provisions under the u s bankruptcy code subchapter iv 11 usc 1164 1174 these provisions which exclusively govern railroad bankruptcy reflect the general flexibility of chapter 11 to promote wide variety of restructuring options including liquidation in railroad bankruptcies trustee is alwa ys appointed and the public interest is factored into the courts decisions this report also considers the constitutional authority of congress to restructure railroad transportation under the commerce clause and to make laws concerning bankruptcy and liquidation under the bankrupt cy clause in the case of railroad insolvency the two provi sions are often related it is impossible to predict the precise financial impact an amtrak bankruptcy reorganization or liquidation might have on its creditors and employees but much of the concern expressed is focused on the fu ture of rail service it is unlikely that amtraks bankruptcy alone would determine the future of intercity passenger rail service shaping the future of rail service need not and in all probability would not occur solely through the vehicle of an amtrak bankruptcy congressional action to address national trans portation needs may occur independe nt of courts

this report surveys those provisions in the bankruptcy code unique to railroad re organization and it considers laws governing amtrak that could affect its filing under the bankruptcy code railroad reorganization pr ovisions in the u s bankruptcy code background the first bankruptcy provisi ons dedicated to railroad reorganization were enacted during the 1930s new 77 entitled reorganization of railroads engaged in interstate comme rce was appended to the bankruptcy act of 18982 the predecessor to the current code despite the fact that 77 was amended over the years it was perceived as inadequate to reso lve railroad industry problems arising during the 1970s in 1973 in response to national rail crisis precipitated by the bankruptcy filings of eight railroads in the midwest and northeast congress passed the regional rail reor ganization act3 the act intended to supplement to 77 created gove rnment corporation the us railway association to formulate pl an to restructure the

subject of bankr uptcies throughout the united states5 the role of chapter 11 generally chapter 11 is designed to facilitate the rehabilitation of business btors through financial re organization the chapter is premised on the assumption that creditors will be better served by preserving the debtors business as an ongoing concern if reorganization is not feasible the debtor may be liquidated under chapter 11 as well although procedurally complex the ultimate goal of the process is to permit debtor through negotiations with creditors to reach consensual plan for feasible reorganizati on while the code has many provisions governing the process for reaching consensus it is very flexible with respect to the business formats and options th at debtor may pursue in short the chapter is primarily concerned with two goals preservation of the debtors estate in manner that optimizes its continuance as an ongoing concern and marshaling the estates assets for the benefit of credito rs however prime purpose of bankruptcy is to safeguard certain creditor rights especially those of secured creditors and to promote equality of distribution among similarly situated creditors when reorganization is not viable option di sbursements through liquidation must be made in accordance with the bankruptcy code requirements and applicable nonbankruptcy law railroad reor ganization chapter 11 of the code governs reorganization subchapter iv 11 usc 1161 1174 d eals exclusively with railroads railroad may not file for liquida tion under chapter 7 of the code6 but railroad may be liquidated under chapter

protecting creditors interests in rolling stock termination of railroad line leases and abandonment of rail service12 interests of railroad employees several provisions of subchapter iv address

flexibility to accomm odate wide range of reorganization or liquidation plans consistent with chapter 11 ge nerally with respect to railroads the public interest is expressly accorded statutory

respect to liquidation the bankruptcy proceeding minimizes litigation to satisfy competing claims and provides finality to discharge of indebtedness22 amtrak as possible debtor in bankruptcy created by congress in 197023 amtrak arguably may be unique among historic and pr ospective railroad debtors although originally created as forprofit company to provide national intercity passenger rail service financial sel fsufficiency has never been realized and amtrak has been dependent upon federa l subsidies to ma intain operation24 hence amtrak unlike wholly privatelyowned company was created to serve an identified national transportation nee d and has been largely s upported by federal funds congress passed the amtrak reform nd accountability act of 1997 to address amtraks dependence on federal subsidies25 the law created goal of operational economic selfsufficiency by 200226 among other things it created the amtrak reform council the council was charge d with the responsibility to assess the likelihood of amtrak meeting the mandated goals if the council found that the goals were unlikely to be met by 2002 it was to develop and submit to the congress an action plan for restructured and rationalized national intercity rail passenger systemwhile amtrak itself would develop and submit to the congress an action plan for the complete liquidation of amtrak after having the plan reviewed by the inspector general of the partment of transportation and the general accounting office for accuracy and reasonableness27 the law sets out proposed procedure fo r consideration

amtraks labor costs however continue to represent ma jor segment of its operating cost national transportation polic versus debt repudiation congress effects national transportation policy incl uding rail transportation policy pursuant to its constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce32 congressional authority to legislate on the subject of bankruptcies is derived from the bankruptcy clause the provisions of title 11 governing railroad reorganization generally permit all manner of sale transfer ab andonment and ultimately disso lution of railroad carrier and its assets the bankruptcy code has not historically operated as an obstacle to congress authority to effect the restruct uring of railroads under its commerce clause power33 the bankruptcy clause does however require that laws on the subject of bankruptcies be uniform the subject matter of bankruptcy is defined as the subject of the relations between an inso lvent or nonpaying or fraudulent debtor and his creditors extending to his and their relief34 the us supreme court has interpreted this to mean that enactment of law to reassign priorities and distributions to creditors in single named debtors bankruptcy violates the bankruptcy clause35 what implications do these principles have for amtrak when people ask what will happen if amtrak is liquidated there are two components to the question what will be the future of inte rcity passenger railhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31550crs7 36see crs report rl30659 amtrak overview and options by david randall peterman see also intercity passenger rail

reform act effected employee benefit reforms the actual impact of 11 usc 1172c in bankruptcy filing is beyond the scope of this report in many instances statutory references are made to rep ealed statutes further whether implementing the provision would have material facto impact on amtrak employees is not consideredservice and what will happen to amtraks assets and creditors including its employees with regard to the former c ongress has many options to deal with the restructuring of intercity passenger rail service lthough many may be premised upon continuing fede ral subsidies36 few of these are foreclosed by the bankruptcy code requirements with respect to railroad liquidation as to the latter the general accounting office noted in its 2002 report that the liquidation of amtrak would presumably result in losses by creditors in cluding the federal government it could have financial impact on participants in the railroad retirement and unemployment systems passenger rail serv ice could be cut back or discontinued however many of these assumptions are premised on hy pothetical liquidation of amtrak in public policy vacuum absent consideration of as yet unknown but probable supplementary law or action to salvage passenger rail service the only major constraint upon congre ss with respect to liquidation of amtrak inheres in the requirement that bankruptcy laws be uniform assuming that congressional mandate to liquidate amtrak is not premised on the desire to alter or otherwise impair creditors rights this constitutionallybased requirement arguably has greater impact on the legislative approach congress may take with respect to amtraks insolvency than on congress prerogatives with respect to transportation policy and restructuring of intercity passenger rail service for example though ambiguous the amtrak reform and accountab ility act appears to contemplate congressional action to eff ect liquidation through freestanding legislation congressional enactment of gislation to liquida single named debtor ie amtrak would be more likely to run afoul of the bankruptcy clause than liquidation under the u s bankruptcy code likewise the provision in the reform act that makes 11 usc 1172c ina pplicable to amtraks employees is constitutionally suspect if it has the actual effect of reassigning creditor rights within named debtors bankruptcy amending the bankruptcy code for the sole purpose of reducing the rights of amtrak employees could violate the uniformity requirement37 nevertheless it is unlikely that the re quirements of railroad reorganization or liquidation will be the vehicle for national transportation planning congressional collaboration in transportation restructuring plan that has amtraks liquidation under the bankruptcy code as mere co mponent is more likely scenario
