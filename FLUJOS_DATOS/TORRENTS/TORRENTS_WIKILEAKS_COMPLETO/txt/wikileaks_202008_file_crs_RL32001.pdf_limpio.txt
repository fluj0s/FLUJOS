the region in 2007 including 230000 in the caribbean and 16 million in latin america moreover the dult prevalence rate in several countries in the caribbean and central america are among the highest outside of subsaharan africa in terms of sheer numbers brazil account s for about onethird of those living with hiv in latin america but its prevalence rate of 05 20052 is low compared to many countries in central america nd the caribbean furthermore brazils active prevention efforts have lowered pr evalence among the high risk groups intravenous drug users and homosexuals and the governments extensive antiretroviral arv treatment pr ogram has lowered death rates3 in contrast the mode of transmission in veral caribbean and central american countries has been primarily through unprotected heterosexual contact which has made it more difficult to contain the epidemic because it affects the general population the estimated adult infecti on rate in the caribbean was 10 in 2007 with the epidemic claiming an estimated 11000 liv during the year and 19000 lives in 2006 an estimated 17000 adults and children in the region became infected in 2007 aids remains one of the leading

infected population the us agency fo r international development usaid notes that haitis poverty c onflict and unstable governance ve contributed to the rapid spread of aids over the years in both countries however ther are indications that the epidemic could be reaching turning point because of prevention efforts nevertheless trends in both countries suggest the need to protect against resurgence of the epidemic in haiti there are been declining infection levels in portauprince and other cites and the declines appear to be associated with some protective behavioral changes an increase in condom use and drop in the number of sexual partners although aids mortality has so been factor in the dominican republic where there has been large incr ease in the use of condoms by commercial sex workers the epidemic appears to have stabilized5 however workers on sugar cane plantations bateyes continue to have high prevalence rates with rates up to 12 found among males aged
