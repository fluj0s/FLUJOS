exercise of religious unless this is the least restrictive way to further compelling government interest charitable choice regulations between january 4 and july 16 2004 the departments of agriculture ducation health and human rvices hhs housing and urban development hud justi ce labor and veterans affa irs issued final regulations to incorporate charitable choice principles in their social service programs the cardinal charitable choice rule is that religious orga nizations should be eligible to compete for funding on the same basis as other organizati ons this repudiates the doctrine that public funds given to pervasively sectarian orga nizations violate the constitution by promoting religion the new regulations spell out the terms under which faithbased organizations can provide federally funded serv ices as follows 1 federa l funds directly received by an organization cannot be used to pay for inhe rently religious activities such as worship religious instruction or proselytization 2 if the organization engages in religious activities it must offer them parately in time or location fro m services paid with direct federal funds 3 if federal funds are recei ved indirectly by an organization through vouchers or certificates as the result of the independent choice of the beneficiary the money may finance religious activities 4 religious organizations that provide federally funded services retain their independence nd may continue to carry out their mission 5 the organization may give preference to co religionists in hiring staff unless the

religious services on th same premises as job corps centers the department of veterans affairs longer requires that re ligious providers of services for the homeless certify that they will not exert r eligious influence in their program and it longer prohibits religious preference in hiring by religious organizations hud has rescinded rule barring religious groups from directly owning housing projects the new rules of hud and the department of agricu lture permit federal f unds to be used to acquire construct or repair structure used for provision of both secular services and religious activities so long as the governme ntsponsored areas are not the principal place of worship agriculture department regu lations clarify preexisting practice under which religious schools that receive school lunch f unds may require their students to attend religious classes the justice depa rtment has dropped rule barring religious groups from ever making religious use of certa in property transferred to them for social service purposes and now permits religious usage after five years justice department regulations also allow use of federal funds to pay for chapla ins to work with inmates in penal institutions missing from the new regulations is ma jor provision of the housepassed hr 7 requirement that beneficiary who objects to provider on grounds of religion be offered an alternate and accessible provider hhs declined to include this requirement but noted in the preamble to its regulations that one commentor insisted that redeemable vouchers that give beneficiarie s choices between programs ar only as real as the choices among programs asked by one commentor fo r definition of faithbased hhs said that it used the terms religious organization and faithbased organization interchangeably it added that neither the us constitution nor the relevant supreme court precedents contain comprehensiv definition of religion or religious organization the bush administration has pursued its faithbased initiative vigorously setting up offices of faithbased and community initiatives ofbcis in 10 agencies and the white house the white house ofbci has c
