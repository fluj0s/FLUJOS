congress this report pr esents variety of data available about revenues collected from fe deral estate and gi ft taxes to provide background material for the debate the xt discusses the numbers presented in 12 tables the first section of the report presents the most recent distributional data available from the internal revenue service irs for estate tax returns filed in 2004 it shows the amount of estate tax paid by each of five categories of size of gross estate both separately table 1 and cumulatively table 2 it also presents the average size of gross estate the average estate taxes paid and the average tax rate as percentage of the gross estate for each of the five size categories table 3 the second section of the report descri bes the substantial increases in the applicable exclusion amount or exempt amount under the estate tax scheduled from 1997 through 2009 the repeal of the estate tax scheduled for 2010 and the reinstatement of the estate tax with lower exclusion amount in 2011 if changes are made to current law it also presents the scheduled decrease in the maximum marginal estate tax rate table 4 the third section of the report examines the relationship between the increase in the applicable exclusion amount or filin g threshold and the number of estate tax returns that were filed and taxable as well as the total amount of tax paid from 1998 through 2004 table 5 it traces the differing patterns of the number of taxable returns by size of gross in both absolute numbers table 6 and measured as percentage of deaths table 7 the fourth section reveals that less than half of all estate tax returns filed from 1998 through 2004 were taxable table 8 the percentage of taxable returns was higher the larger the gross estate size class there was large drop in the percentage of returns that were taxable with in each size class between 1998 and 2004 the fifth section of the report presents da ta on actual estate nd gift tax revenues collected from fy1999

marks time of changes in the estate tax laws brought about by the taxpayer re lief act of 1997 tra pl 10534 and the economic growth and tax relief reconciliati on act of 2001 egtrra pl 107 16 in particular these tw laws provided for increases in the applicable exclusion amount under the estate tax as shown in the first column of table 4 egtrra also provided for gradual decrease in the maximum marginal estate tax rate as shown in the second column of table 4 2 the applicable exclusion amount has tw important implications first federal estate tax return must be f iled if us decedents gross assets3 equal or exceed the applicable exclus ion amount for the year of the decedents death that is why the applicable exclusion amount is sometimes called the tax filinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32768crs5 4 the unified credit is applied against both estate and gift tax obligations 5 the taxpayer relief act also created new exclusion from the estate tax for qualified familyowned businesses that was in effect from 1998 through 2003 the exclusion was limited to total of 1300000 in combination w ith the applicable exclusion amount the familyowned business exclusion was converted to deduction by the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of 1998 pl 105206 under egtrra the family owned business deduction was repealed in 2004 when the applicable exclusion amount for all estates was increased to 1500000 for more information see crs report 95444 history of federal estate g ift and generationskipping taxes by john r luckeythreshold second each estate tax return receives unified transfer tax credit equal to the tax that would be due on the applicable exclusion amount4 thus the transfer of an amount of assets up to the applicab exclusion amount is free from federal tax for every estate egtrra referred to the applicable exclusion amount as the unified credit effective exemption amount it is sometimes called the exempt amount for short the applicable exclusion amount is not i ndexed for inflation nor is it set with an explicit target of taxing only certain percentage of the population for example the wealthiest one or two percent instead congress has intermittently changed the dollar amount from 1987 thr ough1997 the applicable exclus ion amount remained at 600000 under provisions of the economic recovery tax of 1981 erta pl 9734 the taxpayer relief act of 1997 tra pl 10534 phased in relatively gradual increase in the applicable exclusion amount from 600000 in 1997 to 1000000 in 2006 the applicable exclusion amount rose to 625000 in 1998 650000 in 1999 and 675000 for 2000 and 20015 in addition the taxpayer relief act provided for the applicable exclusion amount to increase to 700000 for 2002 and 2003 850000 for 2004 950000 for 2005 and 1 million for 2006 and beyond however before the provisions of tra were fully phased in they were superseded for tax years 20022010 by the provisions of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation ac t of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 egtrra raised the applicable exclusion amount to 1 milli on beginning immediately in 2002 and 2003 it increased the exclusion in large increments to 15 million for 2004 and 2005 2 million for 20062008 and 35 million in 2009 it repealed the estate tax and generationskipping transfer tax entirely for the estates of decedents dying in 2010 but the provisions of egtrra will sunset on december 31 2010 unless new legislation governing the tate tax is enacted before hand in 2011 the law will revert to that in effect prior to june 7 2001 the estate tax will be reinstated with an applicable exclusi on amount of 1 million the amount that tra had provided for 2006 and beyond and the familyowned bus iness deduction will be reinstated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32768crs6 6 assets are typically valued at their fair mark et value as of the date of death however they may be valued as of the alternate valuation date six months after the date of death or the date of distribution of the property from the estate if earlier the alternate valuation date might be elected by the executor if the assets have lower value on that

taxable estate values below 3 million and the unified credit or applicable exclusion amount such that the eff ective rate of tax on the entire estate was 55 as the result of clerical error in the final text of tra of 1997 later adopted by congress the surtax was intended to offset the benefits of only the graduated tax rates and not the unified credit relationship between the filing threshold and the number of taxable returns the tax law that applies to an estate is the law in effect in the year of the persons death6 however the estate tax return is not due until nine months after thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32768crs7 6 continued description of current law by john r luckey 7 david joulfaian estate taxes and charitable bequests evidence from two tax regimes unpublished research paper dec 2004 p 10 8 complex returns may be granted an extension longer than six months persons death and an extension of six m onths is not uncommon as consequence estate tax returns filed in given year are most likely to reflect the tax law in effect in the preceding year it has been estimated that of the estate tax returns filed for decedents dying in given calendar year roughly 5 are filed in the same calendar year 75 to 80 in the next year and the remaining 15 to 20 in later years7 it follows that estate tax returns filed in any given calendar year will include few returns of people who died in that ear mostly the returns of people who died in the previous year and some returns from deaths in prior years that are filing under an extension8 the applicable exclusion amount or tax filing threshold may well differ among the years represented for each filing year from 1998 to 2004 the second column of table 5 shows the applicable exclus ion amount for both the prior year top number and current year bottom number for example estate tax returns file d in 2001 will generally reflect filing threshold of 675000 the threshold in eff ect for both 2000 and 2001 in contrast estate tax returns filed in 2002 will include mainly the returns of decedents that fall under 2001 law when the threshold wa s 675000 as well as some under 2002 law when the effective filing threshold was 1 million estate tax returns filed in 2003 will generally reflect filing threshold of 1 million the law in effect for both 2002 and 2003 estate tax returns filed in 2004 will ge nerally reflect the 1 million threshold in effect for 2002 and 2003 but also some under the 15 million threshold in effect for 2004 an increase in the applicab exclusion amount would be expected to reduce the number of estate tax returns filed the number of returns that were taxable and the amount of estate tax paid relative to what they would otherwise be whether these numbers decline absolutely depends in large part on whether the increase in the exclusion amount outpaces the growth in th value of assets held by decedents as shown in table 5 even as the filing threshold was increasing in annual increments of 25000 from 600000 in 1997 to 625000 in 1998 650000 in 1999 and 675000 in 2000 the number of tax returns f iled and the number of taxable returns continued to rise th increasing pattern holds whether measured as absolute number of returns or as tax retu rns as percentage of deaths in the prior year reflecting the ninemonth grace period for filing returns this suggests that asset values were generally rising more rapidly than the filing threshold over the 19972000 period the number of estate ta x returns filed rose from 97856 or 423 of deaths in 1998 to 108322 or 453 of deaths in 2000 the number of taxable estates rose from 47475 or 205 of deaths in 1998 to 51999 or 217 of deaths in 2000 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32768crs8 9 explained later on page 13the numbers barely dipped in 2001 when the 675000 filing threshold was fully phased in this suggests that the filing threshold had caught up with the growth in asset values but the number of re turns filed dropped by 9 between 2001 and 2002 when the filing threshold increased by much larger step from 675000 to 1 million the number dropped by notewor thy 33 in 2003 when the million dollar threshold was fully phased in this suggests that at the 1 million level the tax filing threshold had moved ahead of the value of assets held by decedents in 2002 between 2003 and 2004 the number of returns f iled dropped by just 5 as the higher 15 million filing threshold be gan to take effect between 2001 and 2003 both the total numbe r of returns filed and the number of taxable returns fell by approximately 40 the total number of returns filed fell from 108112 to 66042 or from 450 of deaths to 270 of deaths the number of taxable returns fell from 51842 to 30626 or from 216 to 125 of deaths some of this decrease was caused by decline in asset values in addition to the large increases in the tax filing threshold from 675000 in 2000 and 2001 to 1 million in 2002 and 2003 the last column of table 5 shows that the total estate tax paid generally moved in the same direction as the number of ta xable returns with both rising from 1998 to 2000 and falling from 2000 to 2003 in percentage terms the total tate tax paid rose more than the number of taxable return s from 1998 to 2000 20 increase in taxes compared with 10 increase in the number of taxable returns but dropped less than the number of taxable returns from 2000 to 2003 15 decrease in taxes compared with 41 decrease in taxable returns net estate tax paid increased slightly from 207 billion in 2003 to 215 billion in 2004 reflecting the legislated decline

number of adult deaths ge 20 and over plus deaths for which age is unavailable was 976978 of all deaths fo r the years 1997 to 2002 consequently using total deaths instead of adult deaths as the nominator does not make much difference in the percentage 11 some estate tax returns are filed several ye ars after the decedents death in its publicly released data for returns filed in given year the irs excludes those late returns for which the gross value of the estate was less than the filing threshold in effect for the prior calendar year in 2003 for example 6498 returns were filed with from 675000 up to 1 million in gross assets of which 2365 were taxable these returns are not included in the publicly released data for returns filed in 2003 this practice somewhat understates the total number of returns filed the number of taxable returns filed and the amount of tax paid by the 600000 to 1 million gross estate size class for the 19982004 period examined in this report but it gives closer picture of what is occurring under the tax laws most pertinent continuedthe number of taxable estates in each size category of gross estate bove 5 million remained relatively constant

gross assets were below the filing th reshold in effect for the year of deathof taxable estates in the 1 million to 25 million size class grew from 1998 to 2001 reflecting growth in asset holdings and more than offsetting the decline in the lowest size class by the 2002 and 2003 filin g years however the increase in the tax filing threshold to 1 million and the decline in asset values had started to reduce the number of taxable returns in the 1 million to 25 million size class the downward trend in this si ze class continued in 20 04 as the 15 million threshold began to take effect the combined losse s in the two smallest size classes under 25 million caused most of the drop in th total from 2001 to 2002 and all of the drop from 2002 to 2004 the number of taxable returns in the 25

first section suggest that these increases can be expect ed to dramatically decrease the number of tax returns required to be f iled and the number of returns that are taxable from 2005 to 2009 through their effect on the 1 million to 25 million size class the decline in estate tax revenues shoul d be less than proportional to the decline in the number of taxable returns the scheduled furt her increase in the filing threshold to 35 million in 2009 is likely to moderately reduce the number of returns filed and taxable in the 25 million to 5 million class between 2009 to 2010 unless it is

estate and gift taxes include only the effects on estate and gift tax receipts the difference between the two series indicates the estimated effects of changes in income tax revenuesthe relatively modest estimated re venue losses from fy2006 through fy2010 stem primarily from projected decline in gift tax revenues the estimates are based on the assumption that taxpayers would immediately begin to reduce taxable gifts during their lifetimes if they knew that the estate tax would be permanently repealed in 2010 in addition the treasury departme nt projected that the enactment in 2006 of permanent repeal of the estate tax effective in 2010 would modestly affect revenues from the individual in come tax in two different ways first treasury assumes that lifetime char itable donations and accompanyi ng tax deductions would fall thereby increasing income tax revenues second and rger in effect it assumes that capital gains realizations by the elderly would fall thereby decreasing income tax revenues for all but one year in the forecast period fy2006fy2011 treasury projects that net reductions in income taxes would add to the decrease in revenues from gift taxes14 these negative effects on gift and income tax revenues are expected to continue from fy2011 onward if the estate tax is perm anently repealed jct assumes further that following estate tax repeal some deductions that would otherwise have been claimed on the estate tax return will instead be claimed on the last income tax return of the decedent thereby reducing income tax revenues this could include deductions for endoflife medical expenses and estate administration expenses the expected accompanying losses in income tax revenues are reflected in the fact that each year from fy2010 on the total revenue losses projected by both treasury and jct from permanent repeal of the estate tax shown in table 12 exceed cbos estimates of estate and gift tax revenues under current law shown in table 11 for the years
