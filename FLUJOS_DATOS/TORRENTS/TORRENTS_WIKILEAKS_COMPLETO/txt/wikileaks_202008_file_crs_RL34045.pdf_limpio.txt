1038s 623 hr 1956 hr 5629 s 1505 and s 1695 would expand regulatory activities of the food and drug administration fda by opening pathway for the approval of followon biologics biologic is preparation such as drug or vaccine that is made from living orga nisms in contrast most commonly used drugs are synthesized via chemical process follow on biologic is similar to the brandname or innovator product made by the pharma ceutical or biotechnology industry the new regulatory pathway would be analogous to the fdas authority for approving generic chemical drugs under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 pl 84417 often referred to as the hatchwaxman act the generic drug industry achieves cost savings by avoiding the expense of clinical trials as well as the initial drug research and development costs that were incurred by the brandname manufacturer the cost of speciality drug products such as biologics is often prohibitively high for example the rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis treatment embrel costs 16000 per year it is thought that pathway enabling the fda approval of followon biologics will allow for market competition and reduction in prices though perhaps not to the same extent as occurred with generic chemical drugs under hatchwaxman in contrast to chemical drugs which are relatively small molecules and for which the equivalence of chemical composition between the generic dr ug and innovator drug is relatively easy to determine biologic such as protein is much larger in size and much more complex in structure therefore comparing followon protein with the brandname product is more scientifically challenging than comparing chemical drugs in many cases current technology will not allow complete characterization of biological products additional clinical trials may be necessary before the fda would approve followon biologic this report provides brief introduction to the relevant law the regulatory framework at the fda the scientific challenges for the fda in considering the approval of followon biologics and description of the proposed legislation it will be updated as legislative events warrant

living organisms in contrast chemical drug is synthesized via chemical process followon biologic is similar but not identical to the brandname or innovator product made by the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industry the 110th congress is considering legislation hr 1038s 623 hr 1956 hr 5629 s 1505 and s 1695 that would expand regulatory activities of the food and drug administration fda by opening pathway for the approval of followon biologics 1 this pathway would be somewhat analogous to that which allowed for the approval of generic chemical drugs via passage of the drug price competition and patent term restor ation act of 1984 pl 84417 often referred to as the hatchwaxman act2 by offering an alternative to brandname drug products the hatch waxman act is credited with lowering the cost of drugs to consumers as well as allowing for the expansion of the generic drug industry in the united states at the time that hatchwaxman was being debated by congress and implemented by the fda the biotechnology industry was just beginning to develop its first human therapeutic agents the first fda approval of biotechnology drug for human use human insulin occurred in 1982 followed by human growth hormone in 1985 alpha interferon in 1986 tissue plasminogen activator in 1987 and erythropoietin in 1989 biotechnology products are expected to become larger and larger share of the drugs sold by the pharmaceutical industry to us consumers however with equivalent to the generic alternatives to chemical drugs the cost of therapeutic biologics is often prohibitively high for individual patients for example the rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis treatment embrel costs 16000 per year and biological drugs for multiple sclerosis range in price from 16000 to 25000 per year 3 spending by medicare in 2006 on just one such drug epogen was 2 billion more than the entire fy2006 budget for fda which was 1863 billion 1494 billion in direct appropriations and 369 million in user fees 4 in 2006 us spending on such speciality drugs was 54 billion or about 20 of total spending on pharmaceuticals5 speciality drugs are expected to comprise 26 of total pharmaceuticals purchased by 2010 almost doubling to 99 billion per year rate of increase that is second highest among all the components of health care spending exceeded only by diagnostic imaging6 from 2005 to 2006 the cost of nonspeciality ie chemical drugs rose 6 whereas speciality 1 sometimes referred to as biogenerics biosimilars or generic biologics the fda and many others consider the use of the word generic to be inaccurate because the term has been used in the context of chemical drugs to mean identical the fda often uses the term followon protein product because many biologics are proteins 2

g344g561mostly biologic drugs rose 217 spending on all pharmaceuticals currently represents about 11 of health care spending in the united states in the case of chemical pharmaceuticals before generic drug can be marketed the generic drug company must demonstrate to the fda that the drug product is identical to the original product for chemical drugs some experts argue that generic medications decrease prices 60 to 90 on branded oralsolid medications8 the congressional budget office estimated the savings generated by generic drug use in 1994 was between 8 billion and 10 billion9 the generic drug industry achieves these cost savings by avoiding the expense of clinical trials as well as the initial drug research and development costs that were incurred by the brandname manufacturer even though patents for several speciality biotechnology drug products have expired very few have had to face the same type of market competiti on that occurs with chemical drugs in contrast to the relatively simple structure and manufacture of chemical drugs followon biological products with their more complex nature and method of manufacture will not be identical to the brandname product but may instead be shown to be similar the generic pharmaceutical association gpha has advocated that the fda establish regulatory system for the approval of followon biologics under its existing statutory authority10 however the biotechnology industry organization bio has filed citizen petition with the fda requesting number of actions that would inhibit the approval of followon biologics11 proposed legislation hr 1038s 623 hr 1956 hr 5629 s 1505 and s 1695 would provide mechanism for fda approval of biological products that are similar to the brandname product thereby allowing for market competition and reduction in prices though perhaps not to the same extent as with generic chemical drugs economic studies on potential savings to the federal government over 10 years due to the use of followon biologics have ranged between nothing and 14 billion 12 study by avalere health estimated government savings at 36 billion in the first 10 years another study by express scripts estimated 10year consumer savings at 71 billion and federal savings at 14 billion13 on june 25 2008 the congressional budget office cbo released cost estimate on s 1695 the cbo study found that enactment of s 1695 would save the federal government 59 billion over 10 years 20092018 and would reduce total expenditures on biologics in the united states by about 25 billion over the same period14

actoriginally by the national institutes of health nih and its precursors and later by the fdaand chemical drugs are regulated approved for marketing under the federal food drug and cosmetic act by the fda this section provides brief history of these two acts and other relevant laws as well as some of the important amendments that have occurred during the past 100 years the regulation of biologics by the federal government began with the biologics control act of 1902 the first enduring scheme of national regulation for any pharmaceutical product16 the act was groundbreaking the very first premarket approval statute in history17 it set new precedents shifting from retrospective postmarket to prospective premarket government review18 the biologics act was passed in response to deaths many in children from tetanus contamination of smallpox vaccine and diphtheria antitoxin the act focused on the manufacturing process of such biologic products and required an inspection of the manufacturing facility before federal license was issued to market the product the biologics act predates the regulation of drugs under the pure food and drugs act which was enacted in 1906 the 1906 act did not include any form of premarket control over new drugs to ensure their safety and did not include any controls over manufacturing establishments unlike the preexisting biologics act and the laterenacted federal food drug and cosmetic act fdc act19 the pure food and drugs act was replaced by the fdc act in 1938 the fdc act required that drug manufacturers submit new drug application nda prior to marketing that demonstrated among other things that the product was safe 20 the biologics act was revised and recodified 42 usc 262 when the public health service act phs act was passed in 1944 the 1944 act specified that biological product that has been licensed for marketing by the fda under the phs ac t is also subject to regulation though not approval under the fdc act biological prod uct is defined under section 351i of the phs act as 15 for patent issues see crs report rl33901 followon biologics intellectual property and innovation issues by wendy h schacht and john r thomas

or derivative allergenic product or analogous product appli cable to the prevention treatment or cure of disease or condition of human beings section 351j of the phs act states that the fdc act applies to biological product subject to regulation under this section except that product for which license has been approved under subsection shall not be required to have an approved application under section 505 of such act most biological products regulated under the phs act also meet the definition of drug under section 201g of the fdc act articles intended for use in the diagnosis cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease in man or animals and articles other than food intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals the fda modernization act of 1997 fdama amended the phs act to require single biological license application bla for biol ogical product rather than the two licenses establishment license application ela and pro duct license application plathat had been required between 1944 and 1997 the phs act provides authority to suspend license immediately if there is danger to public health as stated previously biological products are in general regulatedlicensed for marketing under the phs act and chemical drugs are regulatedapproved for marketingunder the fdc act however through historical quirk the fda was given regulatory authority over certain natural source biological products these products have been regulated as drugs under the fdc act rather than as biologics under the phs act three years prior to the recodification of the biologics act congress gave the fda authority over the marketing of insulin21 insulin is peptide hormone small protein that regulates carbohydrate metabolism22 in the 1940s insulin was obtained in the same manner as many biologics namely extraction from animals despite this similarity with biologics insulin was regulated by fda23 in addition to insulin the distinction of biological product regulated as drug under the fdc act rather than as biologic under the phs act holds true for small set of products that are mostly hormones glucagon human growth hormone hormones to treat infertility hormones used to manage menopause and osteoporosis and certain medical enzymes hyaluronidase and urokinase24 this distinction is important because the hatchwaxman act provides mechanism for the approval of generic drugs under the fdc act but not under the phs act specifically hatch waxman added two abbreviated pathways to the fdc act for subsequent versions of already approved products section 505j and section 505b2 21 dudzinski food and drug law journal vol 60 p 153 the insulin amendments pl 77366 codified at 21 usc 356 were repealed by pl 105115 the food and drug

process for generic drug that contains the same active ingredient as the brandna innovator drug in the anda the generic company establishes that its drug product is chemically the same as the already approved innovator drug and thereby relies on the fdas previous finding of safety and effectiveness for the approved drug the 505j pathway is used for the approval of most generic chemical drugs under the second pathway drug that has significant difference from an innovator drug but is still sufficiently similar to that drug may be the subject of 505b2 application the company filing the application must submit additional nonclinical and clinical data to show that the proposed product is safe and effective25 however the application may rely on published literature or on the fda s finding of safety and effectiveness for the already approved product to support the approval of the proposed product the 505b2 pathway has been used to approve omnitrope followon human growth hormone and few other followon protein products 26 all have been members of the small set of biologic products that were regulated as drugs

hygienic laboratory precursor of nih27 in 1972 regulatory authority for biologics was transferred from the nih division of biological standards to the fda bureau of biologics which eventually became the agencys center for biologics evaluation and research cber28 because biotechnology products frequently cross the conventional boundaries between biologics drugs and devices determining the jurisdictional status of these new products has been difficult for both the fda and industry some products have had characteristics that met multiple statutory and scientific definitions29 in 1991 the

biotechnology as stated previously the hatchwaxman act added two abbreviated pathways under the fdc act505j and 505b2but not under the phs act for the approval of additional products subsequent to the innovator product because of the complex nature of most biological products and their methods of manufacture such products will not be identical to the brandname product therefore the 505j pathway cannot be used for product approval however if biological product is sufficiently similar to the innovator product the 505b2 pathway may be used by company for the approval of its biologic foll owing the enactment of hatchwaxman the fda published in 1999 draft guidance on applications covered by section 505b2 the guidance has never been finalized 34 as things currently stand and as discussed above the 505b2 pathway has been used only for those biologics that have been regulated as drugs under the fdc act however the vast majority of biologics have been regulated under the ph s act the fdas position is that additional legislation is required to provide such pathway under the phs act for traditional biologics regulated under the phs act the agencys longstanding policy has been that full bla including clinical testing would be required for the licensing of each such product in 1974 federal register notice the fda stated that unlike the regulation of human and animal drugs all biological products are required to undergo clinical testing in order to demonstrate safety purity potency and effectiveness prior to licensing regardless whether other versions of the same product are already marketed or standards for the product have been adopted by rulemaking indeed many of the existing standards require specific clinical testing before approval will be granted this is required because all biological products are to some extent different and thus each must be 31 fda press release fda to consolidate review responsibilities for new pharm aceutical products september 6

metoo biologic35 when publishing the final rule on the anda proce dure that had been outlined in hatchwaxman the fda stated in 1992 that these procedures are inapplicable to biological drug products licensed under 42 usc 262 section 351 of the phs act 36 most recently during hearing testimony on may 2 2007 before the subcommittee on health of the house energy and commerce committee janet woodcock deputy commissioner and chief medical officer of the fda stated in response to questioning that there is pathway under the phs act for the approval or licensing of followon biologics that is similar to the 505b2 pathway under the fdc act and that the fda would be willing to work with congress in crafting legislative approach to creating such pathway g21g140g146g142g151g157g146g143g146g140g561g5g145g138g149g149g142g151g144g142g156g561 in prepared testimony dr woodcock outlined the scientific challenges involved in determining the safety and effectiveness of followon biol ogics the fda prefers to call these products followon protein products in contrast to chemical drugs which are relatively small molecules and for which the equivalence of chemical composition between the generic drug and innovator drug is relatively easy to determine therapeutic proteins are much larger in size and much more complex in structure protein is large organic molecule composed of long chain of component parts called amino acids which are linked by chemical bonds this amino acid chain folds into complex threedimensional structure slight changes in the chain or threedimensional shape can influence the proteins biological activity proteins can also be altered by the addition of other chemicals such as sugar groups glycosylation at various points along the amino acid chain therefore comparing followon prot ein with the brandname product is more scientifically challenging than comparing chemical drugs in many cases current technology will not allow complete characterization of biological products dr woodcock describes these technical problems in her prepared testimony current technologies such as peptide mapping protein sequencing and mass spectroscopy enable manufacturers to determine with certainty the amino acid sequence of recombinant protein however the amino acid sequence is the most rudimentary characteristic of protein conclusive analysis of other aspects of proteins structure requires much more sophisticated technologies and is fraught with uncertainties that are proportional to the size and complexity of the protein itself such complexities include folding of the proteins amino acid chain into highly organized structures posttranslational modification of the protein with broad range of biochemical additions eg glycosylation acetylation phosphorylation etc and association of multiple protein molecules into aggregates it is the combination of the proteins amino acid sequence and its structural modifications that give protein its unique functional characteristics therefore the ability to predict the clinical comparability of two products depends on our understanding of the relationship between the structural characteristics of the protein and its function as well as on our ability to demonstrate structural similarity between the followon protein and the reference product although this currently may be possible for some relatively simple protein products 35 federal register v 39 248 december 24 1974 p 44641 36 federal register v 57 82 april 28 1992 p 17951

comparison for more complex protein products several terms are important in the discussion of the followon proteins and their approval by the fda products that are considered to be therapeutically equivalent are approved drug products usually made by different manufacturers that are pharmaceutical equivalents and for which bioequivalence has been demonstrated therapeutic equivalents can be expected to have the same clinical effect and safety profile when administered to patients under the conditions specified in the labeling37 pharmaceutical equivalents are products that contain the same active ingredient in the same strength dosage form and route of administration38 bioequivalence means that the products are absorbed into the body at similar rate and extent39 interchangeability is not defined by fda and could have number of different meanings it could refer to products that are therapeutic equivalents and thus could in some circumstances be substituted at the pharmacy level without physicians intervention alternatively the term could describe similar products that are not substitutable but which under physicians supervision could be used to treat the same disease or condition in the same patient 40 most drugs approved under section 505j are therapeutically equivalent to the already approved drug product in her testimony dr woodcock explains the importance of determination of therapeutic equivalence for generic drug and th reasons why such determination for follow on protein product may not be possible at least at the present time in many jurisdictions therapeutically equivalent drugs may be substituted at the pharmacy level without physicians intervention because of the variability and complexity of protein molecules current limitations of analytical methods and the difficulties in manufacturing consistent product it is unlikely that for most proteins manufacturer of followon protein product could demonstrate th at its product is identical to an already approved product therefore the section 505j generic drug approval pathway which is predicated on finding of the same active ingredient will not ordinarily be available for protein products 41 immunogenicity or the ability to elicit an immune response is another important term in the discussion of followon proteins an immune response to therapeutic protein can range from detectable but clinically insignificant to one that can cause safety problems for the patient or limit the effectiveness of the product for some biologics such as vaccines stimulating an immune response is the intended outcome however for other types of therapeutic products an immune response can lower the clinical effect of protein dr woodcock describes the implications at length in the prepared testimony adverse safety events from an immune response could include hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis rash fever and kidney problems to crossreaction with an endogenous naturally occurring in the body protein eg erythropoietin immunogenicity may be 37 janet woodcock deputy commissioner chief medical officer fda testimony before the subcommittee on health committee on

immune responses to administered protein products can be extremel serious or lifethreatening therefore this issue requires significant attention the ability to predict immunogenicity of protein product particularly the more complex proteins is extremely limited therefore some degree of clinical assessment of new products immunogenic potential will ordinarily be needed the extent of independent testing needed will again depend on variety of scientific factors such as the indication whether the product is to be administered chronically the overall assessment of the products immunogenic potential and whether there is the possibility of generating crossreaction with an important endogenous molecule even if followon protein product is found to be safe and effective by the fda this finding does not mean that the followon protein product would be interchangeable with or substitutable for the originally approved brandname product to establish that the followon protein product is substitutable for the brandname product the manufacturer of the followon product must demonstrate through additional clinical data that repeated switches from the followon product to the brandname product and vice versa would have negative effect on the safety andor effectiveness of the products in other words there must be problems with immunogenicity for many followon protein products and in particular the more complex proteins there is significant potential for repeated switches between products to have negative impact on the safety andor effectiveness therefore the abilit to make determinations of substitutability for followon protein products may be limited 42 g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 initially there were two competing legislative

requirements hr 1038s 623 do not contain such product naming provisions acco rding to media reports the brand industry successfully pushed for different names for brandname and followon products in europe the brand industry argues having different names helps pinpoint which drugs are hurting people but the generic drug industry believes it is ploy to thwart generic substitution44 the brand name drug companies believe that having different names would make it easier for fda to tell when brand or biosimilar is the cause of side effects however fda urged european regulators to not use this approach when they were debating it last winter fda says it already has many alternative mechanisms to prevent inappropriate substitution 45 the bipartisan senate authors of s 1695 claim to have negotiated compromise between the brandname manufacturers and the generic drug industry s 1695 would allow fda to make determination on interchangeability s 1695 does not require the publication of guidance or rule prior to consideration of followon biologic application and does not require different nonproprietary name for the followon biologic than the brandname drug s 1695 would provide however 12 years of exclusive marketing for the brandname product prior to the approval of followon biologic hr 1956 and s 1505 would provide at least 14 years of exclusive marketing for the brandname product hr 1038s 623 would not provide an exclusivity period although the bush administration supports creating pathway for the approval by fda of followon biologics it is opposed to several aspects of s 1695 such as allowing fda to make determinations on interchangeability allowing th approval of followon biologics without prior issuance of guidance the creation of the biological products savings fund and the possible waiver by fda of requirement for clinical trials prior to the approval of followon biologic46 the bush administration also believes that followon biologic should have

on s 169547 hr 5629 would require the publication of productclass specific guidance prior to the approval of biological product as is the case with hr 1956 and s 1505 hr 5629 would allow fda to make determination on interchangeability like hr 1038s 623 and s 1695 however hr 5629 would require 1 the publication of final guidance on interchangeability prior to determinations on interchangeability 2 the biological product must be biosimilar to the reference product and any licensed product that is interchangeable with the reference product and 3 the biological product must produce the same

previously approved for the reference product 3 the route of administration the dosage form and the strength of the biological product are the same as those of the reference product and 4 any facility in which the biological product is manufactured or held meets standards that ensure the product is safe pure and potent the application may also include information demonstrating interchangeability of the biological product with the reference product s 1695 would allow the secretary to license the biological product if the information submitted in the application is sufficient to show that th biological product is either 1 biosimilar to the reference product or 2 interchangeable with the reference product the biological product would be interchangeable with the reference product if 1 it can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and 2 the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switchin g between use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch s 1695 would allow for oneyear period of exclusive

application until 12 years after the reference product was first licensed s 1695 would allow the secretary after the opportunity for public comment to issue general or specific guidance on the application process for licensure of biosimilar biological product the issuance or nonissuance of guidance would not preclude the review of or action on submitted application s 1695 would establish new process for identifying patents that might be disputed between the brandname company and the company submitting biosimilar application the bill would provide multistep but according to the bills sponsors expedited patent resolution process s 1695 would require all applications for the approval of biological product to be submitted under section 351 of the phs act rather than section 505 of the fdc act the bill would provide an exception for the class of biological products that have traditionally been approved under section 505 of the fdc act the exception would terminate 10 years after enactment of s 1695 all approved applications under section 505 of the fdc act would then be deemed to be license for the biological product under section 351 of the phs act s 1695 would make preliminary provisions for the collection of user fees for the review of biosimilar biological products s 1695 would direct the secretary of the treasury to determine the amount of savings to the federal government as result of enactment of s 1695 and would transfer the amount to special reserve fund the biological product savings fund to be expended by the secretary of hhs on activities authorized under the public health service act s 1695 would require the government accountability office to conduct study and report to congress not later than three years after enactment on the extent to which pediatric studies of biological products are being required under th fdc act and any pediatric needs not being met under existing authority

biological product is biosimilar to the reference product based on data from 1 analytical studies 2 animal studies and 3 clinical study or studies of immunogenicity for each condition of use for which the reference product is approved the requirement for analytical studies and animal studies may be waived immunogenicity assessment may be waived only if draft and final guidance has been published the bill would not allow such an application to be submitted until the later of 1 the start of proceeding for issuing applicable product class guidance for that product or 2 four years after the reference product was licensed the bill would not allow the secretary to accept an application until the secretary has initiated proceeding for issuance of applicable product class guidance for that biological product hr 5629 would require that license application for such biological products would be reviewed by the division that reviewed and approved the reference product risk evaluation and mitigation strategies under the ffdca would apply the bill would allow the approval of an application only if the biological product is biosimilar to the reference product with respect to each condition of use for which the reference product is approved and the applicant consents to the inspection of the manufacturing facility if the bi ological product is bears or contains select agent or toxin the application would not be approved an application may not be approved until the secretary has completed the proceeding for issuance of guidance with respect to the product class within which the biological product falls hr 5629 would not allow the approval of an application for followon product to become effective until at least 12 years after licensing of the reference product for pediatric applications application approval would not become effectiv until 12 years and 6 months after approval of the reference product pediatric exclusivity must be determined by the fda later than

to make interchangeability determinations on products in that product class and explaining the data that will be required to support such determination hr 5629 would require the secretary to publish proposed guidance for public comment prior to publication of final guidance with respect to licensure of biological product or product class the secretary must establish process to allow public input regarding priorities for issuing guidance for reference product that was licensed more than seven years prior to enactment person may petition the secretary to commence the process for issuing final guidance for the reference products product class the petition must include description of the scientific feasibility and rationale for the request the secretary must issue final product class guidance within two years of such petition guidance may state that the secretary will not license product or product class not including any recombinant protein because the science and experience as of the date of the guidance does not allow licensure the bill would require the product classspecific guidance to include description of 1 the criteria that will be used to determine whether biological product is biosimilar to reference product in such product class 2 the criteria if available that will be used to determine whether biological product meets the standards for
