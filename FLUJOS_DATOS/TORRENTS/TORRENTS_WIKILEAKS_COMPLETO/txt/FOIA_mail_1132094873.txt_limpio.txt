from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to mannpsuedu tim osborn tosbornueaacuk subject re heads up date tue nov 15 174753 2005 cc phil jones pjonesueaacuk mike thanks for this when time allows we will do response to this poster and simply post it on our web page as others have said the dating of the chronology in the urals is not wrong but the magnitude of the extreme years in the early urals reconstruction were not adjusted to account for inflated variance related to low chronology replication so they are sort of right that the emphasis on 1032 is probably overdone anyway thanks again keith at 1529 15112005 michael mann wrote thanks tim phil yes i never had any doubt hes wrong in fact hes been wrong about just about every claim hes ever made he almost had point w the pca centering but as we all know that doesnt matter at all in the end the issue isnt whether or not hes right as we all well know by now but whether his false assertions have enough superficial plausability to get traction in this case they might so probably good to at least be prepared i was told by journalist paul thacker that his poster got prominent placement probably not an accident see forwarded email i believe that mike schlesinger and david karoly were there in the same session so might be worth checking w them i think connie woodhouse and tom wigley were also at the meeting but not sure i suspect that this is the first in line of attacks im sure tom c is next in line that will ultimately get published one way or another the grl leak may have been plugged up now w new editorial leadership there but these guys always have climate research and energy and environment and will go there if necessary they are telegraphing quite clearly where they are going w all of this mike tim osborn wrote thanks for this mike wed spotted an earlier draft of his poster and were bit concerned about this receiving prominence at the meeting did it arouse much discussion do you know keith and tom melvin looked into the dating while back when mcintyre first raised it and were quite satisfied with the published dating i think not sure what should be done unless he submits something for peerreview cheers tim at 1453 15112005 michael mann wrote not sure if you guys are aware mcintyre presented this poster at the ccsp meeting apparently they gave him very prominent location so that everyone entering the meeting would have seen the poster mike can find at 1httpwwwclimatesciencegovworkshop2005abstractspgc1htmhttpwwwclimatesc iencegovworkshop2005abstractspgc1htm pgc14 more on hockey sticks the case of jones et 1998 stephen mcintyre 2mailtostephenmcintyreutorontocastephenmcintyreutorontoca multiproxy studies purporting to show 20th century uniqueness have been applied by policymakers but they have received remarkably little independent critical analysis jones et 1998 is prominent multiproxy study used by ipcc 2001 and others to affirm the hockey stick shaped temperature reconstruction of mann et 1998 however the reconstruction of jones et 1998 is based on only 34 proxies in the controversial medieval warm period including nonarmslength studies by briffa et 1992 and briffa et 1995 we show that the polar urals data set in briffa et 1992 fails to meet variety of quality control standards both in replication and crossdating the conclusion of briffa et 1995 that 1032 was the coldest year of the millennium proves to be based on inadequate replication of only 3 tree ring cores of which at least 2 are almost certainly incorrectly crossdated we show that an ad hoc adjustment to the tornetrask data set in briffa et 1992 cannot be justified the individual and combined impact of defects in the polar urals data set and tornetrask adjustments on the reconstruction of jones et 1998 is substantial and can be seen to have the effect of modifying what would otherwise indicate pronounced medieval warm period in the proxy reconstruction inhomogeneity problems in the polar urals and tornetrask data sets pertaining to altitude minimum girth bias and pith centering bias will also be discussed michael mann associate professor director earth system science center essc department
