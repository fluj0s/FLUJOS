provides an overview of these issues and relevant legislation h r 5167 for more deta ils see crs report rl31258 suits against terrorist states by victims of terrorism by jennifer k elsea in 1996 congress amended the fsia to allow civil suits by us victims of terrorism against designated st ate sponsors of terrorism dsst1 responsible for or complicit in such terrorist acts as torture extrajudicial killing aircraft sabotage and hostage taking 28 usc 1605a7 cong ress also abrogated the immunity of foreign state assets under the fsia to satisfy j udgments awarded under the terrorism exception 28 usc 1610 after court found that th abrogation of sovereign immunity did not itself create cause of action congress passed the flatow amendment 28 usc 1605 note to create cause of action for ch cases courts initially interpreted thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22094crs2 statute as creating cause of action agains t foreign states and their agencies and instrumentalities alt hough its plain language referred onl to officials employees and agents of such states numerous cour t judgments generally rendered after the defendants default ensued resulting in substantial awards to plaintiffs the nature of lawsuits against dssts changed significantly after the dc circuit court of appeals held that neither the terrorism exception to the fsia nor the flatow amendment created private right of action against the foreign government itself including its agencies and instrumentalities consequently most plaintiffs asserted causes of action under domestic state laws which re sulted in some disparity in the relief available to victims injured due to similar or even the same acts of terrorism courts nevertheless continued to aw ard sizable judgments agains t dssts and their officials which now amount to more than 18 billion in damages most of wh ich has been assessed against iran see crs report rl31258 suits against terrorist states by victims of terrorism by jennifer k elsea enforcement of judgments against terrorist states while winning judgments against terrori st states never posed insurmountable obstacles enforcing those judgments has proven more arduous pr imarily due to the scarcity of assets within us jurisdiction that belong to states subject to economic sanctions and the immunity from attachment th at assets frozen by sanctions regulations enjoy successive administrations opposed allo wing the use of frozen assets of foreign states to satisfy judgments out of concerns for treaty obligations to protect foreign diplomatic and consular properties the desire to maintain the blocked assets for diplomatic leverage and the concern that permitting the attachment of such assets would expose us assets abroad to reciprocal action notwithstanding these objections congress has repeatedly steppe d in to make more foreign assets available for judgment creditors and appropriated some 400 million to pay portions of certain judgments against iran with the understanding that the president would seek to recover that amount from iran consequently some plaintiffs were able to collect portions of their judgments while others were stymied some of the assets associated with dssts remained offlimits because they were not blocked within the meaning of the relevant statute because plaintiffs had waived their right to attach the assets in question when they accepted payment from us funds because the assets were not subject to the exception to immunity or were exempted by presidential waiver or because the united states validly possesses the property and successfully asserted u s sovereign immunity the national defense aut horization act for fy2008 in order to assist plaintiffs cong ress passed 1083 of th national defense authorization act for fy2008 ndaa pl 110181 to create 1605a in title 28 us code section 1083 incorporates the terrorist state exception to the fsia previously codified at 28 usc 1605a7 and ne w cause of action against dssts to replace the flatow amendment it allows us na tionals and nonus nationals working for the us government overseas who are harmed by terrorism to seek compensatory as well as punitive damages which are not otherwise available against foreign states the provision also seeks to make more assets associated with state sponsors of terrorismhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22094crs3 available for attachment in aid of execution of terrorism judgments and to permit some plaintiffs to refile claims president bush vetoed the original ve rsion of the ndaa hr 1585 on the stated basis that the fsia amendments would threaten iraqs economic security congress responded with the new version hr 4986 whic h authorizes the president to waive any provision of 1083 with respect to iraq the president signed the bill and exercised the waiver authority section 1083 also encourages the president to ne gotiate settlement of outstanding terrorism claims against iraq pending cases have been permitted to go forward under the previous law but it is unclear whether any ir aqi assets will remain available for attachment by judgment holders under other provisions of law new 28 usc 1605ag provides for the establishment of lien of lis pendens with respect to all real or tangible personal property within the judicial district that is subject to attachment in aid of execution and is titled in the name of defendant state or any entities listed by the plaintiff as controlled by that state ordinarily lis pendens in civil litigation is used to put third parties on notice that the property is the subject of litigation which effectively prev ents the alienation of such property although the notice is not technically lien under the new provision the clerk of th district court is required to file the notice of action indexed by listing the defendant and its controlled entities this may relieve plaintiffs of the burden of identifying specific property in the notices but it is unclear what further measures might be required to ensure adequate notice is afforded to prospective purchasers under th procedure or how it is to be determined without further process that the property is in fact subject to attachment in the case of state sponsors of terror whose property for the most part is already subject to substantial limitations on transactions the primary utility may be the establishment of line of priority among lienholders ho wever in the case of states that are longer subject to terrorism sanctions such as libya the provision could have some impact on lawful transactions new 28 usc 1610g provides that the pr operty of foreign state against which judgment has been entered under 1605a r predecessor provision or of an agency or instrumentality of such foreign state including property that is separate juridical entity or is an interest held directly or indirectly in separate juridical entity is subject to attachment in aid of execution and ex ecution upon that judgment regardless of how much economic control over that property the foreign government exercises and whether the government derives profits or benefits from it the president has waiver authority except with respect to iraq the provision ma enable plaintiff to pierce the corporate veilof corporation owned in whole or in part by judgment debtor state without having to demonstrate to the court that th presumption of indepe ndent status should be overridden it could also be read as an effort to make any entity in which the defendant state including its separate agencies and instrumentalities has any interest liable for the terrorismrelated judgments awarded agains t that state on the other hand 1610g states that nothing in it is to be construed as superceding the courts authority to protect the interests of person who is not liable in the action giving rise to judgment section 1610g also makes property that is regulated by reas on of us sanctions available to satisfy terrorism judgments it does not explicitly waive us sovereign immunity but appears designed to defeat pr ovisions in the sanctions regulations that make blocked property effec tively immune from court action in this respect it echoeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22094crs4 2 tria 201d2 defines blocked asset to an property seized or frozen pursuant to certain sanctions but not property that may be transferred pursuant to license that is required by statute other than the international emergency economic po wers act ieepa or the united nations participation act of 1945 it also excludes diplomatic or consular property being used solely for diplomatic or consular purposes from the definition of blocked asset tria does not refer to regulated assets so it is unclear whether block ed and regulated are mutually exclusive terms or whether blocked assets would be considered to be regulated as well assets regulated pursuant to ieepa presumably mean t hose that are licensed for transfer 3 see plaut v spendthrift farms 514 us 211 1995language in 1610f1 which is not in ffect because it was waived by president clinton except that 1610g applies only to regulated property rather than property that is blocked or regulated pursuant to sanctions regimes2 and it would not be subject to the presidential waiver in 1620f3 unlike 201 of tria 28 usc 1610 note the new language applies to regulated rather than blocked assets and it allows assets to be attached in aid of enforcing punitive damages the new provisions apply to any claim aris ing under them as well as to any action brought under former 28 usc 1605a7 or the flatow amendment that relied on either of these provisions as creating cause of action and that has been adversely affected on the grounds that either or both of these provisions fail to create cause of action against the state and that is still before the courts in any form including appeal or motion for postjudgment relief in cases brought under the older provisions the federal court in which the claim originated is required on motion by the plaintiffs within 60 days after enactment to treat the case as if it had been brought under the new provisions apparently to include reinstating vacated judgment the measure waives defendants defenses of res judicata collateral est oppel and limitation period in any reinstated action the provision also permits the filing of new cases involving incidents that are already the subject of timelyfiled terrorism action under the fsia notwithstanding the limitation time for filing so long as the related action is filed within 60 days after enactment january 28 2008 or entry of judg ment in the original action several actions have been filed under this pr ovision including some lawsuits by plaintiffs who have already won significant judg ments under the previous law while 1083c refers to pending cases it appears to cover finally adjudicated cases in which litigants have filed motion for relief from final judgment after appeals are exhausted to the extent the provision is read to require c ourts to reopen final judgments or reinstate vacated judgments it may be vulnerable to invalidation as an improper exercise of judicial powers by congress3 similar objection may be raised regarding the waiver of legal defenses while it seems wellestablished that congress can waive defenses in actions against the united st ates an effort to abrogate legal defenses of other parties could raise constitutional due process and separation of powers issues it may be that cases qualify for reopening under this provision b ecause the plaintiffs would have had to ve filed motion prior to the actment of pl 110181 however if previous lawsuits can be filed again as related actions under 1083c3 then plaintiffs who file prior to the deadline can bring new actions regardless of the reason their original case was unsuccessful or perhaps even if their case yielded an award it is unclear whether such lawsuits would c ount as refiled actions for the purpose of abrogating the defendants lega l defenses under 1803c2bhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22094crs5 4 presidential determination 20089 of january 28 2008 waiver of section 1083 of the

urging the administration to seek waiver authority with respect to libya for more information about uslibya relations see crs report rl33142 libya background and us relations by christopher m blanchardthe new federal cause of action may make judgments against dssts heftier and easier to obtain but whether such judgments will be easier to enforce seems less certain the result may be an increase in debts owed by those states without sufficient increase in assets available to cover them which could amplify competition among plaintiffs and lead to calls for further congressional action transactions with debtor states are likely to increase only with respect to states that are longer subject to antiterrorism sanctions in which case the use of their asse ts to satisfy judgments may act as barrier to trade despite the lifting of sanctions the presidential waiver for iraq permits the president to protect iraqi assets from attachment to satisfy any outstanding judgments hr 5167 has been introduced in the house to repeal the presidential waiver provision effect of the waiver of 1083 on cases pending against iraq section 1083d authorizes the presid ent to waive any provision of 1083 with respect to iraq if he determines that waiver serves us national security interests and promotes usiraq relations the waiver will promote reconstruction and political development in iraq and iraq continues to be reliable ally and partner in combating terrorism the waiver applies retroactively regardless of its effect on pending cases on the day the president signed the fy2008 ndaa into law the white house signed waiver4 apparently foreclosing any refiling of the lawsuit by former prisoners of war against iraq and saddam hussein for their mistreatment during the first gulf war5 however pending claims against iraq under the fsia terrorism exception as previously in force have been permitted to go forward6 final judgments against iraq are not affected but will remain difficult to enforce iraqi government assets used for commercial purposes in the united states that are not subject to the protection of eo 13303 which covers the development fund for iraq and all interests associated with iraqi petroleum and petroleum products may be subject to attachment and execution on terrorism judgments against iraq under 28 usc 1610 the president could however issue another executive order to protect all iraqi assets from attachment to satisfy judgments administration pr oposal to waive 1083 for libya us businesses seeking to establish commercial relationship with libya

thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22094crs6 8 28 usc 1605a provides cause of action fo r personal injury or death which appears to cover broader scope of injuries than wrongful death or physical injury claims for wrongful death under the fsia amendment have been limited to the decedents estate while close relatives of victim have recovered in their own right ba sed on claims of solatium intentional infliction of emotional distress and pain and suffering depending on the applicable state law see eg pugh v libya 530 f supp 2d 216 ddc 2008 9 ndaa 1083c provides that pending cases originally brought under previous 28 usc 1605a7 are to be given effect as if they had been filed under 1605a if the action was adversely affected on the grounds that the previ ous provisions fail to create cause of action against the state and the plaintiff makes moti on to the court asking for such treatment 10 price v libya 384 f supp 2d 120 d dc 2005approximately 18 million judgment against libya for injuries suffered during plain tiffs imprisonment pending trial for allegedly taking unlawful photographs pugh v li bya 530 f supp 2d 216 ddc 2008nearly 7 billion judgment against libya and six named offi cials for bombing of french airliner over africa in 1989us economy and as important tools for reesta blishing relations with reformed state sponsor of terrorism appears to share their view to relieve libya from the possible effects of 1083 in the event libya agrees to compensate victims of rrorism congress enacted s 3370 the libyan claims resolution act s 3370 exempts libya fro m the terrorism exception to the fsia if libya signs claims agreement with the united states to settle terrorismrelated claims and provides funds to compensa claimants s 3370 author izes the secretary of state to designate one or more tities to assist in the provi sion of compensation entities would be immune from lawsuits related to this function it appears that the government is to receive funds from libya which it would then turn over to the designated entity for dispersal to claimants although there is express requirement to this effect in the statute if the secretary of state certifies to congre ss that sufficient funds have been received under the claims agreement to c over settlements libya has agreed to pay to victims of the pan am 103 airliner bombing and the belle disco bombing as well as to provide fair compensation to some other us nationals who have pending cases against libya the statute will provide immunity to libya including its agencies and instrumentalities as well as its officials employees and agents for all claims pending under the terrorism exception to the fsia and for all property sought to be attached to satisfy existing terrorism judgments it appears that the amount of fair compensation is left to the discretion of the secretary of state th provision may not include all pending cases against libya under 1605a it appears to cover claims for wrongful death or physical injury arising under 28 usc 1605a including previous actions that have been given effect as if they had been filed under 1605a but not cases for nonphysical injuries8 or for cases filed under the previous versi on of the fsia exception that have not been given effect as if they had been filed under 1605a9 it appears that finally adjudicated cases are not covered in which case unsatisfied judgments against libya and its officials will likely be unenforceable10 claimants do not appear to have any recour in court to dispute the amount or deni of compensation although claim against the united states for an uncompensated taking in vi olation of the fifth amendment would not be foreclosed
