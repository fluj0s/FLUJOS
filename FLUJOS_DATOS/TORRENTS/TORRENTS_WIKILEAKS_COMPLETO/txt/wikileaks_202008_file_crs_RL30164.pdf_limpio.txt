divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30164the emergency food assistance program and emergency feeding needs summary the emergency food assistance program tefap or efap supports emergency feeding efforts it provides federally donated food commodities and cash grants to states for food distribution to needy persons served by public and private nonprofit emergency feeding organizations such as food banks food pantries emergency shelters soup kitchens charitable organizations and local governments federal support consists of 1 entitlement food commodities bought specifically for the program 100 million year setaside of funds appropriated under the food stamp act budget account for tefap purchases 2 annual appropriations for grants to help cover distributing agencies food distribution costs typically 45 million year and 3 to the extent they are available discretionary donations of bonus commodities from federal inventories of foods acquired in support of the agricultural economy eg 162 million worth in fy2000 commodities and cash distributioncost grants flow to local emergency feeding agencies through the states which receive their funds and commodity allocations under formula accounting for unemployment and poverty federal rules are minimal states determine which local agencies qualify what eligibility rules will be for applicants and how and which foods will be distributed to local agencies for fy2001 the agriculture department appropriations law appropriated 45 million for distributioncost grants and provided the full 100 million food stamp act setaside for food purchases the extent of additional fy2001 bonus commodity donations is not yet known however preliminary estimate s indicate that they will substantially exceed the 162 million provided in fy2000 for fy2002 the administration proposed using the full 100 million food stamp act setaside for tefap food purchases and appropriating 45 million for distributioncost grants the house version of the fy2002 agriculture department appropriations law hr 2330 approves the 100 million setaside and increases the appropriation for distribution costs to 50 million the senates version s 1191 approves the 100 million setaside but includes increase for distribution costs perception that need for emergency food aid has risen drawn from increased demands on emergency feeding agencies and reduced receipt of food stamps has led to calls for increased help especially with the cost of distributing food donations received by emergency feeding agencies from both the private and public sectors the house agriculture committee has approved its version of the omnibus farm bill hr 2646 hrept 107191 part i this reauthorizes and increases tefap funding by 40 million year and sets aside new money for distribution costs on august 13 2001 pl 10725 an emergency agricultural assistance measure was enacted it provides an extra onetime amount of 10 million for tefap distribution expenses

are minimal with the exception of the federal emergency management administrations emergency food and shelter program typically funded at 100 million year tefap is the only major federal food aid effort aimed at serving the homeless and other needy persons who do not get do not apply for or are ineligible for other federal food assistance and nutrition support programs or who find that the benefits of these programs do not cover their needs background the early years tefap was begun in 198182 as temporary expedient designed at least initially to dispose of huge stockpiles of governmentheld food commodities establishment of tefap also occurred in the aftermath of noticeable reductions in the coverage of and benefits provided by federal food assistance programs eg food stamps school meal programs legislated in 1981 and 1982 and in the midst of an economic recession and concern over hunger and homelessness among the needy in response the administration began distribution of excess federally held food commodities in 19811982 these commodities often termed bonus commodities are those in excess of those needed to fulfill other domestic and international federal commitments to provide food commodities eg to schools operating school meal programs in 1983 congress followed up with legislative authority that created what was known for more than decade as the temporary emergency food assistance program tefap as well as funding for grants to help with distribution costs establishment of the tefap helped reduce federal commodity stocks and storage costs associated with holding them provided an alternativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30164crs2 1there also were some small federal commodityhandling costs that were covered in the regular budgets for agencies dealing with the commodities eg the ccc 2note the program is still referred to as tefap ie the emergency food assistance programsource of food assistance for the needy and was instrumental in supporting and expanding network of emergency food aid providers that also drew food and other resources from many nongovernmental sources in the early years through fy1988 the only significant federal expenditures involved were appropriations for the grants supporting providers distribution costs the commodities that were provided had already been acquired under programs to support the agricultural economy1 however when commodity holdings began to drop substantially in the late 1980s because of changes in agricultural policies and the economy congress established the practice of providing federal funds to buy food commodities specifically for donation through tefap in addition to continuing support for cash grants for distribution costs 19881990 in 1988 after the administration indicated plans to phase out the program because of the lack of commodity inventories congress began to mandate funding starting at 120 million for fy1989 to buy commoditi for distribution through tefap thereby entitling the program to minimum level of support regardless of the level of federal commodity holdings in the 1988 hunger prevention act it also created separate program to buy commodities for soup kitchens and food banks not receiving tefap commodities mandating funding starting at 40 million for fy1989 while some soup kitchens and food banks and other entities serving the homeless could receive federal food donations through small separate initiative to help charitable organizations and others could participate as local tefap providers the separate soup kitchenfood bank program was established out of concern that most commodities for emergency feeding were going to local agencies that distributed food packages directly to the needy rather than to shelters soup kitchens and other providers serving meals to the homeless however 2 years later the 1990 omnibus farm law made commodity and cashgrant funding authority for tefap and soup kitchensfood banks discretionary ie expenditures on commoditi and distributioncost grants were made dependent on annual appropriations decisions not mandated by the authorizing law entitling the program to specific minimum funding level recent history although the authorizing law for tefap the emergency food assistance act efa of 1983 has been amended number of times and the word temporary has been dropped from the programs official title perhaps the most important changes since 1988 were made in 1996 the most recent legislative actions2 the 1996 omnibus farm law pl 104127 extended the discretionary authority to appropriate money for commodities and distributioncost grants for tefap and soup kitchenfood bank programs through fy2002 but more importantly the subsequent 1996 welfare reform law the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconcilia tion act pl 104193 changed how these federal efforts are structured and funded the welfare reform law 1 consolidated tefap and the soup kitchenfood bank program in one statute the efa so that states nowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30164crs3 3it should be noted that in the years since this setaside was enacted food stamp appropriations have been well above the amount needed to operate the food stamp program and they have taken into account the tefap setaside as result the 100 million setaside has not affected food stamp benefits 4the following discussion covers support for both tefap and the program for soup kitchens and food banks created in 1988 and later merged with tefapget single tefap grant of commodities and distributioncost funds for all types of emergency feeding organizations and 2 mandated funding of 100 million year through fy2002 to purchase food commodities for the program in addition to any commodities that might be bought with money appropriated under discretionary authority in the efa and any bonus commodities that might be made available at the agriculture departments discretion this second change was intended to entitle the program to minimum level of commodity support when regularly appropriated money is not made available to buy commodities or excess federal commodity holdings for tefap distribution are minimal or nonexistent it was accomplished through an amendment to the food stamp act effectively setting aside 100 million year in entitlement appropriations under the act to purchase tefap commodities as result the majority of funding for tefap ie for commodity purchases typically is now made available under the aegis of the food stamp act appropriation unless congress chooses to appropriate additional money for commodities under authority provided in the efa which it did in fy1997 the minority of funding money for distributi on cost grants is appropriated under the authority of the efa legislative and funding authorities since 1996 tefap including assistance for soup kitchens food banks and other organizations serving meals to the homeless has been run under the legislative authority contained in the efa as amended it sets the minimal federal rules that govern program operations however funding provisions for tefap are more complicated the efa specifically authorizes appropriations to cover cash grants to help with nonfederal direct and indirect distribution costs of states and local recipient agencies up to 50 million year through fy2002 it also provides general authority for the purchase of commodities above the level provided under the food stamp act appropriation noted above or any bonus commodities if money is appropriated while money for both commodity purchases and distributioncost grants was appropriated under efa authority in fy1997 it was used only to appropriate money for distributioncost grants in fy1998 and fy1999 on the other hand section 27 of the food stamp act requi res the secretary of agriculture to use 100 million year of funds made available under the act to purchase food commodities for tefap3 this requirement is in addition to commodities purchased out of any funds appropriated under efa authority or any bonus commodities that might be made available at the agriculture departments discretion however it should be noted that supplemental appropriations legislation for fy1997 lowered this 100 million entitlement to 80 million the fy1999 appropriations law decreased it to 90 million and the fy2000 appropriations law dropped it to 98 million history of federal support4 as noted earlier through fy1988 federal support for tefap consisted mainly of bonus commodities acquired and donated athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30164crs4 5these figures for distributioncost grants are actual expenditures from amounts made available under annual appropriations they differ slightly from the appropriations themselves eg the distributioncost appropriation for fy1998 fy1999 and fy2000 was 45 million year because they reflect the reallocation of unspent money and transfers of distributioncost funds to the purchase of commoditiesthe agriculture departments discretion the dollar value of these commodities was much larger than what is now provided under the program the value of bonus foods ranged from high of slightly more than 1 billion in fy1984 to low of 537 million in fy1988 in addition congress typically appropriated 50 million year for grants to assist with distribution costs beginning with fy1989 the value of discretionary bonus foods dropped substantially as federal acquisitionsstocks waned and the majority of the commodities made available for tefap came to be made up of commodities purchased specifically for the program from fy1989 through fy1994 commodity purchases ranged from 119 million fy1994 to 160 million fy1989 and fy1993 while annual value of bonus commodities went from high of 135 million fy1989 to low of 48 million in fy1994 appropriations for distributioncost grants dropped somewhat during this period to 40 million by fy1994 federal support was lowest in fy1995 and fy1996 commodity purchases were 65 million and 49 million bonus foods were valued at 35 million and 14 million and distributioncost grants totaled 40 million and 31 million since fy1996 federal support spurred by enactment of the setaside of food stamp act funds for tefap has grown noticeably but it has not returned to the levels reached in the 1980s or early 1990s commodity purchases went to 130 million in fy1997 and 100 million in fy1998 but dropped to 90 million in fy1999 and then increased to 99 million in fy2000 the value of bonus commodity acquisitions increased to 30 million in fy1997 109 million in fy1998 107 million in fy1999 and 162 million in fy2000 and spending for distributioncost grants was 42 million in fy1997 46 million in fy1998 and fy1999 and 44 million in fy20005 table 1 provides details on federal support for tefap over the years including the amounts included in the fy2001 agriculture appropriations law pl 106387 current status of federal support fy1999 for fy1999 the clinton administration proposed using the full 100 million provided under the food stamp act to fund tefap commodity purchases plus 45 million appropriation for distributioncost grants additional appropriations were proposed for food purchases congress however chose to provide less than requested the house version of the fy1999 agriculture department appropriations measure reduced the 100 million food stamp act tefap entitlement to 90 million and the senate version lowered it to 80 million both appropriated the full 45 million requested for distribution costs still below the authorized 50 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30164crs5 6actual fy1999 spending on distribution costs was 458 million including amounts recovered from prior year

bills funding for tefap purchases and the full 100 million called for under the food stamp act setaside was effectively appropriated to fund bill emerson mickey leland hunger fellowships through the congressional hunger center the house bill funded the fellowships at 1 million the senate provided 3 million and the conference agreement and enacted law appropriated 2 million for the fellowships leaving 98 million for tefap food purchases 8the fy2000 consolidated appropriations act pl 106113 directed reductions of 38 in agencies discretionary funds efaprelated discretionary spending eg the 45

accompanying administration budget requests for selected years value of food commodities purchased with appropriated funds or money set aside under the food stamp act in recent years includes small amount eg 800000 in fy2000 700000 in fy1999 400000 in fy1998 100000 in fy1997 for some federal administrative costs related to tefap food acquisitions the value of purchased entitlement commodities shown in this table does not necessarily correspond to the value of entitlement food deliveries to states during the fiscal year notes for this table are continued on the following pagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30164crs9 b value of bonus commodities acquired for donation through t efap or soup kitchens and food banks at the agriculture departments discretion the value of actual bonus food deliveries to states and local emergency feeding organizations during fiscal year varies from these figures depending on the terms of acquisition contracts and federal state and local delivery schedules for example the estimated value of bonus foods delivered in fy2000 was 921 million 96 million pounds and during fy1999 1614 million pounds of bonus commodities worth 1352 million were deliveredc state allocations from funds appropriated to help states and local emergency feeding organizations to transport store and distribute commodities in number of years figures include small amount eg 800000 in fy1999 spent from recoveries of unused prior year obligations or reflect reduction because states chose to use some distribution cost money for food purchases eg 17 million in fy2000 as result these figures may differ from the annual appropriation eg the distribution cost appropriation for fy 2000 was 45 milliond includes onetime purchase of 423 million worth of commodities under pl 102552e includes 17 million for food purchases transferred from funds available for supporting distribution costsf as approved in the fy2001 agriculture department appropriations law pl 106387g totals do not reflect the extent to which bonus commodities will be made available including those purchased under authority provided in the agriculture risk protection act pl 106224 early estimates indicate that the value of these extra commodities in fy2001 is likely to be significantly greater than the figure shown in this table for fy2000 the program under tefap food commodities either specifically purchased for the program or otherwise acquired for federal commodity stocks through initiatives supporting the agricultural economy are provided to states for allocation to local emergency feeding organizations serving needy individuals and families including the homeless wide range of commodities roughly three dozen types of food are offered under the program they can include items like peanut butter juices dried beans cereals rice vegetable oil flour pasta soup mixes nuts dairy products and cannedfrozen fruits applesauce vegetables meats and fish depending on agricultural market conditions program providers preferences and the need to provide variety of foods the federal government is responsible for tefap commodities until they reach the state food distribution agency and pays some basic costs associated with processing eg repackaging and delivering the commodities to state receiving points tefap assistance also includes cash grants to help pay for state and local distribution costs eg storage processing transportation expenses this distributioncost aid can be used for both federally and privately donated foods handled by tefap agencies commodities and distributioncost funding are allocated to states based on formula that takes into account unemployme nt rates and the number of persons with income below federal poverty guidelines distributioncost funding depends on the amount of commodities state receives federal administration of tefap is the responsibility of the agriculture departments food and nutrition service in close collaboration with other department agencies dealing with commodity acquisition storage and distribution eg the ccc the agricultural marketing servicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30164crs10 federal rules governing tefap are minimal each state is responsible for designating state administering agency and through this agency selecting local organizations of their choice eg private nonprofit organizations volunteer groups religious organizations governme nt agencies for participation in the program as emergency feeding organizations providers states also are in charge of allocating commodities and distributioncost funding among the approved providers and establishing eligibility criteria for needy individuals seeking aid these eligibility standards must limit participation based on low income as defined by the state and may consist of specific income cutoffs proof of eligibility for meanstested public assistance program or other criteria state grants for distribution costs at least 40 of the grant must be shared with local providers but the portion retained by the state has to be matched dollar fordollar in cash or in kind distributioncost grant money is to be used to assist with direct and indirect costs incurred in distributing commodities provided by tefap and those coming from voluntary donors it also may be used to help support soup kitchens food banks and other organizations serving meals to the homeless that receive tefap commodities and to support food recovery initiatives eg gleaning efforts in addition states may elect to convert distributioncost funds 1 to money for food these converted dollars are then used by the agriculture department to buy additional commodities and 2 to support food rescue efforts like gleaning finally states have responsibility for allocating commodities and cash assistance between providers that distribute food directly to needy clients and those that provide meals eg for the homeless at congregate feeding sites and they may choose to concentrate support on only one of these provider groups client participat ion data for tefap are not available although related information about emergency food assistance is presented in july 2001 report by the agriculture departments economic research service the decline in food stamp participation report to congress available at the agriculture departments website httpwwwfnsusdagov issues and legislation the debate the current debate over tefap has focused primarily on whether how and how much to increase federal commodity donations as well as how much indications of need justify an expansion but most recently supporters of tefap have argued that expanded support for the cost of distributing food handled by tefap agencies whether federally or privately donated may be the most pressing need and current legislative and appropriations initiatives reflect this they note that there are increasing signs that tefap agencies need help with the cost of handling growing nongovernment donations in addition funding authorizations for tefap in the food stamp act and the emergency food assistance act expire with fy2002 they are scheduled for reauthorization during the 107th congress as part of the omnibus farm bill supporters of tefap see it as an inexpensive way to assist those with short term food needs who fall between the cracks in other words safety net for those needy individuals and households who do not participate in other food aidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30164crs11 10a study of the reasons for the decline in food stamp participation and the rise in demand for emergency food assistance was released in midjuly 2001 the report entitled the decline in food stamp participation report to congress is available at the agriculture departments website httpwwwfnsusdagovprograms for whatever reason or whose benefits do not fully meet their needs eg their food stamps and whatever amount of cash they can pay for food out of their own income do not last out the month moreover tefap is defended as key component of the network of public and private efforts that attempts to meet the food needs of the poor in this view federally provided commodities and distributioncost grants help leverage assistance from other sources and give support to an infrastructure on which private efforts to feed the needy can build to make their contributions more effective federal assistance through tefap also helps increase variety in the food items offered by emergency feeding organizations further backing for an expanded tefap comes from those concerned over what they feel is an increased need for tefaplike aid they are worried about accumulating evidence of the negative effects of changes made by the 1996 welfare reform law eg ending many benefits for large number of noncitizens more restrictive eligibility standards for public assistance trend toward discouraging diverting needy people from applying for public aid that spills over to diversion from applying for food stamp help for which they may be eligible burdensome application requirements for food stamps specifically supporters point to the dramatic and not completely understood decline in food stamp participation noticeably larger than the fall in the poor population in recent years eg food stamp participatio n has dropped from monthly average of 255 million persons in fy1996 to 172 million people in the most recent month for which comprehensive numbers are available april 2001 they are concerned over the corresponding rise in demand at emergency feeding organizations10 finally support for tefap is seen as way of helping the agricultural economy and maintaining farm support for food assistance programs eg farmers get larger share of the benefits provided by tefap than from other food assistance programs in rebuttal to critics supporters of tefap expansion point out that the federal government should not wait until there is additional evidence of widespread need that satisfies those who are now reluctant to add to federal support for tefap and note that significant information now available points to the need to act private donations they maintain cannot reasonably be expected to fully cover the gap between need and the amount of food now available for distribution to the needy moreover they argue that larger bonus commodity donations cannot consistently be relied on to obviate the need for increased money for direct purchases for tefap and help with the costs of distributing federally and privately donated commodities however some are hesitant to increase direct federal support appropriations for food purchases and distribution costs for tefap they view it as relatively inefficie nt way of delivering small amounts of food to the needy especially when compared with other food assistance programs such as food stamps school meal programs and the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children the wic program that are available on regular basis to millions of lowerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30164crs12 11note provisions in s 1246 an emergency agricultural assistance measure reported by the senate agriculture nutrition and forestry committee but not approved by the full senate would have extended this suspension by one year through fy2002income persons more importantly they argue that 1 the cost of increasing federally donated commodities and cash grants will have to come out of other perhaps more deserving programs appropriations given federal budget constraints 2 the case for increased need has not for them been made to the extent that would warrant major increase in tefap money and 3 larger bonus commodity donations increased private donations and expanded gleaning efforts may fill in much of the perceived supplydemand gap in related area tefap supporters have been concerned over the potential effects of recent change in child nutrition law it directs that bonus commodities acquired to support the agricultural economy and donated to the school lunch program be counted in meeting requirement that 12 of all federal assistance for school lunches be in the form of commodities they fear that this provides possible incentive to donate bonus commodities to schools rather than tefap because it relieves the agriculture department of the burden of purchasing extra commodities with annual appropriat ions to meet the requirement as called for in previous law the agriculture risk protection act pl 106224 enacted june 20 2000 alleviates this situation temporarily it requires extra commodity purchases for schools and suspends the rule counting bonus commodi ties toward the 12 school lunch commodity requirement through fy2001 11

senate it contained the same tefaprelated provisions as the house bill pl 10725 directs the agriculture department to use 10 million of funds available to the commodity credit corporation to make grants to states covering direct and indirect costs related to the processing transport ation and distribution of federally and privately donated commodities handled by tefap recipient agencies it also includes spending for new purchases of agricultural commodities which may result in added donations to tefap hr 2646 the agricultural act of 2001 this measure the omnibus farm bill reported by the house agriculture committee on august 2 2001 hrept 107191 part i reauthorizes the food stamp act setaside forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30164crs13 12under the food stamp act federal funds are set aside for states use in employment and training programs for food stamp recipients because of economic conditions in recent years and restrictions placed on this money eg much of it is reserved for programs for ablebodied adults without dependents significant portion of these funds go unused if unused they can be reallocated to states that need them but unreallocated funds accrue for use in later years they are not returned to the federal treasury unused employment and training money accrued for the future now stands at well over 200 million supporters of allowing this accrual to continue argue that the money should be saved for use when economic conditions worsen and the need for employment and training efforts increasestefap through fy2011 and increases the setaside amount to 140 million year of which 10 million is earmarked as new money for distribution expenses it also reauthorizes separate regular appropriations for distribution costs up to 50 million year under the emergency food assistance act hr 2185 entitled the emergency food assistance program enhancement act would require that up to 40 million year in unused funding for employment and training activities under the food stamp program be used to purchase and distribute food commodities under tefap12 as much as 10 million of this could be used for processing storage transportat ion and distribution expenses note the added funding for tefap and the earmark for distribution costs in this bill have been incorporated in the house agriculture committees omnibus farm bill hr 2646 noted above provisions included in s 583hr 2142 and s 940hr 1990 section 8section 6109 authorize the appropriation of an additional 20 million year through fy2006 for tefap commodities and distribution costs at least 50 would have to be used for distribution costs note the tefap provision s of these bills have effectively been incorporated in the house agriculture committees omnibus farm bill hr 2646 noted above separately two other bills s 37hr 990 the good samaritan hunger relief tax incentive act and similar measure s 810 the feeding needy families act would indirectly affect tefap by making changes in the federal tax code to encourage increased business donations of food to food banks and other outlets for distribution to the needy they would expand the availability of tax deductions for charitable donations of food inventory and increase the value of the deduction for some donors this could lessen pressure on the federal tefap program to acquire and provide additional commodities on july 19 2001 the house approved hr 7 the community solutions act of 2001 provisions of title i of this bill include tax code revisions comparable to those advanced in s 37hr 990 and s 810 hr 76 the

years and equal to the full authorized level of funding emergency feeding needs participation in the food stamp and other major public assistance programs has declined dramatically in recent years food stamp enrollment and participation in cash aid programs under temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grants have dropped precipitously from their peaks in the spring of 1994 recipients of food stamps have decreased by over onethird from 28 million persons to about 17 million people tanf caseloads have decreased by at least half while these sharp reductions have in part been due to the success of welfare reform efforts and an improved economy separate measures such as the proportion of persons and families with income below federal poverty income thresholds and presumably still needing some assistance show more modest declines and suggest to some advocate s that need has not decreased as dramatically as it would appear for example the overall poverty rate decreased by 12 from 1994 to 1998 considerably less than the drop in public assistance rolls those supporting efap expansion and loosened eligibility rules for food stamps point to these differing trends along with their own experiences and maintain that there is still substantial need for emergency feeding efforts in their view many poor normally served by traditional public assistance need help because they are excluded by new and stricter rules such as those barring noncitizens and timelimiting benefits or simply discouraged from applying historically there has been only limited data on which to base policy decisions as to the need for emergency feeding efforts this dearth of information has not changed recently however several recent reports provide some evidence of the extent of

households to measure food insecurity and hunger in nationally representative sample of us households the results of the 18item scale used are classified into four categories food secure food insecure without hunger food insecure with moderate hunger and food insecure with severe hunger the questions seek to provide insight into several types of household food conditions anxiety that the household

consequences of reduced food intake for adults andor children in the household and coping actions taken by households to augment their food budget or food supply preliminary estimates indicate that 899 of american households were food secure in 1999 up 06 from 1995 however 31 million americans were food insecure meaning that they did not have assured access to enough food for an active health life at all times for 3 of all households at least one household member was hungry at least sometime during the year due to inadequate resources for the period of 1995 to1999 the number of foodinsecure households fell by 12 and the number with hunger due to inadequate resources fell by 24 among the subgroups studies only households with incomes between 50 and 130 of the poverty line showed higher rate of food insecurity in 1999 compared to 1995 these data provide only relative aggregate information on the extent of food insecurity in the united states in the 5 year that the data

children will increase during 2001 city officials continue to have mixed views on the effect that the current economy is having on hunger with some officials seeing little or impact while others see strong economy leading to improved conditions still others believe that the strong economy makes matters worse especial ly with regard to increased housing costs that will lead to lack of affordable housinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30164crs17 the decline in food stamp participation report to congress this july 2001 report is primarily review of the components and demographics of the reduction in food stamp program participation and the implicati ons of nonparticipation for lowincome families in addition it contains an economic research service review of the recent demand for emergency food assistance based on the first comprehensive national survey of the providers of this assistance key survey finding was that the local emergency food providers have varied program structures and innovative practices allowing them to meet the specific needs of their communities but are only about onetenth the size of the major federal nutrition programs the reported demand for food assistance at soup kitchens and food pantries has increased 45 per year since 1997 most providers in the emergency food assistance system are meeting current demand for their services and the majority of providers felt they could cope with an increase of 10 however other providers reported either being unable to meet immediate needs or perceiving other services that they could offer their clients while the relationship between falling food stamp participation and increases in demand for emergency food assistance remains unclear public and private food assistance programs appear to complement each other in meeting client needs
