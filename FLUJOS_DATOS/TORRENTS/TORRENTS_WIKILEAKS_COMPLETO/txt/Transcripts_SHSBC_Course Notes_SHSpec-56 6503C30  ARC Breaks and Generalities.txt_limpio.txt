6503c30 shspec56 arc breaks and generalities the problem of getting materials out has to do with lrhs pen fingers and the short only 24 hour day nevertheless expansion is going rapidly what is interesting is the number of false data that you can get that create false impression for instance you can get the datum that they say when only one guy said it we were thrown curve last year it was reported to lrh from at least two sources that the gradation program was unpopular in fact the gradation program alone was responsible for last years organizational upsurge lrh let the gradation program wobble and modified it whereupon decline set in most people think that it was the price shift at the start of the year that caused the decline but the decline was coincident with lrh leaving for vacation when investigated it was found that registrars were using the confusion caused by the price shift to deny service they sold lot of auditing saying the price will be prohibitive in thirty days and everyone went into agreement with it the registrars also confused the public about what they could get with what in terms of memberships furthermore there wasnt price rise the price dropped unlike registrars in central orgs lrh never talked about money someone would come in to central org thinking about auditing and someone at the org who had money problems himself gratuitously gave the wouldbe pc money problems lrh never talked about money yet people force discussion of money on him if processing works the person who gets it is more able to have money since registraring to get money was never something that lrh had to do he is considering removing interviews with the reg as part of the regs hat it must have been something added on the line that suppressed the inflow of money it must have been the selling lrh used to explain every datum at least nine times in lecture before study tech came out that got around misunderstood words because the material was put in various ways when telling students to do something he has found that they will do what he said so he has to be sure that he tells them what to do very very clearly instruction is basically trying to cover all of it so thoroughly that there are gaps and room for question on how to do it an old process gets all the quirks and weird ways to do it ironed out as it gets used people in the org got the odd idea that class vi auditor would only audit level vi material class vi auditors can run level 0 only they would use emeters assess for the exact thing to run etc an auditor uses all the tools of the trade that he has mastered if class vi auditor were doing touch assist on burned area and he could see that the area was not getting better fast ie that there was ta on the process he would know that the pc must have something connected with the injury like withhold or an overt having the pc point to where it happened and where it is now is having him contact the environment and letting the whole incident come into view now the touch assist can go to work never accept rumor as something on which to base any action or decision except to investigate use statistics which are particularities if you dont have stats for each individual you get chaos because it is generality an organization will cause arc breaks amongst its staff if you cant get statistic on everybody present week in and week out people will protest an organization as slavedriving system in the absence of stats the stat has to be on each individual or it is worthless it must also be compared with former stats this is what it takes to keep some activity or organization going for long period of time the galactic confederacy had pretty good org board the org lasted eighty trillion years its only flaw was not having any provision for change or improvement it had two billion staff members in the central org lrh set himself the problem of making an org board that could cover from one person to two billion when things arent staticized you get rumors injustice and authoritarianism because generality is operating earth organizations commonly attribute success wholly to the man at the top when in fact he is only 60 or 70 responsible general macarthur didnt win the war though he was bright cookie in korea he didnt win because he wasnt good politician he disobeyed condition formula he was in emergency and didnt promote public opinion is made out of someones hat the moral is that when you try to explain condition with generalities that do not apply you muck up the whole situation that is how russia will take the us they have better propaganda they are promoting communism and who is promoting democracy wilson and johnson are reorganizing economies in period of decline emergency when they should promote what they cam eventually deliver be prepared to deliver it etc they are advertising crisis if you dont want to be something dont postulate it if you yell crisis you will get crisis apply the proper conditions formula us business operates an though it is in perpetual condition of emergency it uses heavy promotion etc american businesses never apply the condition for normal when they get there so they never get out of emergency in emergency you handle with sledge hammer in normal you handle with kid gloves all this has to do with dealing with what is actually going on but you can never find out what is actually going on from having just mass of something there is nothing to compare it with you can only find out what is happening with the individual bits of something never with the masses you get in trouble when you generalize what should be particular in scientology we do make general statements about men we can only get away with doing this because we have studied many individuals when we say about men is actually description of thetan there is another interesting fact about generalities we used to know fairly little about arc breaks now we know that an arc break is generality that should be particularity it was single but it was called many only an arc break can worsen graph during processing which makes an arc break more serious than ptp if theres graph change theres ptp there is nothing wrong with generality per only with one that should be particularity if you get generality when asking for an arc break get the pc to particularize it you can fail to find the bpc by taking generality as the bpc instead of going on to find out who they is you would still have to get the specific who and it may take several of these steps to get it eg aud is there an arc break pc yes the instructors are mean to aud who is the instructors pc pete aud there is bpc has he failed to answer you etc pc it is actually the students aud who is the students pc agnes id forgotten completely she said i was lousy auditor yesterday what is basically wrong with the r6 bank all the gpms are generalities that is why people arc break so hard on r6 the above datum concerning generalities also solves loss the loss of something produces generality of where it could be when you lose something it could be anywhere which makes it generality this is lie so the person arc breaks one of the ways to cure yourself of loss is to remember that the thing that was lost can only be in one place not in thousands of places its an everywhere that should be particularity it gives the individual an unflat listing question about where the test of what was the bpc is when it is located does the pc cheer up if you have to locate it more you havent found the bpc
