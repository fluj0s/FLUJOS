from kevin trenberth trenbertucaredu to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re draft paper on chinese temperature trends date mon 14 jan 2008 090331 0700 cc davidparkermetofficegovuk thomascpetersonnoaagov reinhard boehm reinhardboehmzamgacat susan solomon susansolomonnoaagov adrian simmons adriansimmonsecmwfint hi phil ill read it more thoroughly later my quick impression more from the abstract than the main text is that you are defensive and it almost seems that there is denial of the uhi in part yet later in the abstract and nicely in the first two sentences of the conclusions you recognize that the uhi is real and the climate is different in cities the point is that the homogenization takes care of this wrt the larger scale record and that uhi is essentially constant at many sites so that it does not alter trends so i urge you to redo the abstract and be especially careful of the wording you might even start with the urban heat island uhi is real phenomenon in urban settings that generally makes cities warmer than surrounding rural areas however uhis are evident at both london and vienna but do not contribute to the warming trends over the 20th century because the city influences have not changed much over that time similarly regards kevin phil jones wrote dear all i have mentioned to you all that ive been working on paper on chinese temperature trends this partly started because of allegations about jones et 1990 this shows as expected that these claims were groundless anyway id appreciate if you could have look at this draft i have spelt things out in some detail at times but im expecting if it is published that it will get widely read and all the words dissected i know youre all very busy and i could have been doing something more useful but it hasnt taken too long the european examples are just simple way to illustrate the difference between uhis and urbanrelated warming trends and an excuse to reference luke howard cheers phil prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email 1pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk kevin trenberth email 2trenbertucaredu climate analysis section 3wwwcgducareducastrenberthtml ncar p box 3000 303 497 1318 boulder co 80307 303 497 1333 fax street address 1850 table mesa drive boulder co 80305 references 1 mailtopjonesueaacuk 2 mailtotrenbertucaredu 3 httpwwwcgducareducastrenberthtml
