may not add due to rounding u project description tssinf the sigint enabling project actively engages the us and foreign it industries to covertly influence andor overtly leverage their commercial products designs these design changes make the systems in question exploitable through sigint collection eg endpoint midpoint etc with foreknowledge of the modification to the consumer and other adversaries however the systems security remains intact in this way the sigint enabling approach uses commercial technology and insight to manage the increasing cost and technical challenges of discovering and successfully exploiting systems of interest within the evermore integrated and securityfocused global communications environment tssirel to usa fvey this project supports the comprehensive national cybersecurity initiative cnci by investing in coiporate partnerships and providing new access to intelligence sources reducing collection and exploitation costs of existing sources and enabling expanded network operation and intelligence exploitation to support network defense and cyber situational awareness this project contains the sigint enabling subproject u base resources in this project are used to tssirel to usa fvey insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems it systems networks and endpoint communications devices used by targets tssirel to
