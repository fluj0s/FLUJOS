order code rs21237 updated february 17 2005 crs report for congress received through the crs web indian and pakistani nuclear weapons sharon squassoni foreign affairs defense and trade division summary until 2005 india and pakistan were the only states outside the nuclear nonproliferation treaty to declare openly their nuclear weapons capability in 1998 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21237 they tested nuclear weapons and since then deployed ballistic missiles enunciated nuclear doctrine and made organizational changes to their nuclear establishments in 2002 they teetered on the brink of war in kashmir this paper summarizes indian and pakistani nuclear weapon capabilities and thinking and discusses some confidence building measures in place intended to help avert nuclear war it will be updated as events warrant background almost 50 years of nuclear ambiguity were swept away by the may 1998 nuclear tests of india and pakistan optimists hoped that overt nuclear weapons capabilities could help provide more conventional stability and that limited nuclear arsenals might dampen competition in missile development1 the 1999 conflict in kargil and 2002 crisis in kashmir challenged this viewpoint2 south asia remains nuclear flashpoint and potentially source for terrorists of access to weapons of mass destruction indian nuclear weapon capabilities and thinking india began its nuclear program shortly after independence in 1947 after humiliating defeat in border war with china in 1962 followed by chinas first nuclear test in 1964 the drive for nuclear weapons intensified the 1974 test of peaceful nuclear device was an important milestone but it took several more years to develop nuclear weapons capability simultaneously india developed nuclear infrastructure that supported both civilian and military purposes for example indias development of 1 see joeck neil maintaining nuclear stability in south asia adelphi paper 312 international institute for strategic studies 1997

research service the library of congress crs2 reprocessing capabilities supported both its use of mixed oxide fuel plutonium and uranium for its nuclear power plants and its plutoniumbased weapons the size of indias nuclear stockpile has been topic of considerable debate within scientific and defense communities3 estimates vary from few to 100 but several converge on around 3035 weapons probably stored in component form the us department of defense believes that india is capable of manufacturing complete sets of components for plutoniumbased weapons and has small stockpile of such components india probably can deploy few nuclear weapons within few days to weekand can deliver these weapons with fighter aircraft4 most agree that india is expanding its stockpile and that if india uses unsafeguarded reactorgrade plutonium the potential to expand its stockpile is very significant indias delivery capability has long reflected two very different contingencies china and pakistan because of the distances involved and indias lack of longrange bombers capability against china inevitably required ballistic missiles against pakistan however indian officials recognized early on that aircraft would be more valuable particularly in retaliatory strike the indian air force is significantly more sophisticated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21237 and capable than pakistans5 india has some 35 mirage 2000 fighters that are nuclear capable although other aircraft could also be used ballistic missiles add considerable instability into the security equation because they are high priority targets the pressure to use them quickly and for the other side to strike them preemptively is great indian officials have said shortrange prithvi ballistic missiles 150km and 250km ranges are conventionally armed while nuclearcapable and able to reach almost all of pakistan the use of nucleararmed prithvis could pose major risks of fallout to india6 india has deployed agniii missiles with 1500 km range and tested an 800 km range version of the agni earlier this year these solidfueled missiles which reportedly can be launched within minutes considerably enhance indias ability to respond rapidly in crisis situation in january 2003 the ministry of external affairs released to the public short document on indias nuclear doctrine the doctrine reiterated some of the points in the 1999 draft document on nuclear doctrine produced by the national security advisory board and refined others in summary the document committed india to credible minimum deterrent defined as 1 posture of first use and use against non nuclear weapon states with the exception of the right to retaliate with nuclear weapons 3 the stockholm peace research institute estimated 60120 warheads in 1995 but 2540 warheads in 2000 the bulletin of atomic scientists estimated 50 in 1998 but 3035 in 2002 estimates often calculate how much material theoretically is available but few estimates are based on information about actual weapons another variable is how much material is needed per weapon traditionally it is thought to be 25kg of highlyenriched uranium or 8kgs of plutonium but estimates often use smaller figures one indian researcher estimated in may 1998 that india had fewer than 10 weapons 4 us department of defense proliferation threat and response january 2001 p 24 5 perkovich george

biological or chemical weapons 2 civil control in the form of the prime minister as head of the nuclear command authority 3 nuclear retaliation against first strike as massive and designed to inflict unacceptable damage7 the document described the nuclear command authority as being composed of political council chaired by the prime minister and authorize the use of nuclear weapons and an executive council chaired by the national security advisor pakistani nuclear weapon capabilities and thinking pakistans nuclear program dates back to the 1950s but it was the humiliating loss of east pakistan now bangladesh that reportedly triggered political decision in january 1972 just one month later to begin crash nuclear weapons program unlike india pakistan focused on the uranium route to weapons pakistan sought technology from many sources including china and north korea8 this extensive assistance is reported to have included among other things uranium enrichment technology from europe blueprints for small nuclear weapon from china and missile technology from china httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21237 most observers estimate that pakistan has enough nuclear material highly enriched uranium and small amount of plutonium for 30 to 50 nuclear weapons9 like india pakistan is thought to have small stockpile of nuclear weapons components and can probably assemble some weapons fairly quickly10 pakistan could deliver its nuclear weapons using f16s it purchased from the united states 28 f16 and 12 trainer aircraft 8 are longer in service provided the appropriate wiring has been added to make them nuclearcapable in the 1980s pakistan moved assiduously to acquire ballistic missile capabilities and now deploys shortrange ballistic missiles and small number of mediumrange missiles aq khan former head of khan research laboratories maintained that only the mediumrange ghauri missiles would be usable in nuclear exchange given fallout effects for pakistan of shorterrange missiles other observers view the 30 to 50 hatf2 shortrange 300km missiles modified chinese m11s as potential delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons ghauri missiles 1350 and 2300km which reportedly are based on the north korean dong and taepodong1 are capable of reaching new delhi with large payloads11 7 see httpwwwiddsorgacr2003454d1san03html 8 1976 cooperation agreement with china greatly aided

and response january 2001 p 28 11 bulletin of atomic scientists januaryfebruary 2002 pp 7071 crs4 pakistan has not yet enunciated nuclear doctrine but it is clear that pakistans nuclear arsenal is seen as the key to military parity with india because of its fears of being overrun by larger indian forces pakistan has rejected the doctrine of nofirstuse in may 2002 pakistans ambassador to the munir akram stated that we have not said we will use nuclear weapons we have not said we will not use nuclear weapons we possess nuclear weapons so does india we will not neutralize the deterrence by any doctrine of first use12 on june 4 2002 president musharraf went further the possession of nuclear weapons by any state obviously implies they will be used under some circumstances13 in recent years pakistan apparently has taken steps toward refining command and control of nuclear weapons in april 1999 general musharraf announced that the joint staff headquarters would have command and control arrangement and secretariat and strategic force command would be established14 the connection to civilian leadership was unclear given recent account of the 1999 kargil incursion which suggested that prime minister sharif was unaware that his own nuclear missile forces were being prepared for action15 pakistan established national command authority nca in february 2000 but little is publicly known about it pakistani officials have repeatedly httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21237 said that their nuclear capabilities are safe the new nca is believed to be responsible for nuclear doctrine as well as nuclear research and development wartime command and control and advice to president musharraf about the development and employment of nuclear weapons16 role of kashmir kashmir has been flashpoint since indian and pakistani independence in 1947 many analysts have feared that nuclear weapons could be used if conventional hostilities over kashmir were to spiral out of control especially if as in 1965 indopakistan conflict india opened new front on the punjab plains to break stalemate in pakistan or attempt to settle the issue decisively by confronting pakistan with mortal threat to its territorial integrity17 under these circumstances some have suggested pakistan might be tempted to detonate small nuclear weapon on its own territory to halt forward indian movement other observers however believe such strategy would be akin to state acting as 12 barbara crossettepakistan asks council for action on kashmirnew york times may 30 2002 13 laurinda keys pakistan

coup there may be ironically less concern about civil vs military control but this may be an issue for future concern 16 proliferation threat and response january 2001 p 27 17 the war was preceded by major tank engagement along the border with pakistans sind province in the spring which went in pakistans favor and subsequent war over kashmir in augustseptember 1965 pakistani troops only narrowly defeated an indian counterattack in the direction of lahore illuminating pakistans vulnerability crs5 suicide bomber18 some media reports have suggested that paradoxically the fact that both countries have very small nuclear arsenals increases the pressure on both sides to use their weapons against highvalue targets19 regardless of whether nuclear weapons might be used to stop war or to gain military advantage many observers agree that uncertainty about intentions could worsen stability since 1998 both india and pakistan appear to be integrating nuclear weapons into security strategy and planning with the ominous logic of nuclear deterrence each sides desire to make its nuclear forces more credible may make those nuclear forces more usable ballistic missiles offer both sides advantages over using aircraft as delivery vehicles but the short ranges create hairtrigger situation from launch to impact missile flight times may be as short as 5 minutes in the past both sides appeared to use the separation of warhead components as form of command and control in the sense of lowering the risk of unauthorized or accidental use some observers have noted that this approach becomes risky when the other side can launch shortrange ballistic missiles against which there is defense these observers have called for improving command and control of nuclear forces while noting ironically that reduced ambiguity could conversely increase the likelihood of war20 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21237 the defense intelligence agency reportedly has estimated that nuclear exchange could kill between 9 and 12 million persons on both sides with 2 to 6 million injured these estimates are likely predicated on nuclear exchanges aimed at cities eg indian defense secretary yogendra narain suggested in 2002 that india would retaliate against pakistani aggression and that both sides should be prepared for mutual destruction president musharrafs interview in june 2002 with cnn offered respite from the nuclear rhetoric when he stated i dont think either side is that irresponsible to go to that limit ie nuclear conflict one shouldnt even be discussing these things because any sane individual cannot even think of going into this unconventional mode whatever the pressures21 confidencebuilding measures india and pakistan have 30year history of confidencebuilding measures these include hotlines between army commanders and prime ministers joint indiapakistan military commission created in 1990 and agreements to provide prior notification of troop movements and ballistic missile tests in 1991 both sides agreed not to attack 18 salman rushdie the most dangerous place in the world new york times may 30 2002 19 us is limited in ways it can act to subdue indiapakistan

that agreement envisioned plan for future work to include measures to reduce the risk of unauthorized or accidental use of nuclear weapons reviews of confidencebuilding measures and communications links prior notification of ballistic missile tests continuation of unilateral moratoria on nuclear testing and dialogue on nuclear and security issues the lahore process was undermined by the summer 2001 military incursion by pakistan in the vicinity of kargil but the two sides began dialogue in 2004 in september 2004 india and pakistan announced 13 confidencebuilding measures three securityrelated ones included experts meetings on conventional and nuclear cbms including discussions on draft agreement on advance notification of missile tests biannual meeting between indian border security force bsf and pakistan rangers implementation of the agreement reached between the defense secretaries in their talks in august to discuss modalities for disengagement and redeployment on the siachen glacier24 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21237 foreign secretaries reported progress in their discussions on missile notifications in december 200425 issues for congress since the passage of the 1978 nuclear nonproliferation act congress has been closely involved in efforts to prevent or slow the development of nuclear arsenals by india and pakistan in the light of the global war on terrorism and limited pakistani cooperation in nonproliferation congress might consider the following questions what sources of leverage does the us now have toward india and pakistan are new sources of leverage visavis indian and pakistani proliferation needed should new leverage be focused on averting nuclear use rather than on limiting nuclear proliferation should india and pakistan be priority recipients of cooperative threat reduction assistance what options exist in this regard that do not undermine us obligations as party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty how effective are economic or other sanctions and which might work best 22 annual data exchanges on the facilities according to some were at first less than forthcoming see hibbs mark india and pakistan fail to include new swu plants on exchanged lists nuclear fuel march 30 1992 p 6 23 the hotlines were not used to good effect either in operation brass tacks in 1987 or in may 1998 around the nuclear tests 24 see
