effects on the regi on since the storm number of economic forecasters have adjusted their predictions to reflect its effects most indicate that as result of the storm nationa l economic growth is expected to be 0510 slower than in the second half of 2005 however as economic activity recovers in the affected region and rebuilding begins growth in the first half of 2006 is now expected to be more rapid than was previously forecast this report will be updated as reliable data become available there can be doubt that hurricane katrina wa s tragic and historic event that will have substantial and longt erm effects on the economies of southern louisiana and mississippi from national perspective th at region of the country accounts for only fraction of us economic activity in 2004 louisiana and mississippi accounted for just 2 of national gross domestic product gdp in 2003 the new orleansmetairie kenner metropolitan area accounted for just 04 of total nationa l personal income given the relatively small percentage that the affected area contributes directly to national output what are the prospect s for noticeable slowdown in national economic growth historical perspective in 1992 the united states was hit by tw major storms hurricane andrew which hit florida and louisiana in late august and hurricane iniki which hit hawaii in mid september both storms caused significan t destruction of comme rcial and residential structures the bureau of economic analysis bea estimated that the storms directly reduced the fixed capital stock by 551 billion or over 60 billion in 2005 dollars1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22260crs2 2 national association of home builders news release sept 2 2005 available at their website at httpwwwnahborg 3 jason bram james orr and

2003gross domestic product the standard measure of economic output measures new production destruction of the existing capital stock is not part of the gdp measurement however net domestic produc t which is gdp less capita l depreciation was reduced of course the loss of capita l and labor reduces the nati ons ability to produce new goods and services but bea cannot is olate those effects in the ggregate data for example bea cannot quantify how much of reducti on in tourism services is caused by hurricane compared to other factors what the data do show is that the growth rate of national gdp actually increased from 39 in the second quarter of 1992 to 40 in the third quarter by contrast the growth rate of net domestic produc t fell from 42 in the second quarter to 11 in the third quarter nor did the hurricanes cause fall in gross local output florida grew at 33 the same rate as the nation and hawaii grew at 21 in 1992 total employment in florida grew at 12 rate in 1992 compared to 03 nationally most reports suggest that the costs of hurricane katrina will surpass those of iniki and andrew for example the nationa l association of home builders nahb estimated that the number of housing units destroyed by hurricane andrew was over 28000 as result of damage from hurricane katrina the nahb expects that large share of the more than 200000 homes in new orleans will be found to have been damaged beyond repair in addition to storm losses sewhere not yet estimated2 the economic effects of hurricane katrina ve also been compared to the terrorist attacks of september 11 the attacks cam during the 2001 recession which began in march 2001 and ended in nove mber 2001 in the third quarter of 2001 national gdp declined by 14 it is likely that third qua rter growth would still have been negative had the attacks not occurred in new york st ate output rose by 18 in 2001 fell by 08 in 2002 and then returned to healthy gr owth rate beginning in 2003 the federal reserve bank of new york estimated that september 11th caused loss of 4900071000 jobs in new york city in the worst month february 20023 effects on national economic growth it is important to keep in mind that the effect on national output from the area affected by katrina is largely onetime event it represents drop in the normal level of output due to lost labor hours and capital most of that immediate effect will be reflected in reported gdp growth for the third quarter until output returns to normal levels national output may be depressed but the growth rate of the economy is likely to recover quicklyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22260crs3 4 global insight us economy current situati on forecast flash posted on the global insight website sept 8 2005 global insight katrina s impact on the new

william h frist md sept 6 2005in fact increased spending for immediate storm relief will offset some of the losses due to the storm although damage to th capital stock does not reduce measured gdp rebuilding increases it some of the regions that take in victims will see their growth rates rise as the victims receive government re lief spending and in some cases obtain employment in their temporary city moreover there is likely to be an increase in construction spending in the quarters and years to come in the affected area the effects of that construction boom will be substantial locally but m odest at the national level even if estimates of over 100000 homes destro yed prove correct their replacement will add only marginally to cons truction totals nationwide in 2004 the census bureau reported nearly 2 million to tal new housing starts even if the storm had resulted in the loss of all output contributed by louisiana and mississippi the direct effect on national gdp would only be drop of 2 since some economic activity continues in both states the loss will be less than that those parishes in louisiana and the counties in mississippi and alabama that were declared presidential disaster areas accounted for 13 of total nati onal personal income in 2003 prior to the storm the us economy was growing well in excess of 2 the nnual rate of growth in real gdp was 42 in 2004 for the firs t two quarters of 2005 the growth rates were 38 nd 33 respectively thus lost output due to the storm seems unlikely to be sufficient to result in recessi on or negative economic growth growth forecasts some forecasters have adju sted their economic projections to include the potential effects of katrina global insight has lowered its forecast for economic growth in the second half of 2005 by 07 percentage point anticipating falling energy prices and pickup in reconstructi on global insight raised its projection for growth in the first half of 2006 by 08 per centage point measured year over year the changes appear more modest the forecast for 2005 was reduced by 02 percentage point and the forecast for 2006 was increased by the same amount4 on august 18 2005 macroeconomic advisers released forecast of 46 growth in the third quarter and 36 in the fourth quarter on september 6 2005 they revised those numbers down to 32 and 33 after th storm the bank of america is reported to have lowered its gdp growth forecast fo r the fourth quarter from 37 to 30 merrill lynch economists were reported to have estimated that the combination of the storm and higher energy prices could reduce output by combined 70 billion or 06 of gdp5 the congressional budget office cbo estimates that the overall reduction in economic growth due to katrina in the sec ond half of 2005 is likely to be somewhere between onehalf and one percentage point and will be even less when considered on yearoveryear basis cbo also estimated the katrina could reduce employment through the end of the year by as much as 4000006httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22260crs4 7 for the current status see ergy information administration special report hurricane katrinas impact on us energy at

kuminsjust as the loss of output due to katr ina is likely to reduce economic growth somewhat in the second half of 2005 the resu mption of economic activity in the affected areas will raise growth perhaps as soon as early 2006 both that and the additional spending associated with the rebuilding are lik ely to be boost to economic growth in the first half of 2006 in the same two for ecasts cited above m acroeconomic advisers adjusted their outlook for economic growth in the first two quarters of 2006 from 32 and 32 before katrina to 44 and 38 afterwards for the hurricane to have longer lasting negative economic effect s it would have to affect the broader national economy this could occur if the hurricane led to wide spread disruption of specific sectors of the economy sectoral issues thus far this report has examined the direct effects of hurricane katrina on the local gulf economies as share of the national ec onomy next the report will examine whether the hurricane will have any indirect effects on the rest of the nation that was not hit by the hurricane energy the gulf region is an important produ cer and distributor of oil and natural gas for the nation as whole it produces 65 of domestic crude oil consumption and 16 of natural gas consumption oil refineries in the gulf area were also shut down by hurricane katrina initially about 2 million barrels per day of refining capacity was lost the louisiana offshore oil port receives crude oil imports equal to 5 of consumption and major pipelines that serve the east coast south and midwest originate in the gulf the longterm effect of katrina on energy prices depends how quickly the production facilities refineries ports and pipelines can be repaired and brought back on line7 why would higher energy prices be cau for broader economic concern eight of the nine postwar recessions were accompanied by sharp increases in the price of oil the last four recessions followed this pattern the 19731975 recession followed the oil embargo the double dip recession of 1980 1982 followed the second oil shock which was caused by the iranian revolution and iraniraq war the 19901991 recession followed the oil price spike induced by the gulf wa r and the 2001 recession followed sharp rise in oil prices from 1999 to 2000 energy prices are important to the br oader economy because energy is major component in the production process and major consumption good for households economic theory suggests that oil shocks lead to higher inflation contraction in output and higher unemployment in the short run it is the rise in energy prices rather than high energy prices that causes these macroeconomic problems effective policy responses are difficult because expansionary monetary policy lower interest rates or fiscal policy increased budget deficit would exacerbate the inflationary pressures caused by the oil shock while contractionary polic would exacerbate the contraction in outputhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22260crs5 8 for more information see crs report rl31608 the effects of oil shocks on the economy review of the empirical evidence by marc labonte 9 statistics from american association of port authorities press room httpwwwaapa portsorgpressroomkatrina_updateshtmstatistics 10 uptodate status of ports can be found at american association of port authorities press room httpwwwaapaportsorgpressroomkatrina_updateshtmport20updatessome studies found that the cumulative effect of 10 increase in oil prices during onequarter 3month period would re duce economic growth by 0714 percentage points over the next year this means that small transient price increase would reduce growth modestly but long sharp price increase could push the economy into recession8 empirical research and macroeconomic models of the effect of oil price increases on economic growth and inflation are typically m easured in terms of the price of crude oil not gasoline prices initially the effect of the hurricane on crude oil prices has been moderate while the effect on gasoline pri ces has been significant thus the macroeconomic mode ls may underpredict the effect of higher prices on the economy however the disparity between the increase in gasoline prices and crude oil prices probably reflects the loss of refinery capacity as result of the hurricane this suggests that once refinery capacity is brought back on line gasoline prices should come back in line with crude oil prices trade another channel through which th hurricane could affect the broader national economy is through its effects on international trad new orleans and other gulf ports are major loading points for imports and exports imports that passed through gulf ports in 2003 equaled 100 billion about one sixth of ll imports passing through us ports by tonnage louisiana contains fi ve of the 12 largest us ports including the first south louisiana and fift h new orleans largest and mobile is the fourteenth largest9 disruptions to trade may be mostly shortlived the ports are not expected to be closed for an extended period of time ports in baton rouge south louisiana and mobile were open shortly after the storm the port of new orl eans was reopened to military and relief vessels on september 7 the mississippi river was partially reopened to traffic on september 5 most trade can be diverted to other ports relatively easily notable exception is certain agricultural commodities including half of us grain exports that are shipped from the midwest down the mississippi river on barges to louisiana ports and then shipped abroad10 trade impacts the gdp through net expor ts from an accounting perspective exports add to gdp and imports subtract from gdp thus if both exports and imports fell in equal proportion as result of the hu rricane gdp would be unchanged only if net exports fall eg because of greater oil imports or reduced agricultural exports would gdp fall as result of the hu rricanes disruptions of tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22260crs6 11 see crs report rl30354 monetary policy current policy and conditions by marc labonte and gail makinen 12 see crs report rl31235 economics of the budget deficit by brian cashellpolicy response policymakers have two tools at their disposal to offset the effects of the hurricane on aggregate spending in the economy fiscal and monetary policy the federal reserve can use monetary policy to stimulate spending by lowering the overnight interest rate11 this stimulates interestsensitive spending on capital investment goods residential investment consumer durables and net exports fiscal policy can be used to stimulate spending through an increase in the budget deficit12 deficitfinanced spending stimulates aggregate spending because the spending is financed through borrowing likewise deficitfinanced tax cuts stimulate private spending by the recipient that is financed through borrowing economic theory holds that deficitfinanced spending is more stimulative than deficitfinanced tax cuts because some of the tax cut would be saved rather than spent any stimulus to spending is only temporary in the long run spending cannot grow faster than the growth in the productive capacity of the economy the emergency supplemental appropriation acted in response to the hurricane will act as natural stimulus even though that is not its intention 105 billion supplemental was enacted on september 2 pl10961 and 518 billion supplemental was enacted on september 8 pl10962 co mbined these supplementals would equal about 05 of gdp however further supplemen tals may be enacted in the future if the negative economic effects of the hurricane are as shortlived as predicted additional stimulus might take effect after the fact while changes in interest rates can be implemented rapidly the effect on the ec onomy is delayed fiscal policy changes also face an implementation lag for exampl stimulus bill was proposed immediately following the september 11 attacks but was not enacted until march 9 2002 pl107 147 policy lags are less of an issu for emergency supplemental spending if higher oil prices persist as result of the hurricane then inflation over the next few quarters is likely to be higher than the fed expected when it set its interest rate path prior to the storm while inflation is unlikely to be intolerably high as result of higher oil prices it may top 3 which seems to have been the upperbound of the feds comfort level in recent years drawback to stimula tive policy is that it would be likely to push inflation even higher if economic forecasters are correct th at the hurricane will have limited and temporary effect on economic growth then fiscal or monetary stimulus would be unnecessary to keep the economy on growth path near full employment after being revised downward to take the hurricane into account most for ecasts are still near 3 which is close to the economys historical average if aggr egate spending is stimulated when the economy is at full employment th results are likely to be inflationary
