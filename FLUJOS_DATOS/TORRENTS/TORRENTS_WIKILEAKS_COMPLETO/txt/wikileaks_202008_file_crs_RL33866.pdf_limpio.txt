legislative proposals are presented separately in general cbo only adjusts its baseline estimates to account for administrative changes as they are implemented rather than as they are proposed and only provides separate estimates for legislative proposals medicaid streamline admi nistrative match rates background the federal government pays share of every states spending on medicaid services and program administra tion for medicaid services this share is called the federal medical assistance pe rcentage fmap the fmap is based on formula that provides higher reimbursement to states with lower per capita incomes and vice versa it has statutory minimu m of 50 and maximum of 83 the federal match for administrative expenditures does not vary by state and is generally 50 but certain administrative functions have higher federal match functions with 75 federa l match include compensation or training of sk illed professional medical personnel and their direct support staff of the state medicaid or other public agency preadmission screening and resident review for individuals with mental illness or mental retardation who are admitted to nursing facility survey and certification of nursing facilities operation of an approved medi caid management information system mmis for claims and information processing performance of medical and utilization review activities or external independent review of managed care activities and operation of state medicai d fraud control unit mfcu in the case of mmiss and mfcus the federal match is 90 for startup expenses there is 100 match fo r the implementati on and operation of immigration status verification systems section 1903a7 of the social security act specifies that 50 match will be provided for remaining expenditures that are found necessary by the secretary of hhs fo r the proper and efficient administration of the state medicaid program proposal the presidents budget seeks legi slation to align all administrative reimbursement rates in dicaid at 50 hhs estimates that the proposal would save 945 million in fy2008 and 5315 b illion over the fy2008fy2012 period cbo estimates that the proposal w ould save 1160 billion in fy2008 and 8380 billion over the fy2008fy2012 period reports see crs report rs22101 state medicaid program administration brief overview by april gradyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33866crs5 medicaid implement cost allocation background because of the overlap in ligible populations states often undertake administrative activitie s that benefit more than one program under the former aid to families with dependent children afdc cash welfare program afdc and medicaid program eligibility were linked and many afdc families also qualified for food stamps as result stat often collected necessary information for all three programs during single eligibility interview or performed other shared administrative tasks and charged the full am ount of the cost to afdc as matter of convenience since the federal gove rnment reimbursed states for 50 of administrative expenditures for all three programs total federal spending was not affected by the way in which states allocated the programs common administrative costs when congress replaced afdc with the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant program in 1996 the 50 federal match for expenditures related to cash welfare assistance ended and the automatic link between cash welfare and medicaid eligibility was severed later hhs clarified that states are required to allocate common administrative costs for tanf medicaid and food stamps based on the relative benefits deri ved by each program remaining issue of controversy stems from the fact that tanf block grants are calculated in part on the basis of pre1996 federa l welfare spending including any amounts received by states as reimbursement for common administrative costs as result tanf block grants are higher in many states than they would be if common administrative costs attributable to medicaid and food st amps were excluded from block grant calculations to compensate congre ss has permanently reduced federal reimbursement for food stamp administrative costs in most states by flat dollar amount that reflects the administrative cost s attributable to food stamps that are included in each states tanf block gran t the annual reducti ons total nearly 200 million congress has not reduced federal reimbursement for medicaid administrative costs in similar manner proposal the presidents budget seek s legislation to recoup medicaid administrative costs assumed in states tanf block grants hhs and cbo both estimate that the pr oposal would save 280 million in fy2008 and 1770 billion over the fy2008fy2012 period reports see crs report rs22101 state medicaid program administration brief overview by april grady medicaid require state reporting and link performance to reimbursement background the budget act of 1997 mandated performance monitoring as tool for ensuring the delivery of quality services in medicaid and schip among several initiatives the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms formed the performance measurement partnership pr oject pmpp to select common set of measures that can be used by medi caid and schip programs on voluntary basis to assess the quality of care httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33866crs6 proposal the presidents budget proposal would seek legislation to require states to monitor and report on medicaid performance measures aimed at improving quality of care program integrity and efficiency and would link performance to federal medicaid grant awar ds reporting would begin in fy2008 with threeyear phasein for each of the measures beginning in 2011 states that fail to meet targeted thresholds for each performance measure woul d be subject to an fmap or medicaid grant award reduction depending on the performance measure these reductions would remain in effect until the state meets the designated thresholds for specific performance measures budget documents further indicate that performance measures currently being considered incl ude increasing estate recovery collection rates and reducing the prevalen ce of daily physical restraints in nursing homes for this proposal hhs estimates cost impact in fy2008 and savings of 330 million over the fy2008fy2012 period cbo estimates cost impact in fy2008 and savings of 350 million over the fy2008fy2012 period reports currently other crs re ports address this topic medicaid reimburse targeted case management at 50 percent rate background under current law case manage ment is an opti onal benefit under the medicaid state plan that assists medicaid beneficiaries in gaining access to needed medical social educational and other services the term targeted case management refers to situations in whic h these services are not provided statewide to all medicaid beneficiaries but rather are provided only to specific classes of individuals eg those with aids tuberc ulosis chronic physical or mental illness developmental disabilities or children in foster care or to persons who reside in specific area the federal government matc hes payments for such services using the federal medical assistance percentage fmap which is the rate applicable to medicaid benefits fmaps can range fro m 50 to 83 statutory upper boundary depending on the state in fy2008 13 stat will have an fmap equal to 50 case management can also be claimed as an administrative activity rather than as medicaid benefit when claimed as an administrative service the federal government matches case management at the 50 rate applicable to most administrative services proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation that would set the federal reimbursement rate for all case management activities at 50 to ensure that such services are reimbursed in cost effective and efficient manner the administration maintains that case management activities are inherently the same regardless of how federal matching funds are claimed and that the availa bility of different matching rates has resulted in states choosing to submit claims for case management that will yield the highest reimbursement rate for example states may claim case management services as benefit rather than as an administrative activity when the fmap for the state is higher than the standard 50 match rate for administrative activities hhs estimates that the pr oposal would save 200 million in fy2008 and 1160 billion over the fy2008fy2012 period cbo estimates that the proposalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33866crs7 would save 225 milli on in fy2008 and 1370 billion over the fy2008fy2012 period reports for general information on

state medicaid programs to establish formularies or lists of preferred pharmaceu ticals to be made available to medicaid beneficiaries when health care insurers or providers cover only those drugs on the list and deny payment for others the list is referred to as closed formulary medicaid formularies are seldom as restrictive as the clos ed formularies found in the private market for insurance because of two requirements 1 states are required to provide any nonformulary drug with the exception of drugs in specific categories described below that is specifically requested and approved through prior authorization process and 2 states ar required to cover all drugs offered by manufacturers entering into rebate agreements with the secretary of hhshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33866crs8 states on the other hand are per mitted to exclude certain categories of drug products from medicaid coverage these include drugs used to treat anorexia weight loss or weight gain b to promote

preparations g nonprescription drugs h barbiturates i benzodiazepines and j drugs requiring tests or monitoring that can only be provided by the drug manufacturer formularies may also exclude drug for which there is significant therapeutic advantage over other drugs that are included in the formularies as long as there is written explanation of the reason for its exclusion and the explanation is available to the public as of january 1 2006 federal law also prohibits federal medicaid funds from being used to pay fo r drugs for the treatment of sexual or erectile dysfunction proposal the

prescription drug coverage under medicaid by jean hearne medicaid replace best price with budget neutral rebate background under medicaid drug manufactur ers that wish to have their drugs available for medicaid enrollees are required to enter into rebate agreements with the secretary of hhs on behalf of the states under the agreements pharmaceutical manufacturers must provide state medicaid programs with rebates on drugs paid on behalf of medicaid beneficiaries the formulas used to compute the rebates are intended to ensure that medicaid pays the lowest price that the manufacturers offer for the drugs rebate calculations depend on the type of drug for single source and innovator multiple source drugs basic rebate amounts are determined by comparing the average manufacturer price amp for drug the average price paid by wholesalers to the best price which is the lowest price offered by the manufacturer in the same period to any wholesal er retailer nonprofit or public entity the basic rebate is the greater of 151 of the amp or the difference between the amp and the best pri ce additional rebate s are required if the weighted average prices for all of give n manufacturers

must meet their legal obligation to pay claims before the medicaid program pays for the care of an individual states are required to take all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties to pay for care and services available under the state medicaid plan if state has determined that probable liability exists at the time claim for reimbursement is filed it generally must reject the claim and return it to the provider for determination of the amount of th irdparty liability re ferred to as cost avoidance if probable liab ility has not been established or the third party is not available to pay the individuals medical expenses the state must pay the claim and then attempt to recover the amount pa id referred to as pay and chase states are generally required to cost void claims unless they have an approved waiver that allows them to use the pay andchase method however there are two statutory exceptions to this rule in the case of prenatal and preventive pediatric care states are required to use pay and chase in the case of medicaid beneficiary whose parent provides medical suppor t eg health insurance coverage via an employer as part of child support

medical malpractice insurance is public policy concern because of its potential impact on the availab ility of health care providers and services as malpractice insurance becomes increasingly expensive some physicians claim that premium increases have forced them to limit the services they provide move their practice locations or leave medicine altogether they cite frivolous lawsuits and unreasonably larg jury awards as the causes of the malpractice insurance crisis however lawyer and consumer groups counter that the insurance industry is to blame for th rapid rise in malpractice insurance premiums these groups contend that bad investment choices in addition to the underwriting cycle have led to dwindling pr ofits for insurers who then try to recoup their losses through expensive insurance products there is third perspective which has not generated the same level of attention or controversy that sees the overall medical error rate as the root of the problem proposal
