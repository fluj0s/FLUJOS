their delivery systems and related materials the initiative was announced by president bush on may 31 2003 psi does not create new legal framework but aims to use existing national authorities and international law to achieve its goals initially 11 nations signed on to the statement of interdiction principles that guides psi cooperation as of december 2007 86 nations have formally committed to psi participation psi has secretariat but an operational experts group coordinates activities the state department credits psi with halting 11 wmdrelated transfers from 2004 to 2005 and more than two dozen from 2005 to 2006 psi participants conducted 32 joint interdiction training exercises as of october 2007 although wmd interdiction eﬀorts took place with international cooperation before psi was formed supporters argue that psi training exercises and boarding agreements give structure and expectation of cooperation that will improve interdiction eﬀorts many observers believe that psis

interdiction training exercises and actual operations as they arise and be willing to consider signing relevant agreements or to otherwise establish concrete basis fo r cooperation with psi efforts7

mechanisms an advantage and point instead to highlevel meetings in europe australia and the united states the agreement on set of principles in sept ember 2003 and cooperativ exercises to test interdiction procedures as evidence of psis usefulness8 others however question the seriousness of the administrations effort as well as its sustainability as long as formal mechanisms are created9 the current configuration holds nothing particularly to bind psi dherents to this cooperativ endeavor an informal coordinating structure has developed with an operati onal experts group which has met 15 times to discuss proliferation concerns and plan future exercises psi participants have also hosted four work shops to introduce industry representatives to psi goals and principles10 since its

between april 2005 and april 2006 psi pa rtners worked together on roughly two dozen separate occasions to prevent transfers of equipment and materials to wmd and missile programs in countries of concern12 as of july 2006 under secretary joseph said that psi had played key role in helping to interdict more than 30 shipments13 he also said that psi c ooperation stopped exports to irans missile program and the export of heavy waterrelated equipment to irans nuclear program however whether and to what extent psi has contributed to these interdictions is unclear th ey may have happened even without psi moreover even if psi has resulted in more interdictions than before the increase may simply be the product of an upsurge in proliferation activity psi also faces several implementation challenges for example some states of proliferation or transshipment concern such as malaysia pakistan south korea and south africa remain outside the initiative14 it should be noted however that some countries that are not ready to sign up as full participants do attend psi exercises as observers15 other countries such as south korea may participate indirectly in interdictions or information exchange related to wmd proliferation without becoming full participant in psi16 another issue affecting implementati on is conclusion of shipboarding agreements particularly w ithflags of convenience c ountries so far the united states has signed eight shipboarding ag reements in 2004 with panama the marshall islands and liberia in 2005 with croa tia cyprus and belize and in 2007 with malta and

following 1 the departments of defense and state tablish clear role s and responsibilities interagency communication mechanisms doc umentation requirements and indicators to measure program results 2

interdict wmd shipment using broad range of legal diplomatic economic military and other tools22 several approaches may help improve interdiction efforts first participating states have agreed to review their own relevant national legal authorities to ensure that they can take action second participating states re solve to take action and to seriously consider providing consent to boarding and searching of its own flag vessels by other states23 third participating states seek to put in place agreements such as shipboarding agreements with other states in advance so that time is lost should interdiction be requi red fourth approach is to conduct interdiction exercises psi participants reportedly have trained for maritime interdiction in the mediterranean arabian sea and western pacific ocean all areas that are particularly prone to proliferation trafficking24 in all psi s conducted 32 joint interdiction exercises as of october 200725 as many describe it psi relies on the broken taillight scenario officials look for all available options to stop suspected transport of wmd or wmdrelated items in practice cargos can be seized in ports if they violate the host states laws hence the focus on strengthening domestic laws on the high seas ships have the rights of freedom of the seas and innocent passage under the law of the sea convention and customary international law the boarding agreements may allow for boarding but not necessarily cargo seizure26 according to state department lawyer as of 2005 authority had been worked out to legally seize cargo in addition key gap in the psi framework is that it applies only to commercial not government transportation government vehicles ships planes trucks etc cannot gally be interdicted thus the missile shipments picked up by paki stani c130 in the summer of 2002 in north korea reported by the new york times in november 2002 could not have been intercepted under psi the october 2003 interdiction of shipme nt of uranium centrifuge enrichment parts from malaysia to libya illustrates the need for multilateral cooperation the malaysianproduced equipm ent was transported on germanowned ship the bbc china leaving dubai passing through the ez canal the united state reportedly asked the german shipping company to di vert the ship into the italian port of taranto where it was searched passage th rough the highly regulated suez canal may give authorities an opport unity to delay ships and find reason to board them while some administration officials have cited this as an example of successful

ed it was part of separa operation and thus should not be used as evidence of psis success27 in an interview in november 2003 then secretary bolton suggested that wmd interdiction would target shipments to rogue states and terrorists that pose the most immediate threat28 in the case of rogue states it may be relatively easy to target shipments to iran and north korea and th eir transhipment points but targeting terrorist acquisitions may place seri ous strain on intelligence gathering the bush administration has emphasize d that under psi states will develop new means to disrupt wmd trafficking at sea in the air and on land29 n february 11 2004 president bush proposed expanding psi to address more than shipments and transfers including shuttin g down facilities seizing materials and freezing assets30 to some observers it is di fficult to imagine how national authorities could shut down facilities seize materials and freeze assets particularly if the material and equipment in questi on is dualuse which would normally place the burden on the export destination another approach has been to target fi nancial assets in june 2005 president bush issued executive order 13382 which prohibits us persons from doing business with entities designated becau of their pro liferation activities31 on june 23 2006 66 psi states participated in high level political meeting in poland which focused on developing closer ties with the business community to further prevent any financial support to the proliferation of wmd32 psi legal authorities us officials have been careful to em

nts there are differing opinions on whether the united states should work more aggressively to expand international legal authority for interdictions on the high seas and in international airspace this would include adopting the 2005 protocol to the convention for the suppression of unlawful acts against the safety of maritime navigation sua which would require states to criminalize transportation of wmd materials and their delivery vehicles this protocol also creates shipboarding regime based on flag state consent similar to agreements that the united states has concluded bilaterally as part of the proliferation security initiative33 further step would be adoption of resolution that would provide for interdic tion activities under section vii of the charter which allows the s ecurity council to authorize sa nctions or the use of force to compel states to comply with its resolutions the bush administration has in the past attempted to expand international legal authority for psi and relate d activities on april 28 2004 the security council passed unsc resolution 1540 which requires all states to criminalize proliferation enact strict export controls and secure all sensitive materials within their borders34 while unscr 1540 was adopted under chap ter vii of the charter the resolution did not provide any enforcement authority nor did it specifically mention interdiction or psi early drafts of the resolution put forward by the united states had included explicit language calling on stat to interdict if necessary shipments related to wmd however over china s objections the word interdict was removed and was changed to take coopera tive action to prevent illicit trafficking in wmd35 unscr 1540 called on states to estab lish and enforce effective domestic controls over wmd and wmd related materials in produc tion use storage and transport to maintain effective border c ontrols and to devel op national export and transshipment controls over such items ll of which should help interdiction efforts in april 2006 the security counc il adopted resolution 1673 which extended the mandate of the 1540 committee for two years and
