wheelchairs for 13 months3 on december 21 2005 the senate agreed to the conference report that included the 13month rental period after certain provisions not related to this time period were stricken4 because these unrelated provisions were stricken the senatepassed text had to be returned to the house for final vote to complete legislative action an error allegedly was made in transcribing this text ie the engrossed bill5 before it was sent to the house for final vote 13 months for the rental period for nondurable medical equipment other than oxygen equipment was changed to 36 months this error may have been made because section 5101b provides for rental period of 36 months for oxygen equipment on february 1 2006 the house agreed to hres 653 109th cong 2nd sess 2006

committees in the 109th congress with jurisdiction over agencies affected by the deficit reduction act of 2005 in dismissing the constitutional challenges these district courts invoked the enrolled bill rule enunciated by the united states supreme court in marshall field co v clark19 in 1892 this rule provides that the signing by the speaker of the house of representatives and the president of the senate or the president pro tempore of the senate of an enrolled bill is an official attestation of its passage by both chambers and that when bill thus attested receives the approval of the president of the united states and is deposited in the public archives its authentication as bill that has passed congress should be deemed as complete and unimpeachable20 the court explained the reason that it applied this rule the respect due to coequal and independent departments requires the judicial department to act upon that assurance and to accept as having passed congress all bills authenticated in the manner stated21 when court applies the enrolled bill rule it does not look behind the text of the bill as enrolled that is it does not examine congressional documents such as house and senate journals to ascertain whether the language in the enrolled bill comports with httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22507 versions that appear in legislative sources which precede enrollment according to the supreme court the evils that may result from the recognition of the principle that an enrolled act is conclusive evidence that it was passed by congress according to the forms of the constitution would be far less than those that would certainly result from rule making the validity of congressional enactments depend upon the manner in which journals of the respective houses are kept by the subordinate officers charged with the duty of keeping them22 these district courts appear to have affirmed the current viability of the enrolled bill rule expressly or implicitly acknowledging that the supreme court has not overruled it they rejected an assertion based on footnote in 1988 supreme court case united states v munozflores which stated that where as here constitutional provision is implicated field does not apply23 the plaintiffs argued that this statement raised question about whether the rule should apply to case that alleges violation of constitutional provision responding to this contention the courts in the onesimpleloan case and the public citizen case for example observed that another part of the same footnote provided that the constitution left it to congress to determine how bill is authenticated as having passed24 moreover they quoted language from supreme court 19 143 us 649 1892 20 id at 672 21 id 22 id at 673 23 495 us

precedents25 in another case cookeville regional medical center v leavitt26 federal district judge acting on procedural motion rejected an assertion that the deficit reduction act was not constitutionally enacted the court cited the enrolled bill rule to support this conclusion in the conyers case the district court also held that the plaintiffs members of congress did not have standing ie were not proper parties to file suits challenging the constitutionality of the deficit reduction act27 an appeal has been filed and oral arguments were heard on october 10 2007 in the california department of social services case28 the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit affirmed the district courts dismissal of the public citizen case on may 29 200729 conceding that the bill signed by the president did not pass the house and senate in identical form the court of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22507 appeals agreed with the district court that the enrolled bill rule precluded court from considering extrinsic evidence it cited the reasons undergirding the rule that the supreme court gave in the marshall field case to preserve the certainty and validity of congressional enactments and to respect congress coequal branch of government the court rejected the plaintiffs arguments to distinguish and narrow marshall field based on the footnote in the munozflores case on august 6 2007 public citizen the group that filed suit sought supreme court review of the circuit courts opinion30 but the high court denied review in december 10 2007 order31 25

the deficit reduction act did not arise directly in this case according to published report the district court in september of 2005 awarded 100 million in additional medicare reimbursements to the plaintiffs several hospitals shortly after the president approved the deficit reduction act in february of 2006 the defendant michael leavitt the secretary of health and human services filed motion to alter the september award on the ground that provision of the act precluded the department from paying it in response to this motion the plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the act see one

httpwwwsupremecourtusgov relating to 07141 public citizen v united states district court for the district of columbia continued crs6 the court of appeals for the second circuit on july 19 2007 affirmed the district courts dismissal of the onesimpleloan case for the same reasons given in the public citizen case by the district of columbia circuit32 it also held that court may dismiss claim on the basis of the enrolled bill rule before assessing whether plaintiff has standing to file suit the plaintiffs in these cases asked the courts to strike down the deficit reduction act in its entirety because the house and senate allegedly did not agree on identical text in one subsection if court in the future should agree that the constitutional provisions for lawmaking were violated however it is not clear whether it would invalidate the entire statute or only the subsection involved section 5101a in case decided in january of 2006 regarding abortion restrictions ayotte v planned parenthood of northern new england33 the supreme court indicated that it preferred to invalidate only the portion or portions of an act held to contravene the constitution while upholding remainder of it the court observed that generally when confronting constitutional flaw in statute we try to limit the solution to the problem we prefer for example to enjoin only the unconstitutional httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22507 applications of statute while leaving the other applications in force see united states v raines 362 us 17 2022 1960 or to sever its problematic portions while leaving the remainder intact united states v booker 543 us 20 227229 200534 the court added that after finding that portion of statute is unconstitutional it must ask would the legislature have preferred what is left of its statute to statute at all35 typically to make this determination court conducts detailed analysis of legislative intent it must ascertain whether the legislative body would have preferred that the remainder of statute should continue in effect if it had known that court would strike down portion of it or if it would have preferred statute without the unconstitutional portion an analysis of this kind would not appear be necessary in this case because the house and senate agreed to identical text of all portions of the deficit reduction act except for section 5101a they did not agree to identical text of that section because of transcription error 31 continued 32 onesimpleloan v us secretary of education 496 f3d 197 2d cir 2007 062770cv l available at
