little change in the short rm but would rise as the six countries quotas expand once quotas are fully phased out us grain exports are expected to increase substantially the itc estimates that by the

million and milled rice 10 milli on though the impact of these additional sales in the long run is sma ll equal to 12 of 2003 us grain exports worldwide the itc views the potential increase as offering significant market opportunities for us corn and rice producer s the itc further found that the us grains sector would of all economic sect ors experience the most noticeable positive changes though very small grain out put revenues and employment would rise between onequarter to onethird of 110 the itc expects that the drcaftas sugar provisions likely would result in small increase in us sugar and garcontaining product scp imports from the region equal to the quan tities spelled out in the new preferential quotas prices calculated to drop by about 1 due to increased imports likely would have an adverse impact on production and employment for us sugar producers at the same time lower prices likely would benefit producti on and employment for us producers of certain scps par ticularly of those containing high sugar content the itcs analysis further shows that the us sugar manufacturing and sugar crops sectors would both experience the largest percentage decrease of all

very small share onehalf of 1 according to the itc of total us agricultural exports to the world this outcome largely reflects the small population of the six countries combined 44 million in 2003 and low per capita incomes when contrasted to the much larger markets in asia where average incomes are higher and agricultural import demand is growing rapidly at the same time the market openings granted these c ountries could place additional pressure on the us sugar and cottontextile sectors fearing what increased competition from additional imports might mean for their business outlook sugar and cottontextile interests lobbied congress to defeat or to modify this agreement of more interest to the us agribusiness sector likely will be the agreements investment provisions structured to give us investors in the region predictable legal framework and equal treatment with local investors protections for all types of investment and transparent procedures fo r handling disputes accordingly some us food manufacturers may take advantage of lower input and labor costs tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32110crs24 establish food processing plants to supply the regional market as well as to export eg hispanic food products to the us market the six countries agricultu ral sectors would in the aggregate gain little from this agreement according to the itcs analysis since almost all exports to the us market would continue to benefit from dutyfree access that they ready receive under us trade preference programs what would change is that the agreement makes this dutyfree access permanent and sets into motion process that in 1520 years gives these countries unrestricted acce ss to the us market for all sensitive commodities except sugar now subject to us agricultural tariffrate quotas the expanding us quotas reserved for these countries would benefit sugar processors in the region and to lesser extent exporte rs of beef and dairy products that seek to sell to the us market us debate the congressional debate created divisions within the us agricultural sector between commodity groups that expect to gain from drcafta and those which foresee losses whether this tension is s hortlived or continue s beyond the debate on this trade agreement will depend on whether and to what extent the bush administration includes comparable openings affecting these same sensitive agricultural products in other ftas recently negotiated eg co lombia and peru or yet to be concluded eg panama and thailand recognizing this us trade negotiators are likely to craft these other bilateral free trade agreements acknowledging the political realities involve d in securing c ongressional approval this means translating potential agricultural export gains in trade agreement into bloc of supportive congressional votes it also suggests that ustrs negotiating strategy must incorporate limiting us trade concessions on us sensitive agricultural commodities in order to minimize the number of congressional votes on concluded free trade agreement following senate approva l of drcafta most observers acknowledged that securing majority in the house for drc afta would be problematic in large part due to opposition by the sugar sector and some segments of the textile sector consequently administration officials f aced dilemma should they press ahead and work to cut deals to line up the necessa ry votes to make majority or should they consider making further changes to the sugar and textile provisions or related deals sufficient to yield enough yes votes to win approval as precedent for the latter course of action the clinton administration negotia ted lastminute changes in november 1993 to naftas sugar and orange juice provisions in order to secure enough votes for house passage us trad officials signaled their reluctance to consider this option for fear of unrav eling the overall drcafta package and facing opposition from central american negotia tors to such scenario though the administration made commitments to some members to address certain textile issues the president decided to forward the final implementing bill to congress without seeking any changes in the agreem ent itself the drcafta implementing bill hr 3045 did not contain an provisions for example deta iling the sugar compensation provision or the textile co mmitments though these issues remained under discussion between the administra tion and some house members until the very close house vote occurredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32110crs25 36 to illustrate an initiative was
