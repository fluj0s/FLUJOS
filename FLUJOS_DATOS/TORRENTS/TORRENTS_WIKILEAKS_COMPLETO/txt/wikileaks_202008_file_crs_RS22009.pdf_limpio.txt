pakistani education system that w ill better prepare young citizens for gainful employment in an increasingly knowledgeba sed economy as well as in curtailing or halting the teaching of militantext remist values that are implicated in breeding terrorism3 to some degree and often through overt means such values can be widely transmitted in mainstream nonreligious schools through historical narratives that provide false or inaccurate accounts portraying muslims andor pa kistanis as victims of foreign aggression and repression4 however for many observers it is the curriculum taught in some pakistani religious schools madrassa s that represents the most daunting sociocultural obstacle to president musharra fs stated goal of enlightened moderation the number of madrassas in pakistan incr eased more than tenfold from 1947 to1988 in apparent correspondence with the deterioration of pakistans public education system the taliban movement itself began among stude nts attending pakistani religious schools among the more than10000 madra ssas training up to two million children in pakistan are small percentage that have been imp licated in teaching militant antiwestern antiamerican antihindu and ev antishia values pre ss reports citing pakistani government estimates claim that about 10 of all pakistani school children attend madrassas and that 10 of madrassas have links to militant groups secretary of state powell identified these madrassas as offeri ng programs that do nothing but prepare youngsters to be fundame ntalists and to be terrorists even the

ahmed and john norton moderation of freedom washington post june 15 2004 author interviews with pakistani govern ment officials and scholars in islamabad in january 2004 tended to confirm that movement on madrassa reform was slow at bestfinancing while wealthy citizens are able to send their children to private english medium schools the vast majo rity of pakistanis must choose between deteriorated public system that can be physically difficult to access and religious schools that will feed clothe and oftentimes house their children for free12 some analysts are critical of pakistans government for what they view as excessive spending on the military in country where abject poverty is rife although expenditu res on education have risen considerably over the past decade islamaba d is set to spend nearly 16 on defense for every 1 spent on education this year corr uption and economic dema nds also are factors in many locales schools and textbooks are av ailable and teachers are paid but never report for work usaid administrator natsios has called the existence of these ghost schools terrible problem for pakistan moreover the use of child labor remains widespread in pakistan and international human rights gr oups have identified extensive use of bonded child labor there especially in agriculture nd textile industries13 pakistani officials insist that president musharraf is serious in his aims to bring madrassa curriculum closer in substance to that provided in nonreligious schools with the longterm goal being curriculum that is nearly identical in pakistan the issue of government andor foreign in terference in the operations of madrassas is an extremely sensitive one in part due to perception that the pakistani government at the alleged direction of the us government is seeking to interfere with religion14 us and pakistani officials emphasize that us assistance efforts are districtwide and are not targeted at any individual schools or types of schools likewise the united states claims to be putting pressure on pakistans internal education policies some western nongovernmental organizations working with private donations have teamed with local islamic groups to reform madrassa curricula15 despite president musharrafs repeated pledges to crack down on the more extremist madrassas in his country there is little concrete evidence that he has done so according to two observers most madra ssas remain unregistered their finances unregulated and the government has yet to remove the jihadist and sectarian content of their curricula16 many speculate that musharrafs reluctance to enfor ce reform efforts is rooted in his desire to remain on good terms with paki stans islamist political partie s which are seen to be

success in fulfilling its mandate only three model madrassas have been established and onl small fraction of pakistans religious schools have regist ered the board has ability to compel cooperation18 resistance to reform efforts is not limited to is lamist groups but can also been seen in the statements of pakistans t op political leaders an exam ple is the april 2004 uproar over changes made to ninth and tenthgrade sylla bi clamor that caused the prime minister education minister and religious affairs minister to reaffirm their commitments to islam and backpedal on planned curricula changes the september 2004 repl acement of education minister zobaida jalal with former intelligence chief lt gen javed ashraf qazi was seen by some analysts as setback to reform efforts as pakistans intelligence agency has long been viewed as traditional ally of the countrys religious conservatives yet other observers see the move as potentially shielding the government from criticism by conservatives as it goes ahead with reform efforts19 it appears that even setting aside the question of president musharrafs sincerity and full commitment on this issue resistance to the reform of pakistans madrassas is fierce and the schools identified as the most immediat ely threatening to pakistani society and us interests though small in number may be immune to g overnmental pressure due to their access to external funding sour ces and their close c onnections to powerful islamist politicians one nongovernmental report identifies centr alized and deeply politicized control of pakistan s public education system perhaps most especially of curriculum and textbooks and an overem phasis on urdumedium instruction to be important causes and exacerbators of the count rys ongoing ethnic and sectarian divisions the report also criticizes centr alized curricular decisionmaki ng as bringing about rise in the islamization of public syllabi an outcome that may be the intent of national leaders seeking to manipulate religious fervor in pursuit of foreign policy goals in kashmir and afghanistan20 given this view combined with extreme pakistani sensitivity to perceived interference in religious teaching it may be that focus on public sector reform currently is the best choice for donors years or even decadeslong effort to improve the quality of pakistans education system and reduce the spread of religiousbased militancy appears to be the course that both pa kistani and us leaders have chosen attaining set objectives likely will require greater determination and genuinely longterm commitment
