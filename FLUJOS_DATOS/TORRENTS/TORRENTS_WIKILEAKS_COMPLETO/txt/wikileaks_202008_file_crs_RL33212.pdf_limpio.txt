it has more proven natural gas reserves than any other country is among the top ten in proven oil reserves is the largest exporter of natural gas the second largest oil exporter and the third largest energy consumer energy exports have been major driver of russias economic growth over the last five years as russian oil production has risen strongly and world oil prices have been very high this type of growth has made the russian economy dependent on oil and natural gas exports and vulnerable to fluctuations in oil prices the russian government has moved to take control of the countrys energy supplies it broke up the previously large energy company yukos and acquired its main oil production subsidiary the duma voted to give gazprom the statecontrolled natural gas monopoly the exclusive right to export natural gas russia moved to limit participation by foreign companies in oil and gas production and gazprom gained majority control of the sakhalin energy projects russia has agreed with germany to supply germany and eventually the uk by building natural gas pipeline under the baltic sea bypassing ukraine and poland in late 2006 and early 2007 russia cut off andor threatened to cut off gas or oil supplies going to andor through ukraine moldova georgia and belarus in the context of price andor transit negotiationsactions that damaged its reputation as reliable energy supplier russias ability to maintain and expand its capacity to produce and to export energy faces difficulties russias oil and gas fields are aging modern western energy technology has not been fully implemented there is insufficient export capacity in the crude oil pipeline system controlled by russias stateowned pipeline monopoly transneft and there is insufficient investment capital for improving and expanding russian oil and gas production and pipeline systems number of pr oposals would build new or expand existing russian oil and natural gas export pipelines some are contentious and while the russian government is faced with perceived need to expand its oil and gas export capacity it also has limited resources in midmay 2007 russia announced an agreement with kazakhstan and turkmenistan to build natural gas pipeline feeding central asian natural gas into russias network of pipelines to europe given that the united states as well as russia is major energy producer and user russian energy trends and policies affect us energy markets and economic welfare in general an increase in russias energy production and its ability to export that energy could ease the supply situation in energy markets in the atlantic and pacific basins on the other hand the russian governments moves to take control of the countrys energy supplies may reduce the amount of oil available possibly us suppliers of oil and gas field equipment and services could increase sales and investment in russia however while the investment climate in russia had been considered to be improving it arguably is now worsening as investors complain that it is inhospitable with respect to factors such as poor property rights protection burdensome tax laws inefficient government

reserves table 1 are located in western siberia between the ural mountains and the central siberian plateau the ample endowment of this region made the soviet union major world oil producer in the 1980s reaching production of 125 million barrels per day bbld in 19883 however roughly 25 of russias oil reserves and 6 of its gas reserves are on sakhalin island in the far eastern region of the country just north of japan russian oil production which had begun to decline before the soviet union dissolved in 1991 fell more steeply afterwardto less than six million bbld in 1997 and 19984 statemandated production surges had accelerated depletion of the large western siberian fields and the soviet central planning system collapsed russian oil output started to recover in 1999 many analysts attribute this to privatization of the industry which clarified incentives and shifted activity to less expensive production increases in world oil prices application of technology that was standard practice in the west and rejuvenation of old oil fields helped boost output aftereffects of the 1998 financial crisis and subsequent devaluation of the ruble may well have contributed russian crude oil production reached 90 million bbld in 2005 and rose slowly in 2006 to 92 million bbld 5 1 oil and gas journal december 19 2005 estimates of proven oil andor gas reserves by c ountry can

exploitation combined with old technology is leaving 65 of the oil in the ground according to the director of the russian natural resources ministry between 1994 and 2005 the increase in russian oil extraction was about eight billion barrels greater than the increase in reserves reserves in western siberia russias prime oil producing region shrank by almost 23 billion barrels between 1993 and 20056 with about 1700 trillion cubic feet tcf russia has the worlds largest natural gas reserves in 2005 it was the worlds largest natural gas producer and the worlds largest exporter however production by its natural gas industry has increased very little in recent years and are projected to continue to increase slowly 7 exports only have reattained their level of the late 1990s growth of russias natural gas sector has been impaired by ageing fields near monopolistic domination over the industry by gazprom with substantial government holdings state regulation and insufficient export pipelines gazprom russias 51owned staterun natural gas monopoly holds more than onefourth of the worlds natural gas reserves produces nearly 90 of russias natural gas and operates the countrys natural gas pipeline network the companys tax payments account for around 25 of russian federal tax revenues gazprom is heavily regulated however by law it must supply the natural gas used to heat and power

potential growth of both oil and natural gas production in russia is limited by the lack of full introduction of the most modern western oil nd gas exploration development and production technology also oil companies whose natural gas is largely flared and independent gas companies will play an important role by increasing their share of russian total gas production from 9 percent in 2005 to around 17 percent by 2010 according to the energy information administration 8 their success however depends largely on gaining access to gazproms transmission system however while the investment climate in russia had been considered to be improving arguably there are reasons to posit that it is now worsening as discussed later reported proposal to tighten restrictions on the extent to which foreign companies can participate in russian oil and natural gas production would seem to discourage investment an unsettled judicial system provides limited and uncertain protection of property rights and rights of minority shareholders also investors complain that the climate is inhospitable with respect to factors such as burdensome tax laws and inefficient government bureaucracy

for year results in 3 billion increase in russias nominal gross domestic product9 g18g142g157g155g152g149g142g158g150g561 almost three fourths of russian crude oil production is exported the rest is refined in the country with some refined products being exported of russias 67 million bbld of crude oil exports in 2004 twothirds went to belarus ukraine germany poland and other destinations in central and eastern europe the remaining 2Â¼ million bblsd went to maritime ports and was sold in world markets recent high oil prices have enabled as much as 40 of russias oil exports to be shipped via railroad and river barge routesmore costly modes than pipelines most of russias exports of refined petroleum products to europe are distillate oil used for heating and by trucks russias capacity to export oil faces difficulties however one stems from the fact that crude oil exports via pipeline are under the exclusive jurisdiction of russias stateowned pipeline monopoly transneft bottlenecks in the transneft system prevent its export capacity from meeting oil producers export ambitions only about four million bbld can be transported in major trunk pipelines the rest is shipped by rail and river routes most of what is transported via alternative transport modes is refined petroleum the rail and river routes could become less economically viable if oil prices fall sufficiently the russian government and transneft are striving to improve the export infrastructure unless significant investment flows into improving the russian oil pipeline system nonpipeline transported exports probably will grow for example rail routes presently are the only way to transport russian crude oil to east asia russia is exporting about 200000 bbld via rail to the northeast china cities of harbin and daqing and to central china via mongolia since yukos was the leading russian exporter of oil to china there was concern that the breakup of yukos by the russian government see below under energy policy might affect rail exports to china however lukoil now is the chief supplier of russian oil to china us markets could benefit from proposed pipeline which would carry crude oil from russias west siberian basin and timanpechora basin we stward to deepwater tanker terminal at murmansk on the barents sea this could allow for between 16 and 24 million bbld of russian oil exports to reach the united states via tankers within only nine days much faster than shipping from the middle east or africa lng facilities at murmansk and arkhangelsk to the southeast also have been suggested possibly allowing for gas exports to american markets oil transportation in the black sea region is in flux much of russias oil is shipped by tankers from the black sea to the mediterranean and to asia much of it from the port of novorossiysk however transit through the shallow and congested bosporus straits is limited by turkey for environmental and safety reasons limiting the effective capacity of pipelines to novorossiysk 10 9 antonio spilimbergo measuring the performance of fiscal policy in russia imf working paper wp05241 international monetary fund december 2005 p 7 crs has applied the imf

mid1980s russia began trying to diversify its export options gazprom has shifted some of its exports to meet the rising demand of european union countries turkey japan and other asian countries for gazprom to attain its longterm goal of increasing its european sales it will have to boost production as well as secure more reliable export routes to the region issues have arisen with the growth of russias gas sales to europe eu trade representatives have criticized gazproms abuse of its dominant market position and twotiered pricing system which charged higher prices on exports than on domestic sales russia agreed to grant domestic independent natural gas producers access to gazproms pipelines and in response to calls for fair pricing the russian government doubled prices to russian industrial consumers but the new price level still is less than half of the prices charged at the german and ukrainian borders to correct this the russian government has decided increase domestic gas prices gradually over the next few years with the aim of more than doubling them by 2011 14 as major supplier of natural gas to european countries and the dominant supplier to some russia has some ability to set prices15 for example as described later in this report gazprom has threatened to cut off natural gas supplies to certain countries if they didnt agree to pay higher prices and has actually done so as the only seller of russias gas gazprom is russias largest earner of hard currency continued restricted to smaller tankers that can transit the bosporus straits ceyhan can remain

markedly in january 2006 as result of severely cold weather in russia that greatly increased russian gas consumption and also reduced oil exports somewhat the cold conditions lasted through the month16 as with oil russia faces competition for asian gas markets from kazakhstan which with china is studying the feasibility of building pipeline from the former to the latter17 given the proximity of gas producers turkmenistan and uzbekistan to kazakhstan it is possible that their gas also would go to china via that route g7g151g142g155g144g162g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g343g350g561 the russian government has moved to take control of the countrys energy resources and to try to use that control to exert influence elsewhere it is arguable that the push for control was partly the motivation behind the governments prosecution of mikhail khodorkovski ceo of yukos who acquired stateowned assets during privatization and adopted open and transparent business practices while transforming yukos into major global energy company yukos is being broken up with its principal assets being sold off to meet alleged tax debts uganskneftegaz yukos main oil production subsidiary was sold at staterun

2006 and the moscow arbitration court confirmed the vote21 portions of yukos have been sold off piecemeal since then possible change to less aggressive policy was hinted at when president putin announced on january 31 2006 that russia will not seek control of more oil companies22 however the duma voted to give gazprom the exclusive right to export natural gas23 and as described below russia moved to limit participation by foreign companies in oil and gas production and gazprom gained majority control of the sakhalin energy projects 16 cold spell cuts russian gas to europe financial times

the russian government have used leverage to buy energy companies to gain control over energy supply for example yukos obtained majority control of lithuanian refinery the only one in the baltic states by slowing oil supply to it and buying it at reduced price the transneft pipeline monopoly diverted the flow of oil shipments to primorsk russian port stopping fl ow to the latvian port of ventspils some see transnefts action as move to obtain control of the firm that operates the ventspils terminal24 also transneft refused to finalize an agreement to transport kazakhstani oil to lithuania undermining kazakhstans kazmunaigazs attempt to buy the refinery after several developments an agreement was reached for yukos to sell the refinery to polish firm25 another example of russias efforts to maintain or increase control over energy supplies is the routing of new and planned export pipelines for example russia has agreed with germany with the support of the united kingdom uk to supply germany and eventually the uk directly by building natural gas pipeline under the baltic sea thus bypassing ukraine and poland in late january 2006 gazprom was negotiating with uzbekistan to obtain control of three of that countrys gas fields 26 russia also is hoping to participate in the venture that is constructing gas pipeline between turkey and greece27 several actions in recent years by russia or its economic agents have been characterized by some as perhaps overaggressive in 2005 gazprom wanted to raise ukraines price originally fraction of the world market price in return for its transmission of the gas to the market level large share of russias natural gas exports to western europe pass through ukraine and belarus which withdraw certain amount of gas from the pipelines for its own use when negotiations failed gazprom reduced gas pressure and flow through the ukrainian network on january 1 2006 ukraine compensated by using some gas intended for west europe gazprom restored supply very shortly after when those countries complained and pointed out that russia was risking its reputation as reliable energy supplier 28 the dispute was resolved temporarily on january 4 2006 gazprom would sell gas at its asking price to trading company that would mix russian gas with less expensive gas from central asia and sell the mixture to ukraine at the higher price that ukraine had indicated it was willing to pay but much lower than gazproms price gazprom would pay cash instead of gas in kind to ukraines pipeline business for increased transit fees

apparent reliability of its natural gas supplies suffered further when severely cold weather raised russian gas for gas and cut exports below contracted volumes after few temporary russiaukraine gas price agreements deal was reached in october 2006 in which ukraine pays moderate price for gas in return for political and other favors32 in other actions russia cut off gas to moldova in an early january 2006 price dispute the countries reached an interim agreement after moldova had been without russian gas for two weeks33 in late 2006 gazprom appeared to be preparing to cut off gas supplies to belarus and georgia unless they agreed to pay much higher prices in 2007 reportedly georgia soon agreed to doubling of gazproms prices34 belarus and gazprom signed fiveyear contract on january 1 2007 providing that belarus will pay increasingly more for gas starting at more than twice the old price and gazprom will purchase 50 of belarus gas pipeline network 35 the next week russia shut off the flow of crude oil to and through belarus following its announcement of an oil export tax and belarus imposition of customs duty on oil transiting belarus to other export markets and b taking some of the oil flow as payment of the customs duty36 destination countries had adequate inventory to cope in the short run but criticized the failure to warn that shutoff was possible37 oil began flowing again late on january 10 2007 after belarus lifting of the transit duty helped the countries reach tentative agreement38 the moldova georgia and belarus incidents have heightened concern about russias reliability and encouraged investigations of nonrussian energy sources by several former soviet union as well as west european countries to explore nonrussian sources of energy russia initially opposed western investment in caspian sea energy projects insisted that oil from the region be transported through russian territory to black sea ports and argued for equal sharing of caspian sea oil and gas this attitude partly reflected the extensive energy ties between russia and central asian countries stemming from the numerous transportation routes from that area through russia but russia has become more agreeable and even cooperative with western projects and it has signed an agreement with azerbaijan and kazakhstan on caspian seabed borders essentially based upon shore mileage

the largely undeveloped energy resources of eastern siberia as those countries strive to meet their increasing energy needs while reducing dependence on the middle east china and japan appear to be engaged in bidding war over russian projects and are contesting access to russian rival oil pipeline routes many observers believe that russia tried to use potential participation by american firms in development of the large shtokmanovskoye gas field as leverage in the negotiations to gain entry into the world trade organization wto 39 ultimately russia decided to rule out foreign equity participation in developing shtokmanovskoye but will allow foreign company involvement as contractors and owners of the operating company40 41 another recent development the july 2006 initial public offering ipo in which 1314 of stateowned oil company rosneft was sold has been seen by some as an attempt by russia to attract investments by major oil companies presumably the latter hope that investing in the rosneft ipo would gain them easier access to participation in russian oil and gas projects 42 43 another instance of russian moves to gain control of its energy resources is gazproms

proposals are contentious and while the russian government perceives need to expand its oil and gas export capacity it has limited resources several selected proposals are discussed below with 1214

approval will be expa nded to 12 million bbld the bps gives russia direct outlet to northern european markets reducing dependence on routes through the baltic countries the rerouting of russian crude through the bps has incurred considerable cost to those countries russian authorities have stated that precedence will be given to sea ports in which russia has stake over foreign ones but the waterways through which tankers leaving from primorsk and most other russian export ports must transit limit tanker size and therefore the price competitiveness of their cargoes 47 much of the

major energy producer and user russian energy trends and policies affect us energy markets and us economic welfare in general in broad sense other things being equal should russia considerably increase its energy production and its ability to export that energy both westward and eastward it may tend to ease the supply situation in energy markets in both the atlantic and pacific basins in the atlantic arena more russian oil could be available to the united states in the pacific area there would tend to be more supply available to countries trying to assure themselves energy supplies such as china and japan this may ease the global competition for persian gulf oil on the other hand the russian governments moves to take control of the countrys energy supplies noted earlier may have the effect of making less oil available on the world market this could occur if russias tendency to limit foreign company involvement in oil and gas development limits the introduction of the most modern technology or if russia intentionally limits energy development and production possibly as important as russian oil and gas industry developments is the associated potential for us suppliers of

of the most modern we stern oil and gas exploration development and production technology although usrussian economic relations have expanded since the collapse of the soviet union as successive
