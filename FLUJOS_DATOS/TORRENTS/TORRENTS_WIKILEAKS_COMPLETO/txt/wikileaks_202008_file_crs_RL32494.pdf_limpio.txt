professiona l journals concerning th substantial profits that physicians could make by becoming partners in providers to which they referred their patients in 1989 the office of the inspect or general oig of the department of health and human services dhhs reporte d that patients of referring physicians who owned or invested in i ndependent clinical labs received 45 more lab services than medicare patients in general and 34 more services directly from clinical labs than medicare patients in general this increased utilization cost medicare an estimated 28 million in 19871 while several types of arrangements were the subject of both the press and oig studies the most significant findings related to referrals to independent clinical laboratories the congress re sponded to these reports by enacting the stark i ban as part of obra 1989 the omnibus b udget reconciliation act of 1990 obra 1990 included technical amendments summary the 1989 law established ban effective january 1 1992 on certain financial arrangements between physicians and clinical laboratories specifically physician could not make referral to lab for services for which medicare would otherwise pay if the physician or immediate family member had an ownership or investment interest in or compensation arrangement with the lab further the lab could not bill for such services for purposes of the ban an ownership or investment inte rest could be through equity debt or other means compensation arrangement was defined as any arrangement involving remuneration between physician or immediate family member and an entity the law established series of exceptions to the ban some were general exceptions to both the ownership and comp ensation arrangement prohibitions for example there were exceptions for services provided by another physician in the same group practice or for inoffice ancilla ry services other exceptions related only to the ownership or i nvestment prohibition or only to the compensation prohibition studies the issue of physician selfreferra ls continued to be of concern to policymakers after enactment of the 1989 w several subsequent events focused continuing attention on this issue thes included issuance of florida study and several followup studies whic h added substantially to the body of evidence on the implications of selfreferralshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32494crs3 2 us

patients for more costly services april 20 1993 washington gao 1993the florida study was issued by florida state university in september 1991 it was prepared under contract with the st ates health care cost containment board pursuant to mandate by the florida legisl ature the authors of the study grouped the 10 types of facilities surveyed into thr ee categories based on the effect of joint venture arrangements between physicians nd health facilities on access charges and utilization of services the authors concluded that joint venture arrangements had apparent negative effects on hospital and nursing home services for the second category of facilities ambulatory surgical centers home health services durable medical equipment suppliers and radiation therapy cente rs some potential problems were identified but the data did not allow the authors to draw definitive conclusions however for the third category clinical laboratories diagnostic imaging services and physical therapy services the results indicated significantly higher utilization and significantly higher charges at joint venture facilities further joint venture arrangements did not increase access to rural or unde rserved patients2 followup analysis of the impact of physician ownership on physical therapy and rehabilitation services showed that visits per patient were 39 to 45 higher in joint venture facilities further gross and net revenues per patient were 30 to 40 higher in facilities owned by referring physicians3 followup examination of radiation therapy centers showed that joint ventures provided less access to poorly served populations rural coun ties and inner cities than nonjoint venture facilities further the frequency and costs of radi ation therapy treatments in freestanding centers in florida were 40 to 60 higher than in the rest of the us where the prevalence of joint venture arrang ements was substantially lower4 followup analysis by gao showed that physician owners of diagnostic imaging services referred thei r patients more frequently for more expensive services than nonowners overall mri owners re ferred their patients for mri scans twice as often as nonowners this evidence was presented to the congress during its consideration of obra 19935 the final report issued subsequent to enactment of obra 1993 provided additional evidence that report found that physicians who had ownership interests in some type of imaging facility ordered 54 more mri scans 27 more computed tomography ct scans 37 more nuclear medicine scans 27 more echocardiograms 22 more ultrasound services and 22 more complex xrays the study also found that imaging patterns for physicians with imaging facilities in their offices gr oup practices or other practice aff

httpwwwamaassnorgama1pubuploadmm369ceja_ci91pdfordered tests more fre quently than physicians who refe rred patients outside of their practices6 response of the medical profession beginning in the mid1980s many in the medical profession reexamined the appropriateness of selfreferral arrangements the primary focus for this discussion was within the american medical association ama the or ganizations 1986 c ouncil on ethical and judicial affairs report cite d during consideration of the 1989 law took the position that physician ownership in commercial venture was not itself unethical potential conflictofinterest situations were to be addressed through cer tain safeguards such as informing patients of the ownership interests in december 1991 the ama council citin g evidence of continuing problems recommended new approach it stated that in general physicians should not refer patients to health care facility outside their office practice at which they do not directly provide care or services when they have an investment interest in the facility however physicians could invest in and refer to an outside facility if there was demonstrated need in the community for the facility and alternative financing was not available in such cases physicians must disclose their investment interests to patients when making referral patients must be given list of effective alternative facilities if such facilities become reasonably available informed they have an option to use one of the alternative facilities and assured that they will not be treated differently by the physician if they do not choose the physician owned facility 7 this general policy remains in ffect though revisions have been made to conform to subsequent legislation and additional clarifica tions are under review omnibus budget r econciliation act of 1993 obra 1993 stark ii provisions 1992 legislation the 102nd congress passed hr 11 the revenue act of 1992 which was vetoed by president geor ge hw bush on november 4 1992 this legislation would have in cluded several medicare ame ndments including several technical modifications to the stark ban included were exemptions for facilities shared by more than one physician practice under specified conditions modifications in the definition of group pr actices and clarifica tion of permissible compensation arrangements 1993 legislation modifications to the star k ban were again considered during 1993 the concern continued to be balance between the concerns of legitimate business arrangements with the goal of effective implementation of the referral ban the range of the discussion expanded considerably from that which had occurred during 1992 several issues were of particular concern including the scope of the ban the definition of group practice and clarification of the definition of compensation arrangementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32494crs5 8 many of the concerns were presented to the congress during ways and means committee hearings on the legislation on may 3 1995 much of the material in this section is from testimony given on that dateduring consideration of the bill some attempts were made to extend the ban to broad range of additional services and to additional payers the final law did extend the ban to an additional list of des ignated health services beginning in 1995 it also extended the ban to medicaid the legislation gave physicians over two years to divest themselves of ownership inte rests however some groups had pushed for later startup date second area of concern was the definiti on of group practice this definition is important because referrals to other mbers within the same group practice are exempt from the referral ban there was agreement that the existing law required technical improvements howe ver many were also concer ned that the definition had to be sufficiently tight to exclude sham groups whose primary purpose was to circumvent the referral ban the final finition was modified to include number of additional requirements however it did not include controversial proposal that group practices maintain an averag of five physicians per site obra 1993 also included significant m odifications to the inoffice ancillary services exception under the revised vers ion this exemption is provided for the furnishing of clinical laboratory services by lab even though it has multiple office locations however for all other servi ces the exception for group practices applies only if the services are provided in cen tralized location the question of the treatment of medicare ancillary services in multiple standalone facilities was left to the secretary to address in regulations obra 1993 did not include an exception for facilities which are shared by physicians who are not part of formal group practice shared facility exception for laboratory services had been incl uded in the 1992 bill which was vetoed obra 1993 also contained significant clar ifications in the language relating to permissible compensation arrang ements and to remuneration 1994 legislation the social security amendments of 1994 pl 103432 included technical amendments to medicare several minor changes to the selfreferral provisions were included in the package these included cl arification of the definition of radiology services included in the lfreferral ban and clarifi cation that investment and compensation arrangements are included within the reporting requirements activities during the 104th congress passage of stark ii raised series of concerns on the part of many provider groups8 while stark i and ii were intended to remove potential conflicts of interest from physician decision making number of persons argued that the legislation particularly parts of stark ii represented an unwarranted intrusion into the practicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32494crs6 9 cms officially came into existence on july 1 2001 prior to that date the agency was known as the health care fi nancing administration hcfaof medical care they stated that the legislation partic ularly the provisions relating to compensation arrangements were too complex and might in fact impede physicians ability to participate in managed care networks they suggested that while the referral prohibitions were signed primarily for feeforservice environment the health care system was moving rapidly toward integrated health care networks many observers also objected to imp lementation of st ark i and stark ii including the potential imposition of sanc tions prior to the issuance of final regulations they argued that the law was complex and that guidance was needed on some complex business arrangements cms stated9 that it did not have leeway on the effective dates in january 1995 cms issued an information memorandum outlining the provisions of stark ii while this was intended to inform physicians about prohibited referra ls many argued that it was too general to answer any specific questions in august 1995 cms issued final regulations on stark i the application of these regulations was limited to physician referrals to clinical laboratories however the preamble noted that the policy interpretations were generally expected to apply with respect to othe r designated health services despite this statement many groups contended that in view of the array of existing financial arrangements more guidan ce was needed they raised series of concerns about the potential application of the referral ban in specific situations balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl10533 in 1995 an attempt was made to significan tly scale back the application of the selfreferral ban on november 20 1995 congress gave final approval to the conference report on hr 2491 the balanced budget act of 1995 bba 95 the president vetoed the measure on december 6 1995 in part because of the size of the proposed medicare savings attri butable primarily to reducti ons in the growth rate of payments to health care providers bba 95 included several amendments to the physician selfreferral provisions many of the changes were in response to the objections raised by various provider groups there were two major changes the first would have repealed the selfre ferral prohibitions based on compensation arrangements the second change limited th application of the prohibition to the following designated services 1 clinical laboratory services 2 parenteral and enteral nutrients equipment and supplies 3 radiology services including magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomo graphy and ultrasound services and 4 outpatient physical or occ upational therapy services modified version of bba 95 was considered and ultimately passed as the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 as part of the effort to develop compromise measure several of the items which were included in the 1995 bill were not considered as part of the 1997 bill as result major physician selfreferral changes were not considered during the 1997 debate however the legislation did include provision which requires the secretary of hhs to issue written advisoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32494crs7 10 us general

firs t related to electronic prescribing the second to specia lty hospitals discussed below mma provided for the establishment of an electronic prescription program for the new medicare drug program it authorized the secretary to establish safe harbor from sanctions under the sel freferral and other antifraud provisions in connection with the provision of nonmonetary remunera tion necessary and used exclusively for electronic prescribing such remunerati on could consist of rdware software or other information technolog and training services specialty hospitals recent years have seen the growth of sp ecialty hospitals these generally for profit entities focus on one category of care such as cardiac ca re or orthopedic surgery proponents of specialty hospitals contend that the focused mission improves quality and reduces costs other observers suggest that these hospitals are siphoning off the more lucrative cases from nearby general community hospitals thus having an adverse impact on the latters viability and ability to deliver range of services including emergency care10 related concern is the impact of physici an ownership of specialty hospitals on physicians clinical behavior and referral patterns while physician is barred from referring patients for inpatient or outpatient hospital services to entities in which the physician has financial interest the law includes an exception if the ownership interest is in the entire facility and not merely subdivision this whole hospital exception means that physician can refer patients to specialty hospitals even if the physician has an ownership interest in the facility some observers have characterized this as rious loophole in the selfre ferral ban because physician ownership in speciality hospital is compar able to ownership in subdivision of community hospital they state that while referrals to general hospital would have little economic impact for an individual physici an the same is not true in the case of smaller specialty hospitals an april 2003 gao report focused on these concerns it noted that specialty hospitals while only 2 of the market had tripled in number since 1990 in 2000 they accounted for about 1 of medicar spending for inpatient services approximately 70 of specialty hospitals in existence or under development had some physician owners with total physician ownership

changes medpac report medpac submitted its report on march 8 200512 the report found13 that physicianowned specialty hospitals treat patients who are generally less severe cases and therefore more

similar to those which had been recommended by medpac it further noted that physicians may be particip ating in ownership of sm all orthopedic or surgical hospitals rather than ambulatory surgical cen

regulations the regulations discussion incorporates changes made by phase iii which are effective december 7 2007 this summary should not serve as basis for determining whether an individual financial relationship is in violation of the ban or fits one of the exceptions only an attorney familiar both with the stark provisions as well as the circu mstances of an individual case is in position to make such determination in general the law establishes ban on certain financial arrangements between referring physician and an entity specifically if physician or immediate family member has financial relationship with an entity the physician is prohibited from making referral to the entity for designated health services dhs for which medicare would otherwise pay further the entity may not bill medicare for such services financial relationshi p is defined as an ownership or investment interest in or compensation arrangement with the entity for purposes of the ban an ownership or investment interest may be through equity debt or othe r means an interest in an entity that holds such ownership or investment interest is included in the definition compensation arrangement is generally fined as any arrangement involving any remuneration between physician or immediate family member and an entity sanctions the law prohibits payments for dhs provided through prohibited referral and requires refunds for any amounts improperl billed and collected it provides for civil monetary penalty up to 15000 per service and exclusion from medicare in any case where person submits an imprope r claim that such person knew or should have known was provided thr ough prohibited referral or who has not refunded the payment civil monetary penalties of up to 100000 for each arrangement or scheme and exclusion from medicare are so provided for circ umvention schemes these occur in cases where physician or other entity enters an arrangement or scheme such as crossreferral arrangement which the entity or person knew or should have known had the principal purpose of assuring referrals which if they had been directly made woul d have been prohibited civil money penalties assessments and exclusions for health care violations are administered by the hhs office of inspector general oig the oig sanctions regulations for such violations include sa nctions relating to th selfreferral ban 42 cfr 1003 exceptions the law includes series of exceptions to the ban some are general exceptions to both the ownership and compensation arrangement prohibitions while others relate only to ownership or onl to compensation arrangementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32494crs16 implementing regulations add an exception for claim by an entity for dhs when the entity is unaware of the referring physicians identity and did not act in reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance of such identity the regulations further add an exception for certain temporary arrangements involving noncompliance if the entity has financial relationship with an entity that complied with one of the general owne rship or compensation exceptions for the previous 180 days it is allowed up to 90 days to come into compliance provided certain conditions are met the relationshi p must have fallen out of compliance for reasons beyond the control of the entity and the entity must take prompt steps to rectify the noncompliance this exception can be used by an entity only once every three years with respect to the same referring physician the following is summary of the lfreferral law section 1877 of the social security act and related re gulations 42 cfr 411350 411370 definitions the law and regulations contain series of terms which are key to application of the selfreferral provision the definiti on of terms is partic ularly important to determine whether particul ar referral falls within th prohibition and if so is eligible for an exception the following hi ghlights the definitions for key terms used throughout the law andor regulations dditional concepts prima rily applicable to single exception are define d in subsequent sections designated health services law the selfreferral ban app lies to designated health services dhs these are defined as 1 clinical laboratory rvices 2 physical therapy services 3 occupational therapy services 4 radiolog services including magnetic

under the supervision of that other physician also included is request by physician or establishment of plan of care that involves the furnishing of dhs physician requests are defined as physician referrals the law specifies that requests by pathologists for clinical diagnostic lab services and pathological examination services are not referrals if they are furnished by or under the supervision of ch pathologist pursuant to consultation request by another physicia n requests by radiologists for diagnostic radiology services and by radiation oncologists for radiation therapy would not constitute referrals regulations the regulations state that referral does not include services performed or provided personally by the referring physician service is not considered to be personally performed or provided if it is perfo rmed or provided by another person including the referring physicians employees independent contractors or group prac tice members the definition of referring physician specifies that such physician and the prof essional corporation of which he or she is the sole owner are the same for pur poses of the selfreferral provisions the preamble to the regulations notes that while some services may not be considered to be personally performed they may fall into the inoffice ancillary services or other exceptions discussed below further the preamble also notes that there is referral if physician personally fills an implantable pump or when physician prepares an antigen and furnishes it to patient however it stated that there are few if any situations in which referring physician would personally furnish dme and supplies to patient because doing so would require that the physician be enrolled in medicare as dme supplier and personally perform all of the duties of supplier referring physician claiming to provide dme personally would need to maintain adequate documentation to establish that he or she personally performed all required activities financial re lationship law as noted above fina ncial relationship is defi ned as an ownership or investment interest in or compensation arrangement with the entity httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32494crs18 regulations the interest may be direct in which case the remuneration passes between the referring physician and the entity furnishing the dhs without any intervening persons or entities it may also be indirect ownership or investment interest law an ownership or inves tment interest may be thr ough equity debt or other means an interest in an entity that holds such ownership or investment interest is included in the definition regulations the regulations specify that an ownership or inve stment interest in subsidiary company is not an owne rship or investment interest in parent company nor in any other subsidiary of the parent company unless the subsidiary company itself has such interest in the parent company or such other subsidiaries it may however be part of an indirect fi nancial arrangement certain items are excluded from the definition of ownership nd investment interests one exclusion is security interest in the equipment of hospital held by physician who both sold the equipment to the hospital and financed its purchase through loan to hospital this transaction is considered compensation arrangement an indirect ownership or investment inte rest exists if there is an unbroken chain of persons or entities with ownership and investment interests between the referring physician or immediate family member and the entity common ownership in an entity does not in and of itself establish an indirect ownership there must be an unbroken chain of interests between the refe rring physician and the entity furnishing the dhs such that the physician has an interest in the entity furnishing the dhs compensation arrangement law compensation arrangement is generally defined as any arrangement involving any remuneration between phy sician or immediate family member and an entity the following types of remuneration are excluded from the definition 1 the forgiveness of amounts owed for inaccu rate or mistakenly performed tests and procedures or correction of minor billing errors and 2 the provision of items used solely to collect transport process or store specimens or order or communicate the results of tests in addition there is an exclusion for pa yments made by an insurer or self insured plan to physician to satisfy claim submitted on feeforservice basis for the furnishing of health services by that physician to an individual covered by policy with that insurer or selfinsured plan the following requirements must be met for this exclusion 1 the services may not be furnished and the payment may not be made pursuant to contract or ot her

the payment is set in advance does not exceed fair market value and is unrelated directly or indirectly to the volume or va lue of referrals and 4 the payment meets any other requirements imposed by the secretary to prevent abusehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32494crs19 regulations an under arrangements cont ract between hospital and an entity providing dhs under arrangements to the hospital is considered compensation arrangement an arrangement consisting solely of items excluded from the definition of remuneration is not considered compensation arrangement direct compensation arrangement exis ts if remuneration passes between the referring physician or immediate family member and the entity furnishing the dhs without any intervening persons or entities an indirect compensation arrangement exists if 1 there exists between the referring physician and the entity an unbroke n chain of persons or entities that have financial relationships between them 2 the aggregate compensation of the referring physician or immediate family from the person or entity with which the physician has direct financial relati onship must vary with or take into account the volume or value of referrals or other business generated for the dhs entity and 3 the dhs entity must have actual knowledge of or act in reck less disregard or deliberate ignorance of the fact that the referring physician receives aggregate compensation that varies with the volume or value of re ferrals or other busin ess generated for the dhs entity phase iii of the regulations adds new stand in the shoes provision which means that some arrangements previously considered indirect compensation are now defined as direct compensation and must comply with the direct compensation rules specifically physician is deemed to have direct compensation arrangement with an entity furnishing dhs if the only intervening entity is his or her physician organization the physician is deemed to stand in the shoes of the physician organization for purposes of the definition of indirect compensation arrangement physician will be deemed to stand in the shoes of the physician organization with which he or she has direct financial relationship when physician stands in the shoes of his or he r physician organization he or she is deemed to have the same compensation arrangement with the same parties and on the same terms as the physician organization has with the dhs entity the term parties refers to the physician organization and all of its physician members employees and independent contractors in the preamble to the phase iii regulations cms noted that many existing arrangements may have been properly structured to comply with the indirect compensation excep tion it stated that it was not the intent to require that those arrangements be reexamined and revised therefore the regulations grandfather in those arrangements meeting the indirect compensation exception as of september 5 2007 the pub lication date of phase iii during the original term or current renewal term of the arrangement the regulation states that physicians compensati on from bona fide employer or under managed care contract or other contract for personal services may be conditioned on the physicians referral to particular provider practitioner or supplier provided that the compensation arra ngement is set in advance is consistent with fair market value which may include unitbased or timebased compensation otherwise complies with general or co mpensation exception as discussed below and complies with certain conditions ensuri ng patient choice insurers choice and physicians independe nt medical judgmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32494crs20 fair market value law the law defines fair market value as the value in an arms length transaction consistent with general market value in th case of rentals or leases it includes the value of the rental property fo r general purposes in the case of leased space the value is not adjust ed to reflect the additional value the prospective lessee or lessor would attribute to the proximity to the lessor where the lessor is potential source of patient referrals regulations general market value is defined as the price that an asset would bring or the compensation that would be included in service agreement as result of bona fide bargaining between wellin formed buyers and sellers who were not otherwise in position to generate busine ss for the other party usually the fair market price is the price at which bona fide sa have been cons ummated for assets of like type quality and quantity phase ii regulations established safe rbor that specified that hourly payment for physicians professional service was to be considered fair market value if it was determined using one of two methodologie s this safe har bor was eliminated in phase iii in part b ecause the survey and other information upon which the methodologies relied were not readily available volume or value of referrals law number of exceptions in the comp ensation sections specify that the compensation not take into account the vol ume or value of referrals certain exceptions impose the further requirement that the compensation not take into account other business genera ted between the parties regulations the regulations permit timebased or unitbased payments even when the physician receiving the payment has generated the payment through dhs referral provided the payment is set at fair market value at the inception of the arrangement and does not subsequently chan ge during the term of the arrangement in any manner that takes into account dhs referrals for those exceptions that prohibit taking into account other busine ss generated between the

may be paid share of the overall profits of the group or productivity bonus based on personally performed services or services incident to such services so long as the share or bonus is not termined in any manner which is directly related to the volume or value of the physicians referrals the law also specifies that faculty practice plans operated by hospital an institution of higher education or medical sc hool with an approved medical residence training program fall within the definition of group practice only for services provided within the faculty practice plan regulations the regulations specify that the practice must consist of single legal entity operating primarily for the pur pose of being physician group practice in any organizational form recognized by the state including but
