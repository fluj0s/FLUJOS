summit at riga 2006 background since the collapse of the berlin wall the european threat environment has changed dramatically nato longer needs static layered defense of ground forces to repel largescale soviet i nvasion instead the alliance must address new and different threats for which nato would face far less warning time yet more complex circumstances than conventional assau lt these might include terrorism weapons of mass destruction proliferation and ethnic strife as conf licts from the balkans to afghanistan have demonstrated the alliance must be able to prepare for security contingencies requiring the rapid deployment of more agile fo rces distant from the treaty area during natos air war against yugoslavia in the spring of 1999 us aircraft flew disproportionately large share of the combat sorties the kosovo action exposed great disparity in defense capabilities between the united states and its allies that gap along with the transformation of the overall threat

initiative preparing for future challenges by frank boland nato review summer 1999two parallel and it was hoped complementary tran satlantic security initiatives aimed at among other things bridging the technology gap between us and european forces the balkans conflicts of the 1990s motivated the european union eu to speed the construction of european fense arm called the european security and defense policy esdp one aspect of esdp is the development of rapid reaction forces to undertake several military tasksincludi ng humanitarian and rescue missions peacekeeping and crisis management in which other countries including th united states might choose not to participate to achieve this the eu states in 1999 set forth headline goals for creating 60000strong crisis management for ce that would be deployable within two months and sustainable for one year in 2004 brussels announced the planned formation of 13 1500troop battle groups that w ould be available for rapid deployment to crisis areas also that year the eu created the european defense agency intended to help coordinate the development of european defense capabilities in january 2007 the eu stated that the battlegroups were fully operational1 the other significant change occurred at natos washington dc summit in april 1999 when the alliance launched the defense capabilities initiative d ci the initiative was intended not only to improve natos ab ility to fulfill natos traditional article 5 collective defense commitments but also to prepare the alliance to meet emerging security challenges that may require va riety of types of missions both within and beyond nato territory to accomplish these ta sks the alliance must ensure that its troops have the appropriate quipment supplies transport communications and training accordingly dci aimed to improve nato core capabilities by listing 59 action items in five categories mobility and deployability sustainability and logistics effective engagement survivability and c onsultation command and control2 before long however analysts realized that dci was not meeting its goals because the changes that had been agreed to required most countries to increase their defense spending most however did not the aftermath of september 11 further highlighted allied military limitations visa vis the united states nato invoked artic 5 for the first time but during the subsequent war in afghanistan the united states initially relied mainly on its own military accepting only small tingents of special forces from handful of other countries allied combat and p eacekeeping forces entered the fray in larger numbers only after the taliban had been defeated analysts believe that the allies were not invited to contribute because they lacked many of th military capabilities air borne refueling air transport precisionguided munitions pg ms and night vision equipment necessary to conduct hightech campaign designed to achieve swift victory with minimum civilian and us casualties lack of interoperability was also an issue the 2002 prague summit enter pcc nato sought to address the perceive d problems of dci at its november 2002 meeting in prague by

september 11 in an effort to combat terrorism it emphasizes air lift secure communications pgms and protection against weapons of mass destruction nato officials point out however that p cc differs from dci in several important ways pcc is focused on smaller number of goals emphasizes multinational cooperation and specia lization requires specific commitme nts from member states and was designed with particular force in mind the nato response force nrf3 pcc calls for alliance members to make commitments to bolster their capabilities in eight specific areas 1 chemical biological radiological and nuclear defense 2 intelligence surveillance and target acquisition 3 airtoground surveillance ags 4 command control and communications 5 combat effectiveness 6 strategic air and sea lift 7 airtoair refueling and 8 deployable co mbat support and combat service support units pcc also places greater emphasis on multinational commitments and pooling of funds than did dci this enables smaller countries to combine resources to purchase hardware that would be unaffordable for each alone the netherlands for example volunteered to lead group of countries buyin g conversion kits to transform conventional bombs into pgms germany managed consortium that will acquire strategic air transport capabilities while spain headed anot her group that would l ease tanker aircraft norway and denmark coordinate d procurement of sealift asse ts the czech republic has concentrated on countering the effects of ch emical biological ra diological and nuclear cbrn weapons4 in addition pcc recognizes the va lue of role specialization or niche capabilities this concept is especially important to the new member states romania for example can offe r alpine troops hungary has skilled engineering corps on call and the czech and slovak republics ve units trained in counter ing the effects of chemical and biological weapons pcc is also much more specific in its requirements of commitments than was dci defense officials argue that dci was loaded down with too many vague requirements and that many countries contented themselves by picking the lowhanging fruit acquiring the

missions they also urged some nations to reorient their national resources toward investments in deployable capabilities finally the leaders approved the creation of nato active layered theater ballistic missile defense program as an impor tant element of force protection5 in the final communiqué of their nove mber 2006 riga summit nato leaders stated their intention to continue building on thei r work on capabilities at prague and istanbul after describing the status of several alliance missions they declared that force adaptation and support for expeditionary operations shoul d proceed and laid out pareddown list of key activities they noted that progress toward one major goal beefed up airlift capacity had been achieved through two coope rative initiatives 1 th strategic airlift interim solution under whic h several countries committe d to buying airbus a400m cargo planes by 2010 have in the interim chartered antonov transporters from ukraine and 2 the creation of nato strategic ai rlift capability under wh ich 15 member states and one partner sweden agreed to pool funds to purchase thr ee or four c17 aircraft the planes will be staffed by international crews and will be available for nato eu or other international operations military or humanitarian the communiqué also reported progress on key capabilities in other areas including special operations networking intelligence sharing ags missile defense and anticbrn capabilities6 the 2008 bucharest summit declaration did not mention pcc but referred instead to the more general comprehensive political guidance agreed to at riga the guidance provides framework and political direc tion for natos continuing transformation setting out for the next 10 to 15 years the priorities for all alliance capability issues planning disciplines and intelligence in light of nato missions particularly in afghanistan the bucharest declaration also stressed the urgency of acquiring specific capabilities such as strategic and intratheater airlift and communications and pointed toward possible future nato missile defense system it also once more encouraged member states to bolster defense

the past decade betw een 1992 nd 1999 defense expenditures by european nato countries fell 22 although the united states also cu t back on defense during that period it still spends much higher share of gdp on defe nse than most other nato countries and has boosted defense outlays significantly in r ecent years while france and the uk have increased their spending germany with th secondlargest military in the alliance has drastically reduced its military budget8 most assessments of the progress of pcc are classified late2005 nato parliamentary assembly npa report noted that it was difficult to gauge the progress of pcc because of incomplete information mainly stemming from lack of transparency on force goals of member states neverthele ss the study noted progress in several areas including sealift anticbrn and in equipping aircraft with pgms in april 2008 another npa report providing an overview of the curre nt state of play of efforts to improve alliance capabilities it highlighted othe r initiatives nato has undertaken to acquire expeditionary assets singling out in particular airlift special forces and information superiority noting that operations in afghanistan are serving as the principal driver for capability requirements today it also reemphasized the continuing utility of asset pooling and specialized niche capabilities9 reading between the lines of nato publications and statements some analysts sense that there have been real improveme nts in boosting capabilities for example at their june 2005 meeting nato defense ministers issued communiqué stating that pcc had brought some improvements in capabilities but critical deficiencies persist particularly in support for our deployed forces one year later however the ministers statement was more sanguine noting progre ss in number of areas and indicating that they had provided further guidance on the way ahead shortly before the riga summit the alliance issued media summit guide sta ting that by the end of 2008 over 70 per cent of the 460 or so pcc commitments made by allies will have been fulfilled most of the remainder will be completed by 2009 and beyond howe ver 2008 national defense university study characterized the results of pcc as mixed10 range of views the riga final communiqué noted that nato is involved in six missions and operations on three continents some analysts conclude that the capabilities debate has increasingly been driven by the experience of nato forces in these missions as military leaders assess their earlier goals in light of actual operations especially in afghanistan this is particularly the case with special forces and with strategic lift which one observerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21659crs6 11 assessing nato transformati on by mario

capabilities in addition us nato ambassador victoria nuland has noted that increased operational tempo demonstrates the need for greater spending on new military assets11 because nato operates under consensus ru the fact that the alliance adopted both dci and pcc implies that all member states agreed to the need to strengthen capabilities of an expeditionary nature some critics however have questioned the two initiatives arguing that nato already enjoyed vastly superior tec hnological prowess vis àvis countries other than the united stat and that the alliances military capabilities whatever their shortcomings are more than sufficient to address any threat others are skeptical of the possible motives behind the push for more advanced capabilities they contend that massive defense spending increases are unnecessary and wasteful and that pcc merely serves to boost sales for high technology arms and equipment manufacturers finally some analysts have challenged the significance of the capabilities gap between the united states and its nato allies12 supporters meanwhile also ve expressed reservations some question whether member states particularly the europeans will approve sufficient f unding in their defense budgets to make the required changes this has increasingly been the case for countries that have made significan t contributions to overseas nato missions particularly in afghanistan unless military budgets are increased substantially the costs of deployment maintenance and equipment replacemen t will likely displace expenditures for modernization it has also been suggested that the capabilities re quirements effectively raise the bar for new members of the alliance finally some analysts insist that dci and pcc need to be viewed in the context of the traditional debate over nato burdensharing shortly after the prague summit jiri sedivy director of pragues institute of in ternational relations noted that people talk about new members like the czech republic not contributing enough to nato but what they dont realize is that the western european s have failed to keep their promises since the 1950s13 by focusing on specific agreedupon military capability requirements the alliance hopes to endrun this decadesold problem
