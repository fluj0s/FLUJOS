traditional ira roth ira or an employersponsored retirement plan receive credit that reduces the amount of income tax they owe the maximum credit is the sser of 1000 or the amount of tax that would have been owed without the credit th amount of the credit declines as income increases in 2008 for individuals with adjusted gross incomes agi under 16000 and married couples with incomes under 32000 th credit is 50 of contributions up to 2000 for maximum credit of 1000 see table 1 because the credit is based on agi it increases the net benefit of contributing to retirement plan for example married couple filing jointly with inco of 32000 who contribute 2000 to 401k plan would reduce their taxable income to 30000 and qualify for 1000 tax credit the net effect is that the 2000 contributi

worker or spouse receives preretirement distribution from retirement plan such as hardship withdrawal any credit taken in that same year and in the two subsequent years will be reduced by the amount of the distribu tion for example if an individual took 1000 hardship withdrawal in 2005 and qualif ied for 500 credit for that year 500 of the hardship withdrawal would offset th 500 credit in 2005 the remaining 500 of the hardship withdrawal would offset any cr edits up to 500 in 2006 and 2007 because it is nonrefundable some familie s may not benefit from the re tirement savings tax credit because they have net inco tax liability also the cr edit may not be large enough to provide savings incentive for families with incomes near the upper limits for families in the highest income bracket that qualifies for the credit the maximum credit is 200 for contribution of 2000 on the ot her hand families that increase their saving to claim the retirement savings credit and who are eligible for the earned income tax credit eitc may increase the amount of the eitc for which they qualify data from the irs indicate that the retirement savings tax credit was claimed on about 53
