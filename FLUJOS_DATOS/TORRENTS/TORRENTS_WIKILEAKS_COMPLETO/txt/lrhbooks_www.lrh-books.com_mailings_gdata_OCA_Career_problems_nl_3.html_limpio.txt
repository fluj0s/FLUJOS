bridge publications inc newsletter what does the entire structure of civilization depend on another thing we know is that men are not dispensable it is mechanism of old philosophies to tell men that if they think they are indispensable they should go down to the graveyard and take look those men were indispensable too this is the sheerest foolishness if you really looked carefully in the graveyard you would find the machinist who set the models going in yesteryear and without whom there would be industry today it is doubtful if such feat is being performed just now workman is not just workman laborer is not just laborer an office worker is not just an office worker they are living breathing important pillars on which the entire structure of our civilization is erected they are not cogs in mighty machine they are the machine itself l ron hubbard this excerpt was taken from the book the problems of work by l ron hubbard success in the workaday world when i first reviewed the project description i was frankly dismayed i didnt see how we could finish the job in the time we had my personnel hadnt ever handled anything like this and none of us had the training or experience needed to deal with some aspects of the work to make matters worse we had just finished another major project and were still recovering from the organizational strain it had involved after swimming in the initial confusion of how on earth are we going to do this i realized that it was confusion an awfully simple realization but my eyes were opened to the means to deal with the matter i knew i first had to find single stable datum from there i would handle one thing then another and another and somehow carry off the whole project resisting the feeling that i had to handle everything at once in mad rush i looked over some of the most important points that had to be solved to get the project rolling and chose one as the point to be settled first who would be in charge of one particular phase of the production just doing this was relief at least there was one firm thing there i could concentrate on i reviewed the possible personnel named one for the job and briefed him on his responsibilities now i not only had one bit of the confusion out of the way i also had someone to help deal with the rest of it without going into all the details of what came after we took one point at time and handled it how would these raw materials be gotten who would be in charge of this function and that how were we going to make sure loose ends went by unnoticed and unhandled and so on and so on nailing down one detail after another pushing forward actual production all the while the confusion was under control and we were getting somewhere it was by means an easy job and not without its share of shouting matches and near disasters but we kept our sanity and managed to finish the project we also gained new stable data from the experience which im sure will make future projects go lot more smoothly executive this person used the data contained in the problems of work click here for more information or to purchase your copy confusion and the stable datum based on the chapter handling the confusions of the workaday world as published in the book the problems of work by l ron hubbard confusion can be defined as any set of factors or circumstances which do not seem to have any immediate solution more broadly confusion is random motion if you were to stand in heavy traffic you would be likely to feel confused by all the motion whizzing around you if you were to stand in heavy storm with leaves and papers flying by you would be likely to be confused is it possible to actually understand confusion is there any such thing as an anatomy of confusion yes there is if as switchboard operator you had ten calls hitting your board at once you might feel confused but is there any answer to the situation if as shop foreman you have three emergencies and an accident all at the same time you might feel confused but is there any answer to that confusion is only confusion so long as all particles are in motion confusion is only confusion so long as factor is clearly defined or understood confusion is the basic cause of stupidity to the stupid all things except the very simple ones are confused thus if one knew the anatomy of confusion matter how bright one might be he would be brighter if you have ever had to teach some ambitious young person who was not too bright you will understand this well you attempt to explain how such and so works you go over it and over it and over it and then you turn him loose and he promptly makes complete botch of it he didnt understand he didnt grasp it you can simplify your understanding of his misunderstanding by saying very rightly he was confused ninetynine percent of all education fails when it fails on the grounds that the student was confused and not only in the realm of the job but in life itself when failure approaches it is born one way or another from confusion to learn of machinery or to live life one has to be able either to stand up to confusion or to take it apart we have in scientology certain doctrine principle about confusion it is called the doctrine of the stable datum confusion exists when all particles are in motion if you saw great many pieces of paper whirling about room they would look confused until you picked out one piece of paper to be the piece of paper by which everything else was in motion in other words confusing motion can be understood by conceiving one thing to be motionless in stream of traffic all would be confusion unless you were to conceive one car to be motionless in relation to the other cars and so to see others in relation to the one the switchboard operator receiving ten calls at once solves the confusion by labeling correctly or incorrectly one call as the first call to receive her attention the confusion of ten calls all at once becomes less confusing the moment she singles out one call to be answered the shop foreman confronted by three emergencies and an accident needs only to elect his first target of attention to start the cycle of bringing about order again until one selects one datum one factor one particular in confusion of particles the confusion continues the one thing selected and used becomes the stable datum for the remainder it becomes less confusing when one item is singled out and becomes the stable datum for the remainder any body of knowledge more particularly and exactly is built from one datum that is its stable datum invalidate it and the entire body of knowledge falls apart stable datum does not have to be the correct one it is simply the one that keeps things from being in confusion and on which others are aligned now in teaching an ambitious young man to use machine he failed to grasp your directions if he did because he lacked stable datum one fact had to be brought home to him first grasping that he could grasp others one is stupid then or confused in any confusing situation until he has fully grasped one fact or one item confusions matter how big and hard to overcome they may seem are composed of data or factors or particles they have pieces grasp one piece and locate it thoroughly then see how the others function in relation to it and you have steadied the confusion and relating other things to what you have grasped you will soon have mastered the confusion in its entirety in teaching boy to run machine dont throw torrent of data at him and then point out his errors thats confusion to him that makes him respond stupidly find some entrance point to his confusion one datum tell him this is machine it may be that all the directions were flung at someone who had real certainty real order of existence this is machine you say then make him sure of it make him feel it fiddle with it push at it this is machine tell him and youd be surprised how long it may take but youd be surprised as well how his certainty increases out of all the complexities he must learn to operate it he must know one datum first it is not even important which datum he first learns well beyond that it is better to teach him simple basic datum you can show him what it does you can explain to him the final product you can tell him why he has been selected to run this machine but you must make one basic datum clear to him or else he will be lost in confusion confusion is uncertainty confusion is stupidity confusion is insecurity when you think of uncertainty stupidity and insecurity think of confusion and youll have it down pat what then is certainty lack of confusion what then is intelligence ability to handle confusion what then is security the ability to go through or around or to bring order to confusion certainty intelligence and security are lack of or ability to handle confusion how does luck fit into confusion luck is the hope that some uncontrolled chance
