since the september 11 2001 attacks there s been increasing interest in terrorist financing following the attacks the administration stated its goal of starving the terrorists of funding and shutting down th institutions that support or facilitate terrorism1 in the months immediately following the attacks significant amount of funds were frozen intern ationally after this initial swee p the freezing of terrorist assets slowed down considerably as of nove mber 2002 estimates indicated that of the roughly 121 million in terrorist assets frozen worldwide more than 80 were blocked in the first three months following the attacks2 over the next year and half an additional 80 million has been ized bringing the current total frozen to roughly 200 million3 while separating terrorist organizations from their assets will continue to be major component of the campaign against terrorism many have questioned the feasibility of thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21902crs2 4 see general

center in contrast trying to starve the terrorists of money said the commission is like trying to cat ch one kind of fish by draining the ocean final report of the national commission on terrorist atta cks upon the united states july 2004 p 382goal the slowdown in the amounts frozen re flects numerous changes in how qaeda and other terrorist groups finance their activitie s terrorist organizations are increasingly relying on informal methods of money tr ansfer and regional cells have begun independently generating funds through criminal activity4 in response to these changes the na tional commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states also known as the 9 11 commission an independent bipartisan commission created by congressional legisla tion and president bush has recommended that the us government shift the focus of its efforts to counter terrorist financing from strategy based on seizing terrorist assets to strategy based on exploiting intelligence gathered from financial inves tigations according to the commission the united states should expect less from trying to dry up rrorist money and more from following the money for intelligence as tool to hunt rrorists understand their networks and disrupt their operations5 according to commission chairman thomas kean right now we have been spending lot of energy in the g overnment trying to dry up sources of funding when it only costs 400000 to 500000 to pull ff an operation like 911 well never dry up money but by using the money trail we may be able to catch some of these things terrorist plots and break them up kean further asserted obviously if you can dry up money you dry it up but we believe one thing we didnt do effectively is follow the money thats what we have to do6 while the goals of freezing terrorist funds and tracking them for intelligence7 are not mutually exclusive they tend to emphasize different strategies and approaches for example the fbi and other intelligence agencies have history of gathering intelligence by monitoring financial transactions and relationships over extended periods of time for example in its investigations of the mafia and then using laws against financial crimes to eventually arrest the perpetrators the department of the treas ury by contrast has traditionally favored freezing terro rist assets as soon as possibl each strategy reflects the agencys primary skills and capabilities according to treasury assistant secretary for terrorist financing and financial crime juan zarate i think we need to do everything the commission said with respect to the money trail but we also need to continue and frankly be even more vigor ous on attacking the sources because that affects the longterm ability of alqaeda to do all the nasty things we want to stop themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21902crs3 8 ibid 9 ibid 10 lauren shepherd nominees stalled by turf battle the hill june 9 2004 11 holy land foundati on muslim charity accused of aiding

doing8 this tension is echoed by jonath an winer former deputy assistant secretary of state for international law forcement under president bill clinton there is big ideological divide right now betw een the asset freezers and the people who want to follow the money as it changes hands th eres easy answer one way or another9 effectively combating terrorist financin g requires effective coordination of many different elements of national power including intelligence gathering financial regulation law enforcement and building international coalitions there are number of areas where jurisdiction is blurred according to one senior official10 according to most analysts interagency coopera tion is imperative to successfully combat this threat what is terrorist financing earning money the financial support of terro rism involves both earning funds through legal and illegal means and the illicit movement of money to terrorist groups it is important to note that in many cases charities being the main example funds transferred to terrorists are often raised legally and only acquire their relationship to terrorist financing through subsequent mo ney laundering in case currently under investigation on july 27 2004 the holy nd foundation for relief and development the largest muslim charity in the united states was indicted on charges it provided financial support to hamas an islamic terrorist group11 its finances had been frozen more than two years earlier in decembe r 2001 many of the organizations donors reported knowledge that their donations were being diverted to illegal activities in addition to charities apparently legitimate businesses whose profits go to terrorism are another means of earning funds finally terro rists have engaged in criminal activity such as drug trafficking and smuggling cigarette s or commodities as means of raising funds moving money for many years especially prior to the september 11 2001 attacks terrorists have exploited the formal banking sectors international reach and often weak regulation while the interna tional system is moving towards increased regulation of international banking there are many builtin impediments to regulatory and law enforcement cooperation for example dom estic laws and regula tions have allowed the united states to freeze large amounts of terrorist assets in banks located in us jurisdictions however the ability of th united states to fr eeze funds in other jurisdictions is limited the united states and other countries are working to make the international financial sector more secure from terrorist financin g abuses for example the federal reserve board recently fine d the us arm of ubs ag 100 million for funneling 5 billion to countries ch as cuba iran and libya12 riggs bank was finedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21902crs4 13 ibid 14 mohammed elqorchi hawala finance and development december 2002 p 31 15 ibid 25 million in may 2004 for failing to report unusual transactions13 the united states is also working with the financial action task force fatf and other international financial institutions to create new standards and best practices for the formal financial sector as governments have begun to crack down on terrorist abuse of the formal banking sector terrorists have increasingly turned to informal means in order to move money around these services are cheap er than formal banking or money transfer arrangements they can provide anonymity for all parties involved and they can reach countries where there is formal banking sector in some cases even arranging for hand delivery of the cash while most use these systems for legitimate purposes their lack of documentation and anonymous informal natu re make them attractive for money laundering andor terrorist financing purposes alternative remittance systems or more broadly informal value transfer systems ivts date back hundreds of years and were originally used to finance trade in regions where traveling with gold or othe r forms of payment was not safe14 the system goes by various names including hue vietnam feichien china phei kwan thailand hundi south asia or hui kuan hong kong the primary current network is the hawala system hawala means transfer in arabic in use in south asia and the middle east the primary users of the hawala system are emigrants in europe the persian gulf and north america who send remittances back to their family in south and east asia africa eastern europe and other regions15 the most basic hawala transfer would involve migrant going to hawaladar an ivts agent mostly likely located through an ethnic neighborhood and giving the agent money to send to someone abroad the agent will callfaxor email instructions to counterpart in the recipient country with instructions accounts may be ttled in multiple ways since the hawala system operates on trust nd often familial networ ks accounts between hawaladars can remain open and active for years before being settled settlement might occur simply with transfer in the opposite direction over or under i nvoicing of traded items through occasional wire transfers or some other bartering arrangement authorities have also noted the use of cash couriers to transport sums of money between terrorist operatives cash couriers are particul arly common in middle eastern and south asian countries with predominantly cash economies many of these countries have weak or formal financial system in many countries cross border currency transportation limits are relativ ely high or nonexistent can terrorist financing be stopped as the 911 commission has stressed the cost of terrorist attack is very small and the impediments to freezing money are many and varied collaboration between local state national and interna tional actors both private and public provides comprehensive response that can prevent terrorists from expl oiting gaps or weaknesses within the
