6110c12 shspec66 problems rockslams always take precedence over other needle phenomena rockslam is very badly overrun flow rise on the other hand means nothing because you dont know what turned it off its latent response to something that exceeded the pcs reality so you cant tell where it come from the rise means something it means the pc isnt going to confront something but you cant spot what so its not worth pursuing also the pc wouldnt respond to auditing of it anymore since its beyond his reality sometimes when the pc has an arc break all the needle will do is rise when you get ruds in the needle wont rise much note that on running problems intensive you get the problem before the change it can turn out to be problem hes had for hundreds or millions of years so dont ask for the confusion before the problem you want the confusion before the thislifetime change you must realize that the only reason that people move slowly and get parked on the track or anything else is that problems become timeless the timelessness of problems composed the reactive mind people and organizations are slow he degree that they have problems they cant solve they are inactive to the degree that they have problems they cant solve most of their actions are reactive every new action adds into the old problem to the point of feeling it doesnt matter what we do also the magnitude of the problem can make any other nonconnected thing seem very trivial other peoples reality is viewed apathetically since hes so overwhelmed that he cant look at it matter how immediate it is such people react to everything in life this way its an apparent apathy which is apathy toward life the person being in terrific agony about the problem he cant even articulate what the problem is if you ask him to take his attention off the problem he knows itll eat him up he has attention to spare for you or for auditing you often have pc who is escaping from present time by being in the past you can make mistake by believing hed audit better on his terminals line so you should skip ruds and any thislifetime difficulties and just go back on the line the pc is back on the line because its safer one of the symptoms of that is the pc who never gets picture pictures are dangerous they became dangerous at some time in the past possibly during session getting rudiments in on someone can turn on his pictures rudiments can show someone who has never had auditing that life is solvable at these little finite points its characteristic of pc who is in apathy that he has got to solve it all at once now move the apathy off and youll get the franticness they wont do the available auditing command youve given them theyll take it and make it something to resolve their whole case by one answer why because their whole track is collapsed the fact that problems are timeless and problems join to problems makes it all timeless explosive stratum and anything that explosive about which they worry that much must be solved explosively desperate solution for desperate problem which occurs at one point people look for one command one magic word which will make the pc go clear this becomes what the pc wants when he cant do any of the little things in desperation he will have to do one of the big ones auditing however is done by gradients it depends for success on reaching reality pc can tolerate getting to picture the pc can see at this moment of time in session what the pc really can do are little gradients youve got to find the gradient which is real to the pc something confrontable not the explosive right now effect there are people with frantic desire to have lots of money right now they may have fantastic schemes to get it very unworkable ones if you asked them how much money could you have and sorted it out on the meter youd find that while they said oh millions the amount that would be real to them would be farthing nickel something so small that they dont make that coin its the other side of the circle they think in terms of millions while they get poorer and poorer and poorer the case that has to have total change now and the case that makes change now are almost the same case the case that just sits there apathetically knows that there cant be big enough change or big enough effect right now to solve his problems so hes given up on the idea that anything is going to happen at all he has cancelled all this out he is on lower rung than that he cant have change because theres change tiny enough until you figure out what it is how did he get into this state by having problems that were so overwhelming that he must keep his attention on them all the time and he knows nothing could be done about them but they are terribly important but you have to do something about them but nothing can be done about them so that everything else in life is trivial including your auditing command your command has nothing to do with his problems unless you have his exact problem in which case your commands will have something to do with his case thats actually the only process that will work on him the whole of this problems intensive is to find where the pc is stuck and what problem hes looking at the trick is he doesnt know or he wouldnt be overwhelmed with it the problems he glibly tells you arent it proper assessment will get you the right one not one with lot of figurefigure and musthavebeen the clue to this is that hes figuring from different time band and the real problem is this moment in time the time band of the pc its now if the pc were looking at the problem he is stuck in he wouldnt say person who would have had that problem then because he is in then hes in that problem and other pc who is arc breaking or getting apathetic during goals or terminal assessment is doing it because youre taking his attention off the only thing its safe to keep it on which is the problem hes stuck in if his ruds are very well in and he has lot of confidence in the auditor you can do it and hell feel fine but he still has his attention on the problem now when you try to run his prehav level on the terminal it takes too much attention so he puts that on via so he can keep his attention on the problem he is arc breaky and gets upset or hes apathetic and just grinds if hes lower on the scale in this case hell be running with his attention at monotone because most of his attention is glued to problem so horrendous that if it were solved the whole universe would blow up its even too much effort to say what the problem is so it all operates as withhold every time you have an arc breaky pc you have violated to some degree fixation of attention on problems youve asked him to do something he doesnt consider safe and he is protesting having his attention shifted if someone is in this state you have to work like mad to keep his attention centered where it is centered and not shift it around so its about the hottest thing you can do with case to give problems intensive were getting the backtrack problems which slide up and become pt problems of long duration the problems which underlie the hidden standards and the prior confusions which made the hidden and the problems necessary it works because you are putting his attention where it already is so it goes easily auditors blame themselves because pcs arc break so if you can get certainty as an auditor on exactly why session goes wrong and see the exact mechanism and its magnitude exactly when and why session detours if you can see that the pcs attention is fixated on problem of great importance to degree that any shift of attention causes him to go through this arc break phenomenon you will see that all you have done is to disturb his attention you very often have been running pcs with ptps without recognizing any part of it very often pc has unknowingly to himself stated his problem to you many times and you have never heard it as problem so you go ahead and solve it problem is problem it is what the pc is worried about and feels he has to do something about or that he cant do anything about auditing the problems intensive he may give it to you again and youll suddenly recognize it as problem dont feel silly about it but do recognize that there arent problems which should be solved as opposed to being run as far as ptps of long duration are concerned furthermore the problem you think you see some usual problem may well not be the problem at all eg the instructor who has problem with students that turns out to be the problem of not believing auditors can audit including his present auditor so how could he get auditing problems about scientology are of the order of magnitude of withholds on the subject of scientology in terms of stopping case gain the fact that hes in session acts to restimulate the withhold or the problem and everything you are doing restimulated it dont solve his problem about auditing by giving him more or better auditing the pc has ptp and will behave like case with one matter what you do to solve it
