policy toward direct investment with some exceptions for national security8 the united states has long been considered one of the most receptive ec onomies in the world to foreign direct investment indeed over the past 50 ears the united states has led efforts to negotiate internationally for reduced restri ctions on foreign direct investment for greater controls over incentives offered to foreign investors and for equal treatment under law of foreign and dom estic investors in 1977 the carter administration issued policy statement on foreign direct investment that can be summarized by the neutrality clause the united states will neither encourage nor discourage the inflow or outflow of international investment the policy statement also indicated that international investment will generally re sult in the most efficient allocation of economic resources if it is allowed to flow according to market forces there is basis for concluding that general policy of actively promoting or discouraging international investment w ould further the us national interest unilateral us government intervention in the international investment process could prompt counteractions by other governments with adverse effects on the us economy and us foreign policy and the united states has an important interest in seeking to assure that blished investors receive equitable and non discriminatory treatment from host governments9 this statement is based on an assessment that the free flow of international investment generally will result in the most efficient allocation of economic resources if it is allowed to flow according to market forces during the reagan administration the neutrality statement wa s clarified to include three related objectives these objectives include the lib eralization of barri ers and the reduction of distortions to international investments abroad the encouragement of greater role for private foreign investment in the economic

agreement could have created legal probl ems for state and local governments that enforce environmental labor and other co rporate practices that could have been considered discriminatory on may 10 2007 president bush released his policy statement on open economies12 the statement offered strong support for the international flow of direct investment in part the statement reads free and open

premium on the protection of us investments abroad the united states opposes measures that distort in ternational investment flows including traderelated or other performance requirements discriminatory treatment of foreign investment and expropriation without compensa tion in turn when countries promise to protect investment and eliminate such distortions investors must have the

the public disclosure that dubai ports world15 was attempting to purchase the britishowned po ports16 with operations in various us ports after the september 11th terrorist attacks congress passed nd president bush signed the usa patriot act of 2001 uniting and st rengthening america by providing appropriate tools requi red to intercept and obstruct terrorism17 in this act congress provided for special support for cr itical industries which it defined as systems and assets whether physical or virtual so vital to the united states that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have debilitating impact on security national economic security national public health or safety or any combination of those matters18 this broad definition is enhanced to so degree by other provisions of the act which specifically identify certain sectors of the economy that are likely candidates for consideration as critical infrastructure these sectors include telecommunications energy financial rvices water transportation sectors19 and the cyber and physical infrastructure services critical to maintaining the national defense continuity of government economic prosperity and quality of life in the united states20 the following year congress adopt ed the language in the patriot act on critical infrastructure into the homeland security act of 200221 by adopting the terms critical infrastructure and homeland security following the events of september 11 2001 congress demonstrated that the attacks fundamentally altered the way many policymakers view the concept of national

demonstrated that there was difference between the postseptember 11 expectations held by many in congress about the role of foreign investment in the economy and of economic infrastructure issu as component of national security and the operations of cfius for some members of congress cfius seemed to be out of touch with the postseptember 11 2001 view of national security because it remains founded in the late 1980s orientation of the exonflorio provision which views national security primarily in term s of national defense and downplays or even excludes broader notion of economic national security special security arrangements much of the recent debate concerning foreign direct investment in the us economy has focused on the activities of th committee on foreign investment in the united states and on the exonflorio pr ovision the cfius process however is just one of three major provisions of law th at authorize the review of foreign direct investment transactions fo r their impact on the economy the national industrial security program and the critical industries provisions of various statutes also require that foreign direct investment transacti ons be reviewed generally the reviews mandated by these three provisions operate independently although at times they have overlapped the provisions illustrate the complexities involved in defining most economic activities which can span broad range of ec onomic activities and fields most economic activities affect va rious sectors and segments of the economy in ways that defy narrow definition nd complicate efforts to distinguish those economic activities that are related to the broad rubric of national security or to national economic security which is even less clearly defined strategic material s

ownership of the worlds largest producer of neo powder composed of neodymium iron and boron to produce neo magnets22 the strategic materials protection boar d was mandated by title v iii of the j ohn

and published report in september 2007 of that meeting at that meeting the board determined that the term materials critical to national security would mean strategic materials critical to national

administrative changes activity within congress and the intense public and congressional reaction that arose from the proposed dubai ports world acquisition spurred the bush administration in late 2006 to make an important adminis trative change in the way cfius reviews foreign investment tran sactions cfius and president bush approved the acquisition of lucent technolog ies inc by the frenchbased alcatel sa which was completed on december 1 2006 before the transaction was approved by cfius however alcatellucen t was required to agree to national security arrangement known as special security arrangement or ssa that restricts alcatels access to sensitive work done by lucents research arm bell labs and the communications infrastru cture in the united states the most controversial feature of this arrangement is that it allows cfius to reopen review of the deal and to overturn its approval at any time if cfius believes the companies materially fail to comply with the terms of the arrangement this marks significant change in the cfius pro cess prior to this transaction cfius review or investigation had b een portrayed and had been c onsidered to be final as result firms were willing to subject themselves voluntarily to cfius review because they believed that once an inve stment transaction was scrutinized and approved by the members of cfius the firm s could be assured that the investment transaction would be exempt from any future reviews or actions this administrative change however means that cfius determination may longer be final decision and

if any additional budgetary resources may be necessary to acco mplish the goals of this initiative according to the ita attracting foreign direct investment to the us economy is important for the following reasons foreign direct investment creates jobs in the economy the us affiliates of foreign companies employ 55 million us workers it boosts wages because the us ffiliates of foreig n

procedures by requiring cfius to investigate all foreign investment transacti ons in which the foreign pe rson is owned or controlled by foreign government regardless of the na ture of the business foreign investors may regard this approach as an important policy change by the united states toward foreign investment previously foreign i nvestment transactions were presumed to be acceptable and to provide positive cont ribution to the economy as result of this presumption the burden was on the memb ers of cfius to pr ove that particular transactions threaten national security foreign investors however might view pl 11049 as reversing previous policy because it shifts the burden onto firms to prove that they are not threat to national security because they are owned or controlled by foreign government although the number of investment transactions year in which the foreign investor is associated with foreign government is small compared with the total number of foreign investme nt transactions foreign investors and foreign governments likely will view this as significant change in the traditional us approach to foreign investment pl 11049 also increases the role of congressional oversight by requiring greater reporting by cfius on its actions either during or after it completes reviews and investigations and by increasing repor ting requirements on cfius the

federal government since the end of world war ii us policy toward direct investment has been one of neutrality by the federal government while leading international negotiations to reduce restrictions by other countries on us direct investment ab road at home the federal government has taken role in coordinating or regulating the activities of state and local governments as they have developed and carried out their individual approaches toward attracting foreign direct investment to their jurisdictions more than twothirds of state government and numerous local governments have developed their own initiatives to attract foreign investors to their jurisdictions indeed numerous jurisdictions have offere d foreign firms tax and financial incentives and they have competed against other juri sdictions for the investment dollars and jobs that accompany such foreign investment this conflict between the federal governments stance of neutrality relative to the aggressive actions of state and local governments in attracting foreign investment has been criticized by other foreign governments that question the value of entering into agreements with the federal government without being guaranteed th at the federal government will exercise control over the activities of state and local governments in addition various foreign government s have questioned the motives of us negotiators who have pressed them in international forums to eliminate the various tax and financial benefits they offer multinational firms to locate within their jurisdictions because they argue that such incentives distort the investment market at the same time they argue that the us federal government seemingly makes effort to curtail the considerable tax and financial incentives many state and local governments offer to win foreign investment commitments it is unclear how the invest in america initiative will coordinate with state and local governments that are accustomed to operating on their own and to competing fiercely with one another in attracting foreign investors foreign direct investment in the us economy foreigners invest in the us economy in number of ways and for number of reasons these investments can be divided roughly into two broad categories portfolio investments or investments in corporate stocks and bonds and us government securities and direct investment or investments in us businesses and real estate in 2006 foreigners invest ed nearly 18 trillion dollars in the us economy 184 billion of which was in direct investment with the rest of the funds invested

of direct investment and it chairs the interagency committee on foreign investment in the united states which represents the president as the chief federal government organization responsible for overseeing the national security implications of foreign i nvestment in the economy27 the united states is widely recognized as the premier location for foreign firms to invest as evidenced by the data in table 1 according to the united nations world investment report the united states had received cumulative amount of 18 trillion in foreign direct investment by yearend 2006 40 more than the 11 trillion invested in the united kingdom the next single largest host to foreign direct investment and it accounted for 15 of the total cumulative amount of foreign direct investment among all nations the united st ates is also the largest foreign investor in the world with over 24 trillion invested aborad according to the report of the 125 tr illion in the total cumulative amount of foreign direct investment among all nations the most economically advanced developed economies were host to 70 of this amount from 1980 to 1990 this share increased sharply from 560 of total amount of foreign direct i nvestment to 79 from 1990 to 1995 the developed country share fell slightly to about 70 where it has stayed relatively stable over the past decade the costs and benefits of foreign direct investment generally economists concl ude that direct investme nt benefits both the home and the host country and that the benefits of such investment outweigh the costs some groups within the us economy how ever are concerned about the potentially negative effects of inward and outward di rect investment most economists argue that free and unimpeded international flows of capital such as direct investment positively affect both the domestic home and foreign host economies for the home country direct investment abroad benefits individua l firms because firms that invest abroad are better able to exploit their existing competitive advantages and are able to acquire additional skills and advantages this tends to further enhance the competitive position of these firms both at home and abroad and shifts the composition and distribution of employme nt within the economy toward the most productive and efficient firms and aw ay from the less productive firms

contributes to international trade and integration into the global trading community since most firms that invest abroad are established multinational firms31 on the cost side critics of foreign investment argue that some us firms may invest abroad and thereby shift some resources from activities within the united states in order to take advantage of abundant natural resources lowcost labor or relaxed environmenta l and labor laws32 indeed about onethird of us direct investment abroad is in developing countries where economic conditions are markedly different from those in the united states or in many parts of europe in some cases firms that invest abroad ma shift production from the united states to foreign location from which it might export back to the united states products that it previously had produced in the united stat but this does not seem to be major activity of the foreign affiliates of us firms such offshoring of production or globalization has grown over the last d ecade as many developing economies have dropped formal restrictions on foreign inves tment but much of this investment seems to be geared toward producing for the cal market or for exports to

less than 4 of all us manufacturing establishments they ve 14 more value added on average and 15 higher value of shipments than other manufacturers the average plant size for foreignowned firms is much larger five times than for us firms on average in similar industries this difference in pl ant size apparently rises from an absence of small plants among those that are foreig nowned as result of the larger plant scale and newer plant age foreignowned firms paid wages on average that were 14 higher than all us manufacturing firms had 40 higher productivity per worker and 50 greater output per worker than the average of comparable usownedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33984crs18 manufacturing plants foreignowned firms also display higher capital intensity in larger number of industries th an all us establishments differences between foreignowned firm s and all us firms should be viewed with some caution first the two groups of firms are not strictly comparable the group of foreignowned firms comprises subs et of all foreign firms which includes primarily very large firms the group of u s firms includes all firms spanning broader range of sizes secondly the diffe rences reflect range of additional factors including the prospect that foreign firms which invest in the united states likely are large firms with proven technologies or tec hniques they have succe ssfully transferred to the united states small foreign ventures experimenting with unproven technologies are unlikely to want the dded risk of investing overseas foreign investors also tend to opt for larger scale and higher capitalintensity plants than the average us firm to offset the risks inhe rent in investing abroad and to generate higher profits to make it economical to manage an operation far removed from the parent firm most economists conclude that foreig n investment benef its the host economy because such investment adds permanently to the capital stock of the economy and increases the total amount of capital in th economy while these conclusions seem generally to be true they probably should be tempered so mewhat relative to foreign direct investment in the united states the data in table 3 show the inflows and outflows of capital in the us economy over the past eight years that are associated with direct investment the data indicate that firms can raise funds in three different ways they can borrow it from the parent company as an intercompany debt transfer they can raise the funds in the domestic economy in the form of equity capital or they can raise their funds internally from profits generated by the firm and used as reinvested earnings the data in table 3 indicate that over the eightyear period 19992006 8 of the funds foreign firms used to invest in us businesses came from the foreign parent company in the form of intercompa ny debt the rest of the funds foreign investors used to invest in us businesses was raised in the united states not imported from abroad

foreign direct investment n the us economy however the employment picture is somewhat unclear while foreign direct investme nt on the whole does support and contribute to existing employment in the

three ways by adding to current investments by establis hing new venture termed greenfield investment or by acquiring an exis ting us business the data in table 4 exclude additions to employment that can be acc ounted for by ongoing foreignowned firms and focus on us businesses that are acqui red or are newly established by foreign investors the data in table 4 also indicate that durin g the

foreign firms that currently are operating in the united states it is likely that such acquisitions help to sustain the level of employment of the acquired firms but it is difficult to estimate how much new employment is added to the economy as result of the extensive role foreign acquisitions play in the economy it also is unclear what longterm impact these acquisitions are having on employment among the acquired firms in some cases foreign firms may use their acquisitions as springboard to expand their operations and therefore their employment in the united states in othe r circumstances

respectively in both cases the number of deals and the value of those deals dropped between 2000 and 2002 for both us and foreign firms before activity rebounded after 2002 such similarities in the acquisition ac tivity of us and foreign firms seem to be counter intuitive in that those forces that draw us firms to invest abroad should theoretically be separate from those factors that draw foreign firms to invest in the united states in some respects foreign investment in the united states and us investment abroad should operate as substitutes so that both us and foreign firms would be expected to invest in the united states when the us economic growth rate was strong relative to other dvanced economies and both us and foreign firms would be expected to invest elsewhere when the relative rate of us economic growth was weak instead us investment abroad is strong when foreign investment in the united states is strong and us investment abroad is weak when foreign investment in the united states is weak the two trends likely reflect the impact the us economy has on the global economy and par ticularly on western europe where much of the us overseas investment nd acquisition activity is concentrated as result when the rate of economic growth in the united states is strong foreign firms are drawn to invest in us busine sses in addition the stronger rate of economic growth
