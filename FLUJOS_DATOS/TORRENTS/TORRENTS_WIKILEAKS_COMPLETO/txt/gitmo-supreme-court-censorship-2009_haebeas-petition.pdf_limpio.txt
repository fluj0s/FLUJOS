who has now been held for almost eight years at guantanamo bay cuba after being apprehended by bounty hunters in afghanistan where he was shopkeeper living with his afghani wife and then infant child in july 2007 alghizzawi filed an original habeas petition with this court docket 076827 that petition was denied without prejudice on june 27 2008 after this courts decision in boumediene v bush 553 us 128 s ct 2229 2008 wi 2369628 2008 us lexis 4887 2008 subject to proceeding andor for refilling in the united states district court for the district of columbiaas alghizzawi had habeas petition filed and pending in the district court since 2005 he was not required to refile docket 052378 immediately upon filing his habeas petition in 2005 the petition was stayed by 4 unclassifieoiifor public release unclassifiedjlfor public release the district court pending decisions from this court and the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit that stay was not lifted until november 2008 and as further described below new stay was entered by the district court in may 2009 and to this day that stay has not been lifted despite numerous requests by ai ghizzawis counsel as further described below in addition in april 2007 ai ghizzawi filed petition under the detainee treatment act with the dc court of appeals docket 071089 which was held in abeyance from the time it was filed until this court entered its decision in boumediene as which time the circuit court dismissed that proceeding ostensibly because of the boumediene decision for lack of jurisdiction the district court stay of 2009 as mentioned above aighizzawis habeas case at the district court continued to languish until after election day of 2008 six months after this court ruled in boumediene in november 2008 the government was finally ordered to file return to the habeas petition pending and subsequently aighizzawi was allowed to seek limited discovery from the government in may of 2009 the government sought short stay by agreement in aighizzawis case so that its executive review task force could conduct review of his file counsel for aighizzawi agreed to that request in return for expedited consideration and in short order the executive branch determined that ai ghizzawi was cleared for release counselleamed of that detennination in mid june 2009 alghizzawi cannot return to home to his native libya because of very real risk 5 unclassifiediifor public release unclassifiediifor public release of imprisonment torture andor even death in addition it would not be safe for mr alghizzawi to return to his adopted homeland of afghanistan because of the ongoing war there and general feelings of illwill towards those of arab origin such as mr ghizzawi therefore aighizzawi needs to either be released into the united states or to third country that volunteers to take him after the executive review team determined that alghizzawi was cleared for release the district court continued to stay his habeas petition and asked counsel for both sides for status reports to be filed on july 20 2009 in the status report of that date the government claimed it was making efforts to find third country to offer asylum to alghizzawi alghizzawi asked the district court for prompt habeas hearing the district court evidently concluding that being cleared for release means that ghizzawi longer needs habeas hearing continued to stay the case over the objection of alghizzawi and directed the filing of yet further status report on or about september 202009 on that date the government having nothing additional to report except for purportedly though artfully unspecified ongoing efforts to find third country for alghizzawi once again asked the distrit court to continue the stay alghizzawi once again asked the district court to lift the stay and promptly schedule his habeas hearing to date hearing has been scheduled and there is indication that hearing will in fact ever be scheduled upon information and belief every district court judge hearing the guantanamo cases has stayed the cases of the men who have been cleared for release even though of course only handful have actually been released and most of those because their 6 unclassifjediifor public release unclassifiediifor public release habeas petitions had been granted rather than because they had been cleared for release the executive review task force has cleared more than 80 such men and almost all of them remain imprisoned at guantanamo bay in exactly the same manner as ifthey had not been cleared cleared for release is not legally the same as having the great writ entered if it were in fact legally the same then the writ for habeas corpus should have been entered immediately and the govenunent could have objection to such relief given its legal posture however it is not the same and for that reason habeas hearing should be held immediately as was held to be petitioners right pursuant to this courts decision in boumediene unfortunately the district court judges refuse to address the habeas petitions of these men or articulate reason for their continued failure to schedule those habeas hearings except to say that the cases are stayed because the executive has said that the men have beencleared for release statement of the case petitioner abdul hamid alghizzawi is prisoner incarcerated at the united states naval station at guantanamo bay cuba since early 2002 petitioner is citizen of libya who was living in afghanistan when abducted by bounty hunters sold to the united states military and then imprisoned at guantanamo he has been under respondents exclusive custody and control since that time petitioners jailers refer to him and to all other inmates at guantanamo by number and not name mr ghizzawis number is 654 mr alghizzawi is now fortysix years of age and had been living in afghanistan 7 unclassifiediifor public release unclassifiediifor public release for approximately 10 years since shortly after the soviet military left that country prior to his being abducted by mghani tribesmen and turned over first to the northern alliance and then to the american military forces in the late fall of 2001 in return for cash bounty mr alghizzawi is married to an mghani woman1 and has young daughter who was only few months old when he was abducted he and his wife owned and ran small shop in alalabad where they sold honey and spices and later expanded to include bakery in the fall of 2001 when the united states military began bombing areas close to their city mr aighizzawi took his wife and months old baby and fled their home and shop in alalabad seeking safety in rural area where his in laws lived not long after mr aighizzawi and his family arrived at his inlaws approximately december of 2001 armed men came to the home and told the family to turn over the arab alghizzawi mr alghizzawi cooperated with the bounty hunters to avoid any harm to his family mr alghizzawi was first turned over to the northern alliance then in tum sold to the us forces in return for bounty under us program that provided large bounties in return for terrorists and murderers mr aighizzawi is neither terrorist nor murderer but was instead the victim of greed in an impoverished nation he has been held at guantanamo since the spring of 2002 simply on the basis of being an arab man in the wrong place at the wrong time when i unfortunately a1ghizzawis wife now seeks ivorce because seven years with end in sight is too difficult 8 unclassifiediifor public release unclassifiedflfor public release the united states military indiscriminately provided financial incentive to round up such men since his detention at guantanarno mr aighizzawis health has steadily deteriorated mr alghizzawi suffers from both hepatitis b and tuberculosis and has not been treated for either condition while being held at guantanamo despite repeated requests for medical help counsel for aighizzawi had sought his medical records and medical treatment for his life threatening illnesses but the district court has declined to grant the requested relief and the circuit court affirmed that decision without comment and this court declined review mr alghizzawi is one of those extraordinarily unfortunate individuals who should never been held at guantanamo in fact back in 2004 when in response to this courts ruling in rasul v bush 542 us 466 2004 the military was forced to conduct combatant status review tribunals csrts to determine whether the men at guantanamo were properly held as enemy combatants petitioner alghizzawi was subject to two csrts because the first csrt panel determined that in fact aighizzawi was not properly being held as an enemy combatant mr aighizzawis case also brings forth the extraordinary additional fact that member of his first csrt panel the panel that found mr aighizzawi to not be an enemy combatant included panel member lt col stephen abraham lt col abraham provided an affidavit to this court in june 2007 in that petitioners successful motion to reconsider the denial of certiorari in boumediene v bushsct2007 wl 1854132 75 uslw 3705 75 uslw 3707 us jun 292007 061195 in his affidavit lt col abraham described not only the failed csrt process and the pressure put on the csrt panels to find the 9 unclassifiedflfor public release unclassifiediifor public release prisoners enemy combatants but he also described in detail the only panel that he sat on panel 23 and the paucity of evidence against that detainee mr alghizzawi petitioner herein alghizzawi was in fact one of the more than 30 detainees who were originally found not to be an enemy combatant in the csrt process declaring that panel 23s csrts determination as to petitioner was in error assistant secretary of defense for detainee affairs matthew waxman immediately directed that alghizzawis and other detainees classification be reconsidered in response and petitioner submits contrary to csrt procedures for nonenemy combatant designations and now confirmed by the affidavit of lt col stephen abraham the authorities undertook an inculplery search for information that would justify the continued holding of mr alghizzawi on january 182005 the military officer charged with conducting that search submitted the results of his search which included new information onjanuary 21 2005 new csrt panel 32 was convened for the express purpose of reassessing petitioners non enemy combatant status until it came to the conclusion desired by the pentagon and sometime thereafter redesignated mr a1ghizzawi as an enemy combatant again even though the panel had new evidence in an email chain which included mention of mr alghizzawis non enemy combatant status culminating in message to the chair of the newly convened csrt panel 32 the following text appeared please note that i did everything i could to ensure this was new evidence but in fact the reconciliation the various exhibits on the g drive with the dab 10 unclassifiediifor public release unclassifiediifor public release folders and my inculplery search may have duplicated some of the references inconsistencies will not cast favorable light on the csrt process or the work done by oardec this does not justify making change in and or sic itself but is filter by which to look by properly classifying them as ec then there is an opportunity to 1 further exploit them here in g tmo and 2 when they are transferred to third country it will be controlled transfer in status mr alghizzawi had been desperately seeking legal counsel since early 2005 so that he could pursue his case in federal court and so that he could obtain medical treatment a28285 in december 2005 upon retaining counsel mr aighizzawi filed habeas petition in the united states district court for the district of columbia 05cv 2378 two weeks after mr alghizzawi filed his habeas petition in the district court the president signed the detainee treatment act of 2005 dta pub l no109148 119 stat 2739 2005 into law the governmen thereupon asserted and argued in boumediene and odah that dta 1005e deprived the court of appeals of jurisdiction over the pending appeals the governments outrageous position prompted two rounds of supplemental briefing and second oral argument in that appeal further extending the litigation quagmire that has plagued these cases the district court immediately stayed mr alghizzawis case after his habeas petition was filed and while the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit considered the effect of the dta in boumediene and odah from that time until the present aighizzawi has continuously sought habeas hearing agreeing only to the ii unclassifiediifor public release unclassifiediifor public release short stay in the spring of 2009 so that the obama administration could review his file as part of its vaunted executive review process indeed while that process has purported to clear alghizzawi its clearance has proven meaningless in real terms despite aighizzawis many requests for hearing the district court still refuses to grant him hearing but instead has tacitly decided that the executive branch should be given all of the time it needs to access alghizzawis situation and detennine how it would like to proceed potentially even if this amounts to life sentence for ai ghizzawi and others in his predicament the almost eight years of incarceration that mr aighizzawi has been forced to suffer without so much as habeas hearing has made mockery of habeas corpus as an effective and speedy instrument by which judicial inquiry may be had into the legality of the detention of person carafas v lavallee 391 us 234 238 1968 and this courts admonition in boumediene that the men at guantanamo have waited long enough and should be given prompt hearings mr alghizzawi respectfully asks this court to show the lower courts and the executive branch once and for all that there is bottom line constitutional limit implicated here and to provide bright line guide as to how the lower courts should proceed unless this court provides that guidance the legal limbo that has lasted these many years will continue indefinitely for men like alghizzawi who have been cleared for release but have real prospect for release and more and more of these cases will languish until they reach this court for review again and again in the alternative mr alghizzawi asks this court to treat the present petition as one seeking relief in the nature of mandamus and direct the district court to immediately 12 unclassifiediifor public release unclassifiediifor public release schedule hearing and proceed to the merits of his petition and to provide specific guidance to the district court for that relief the primary purpose of habeas corpus proceeding is to make certain that man is not unjustly imprisoned price v johnston 334 us 266 291 1948 but habeas review must be speedy if it is to be effective stack v boyle 342 us 14 1952 as these kafkaesque proceedings drag on below petitioner alghizzawi is being held in the cruel confines of camp 6 since december 2006 supermax style prison that until very recently had the men sitting in solitary confinement 22 hours day seven days week mr alghizzawi has not seen or talked to his wife and young daughter in almost eight years and his health has deteriorated to an alarming degree in fact just recently aighizzawis wife sent divorce papers to her husband telling him that seven plus years and with end in sight has been too difficult and respectfully asked him to grant her wish for divorce the cruelty that continues for mr ai ghizzawi must come to an endand not on the executives own unilateral terms as this court held even convicted murderers cannot be made to endure conditions like these without first providing them the benefit of due processwilkinson v austin 545 us 209 224 2005 let alone man such as mr aighizzawi who has been charged with wrongdoing and for whom there is absolutely evidence that he has ever been threat to the united states or anyone else and man whom the government hascleared for release and hence longer contests is even an enemy combatant or should continue to be detained until this court acts mr aighizzawi and the other prisoners in his circumstance are forced to endure conditions that are not 13 unclassifiediifor public release unclassifiediifor public release permitted for prisoners of war under the geneva conventions or army regulations for convicted criminals in federal prisons or for caged animals under humane society guidelines summary of argument petitioner alghizzawi has been imprisoned for more than seven years without having been afforded due process of law or other fundamental rights by government that professes justice and adherence to the rule of law but has instead delivered him into penal hell of potentially infinite duration or as british jurist lord goldsmith has termed it legal black holetl despite this courts strong ruling in boumediene admonishing the lower courts to move promptly on the pending habeas petitions of the guantanamo prisoners aighizzawi continues to be denied habeas hearing the fact that the district court judges have all decided that finding by the executive that prisoner is 11 cleared for release is all the prisoners are entitled to is contrary to the purpose and meaning of habeas corpus and every other constitutional value of our nation and the values of civilized nations this court has the authority to redress this injustice and affront to american values and this court should enter the writ requested by mr aighizzawi this court should use his case as vehicle to provide bright line guide to the lower courts showing them how to move forward on the merits and granting some form of relief to mr alghizzawi and the many men at guantanamo who continue to be imprisoned in gross miscarriage of justice 14 unclassifiediifor public release unclassifiediifor public release argument i habeas review must be speedy if it is to be effective lithe writ of habeas corpus is the fundamental instrument for safeguarding individual freedom against arbitrary and lawless government action harris v nelson 394 us 286 29091 1969 as the court stated the scope and flexibility of the writ its capacity to reach all manner of illegal detention its ability to cut through barriers of form and procedural mazes have always been emphasized and jealously guarded by courts and lawmakers the very nature of the writ demands that it be administered with the initiative and flexibility essential to insure that miscarriages of justices within its reach are surfaced and corrected ld at 291 since habeas is an extraordinary remedy whose operation is to large extent uninhibited by traditional roles of finality and federalism its use has been limited to cases of special urgency leaving more conventional remedies for cases in which the restraints on liberty are neither severe nor immediate hensley v man court 411 us 345351 1973 see also peyton v rowe 391us 545860 1968 precisely because the use of habeas is limited to cases of special urgency hensley 411 us at 351 and because principal aim of the writ is to provide for swift judicial review of alleged unlawful restraints on liberty peyton 391 us at 63 see also harris 394 us at 291 the office of the writ is to provide prompt and efficacious remedy for whatever society deems to be intolerable restraints the court has emphasized time and again the writs demand for speed flexibility and simplicityi hensley 411 us at 350 especially pertinent here the court has made plain thata habeas corpus proceeding must not be allowed to flounder in procedural morass is unclassifiediifor public release unclassifiediifor public release harris 394 us at 29192 quoting price v johnston 334 us 266269 1948 and that the guantanamo detainees have waited long enough for habeas hearings boumediene v bush 553 usj 128 s ct 2229 2008 wl 2369628 2008 us lexis 4887 2008 thus far morass quagmire or synonym thereof is the only possible description of proceedings that have languished for over seven years without so much as the scheduling of hearing on the merits of mr alghizzawis habeas petition ii alghizza wi has exhausted every other remedy available to him despite the governments attempts to change the rules at every step as explained above alghizzawi has exhausted every remedy available to him under american law despite these efforts he has suffered at guantanamo bay for almost eight years without being charged with single offense and indeed he continues to be held in identically harsh conditions despite expressly being cleared for release and without single hearing on the merits of the legality of his detention the fact that the executive has declared aghizzawi to be cleared for release is meaningless gesture that cannot be permitted to supercede the substantive rights to which this court has found him and others similarly situated entitled in boumediene iii this court may exercise its original habeas jurisdiction to end the legal limbo in the courts below this court has jurisdiction to end the limbo below this courts jurisdiction is sufficiently broad to remedy the injustice that has befallen mr alghizzawi and others in his predicament in boumediene this court held 16 unclassifiediifor public release unclassifiediifor public release that petitioner and other men imprisoned at guantanamo bay have the right to habeas corpus and that because they have already waited so terribly long the habeas petitions must move swiftly aighizzawi was entitled to the writ under the conunon law and would have been entitled to the writ as of 1789 when the constitution was adopted d at 47982 at the absolute minimum the suspension gause protects the writ as it existed in 1789 ins v sf cyr 533 us 289301 2001 internal quotations omitted accordingly petitioner has right to the writ lias it existed in 1789 even without this courts decision in boumediene this right exists for mr alghizzawi in this court itself as of 1789 and that right is protected by the suspension gause despite this courts holding in boumediene the reality of his case is that the writ of habeas corpus is still not available to aighizzawi in the district court as apparently the district court prefers to defer to the executive rather than act on cases within its prerogative and jurisdiction this court has the authority to hear mr aighizzawis case itself and to use this extraordinary case to establish bright line rule for the processes that should be recognized while accepting such jurisdiction would be unusual it represents the only means of ending the legal logjam and the attendant additional round of appeals and inevitable requests for review by this court once and for all b the courts power of habeas review extends to this case if this court determines that it does not want to accept its own original habeas jurisdiction and hear mr aighizzawis case itself petitioner asks that this court accept the present filing as one seeking relief in the nature of mandamus and in the 17 unclassifiediifor public release unclassifiediifor public release alternative ordering the district court to immediately set hearing for aighizzawis case that this court is authorized to exercise appellate jurisdiction by habeas corpus directly is position sustained by abundant authority ex parte sieboid 100 us 371374 1880 this courts habeas or habeasequivalent jurisdiction stems from its jurisdiction over actions originally brought in the district court such as the habeas action filed by petitioner or the court of appeals such as the dta review and habeas action filed by petitioner see generally us const art ill 2 ci 2 28 usc 1254 and 2241 siebold 100 us at 374 375 having this general power to

morass harris 394 us at 292 all the while petitioner continues year after year to be unlawfully and cruelly imprisoned at guantanamo bay this court has jurisdiction because each lower court has failed to act and because the exceptional circumstances of this case warrant it see rule 204a if this court declines to hear mr alghizzawis habeas petition directly as set forth above aighizzawi ask this court to direct the district court to immediately relieve the prisoner from the unlawful restraint that the paralysis of the lower courts force him to endure ex parte yerger 75 us 85 103 1869 18 unclassifiediifor public release unclassifiediifor public release conclusion more than fifteen months have passed since this court decided boumediene mr alghizzawi remains at guantanamo has not had habeas hearing and there is apparent prospect of such hearing on the horizon alghizzawi asks this court to step in and once and for all to provide him with the long overdue habeas hearing which has been denied to him these almost eight years and to which this court in boumediene held that he and the other men still held at guantanamo bay are entitled habeas corpus is at its core the most fundamental component of our constitutional system but for alghizzawi and others in his predicament that process has completely melted down to the point of being nonexistent the lower courts continue to defer to the vagaries of the executive branch rather than providing the relief that this court held ghizzawi and others were not only entitled but held was long overdue well over year ago by remedying the extraordinary plight of mr aighizzawi this court can once and for all confirm that there is bottom line constitutional limit and at the same time guide the lower courts not only as to the imperative that they must move on to the merits of these habeas petitions but provide the clearest of guidance as to how to do it this is exactly the situation under which both certiorari and the original writ were designed frankly accepting jurisdiction of aighizzawis present petition for this purpose will have the effect of reducing litigation that has resulted in not less than three rounds of landmark appeals to this court notwithstanding this own courts decisive the logjam in the lower courts persists as does the prospect of the court being asked to intervene in these matters again
