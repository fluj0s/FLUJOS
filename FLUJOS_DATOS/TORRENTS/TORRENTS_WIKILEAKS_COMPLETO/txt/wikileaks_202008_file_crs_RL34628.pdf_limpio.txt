plaintiffs in cobell v kempthorne 1 individual indian trust funds are th focal point of this case which has been litigated since 19962 individual indian trust funds as distinguished from tribal trust funds are monies which the federa l government holds for the benefit of individual indians the conflict in the case traces to the federal governments trust responsibility with respect to american i ndians the supreme c ourt first formulated the concept of the federal government as trustee for indian tribes in 1831 likening the relationship to that of ward to its guardian3 in the capacity of trustee the united states holds title to much of indian tribal land and land allotted to individual indians receipts from leases timber sales or mineral roya lties are paid to the federal government for dis bursement to the appropriate indian property owners flowing from the federal trusteeship of indian lands and mineral resources are fiduciary responsibilities on the part of th united states to manage indian monies and assets which have b een derived from these lands and are held in trust4 the case is premised on statutory du ties imposed upon the federal agencies handling indian monies as well as on the ex istence of property rights in funds and assets held in trust for indians the courts have recognized broad powers of congress with respect to indian affairs legi slation and indian property but have also recognized that indian property may not be taken for public purpose without just compensation5 this case is not claim for just compensation it is claim for an accounting by the trustee for receipts and disbursements representing the trust corpus held for the benefit of individual indians the cobell litigation sprang out of the fede ral governments trust responsibility with respect to three groups of money acc ounts held in trust for individual indianhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34628crs2 6 these accounts trace their beginnings to the federal governments allotment program of the late 19th and early 20th centuries under this program the secretary of the department of the interior doi was authorized to llot portions of reservation land to individual indians title would remain with the united states in trust for number of years after which it would pass to the individual allottees free from all encumbrances the allotment policy resulted in large amounts of land passi ng into nonindian ownership and congress abandoned the policy in 1934 extending indefinitely the trust periods of allotments that had not yet passed into fee ownership many of these properties remain

fiduciary obligations to administe r the trust lands and funds arising from them for the benefit of the beneficiaries the federal government has stipulated however that it does not know the exact number of iim trust accounts that it is supposed to administer nor does doi know the correct balances for each iim account14 doi concedes that it is currently unable to provide an accurate accounting for majority of iim trust beneficiaries15 the treasury department also has problems with trust fund manage ment procedures first in conformity with federal law the treasury department allows the struction of documents over six years and seven months old and makes effort to ensure that documents related to accounting for iim accounts are preserved16 in addition there can be time lapse between the deposit of funds with the tr easury department and the i nvestment of those funds17 there can also be time lapse between the issuance of check and when the payee presents the check resulting in

house committee on government operations produced report highly cr itical of the interior department19 in 1994 congress enacted the indian trust fund management reform act the reform act20 recognizing the federal governments preexisting trust responsibilities and further identifying some of the interior secretarys trust fund responsibilities such as providing adequate accounting for trust fund balances providing adequate controls over receipts and disburseme nts providing accurate nd timely reconciliations preparing and supplying peri odic statements of account performance and balances to account holders and establishi ng consistent written policie s and procedures for trust fund management21 significantly the original house bill hr 1846 would have made the accounting duty prospective only when another similar bill was introduced to take hr 1846s place that provision was left out this new bill became the reform act and the courts interpreting it in the cobell litigation have determined that doi owes historical accounting duty going back to the act of june 24 193822 as the dc circuit court of ppeals stated the 1994 act identifiedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34628crs4 23 id at

various accountings that doi has attempted continueda portion of the governments specific ob ligations and created additional means to ensure that the obligations would be carried out23 the litigation in 1996 group of iim account holders filed class action suit to compel performance of trust obligations alleging that the secretaries of the interior and the treasury as delegatees of the federal governments trust responsibilities had breached the fiduciary duties owed to pl aintiffs by mismanaging the iim accounts24 two years later the district court judge bifurcated the trial into two phases with phase 1 to focus on reforming the manageme nt and accounting of the iim trust funds and phase 2 to address the hist orical accounting of those accounts25 in 1999 united states district judge royce c lamberth issued ruling as to phase 1 holding that the treasury and interior secretaries had breached their fiduciary duties to the iim account holders26 the transition to phase 2 has proven increasingly difficult however because the defendants have been unable to submit in forms acceptable to the court plans for reforming the accountmanagement syst em and for providing historical accounting27 providing the farreaching accounting required in the cobell litigation is difficult task on number of levels the pl aintiffs argue that an accurate accounting is impossible due to lack of records two issues however ve proven particularly difficult for doi in performing this task the first of these issues is the fractionation of interests in many of the allotment lands these interests have been fractionated over the years as they have been divided among the heirs of the original allottees increasing exponentially with each genera tion and leading to incredibly small interests that are difficult to track doi estimates that there are currently over 14 million fractional interest s of 2 or less invol ving 58000 tracts of land28 matterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34628crs5 28 continued

that it can perform transactionbytransaction accounting of the judgment and per cap ita accounts and the sdas the problems presented by the landbased acc ounts have proven very difficu lt to resolve doi has argued that it should be able to use statisti cal sampling with respect to some of these accounts the second difficult question is how fa r back historic accounting should reach at various points in the litigation the different parties have argued for an accounting of transactions as far back as 1887 date of the allotment act 1938 date of the indian reorganization act and 1994 d ate of the reform act resolving this problem would likely encompass choice between what is fair and what is possible one could have very different answers to these two questions mainly because as the litigation so far has shown doi and treasur records relating to the iim accounts are at best incomplete in january 2003 doi provided new historical accounting plan to judge lamberth that would cover all account s open as of october 25 1994 when the reform act was enacted after reviewing dois plan judge lamberth in september 2003 issued controversial structural in junction giving the court broad oversight authority to ensure that 1 doi carries out the accounting the court adopted what is essentially modified version of doi s historical accounting plan but did not allow doi to use statistical sampling with respect to the landbased accounts and 2 doi reforms its system for managing the iim accounts judge lamberth also appointed monitor to ensure co mpliance with the injunction order30 one month later congress passed an appr opriations rider stating that nothing in the reform act or in any other stat ute and principle of common law shall be construed or applied to require the depa rtment of the interior to commence or continue historical accountin g activities with respect to the iim trust until 2005 or when congress more clearly delineat dois accounting obligations under the reform act31 congress took this action in direct response to judge lamberths structural injunction order stating that compliance could cost upwards of 6 billion and that diverting that amount of res ources could be devastating to indian country32 two subsequent appr opriation bills have limited the funds available to doi for the historical accounting to 58 million for fy2005 and fy200633

out that they could not address the issues that would be relevant if the district court after december 31 2004 reissued those provisions compe lling historical accounting35 the court next largely overturne d judge lamberths injunction as to dois systemic reform looking to supr eme court precedent the dc circuit held that judicial review under the adminis trative procedure ac t apa is limited to specific agency actions and that such review cannot be extended to claims of broad programmatic failure36 the court held that judge lamberth in issuing his injunction had impermissibly wa ndered into this latter area which is more properly reserved for executive or legislative acti on while the dc circuit upheld judge lamberths requirement that doi submit plan laying out how it will come into compliance with its fiduciary obligations the court found that the other elements of lamberths order eg the appointment of monitor the listing of and compliance with tribal laws were not tied to sp ecific findings of wrongdoing and suggested greater and unlawful judicial in trusion into agency discretion on february 23 2005 judge lamberth noting that the deadline contained in the appropriations rider had passed issued another structural injunction with respect to the historical accounting37 once again he adopted modified version of dois historical accounting plan but prohib ited the use of statistical sampling and required an accounting going back to the llotment act of 1887 he refused to stay the order pending appeal citing the plaintiffs nineyear wait and delay directed by congress in bizarre and futile attempt at legislating settlement in this case38 on november 15 200539 the dc circuit vacated judge lamberths injunction and historical accounting order and directed that on rema nd the district court in evaluating dois plan for statistical sampling to accomplish the accounting should not ignore the general language of the reform act and subs equent congressional limitations on

toward doi independent of the developments in the case it concluded that the language of the opinion combined with the courts actions might give rise to public impression that justice could not be done in the case on january 30 200843 judge james robertson assigned to the case in december 2006 found doi unable to remedy its breach of fi duciary duty and ordered hearing to develop process fo r determining an appropriate remedy he rejected dois historical accounting plan not because of its use of statistical sampling methodology but on the basis of finding its scope legally inadequate in

credited or disbursed to individual indian beneficiaries and how to deal with their claim for benefits to the government with respect to such funds it also addresse s jurisdictional issues whether sovereign immunity bars the courts c onsideration of remedy nd whether monetary remedy is available under any federal statute critically because an award of restitution relies on the equitable power of the court the opinion grapples with the question of how to apply equitable principles to this unique case the restitution issue having recognized on january 30 200845 that what had been the central effort in the case over the years the developm ent of an accounting had failed judge robertson held an evidentiary proceeding on the issue of remedy on august 7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34628crs8 46

of the court of federal claims 48 for brief summary of how the court applied equitable principles see infra at 1213 49 cobell restitution award decision slip op at 42008 he awarded an equitable re medy of 4556 million in restitution46 the figure represents the amount to be restored to pl aintiffs as receipts not credited to their accounts claims for damages for funds which never were collected or for mismanagement of assets are not included in the figure nd were not before the court in cobell 47 to determine the amount of res titution the court had to examine the models the parties had set forth for determining the difference between what treasury had posted as receipts to the iim account nd what had been disbursed to individual accounts or account holders information accu mulated from the years of attempts at arriving at satisfactory and reliable means of reconstructing the records at doi and treasury aided the court in evaluating th models offered by the parties before calculating the amount of re stitution however judge robertson reviewed some principles drawn from previ ous decisions in the case he noted that although the court has broad equitable power to remedy trust nonfeasance the fact that the defendant is the federal government limits the courts authority to fashion remedy48 he gave at least two reasons for this limitation 1 the court has to examine its jurisdiction in the case carefully because the federal governments sovereign immunity renders it immune to suits to which it has not consented ie there must be statute accord ing jurisdiction for the particular issues being litigated and 2 although common law trust principles are applicable their application must be viewed and tempered in light of the unique character of the indian trusts and their trustee according to the opinion trust w would require that where the trustee has not kept an account the trust beneficiar should enjoy the benefit of evidentiary presumptions those presumptions must be adjusted when applied to 121year old perpetual trust managed by civil servants with rapidly multiplying beneficiaries and variety of everchanging assets49 the decision not to accord plaintiffs the full benefit of evidentiary presumptions in their favor led to major conclusion reached by the court to apply modified burden of proof on the govern ments statistical model for calculating data that it could not produce doi had shown that onl 77 percent of the monies collected for the iim system had been posted to iim accounts accepting the governments calculation of receipts but using their own formula for calculating disbursement rate for each year the plai ntiffs claimed shortfall of 36 billion over 122 years to this they proposed adding approx imately 434 billion as benefit to the government based on formula which they had devised that assumed that whatever was not disbursed to the account holders was available for general governmental expenses relieving the government of n eed to issue and pay interest on treasury bonds httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34628crs9 50 dois expert also testified to various means by which bookeeping entries might not be captured as disbursements to individual acc ounts the court found the testimony to be persuasive in explaining the nature of the discrepancy between receipts and postings id slip op at 28 the testimony however did not quantify percentages of receipts for stakeholders for tribal trusts and for third parties but acknowledged that to do so would be not impossible but time consuming and has not been done id slip op at 2829 51

115 million transactions since 1986 id n 8 slip op at 19 52 the basic deficiencies cited by the court are 1 including as collections sums not destined for the iim accounts and 2 choosing to accept as accurate historical receipts data while rejecting historical disbursement data the court characterized the later as self serving id slip op at 17 53 id slip op at 16 54 idthe government produced evidence explai ning some of the shortfall between receipts and disbursements doi expert michele herman testified that the discrepancy reflected the fact that not all the funds received into treasurys iim account are intended to be credited to indi vidual indian trust fund accounts some such as tribal trust fund receipts or bid or lease deposits are to be funneled on pass through basis to other recipients50 doi did not have sufficient records to substantiate the full amount of the discre pancy as passthrough funds but presented through another expert witne ss statistical model as means of quantifying the actual discrepancy had th trust law evidentiary presumption been employed in plaintiffs favor it is likely that dois ev identiary burden would have been greater51 the plaintiffs estimated that 4 billion of the 14 bi llion posted to the iim account had never been never been cred ited to the accounts of or disbursed to individual trust beneficiaries the court rejected this amount both because of what it perceived to be defects in the plain tiffs method of calculating the shortfall52 and because audit conducted durin g the course of the litigati on states or hints at the disappearance of anything close to 30 percent of trust receipts53 the court also noted that whatever problems have existed in the history of this trust and however serious the misfeasances and malfeasances of the trustees over 120 years there has never been evidence of such prodigious pilfering of assets from within the trust system itself54 having admitted that 23 of iim receipt s had not been posted to iim accounts and faced with the plaintiffs charge that approximately 4 billion had not been disbursed to account holders the government was required to explain the shortfall and put figure on it the explanation was essentially that the individual indian trust beneficiaries were not entitle d to all of the funds that treasury deposited in the iim account some were held there on passthr ough basis because of the inadequacies of the recordkeeping and the inability to provide an accounting the government was unable to provide comprehensiv data establishing the qua ntity of

developed by the governments expert witness dr frederick scheuren of the national opinion research center at the university of chicago the governments model employed multiple imputation technique to account for the multiplicity of variables imput ed to the large range of missing data with respect to the accounts it involved several complex steps which are described in the courts opinion55 it was able to produce various figures to represent what should be the present balance in the indi vidual indian trust fund accounts and specify confidence rate56 with margin for error identified for each figure given the court described the result of the statistical analysis as follows the resulting histogram shows that the calculated mean would be 5836 million which is 1599 million more than the current stated balance of the trust because there is so much uncertainty in the data however the histogram displays wide variance the 95 percent confidence interval is wide enough that it encompasses zero difference betw een the calculated and stated balance of the trust meaning that the current stated balance could very well be exactly correct that variance cuts both ways t the 95 percent confidence interval the histogram encompasses 3657 million the 99 percent confidence interval would accommodate finding of shortfall of up to 4556 million57 judge robertson found the model offered by the government to be plausible based on the sound and principled use of av ailable data methodol ogically fair and carefully employed even if it may not have adequately accounted for just how unreliable the underlying data was58 he noted that the governments statistical model conformed with what had been di scovered about the trust funds 1 it admitted that the stated balance was ss than what it should be 2 it found variance around the mean which coincides w ith the one thing that 12 years of this litigation has truly settle d which is that there is still much that is unknown about the trust59 3 its confidence interval included the current stated value of the trust60 and 4 its 4556 m illion figure is best understood as an admission that the range of uncertainty about the aggregate iim trust d ata includes the possibility that the return of 4556 million is necessary to co rrect the trusts balance61although the plaintiffs argued against the use of the model and identified minor omissions in it the courthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34628crs11 62 id slip op at 3839 emphasis in original 63 id slip op at 68 64 id slip op at 6970 according to judge robertson the 99 percent confidence level addresses the fact that there is more uncertain ty in the data than the governments expert witness acknowledged and such figure is legally sound way of crediting obscurities and doubts to the plaintiffs id at 70 65 id slip op at 7071found that they were unable to prove any bias that would render it fundamentally unsound62 not only did judge robertson find the m odel offered by the plaintiffs to be defective he also criticized their failure to offer specific evidence to discredit the defendants model according to his opinion the plaintiffs model could not be considered among other r easons because it was inconsistent in accepting the governments estimate of receipts but not of disbursements and reflective of superstrong interpretation of the presum ption against the breaching trustee that cannot be equitably applied to the trusts at issue here63 accordingly judge robertson accepted the governments model and provided certain evidentiary advantage to the plaintiffs by selecting the maximally conservative64 estimate derived from the governments statistical model rather than the 95 percent level which would be accep table in business context or the 975 percent level that the governments ex pert witness had sugge sted he summed up his reasons for this as follows although it creates highly conservative estimate the most conservative possible it is far less draconian than the presumption that ordinary trust law might apply in the ordinary trust case after 12 years of contentious litigation the government can say only that with 99 percent confidence it believes that more than 455600000 is missing from the stat ed balance of the iim trust this statement has the character of an admission by responsible civil servants that there are limits to what can be c onfidently stated with respect to the iim system and that history of accounting nonfeasance makes substantial error plausible it also represents the pr oduct of zealous and determined advocacy on the part of the plaintiffs counsel who have fought to vindicate their clients belief that the governments inattention to its trust duties has had not only historical significance but real economic significance in the daytoday lives of individual indians65 the benefit to th government issue the court completely rejected the plaintiffs request for compensation for benefit to the government which the plai ntiffs added to their computation of 35 billion difference between what had been r eceived and disbursed they had arrived at that figure by using the governments original figures for receipts and applying formula to devise disbursement rate for each year they also used model to compute what they alleged was the benefit to the government this

these funds for general expenses67 on the other hand the court found sufficient rebuttal evid ence from government witness for the conclusion that benefit to the government restitution was in order 68 jurisdiction the court addressed two ju risdictional issues sovereign immunity whether there was statute that authorized the court to hear the suit against the united states and subject matter jurisdiction whether there was authority for the court to grant monetary award it resolved thes issues principally on the basis of the administrative procedure act apa69 under the doctrine of sovereign immunity suit may not be brought against the united st ates unless statute authorizes it the court found statute which authorizes fe deral district cour t to assess damages against the united states in an action not based on torts and in an amount over 10000 it therefore rejected any cl aim that the plaintiffs may have as compensation for the governments failure to produce an accounting70 however the court did find that the ap could be invoked to restore to the plaintiffs sums not credited to or disbur sed from their accounts the apa authorizes an action in court of the united states seeking relief other than money damages71 the court reviewed supreme court juri sprudence on the question of whether restitution of the sort contemplated comes within the meaning of money damages it concluded that although the supreme c ourt has come close to holding that any award of money constitutes money damages72 it has recognized that monetary award is not always to be considered money damages73 this is true particularly when the nonpayment of money is th very unlawful act of which the agency is accused rather than compensation for another harm74 the court noted that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34628crs13 74 continued language to distinguish between specific relie f and compensatory or substitute relief 75 cobell restitution award decision slip op at 45

revenues and allocate them to the beneficiary and not to himself for that reason the court ruled that it had jurisdiction to order disgorge ment of trust funds not pr operly allocated and paid to the beneficiaries75 it also found that monetary award as compensation for the governments breach of trust in failing to provide an accounting would be money damages and thus excluded from its juri sdiction under the apa the court also concluded that because benefit to the government had been identified any award for lost interest on funds not cred ited to plaintiffs would be compensation and thus excluded from its jurisdicti on under the apa as money damages76 application of equitable principles because the court was applying princi ples based on equity and because of the uniqueness of the case the court soug ht means of drawing upon equitable principles without doing an injustice to ither party the result was that it weighed the governments evidence less strictly than it would have had the case been runof the mill breach of trust case in state court the court proceeded from the premise that if the plaintiffs were to benefit from evidentiary presumptions flowing from breach of trust the government rea lly the taxpayers would be held liable for every transaction not proven by met hod that is not legally required and would be irrational to pursue77 noting that there was hard and fast federal trust law to guide the decision other than various precedents indicating that the federal courts could turn to state trust law and general trust law treatises for guidance judge robertson reviewed the history of courts of equity he determined that cardinal characteristic of court sitting in equity is flexibility to fashion just remedy he declared that he sought to seek fairness to both parties78 he determined that three elements in this case called for modification of the evidentiary presumption that would have favored the plaintiffs calculation of how much had not

trust at issue nd 3 using the presumption would produce result that would be manifestly inaccurat because the plaintiffs are assuming that all of the funds deposited into the treasur account were funds for individual indian account holders80 weighing those factors the court determined that the evidence that the government had produced was sufficient to meet the requirements of equity in that its statistical model allows for the use of the best available data while preserving measures of uncertainty that can be scored to the plaintiffs benefit in the final analysis81 future options the determination of the amount of res titution to be awarded does not end the case not only must the court consider options for distributing the award there is also the possibility of an appeal of the decision the halfbillion dollar award contrasts with the 7 billion that the bush administration was willing to commit to in 2005 for legislative resolution of tribal and individual indian trust fund issues82 it is also almost 27 billion less than what had been recommended by plaintiffs group83 the plaintiffs may be weighing vari ous options an appeal of the awards an action in the court of federal claims for compensation for the failure to provide an accounting and for mismanagement of th funds or legislation to compensate them and resolve all issues it might be noted that if plaintiffs choose to bring an appeal of the amount of the award the g overnment may counter by challenging the rulings resulting in the courts finding au thority to order monetary award without explicit authority in the 1994 reform act
