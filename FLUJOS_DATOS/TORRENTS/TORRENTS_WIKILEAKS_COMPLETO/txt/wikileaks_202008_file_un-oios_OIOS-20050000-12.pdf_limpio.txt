finance officer to the committee kta legal staff advised t he itf that the wisdom of allowing representative of the finance department to partici pate in bid evaluations is questionable because generally officers whose function involve s payment should not evaluate contractors to whom payment will become due accord ing to kta legal staff however such participation is not precluded by any rule or law section 2392 of finance administration instruction 21999 revised 15 d ecember 1999 public procurement using kosovo consolidated budget funds precludes on ly an approving officer from the procuring entity who will eventually sign contrac t from serving as tender evaluator the finance officer was not an approving officer in this procurement process and therefore was not prevented from

members committee member 3 committee member 4 com mittee member 5 committee member 6 committee member 2 and committ ee member 7 told the itf that the conduct of the committee was completely fair an d

consensus of the committee was that vendor 2s samp were better overall in terms of quality and design but the committee was not comple tely satisfied with vendor 2s goods however pristina airport official told the itf tha t the committee was divided during the second session with one group preferring vendor 2 s goods and the other preferring those of vendor 1 pristina airport official said t hat procurement officer 1 who as committee chair did not have the right to vote an d the finance officer argued in favour of vendor 2 none of the committee members supporte d pristina airport officials assertions in this regard 14 the itf allowed pristina airport official to re view copy of the bid evaluation committee report prepared by procurement officer 1 the last page of which listed the attendees at the session of the bid opening committee procureme nt officer 1 and the finance officer were the only members of the bid opening co mmittee who also served on the bid evaluation committee upon looking at the attendee list of the bid opening committee pristina airport official named the committee membe rs who heshe said had vendor 1s and vendor 2s samples respectively heshe correct ly identified procurement officer 1 and the finance officer but the other four persons whom heshe named were members of the bid opening committee not the bid evaluation c ommittee pristina airport officials mistaken identification of these persons as bid eva luation committee members indicates that his memory of the events of the second committ ee meeting might be unclear 15 pristina airport official told the itf that he she believed that had heshe not cancelled the competitive tender the bid evaluation committee wo uld have awarded the contract to vendor 2 pristina airport official said that hesh believed that procurement officer 1 had been primed to award the contract to vendor 2 because procurement officer 1 had expressed preference for and argued in support of vendor 2s inferior product and because source whose identity pristina airport fficial was unable to recall had told himher that procurement officer 1 had been driven to the airport on several occasions by person in either the ministry of finance or the m inistry of transportation who was associated with vendor 2 pristina airport official said that heshe cancelled the competitive tender for these reasons heshe said t hat heshe did not voice his suspicions during the committee meeting adding that heshe di d not subsequently report his suspicions because priming is common and if hesh reported every instance heshe would not have time to do his job heshe said that proving that procurement officer 1 had pushed one competitor would have been difficu lt 16 procurement officer 1 told the itf that forme r kosovo minister is his godfather heshe said that heshe has never received ride to the irport from the former kosovo minister 4or in his car heshe said that heshe has idea whether the former kosovo minister is in any way associated with vendor 2 heshe said th at neither the former kosovo minister nor any other person pressured himher to show favouritism to vendor 2 17 pristina airport official told the itf that he she had not seen vendor 1 managers letter of complaint and had never heard of vendor 1 managers allegation regarding the bribery of procurement officer 1 and the finance officer howe ver pristina airport officials administrative assistant said that heshe had been present when vendor 1 manager voiced his suspicion to pristina airport official t hat an individual from the airport had accepted bribes pristina airport official adminis trative assistant said that heshe could not recall to whom vendor 1 manager referred in ad dition heshe told the itf that vendor 1 manager had given himher his letter of co mplaint pristina airport officials administrative assistant said that heshe does not recall whether heshe handed the letter to pristina airport official or left it for his att ention and heshe does not recall pristina airport official mentioning the letter 18 pristina airport official told the itf that fo llowing the cancellation of the competitive tender his only alternative to obtain uniforms for newly hired staff was to award contract to vendor 1 who had supplied the airport for the p ast two years heshe said that had heshe let new tender for summer uniforms the iforms would not have been ready until the end of august 2004 19 itf allowed pristina airport official to read copy of memo dated 300604 to himher from procurement officer 1 that described the event s of the tender process and summarized the reasons for its cancellation pristi na airport official told the itf that although heshe had signed the memo heshe had not really read it previously the articulated reasons for the cancellation are listed below pristina airport official and procurement officer 1 said that they had contribute d to the list of reasons but disagreed over which of the reasons had been provided by whom however they both said that pristina airport official had provided the term satisfactory quality i unsatisfactory quality ii unsatisfactory design iii evaluation committee not satisfied with the iforms iv manufacturing details were given v documents not completed 20 procurement officer 2 told the itf that heshe transmitted several documents regarding the singlesource procurement of summer uniforms to kta included in the document package was procurement memo dated 070704 signe d by pristina airport official and according to procurement officer 2 prepared by pri stina airport official pristina airport official told the itf that heshe believes that he she wrote the justification the justification segment of the memo stated that unifo rms would be obtained by single source procurement from the current supplier vendo r 1 for reasons of good quality and durability 21 the itf pointed out to pristina airport officia l that heshe had referred to the same uniforms as being of unsatisfactory quality and good quality in the respective documents heshe then admitted flowering up his memo and providing embellishment to ensure that kta would approve the procurement h eshe said that the term unsatisfactory quality in the memo dated 300604 was poorly chosen and that the quality of vendor 1s uniforms actually met the air ports requirements however heshe said that the design of the uniforms design was ba sic and poor allegation 5 that vendor 1 manager threatened procurement offi cer 1 22 procurement officer 1 told the itf that on d ay heshe could not specify the date following the second meeting of the bid evaluation committee at which the decision was taken to cancel the competitive tender vendor 1 ma nager entered procurement officer 1s office and in the presence of procurement offi cer 2 and pristina airport civil engineer made utterances that procurement officer 1 interpreted as threat according to procurement officer 1 vendor 1 manager said tha t heshe would meet procurement officer 1 outside that because heshe had cancell ed the tender procurement officer 1 5would find out who vendor 1 manager was and that p rocurement officer 1 would see what heshe had done by canceling the tender 23 procurement officer 2 assistant confirmed that heshe had been present during the incident but heshe had paid only partial attention to what transpired heshe said that vendor 1 manager might have mentioned that procurem ent officer 1 would have to deal with kta internal audit and the investigation task force the civil engineer also confirmed his presence and said that heshe could r ecall vendor 1 manager saying something to the effect of you have to see who i m the civil engineer said that heshe interpreted the words to mean that procureme nt officer 1 should be afraid of vendor 1 manager 24 vendor 1 manager confirmed that an incident had occurred between himher and procurement officer 1 vendor 1 manager said that h eshe told procurement officer 1 that heshe was the main reason for the cancellatio n of the tender and that heshe told procurement officer 1 youll see what you have don youll see that ill go to the highest levels and if necessary ill see you in court ve ndor 1 manager said that heshe did not ask procurement officer 1 to go outside with himhe r that heshe did not threaten procurement officer 1 and did not imply that heshe would commit physical aggression iv findings of fact allegation 1 that procurement officer 1 and the finance office r accepted bribes from vendor 2 25 the itf did not find any evidence to support th allegation that procurement officer 1 andor the finance officer accepted bribes from ven dor 2 in this matter moreover the itf did not find evidence that any person received bribe or other compensation or promise of bribe or other compensation in relatio n to either the competitive tender or the singlesource procurement therefore the allegatio n of bribery is considered to be unsubstantiated allegation 2 that procurement officer 1 replaced member of t he bid evaluation committee 26 the rationale for replacing the member of the b id evaluation committee is reasonable furthermore vendor 1 manager did not intimate that the replacement was made for any questionable purpose therefore the allegation is considered to be correct but the substantive act is not considered to have been base d on ulterior motives allegation 3 that procurement officer 1 inappropriately placed the finance officer on the bid evaluation committee 27 the itf established that the finance officer pa rticipated on the committee but did not determine whether heshe was nominated by procureme nt officer 1 or pristina airport official regardless the itf did not identify any indication that the finance officers behaviour on the committee was in any way unprofess ional or improper in the absence of specific regulations precluding the participatio n of finance personnel in such processes this allegation is considered to be unsubstantiated allegation 4 that procurement officer 1 favoured vendor 2 in t he tender process 28 the itf did not find any evidence to support th allegation that procurement officer 1 had favoured vendor 2 during the tender process simila rly pristina airport officials opinion that procurement officer 1 had been primed to sel ect vendor 2 is unsubstantiated the credibility of pristina airport officials portraya l of procurement officer 1 as strong proponent of vendor 2 in divided committee was co ntradicted by the committee members themselves and undermined by pristina airpo rt officials misidentification of most of the members procurement officer 1s manage ment of the proceedings appears to have been fair and objective based on the assert ions of the members of the bid evaluation committee therefore this allegation is considered to be unsubstantiated allegation 5 that vendor 1 manager threatened procurement offi cer 1 6 29 the itf was unable to substantiate that vendor 1 managers utterances constituted threat against procurement officer 1 v recommendations 30 the itf offers the following recommendations recommendation 1 it is recommended that unmik pillar iv inform pro curement officer 1 and the finance officer as well as the kta interna l audit unit that the itf did not find any wrongdoing on the part of procurement officer 1 or the finance officer iv0446201 recommendation 2 it is recommended that unmik provide this report to both the department of justice and the financial investigati on unit for information purposes so as to assist current investigations related to the allege d payment of kickbacks in exchange for employment at pristina airport iv0446202
