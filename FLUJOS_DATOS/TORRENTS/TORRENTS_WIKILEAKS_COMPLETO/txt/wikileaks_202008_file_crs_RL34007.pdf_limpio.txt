rather it is inextricably linked to various issues that ve led most observers to conclude that the us immigration system is broken as not ed above many of the estimated 12 million unauthorized aliens in the united states likely have some form of immigration document that is either expired or counterfeit the integrity of the documents issued for immigration purposes and the capacity to curb immigration fraud are among the central themes that unde rlie the bigger issue of comprehensive immigration reform legislation the selected issues discussed below illustrate the complexity of this

perform the fraud detection nd investigation duties formerly handled by the ins complete transition did not occur in 2004 gao reported the difficulty between uscis and ice investigations regarding benefit fraud is not new as result some uscis field officials told us that ic would not pursue single cases of benefit fraud ice field officials who spoke on this issue cited lack of investigative

other findings the ig report concluded th at uscis security checks are overly reliant on the integrity of names and documen ts that applicants submit and that uscis has not developed measurable

are correctly completed47 most recently gao expanded on the concerns the dhs inspector genera l expressed in its report on uscis48 the extent to which uscis should have an enforcement arm to investigate benefit fraud and other adjudi cationsrelated violations has become policy issue although title iv of the homeland secur ity act of 2002 pl 107296 tasked ice with immigration enforcement responsibilities some maintain ices efforts are not sufficient pursuing single cases of bene fit fraud is not priority yet it is possible that some of these single cases may be linked together in larger fraud schemes that are overlooked without coordi nated big picture approac h this linkage has been characterized as critically important in the context of discerning terrorist travel49 priority of fraud investigations the observable decline in investigator work years allocated to document and benefit fraud has led some to question the federal governments commitment to the enforcement of immigration laws among those who would reform immigration law and policy the question arises as to wh ether current law is adequate but the dedication of resources is not this deba grows in importance when weighing the role bogus documents and benefit fraud play in facilitating other violations of law50 some argue that it is critical to investigate the black market in counterfeit documents and benefit fraud because it is especially important to international terrorists organized crime syndicates and alien smuggling rings all of whom rely on fraudulent documents to minimize detecti on they

should not be spent going after unauthorized aliens who presen t false documents so they can work they assert that the preponderance of counterfe it documents is used to obtain employment in the united states these critics agree that ice should prior itize the investigation of international terrorists organized crime syndicates and alien smuggling rings rather than shifting more resources to investigating what they consider to be the lesser threat of immigration fraud presumably that is solely to obtain employment52 new technologies and privacy concerns many observers look to emerging tec hnologies to enhance document integrity and stymie immigration fraud the basic concept is that card with personal identifiers embedded in it w ould be less vulnerable to c ounterfeiting identity theft and immigration fraud current issue is the integration of the competing biometric and in some instances radio frequenc identification rfi technologies and databases53 competing technologies the difficulties thus far in determining what biometric identifiers are most appropriate are exacerbated by the competing technologies used by the existing database s and systems the various key agencies eg cbp uscis and dos have already heavily invested in technologies that are not necessarily compatible with each other this issue most clearly manifests in the scarcity of card readers at ports of entry that are able to read the biometric information in green cards ser visas and biometric visas privacy concerns 2007 report of the national institute of standards and technology nist explains that privacy considerations exist when the technology uses collects stores or di scloses personal information54 according to nist for the purposes of current privacy regulation th most important
