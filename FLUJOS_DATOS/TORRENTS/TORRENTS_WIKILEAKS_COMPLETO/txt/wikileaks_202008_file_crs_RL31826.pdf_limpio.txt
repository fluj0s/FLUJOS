issuesprotecting the us perime ter border searches under the fourth amendment summary many border security initiatives were developed after the events of september 11 20011 because security initiatives often c ontain search and seizure component fourth amendment implications may arise the fourth amendment establishes that search or seizure conducted by governme ntal agent must be reasonable and that probable cause supports any judicially gr anted warrant the supreme court has interpreted the fourth amendment to incl ude presumptive warrant requirement on all searches and seizures conducted by the government and has ruled that any violations of this standard will result in the suppression of any information derived therefrom the supreme court however has also recognized situations that render obtaining warrant impractical or against the publics interest and has accordingly crafted various exceptions to the warrant and probable cause requirements of the fourth amendment few exceptions to the presumptive warra nt and probable cause requirements are more firmly rooted than the border sear ch exception pursuant to the right of the united states to protect itself by stoppi ng and examining persons and property crossing into the country routine border s earches are reasonable simply by virtue of the fact that they occur at the border courts have recognized two different legal concepts for authorizing border searches away from the actual physical border 1 searches at the functional quivalent of the border and 2 extended border searches courts have determined that border sear ches usually fall into two categories routine and nonroutine though this bifu rcation may longer apply to vehicle searches generally the distinction between routine and nonroutine turns on the level of intrusiveness routine border search are reasonable simply by virtue of the fact that they occur at the border and consist of only limited intrusion while non routine searches generally require reasonabl suspicion and vary in technique and intrusiveness though related to borde r search the suspicionless screening of passengers boarding an airplane is ba sed

policy seeks to balance legitimate crossborder commerce and travel with the right of the sovereign to protect itself from terrorist activities illegal immigrants and cont raband the events of ptember 11 2001 refocused attention on where the balance should be and new security initiatives were developed congress has acted on many of the recommendations of the 911 commission and those recommendations and other proposals continue to receive congressional attention security initiatives however often contai n search and seizure component that implicate fourth amendment protections the fourth amendment mandates that search or seizure conducted by governmental agent be r easonable and that probable cause support any judicially granted wa rrant although the supreme court has interpreted the language of the fourth amendment as imposing presumptive warrant requirement on all searches nd seizures conducte d by governmental authority the court has recognized excep tions few exceptions to the usual fourth amendment requirements are more firmly r ooted in the history of the united states than the border search exception based on the inherent authority of sovereign nation to regulate who and what comes within it routine border searches are reasonable simply by virtue of the fact that they occur at the border routine searches are usually very limited intrusions into persons privacy generally consist of document checks or patdown or the emptying of pockets and do not require suspicion of criminal ac tivity to be conducte d similarly limited inspections of cars generally do not require suspicion furthermore upon reasonable suspicion of smuggling or other illegal activity government officials may generally conduct nonroutine border search nonroutine searches may include destructive searches of inanima objects prolonged detentions strip searches body cavity searches and xray searches although there is support to require stronger suspicion requirement for some nonroutine border searches courts have interpreted supreme court precedent as warning against the development of multiple gradations of suspicion in th context of nonroutine border

granted warrant25 although the supreme c ourt has interpreted the reasonableness standard of the four th amendment to impose presumptive warrant requirement and individualized suspicion26 the court has recognized specifically established exceptions to th warrant and probabl cause requirements of the fourth amendment27 at its broadest fourth amendment analysis is twostage inquiry 1 whether the government action was sufficiently intrusive to constitute search or seizure and 2 whether the intrusion was reasonable in light of the circumstances28 reasonableness of government action is judged by balancing the governmental interest justifying the intrusion against persons legitimate expectation of privacy fourth amendm ent violation occurs when the government intrusion constituting the search or seizu re is not reasonable in light of these interests while violation of the four th amendment may result in the suppression of any information derived therefrom in judicial proceeding such rule does not apply to deportation proceedings29 searches search does not occur for pur poses of the fourth amendment unless 1 the individual exhibits an actua l subjective expectation of privacy in the searched object and 2 society is willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable30 legitimate expectations of privacy must have source outside of the fourth amendment either by reference to concepts of real or personal property law or to understandings that are reco gnized and permitted by society31 for example where the government uses remote surve illance device that is not in general

the supreme court has described seizure of property as some m eaningful interference with an individuals possessory interests in that property33 an individual is seized when government official makes person reasona bly believe that he is not at liberty to ignore the governments presence and go about his bus iness in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident34 additionally refusal to cooperate wit hout more does not furnish the minimal level of objective justification needed for detention or seizure35 seizure of person therefore can include full arrests investigatory detentions checkpoint stops for citizenship inquiries nd detentions of person against his will immigration seizures consensual encounter in which an immigration officer questions an alien about his identity is not necessarily fourth amendment seizure even if the alien is unaware that he has right not to answer36 furthermore questioning about immigration status in th absence of seizure does not require reasonable suspicion of alienage37 however there is fourth amendment seizure if the circumstances are so intimidating as to demonstrate that reasonable person would have believed he was not free to leave if he had not responded38 generally in order to detain without warrant person for questioning an immigration officer must have reasonable susp icion based on articulable f acts that the person being questioned is or is attempting to be engaged in an offense against the united states or is an alien illegally in the united states39httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31826crs7 40 act of july 31 1789 ch5

search is subject to an established exception the border search is wellrecognized and long established exception to the fourth amendments probable cause and warrant re quirements authorized by the first congress40 the border search exception has history older than the fourth amendment and obtains its broad power from congresss authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations and to enforce immigration laws41 the fourth amendment does not require warrants or probable cause for routine stops and searches at the border because the power to control who or what comes within its borders is an inherent attr ibute of national sovereignty42 although the border search is an excep tion to the fourth amendments warrant and probable cause requirement s it is not exempt from the fourth amendments reasonableness standard because search has still occurred ie the governments search is still subject to balancing test43 courts have determined that border searches usually fall into two categories routine and nonroutine though the supreme court has arguably sugge sted that this bifurcation may longer be appropriate for vehicular searches generally the distinction between routine and nonroutine turns on the level of intr usiveness routine border searches are reasonable simply by virtue of the fact th at they occur at the border and consist of only limited intrusion while nonroutine s earches generally require reasonable suspicion and vary in techni and intrusiveness bord er searches may occur when entry is made by land from the neighboring countries of mexico or canada at the place where ship docks in the united states after having been to foreign port and at any airport in the country where inte rnational flights firs t land in general authorities at the border may search pe rson

impossib ility of requiring the subject searched to stop at the physical border search occurs at the borders functional equivalent when 1 reasonable certainty exists that the person or thing crossed the border 2 reasonable certainty exists that there was change in the object of the search since it crossed the border and 3 the search was conducted as soon as practicable after the border crossing45 places such as international airports within the country and ports within the countrys territorial waters or stations at the intersection of two or more roads ex tending from the border exemplify such functional quivalents46 in general courts have gi ven the border geographically flexible reading because of the significan t difficulties in detecting the increasingly mobile smuggler extended border search the border search exception may be extended to allow warrantless searches beyond the border or its func tional equivalent under the extended border search doctrine government officials may conduc t warrantless search beyond the border or its functional equi valent if 1 the government fficials have reasonable certainty or high degree of probability that border was crossed 2 they also have reasonable certainty that change in the object of the search has occurred between the time of the border crossing and the search and 3 they have reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was occurring47 this threepart test ensures that suspect still has significant nexus with border crossing so that border officials can reasonably base their search on statutory and constitutional authority and to ensure that the search is reasonable48 although search at the borders functi onal equivalent and an extended border search require similar elements the extended border search entails greater intrusion on legitimate expectation of privacy and thus requires showing of reasonable suspicion of criminal activity another difference between the functional equivalent of border search and an extended border search is that the latter takes place after the first point in time when the entity might have been stopped within the country49 for example in united states v teng yang the seventh

states that permits the extension of the s earch rights of border authorities to allow nonroutine searches in areas near our nations borders51 because of the dynamics of crossborder travel the extended bor der search doctrine has gained wide acceptance among the courts because it strikes sensible balance between the legitimate privacy interests of the individual and societal interests in

examination of outbound materials59 and the inspection of luggage60 similar to routine searches border searches of vehicles generally do not require anyarticulable level of suspicion unless the agency action is especially destructive or intrusive see later discussion 61 the consistent approval of routine border searches by courts reflects longstanding concern for the protection of the integrity of the border it has long been established that an individuals reasonable expectation of privacy is lower at the border than in th interior of the country because person crossing the border is on notice that search may be likely his privacy is less invaded by those searches62 routine border searches are also arguably less intrusive because they are administered to class of people international

whether the suspects reasonable expectations of privacy if any were abrogated by the search64 nonroutine searches once personal search by government official goes beyond limited intrusion court may determine that nonroutine search has occurred nonroutine border searches may include destructive searches of inanimate objects prolonged detentions strip searches body cavity searches and some xray examinations65 at the very least it appears c ourts require government official have reasonable suspicion of illega l activity to conduct nonroutine border search on an individual entering the country66 the reasonable suspicion standard generally requires an officer at the borde r to have particul arized and objective basis for suspecting the partic ular person of wrongdoing67 for example in united states v forbicetta the court found reasonable suspicion to exist where customs officials acted on the following objective facts the suspect 1 arrived from bogota colombia 2 was traveling alone 3 d only one suitcase and items requiring customs inspection 4 was young clean looking and attractive and 5 was wearing loosefitting dress68 some courts however ve required higher degree of

supreme court concluded that third suspicion standard ie clear indication in addition to reasonable suspicion and probable caus was not consistent with the fourth amendments emphasis upon reasonableness in the prolonged detention setting71 the court determined that the clear indica tion standard suggestion that is free from doubt was to be used to indicate the necessity for particularized suspicion rather than as enunciating third fourth amendment threshold between reasonable suspicion and probable cause72 although the court has not articulated level of suspicion for all nonroutine sear ches courts have viewed the montoya hernandez reasoning as warning against the development of multiple gradations of suspicion for nonroutine border searches in general73 prolonged

fourth amendment simply because detainees intestinal fortitude leads to an unexpectedly long period of detention76 notably however the fifth circuit in united states v adekunle concluded that the government must within reasonable time generally within 48 hours seek judicial determination that reasonable suspicion exists to detain suspect for an extended period of time77 in general it seems that most prolonged detentions are classified as routine searches there appear to be hardandfast time limits that would automatically make routine search rise to the level of nonroutine search78 nor render non routine search conducted under the reasona ble suspicion standard unconstitutional79 rather courts must consider whether the detention of the tr aveler was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified it initially80 in order to provide perspective the 16 hour detention in montoya hernandez was considered non routine search justifiable by reasonable suspicions81 while the one hour vehicular search in floresmontano was considered routine82 the second circuit characterized four to sixhourlong detentions of individuals suspected of terrorist ties because of

appears to be unreasona ble to conduct such searches without reasonable suspicion84 often routine searches give rise to the reasonable suspicion required to conduct strip searches for instance in united states v flores upon discovering 600 small undeclared emerald st ones in the defendant s pockets during routine search customs agents conducted strip search and discovered an envelope of narcotics85 the court held that the prior discovery of the undeclared emeralds was clearly sufficient to heighten suspicion to the level necessary to conduct the strip search86 body cavity searches government officials are well aware that narcotic smuggling often has been concealed in the body cav ities of travelers and searches into such cavities have become more commonplace body cavity searches may include inspections of the vagina rectum or the use of emetics87 because of the extreme medical risks involved in internal drug smugglin g courts have determined that body cavity searches do not require th advance procurement of search warrant from magistrate88 nevertheless border offici must reasonably suspect that an individual is attempting to smuggle contraband inside his body for court subsequently to uphold body cavity search89 some courts hist orically required clear indication suggestion that is free from doubt of alimentary canal smuggling due to the significant intrusion beyond the bodys surface90 however ever since the supreme court articulated more general but firm rejection of the subtle verbal gradations being developed by courts of appeals to enunciate the fourth amendment standard of reasonabl eness courts have apparently been unwilling to adopt the clear indication standard in the context of body cavity searches91 additionally the manner in which the body

cavity s earches xray searches raise fourth amendment concerns because they locate items where there is normally an expectation of privacy their level of intrusion has been questioned by courts because they do not constitute an actua l physical invasion but can pose harmful medical effects95 question arises as to whet her an involuntary xray search is more akin to strip search and thus only requires reasonable suspicion for its application or whether the intrusion is so great that it could potentially require greater level of suspicion in examining this issue the eleventh circuit in united states v vegabarvo determined that an xray search is more intrusive than strip search96 the vega barvo court examined 1 the physical contact between the searcher and the person searched 2 the exposure of intimate body parts and 3 the use of force97 these factors helped the court examine the level of intrusiveness endur ed by the defendant and to ultimately conclude that the g overnment agents acting under reasonable suspicion of illegal activity properly detained and xrayed the smuggler the court reasoned that xrays do not require physi cal contact or usually expose intimate body parts the court also determined that an xray is one of the more dignified ways of searching the intestinal cavity98 in general courts have likened xray searches to strip searches and thus reas onable suspicion is the leve l of suspicion necessary to conduct an xray examination of spected alimentary canal smuggler99httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31826crs16 99 continued generally analogize xrays with

effect of multiple routine searches some have argued that subjecting an individual at the border to multiple routine searches during period of detention can rise to the level of nonroutine search the argument was raised in tabbaa v chertoff where the plaintiffs alleged that they were subjected to intrusive questioning patdown searches the forcib spreading of their feet and being fingerprinted and photographed all in the course of four to sixhour period of detention at the border100 the second circuit first not ed that based on prior case law each of the individual elements of the searches was routine101 however even though the court did leave open the possibi lity that in some circumstances the cumulative effect of several routine sear ch methods could render an overall search nonroutine the court did not find this par ticular sequence of search methods to be nonroutine102 this was because the decisive factor in determining whether search is nonroutine is in evaluating the invasiveness of privacy the search caused to the traveler rather than the leve l of inconvenience and in this particular case even taken collectively the searches were routine in the border context albeit near the outer limits of what is permissible absent reasonable suspici on103 thus although most cases of multiple routine searches will not ri to the level of nonroutine the second circuit does leave open the possibility that particularly long sequence of routine searches can rise to the level of nonroutine search searches and seiz ures of vehicles although early courts generally analyzed vehicular border searches within the context of the routinenonroutine dichot omy 2004 decision by the supreme court appears to have placed this bifurcation into question in united states v flores montano border search case that upheld the dismantling removal and reassembly of vehicles fuel tank th supreme court found that the dignity and privacy interests that require reasonable suspicion for highly intrusive searches of the person do not apply to vehicles being examined at the border104 the supreme court stated that the complex balancing tests to determine what is routine search of

th border was justified by the united states paramount interest in protecting itself and that it did not require reasonable suspicion106 in upholding the suspicionless s earch the court noted the factual difference between search that ultimately reassembles what is examined and those that use potentially destructive drilling practice107 it then determined that while it may be true that some searches of pr operty are so destructive as to require different result this was not one of them108 the court however left open the question of whether and under what ci rcumstances border search might be deemed unreasonable because of the particularly offensive manner in which it is carried out109 thus while suspicionless border search of vehicle seems to be viewed as reasonable because it does not pose the same degree of intrusiveness as searches of the human body especially structive vehicular searches may require reasonable suspicion110 subsequent ninth circuit decisions have determined that the routinenonroutine bifurcation in the vehicular inspection c ontext has been severely undermined if not completely overruled by floresmontano and have relied on the supreme court case to allow other suspicionle ss search techniques on vehicles111 in united states v cortezrocha for example the court upheld th suspicionless slashing of vehicles spare tire112 in so holding the
