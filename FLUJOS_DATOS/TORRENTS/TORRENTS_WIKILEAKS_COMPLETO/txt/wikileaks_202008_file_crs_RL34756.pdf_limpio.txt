domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34756nonmarital childbearing trends reasons and public policy interventions summary in 2006 record 385 of all united st ates births were nonmarital births many of these children grow up in moth eronly families although most children who grow up in motheronly families or stepparent families become welladjusted productive adults the bulk of empirical res earch indicates that children who grow up with only one biological parent in the hom are more likely to be financially worse off and have worse socioeconomic outcomes even after income differences are taken into account compared to children who grow up with both biological parents in the home in recognition of the potential longt erm economic and social consequences associated with nonmarital births the federa l governments strategy with regard to nonmarital childbearing has been varied th federal government recognizes that an effective approach for teenagers may be inappropriate for ol der women federal policy toward teens has primarily focu sed on pregnancy prevention programs whereas federal policy toward older women has focused on healthy marriage programs federal income support programs are available to mothers of all age groups in the us nonmarital births are wide spread touching families of varying income class race ethnicity and geographic area many analysts attribute this to changed attitudes about fertility and marriage they find that many adult women and teenage girls longer feel obliged to ma rry before or as consequence of having children with respect to men it appears that one result of the socalled sexual revolution is that many n now believe that women can and should control their fertility via contraception or abortion and have become less willing to marry the women they impregnate factors that are associated with the unprecedented level of nonmarital childbearing include an increase in the median age of first marriage ie marriage postponement decreased childbearing of married couples increased marital dissolution an increase in the number of c ohabiting couples increased sexual activity outside of marriage participa tion in risky behaviors that often lead to sex improper use of contraceptive methods and lack of marriageable partners this report analyzes the trends in nonmar ital childbearing discusses some of the characteristics of unwed mothers addresse s some issues involving the fathers of children born outside of marriage cove rs many of the reasons for nonmarital childbearing examines the impact of nonm

married mother in the us births to unmarried women ie nonmarital birt hs are widespread touching families of varying income class race ethnicity and geographic area many analysts attribute this to changed attitudes bout fertility and marriage they find that many adult women and teenage girls longer feel oblig ed to marry before or as consequence of having children during the 66year period from 1940 to 2006 the percentage of births to unmarried women increased by multiple of nine from 38 in 1940 to 385 in 2006 this represente d about 16 million children in 2006 nonmarital births can be first

children may have had one or more births within marriage and one or more births outside of marriage1 many of the children born outsi of marriage are raised by single parent who may or may not have

and manages the re sources that meet childs basic needs while also playing an instrumental role in stimulating the childs cognitive social and emotional development children bor n outside of marriage

in which the mother is cohabiting with male partner become welladjusted pr oductive adults large body of research indicates that children who grow up with onl one biological parent in the home are more likely to be financially worse ff and have worse socioeconomic outcomes even after income differences are take n into account compared to children who grow up with both biological parents in the home3 to emphasize this research indicates that all family situations in which both biological parents are not living together regardless of whether the mother is divorced separa ted widowed or was never married are more likely to result in less favorable outcomes for children than family situation in which the child is living in household with both biological parents it is also noteworthy that some researchers conclude that even among children living with both biological parents living with married parents generally results in better outcomes for children than living with cohabiting parents mainly because marriage is more stable and longer lasting situation than cohabitation4 the federal concern about nonmarital ch ildbearing centers on its costs via claims on public assistance these federal costs primarily reflect the fact that many of these nonmarital children are raised in singleparen t families that are financially disadvantaged federal concern also aris because of the aforementioned research indicating that children living in singleparent families are more likely to face negative outcomes financially socially and emotionally than children who grow up with both of their biological parents in the home as mentioned earlier many children born outside of marriage are raised in singleparent families5 this report analyzes the trends in nonmar ital childbearing in the

report often uses the term women in describing data that include females who are under age 18 9 elizabeth terryhumen jennifer manlove and kristen moore births outside of marriage perception vs reality research brief child trends april 2001key findings nonmarital childbearing sometimes results in negative outcomes for children mainly because children born outside of marriage are generally not raised by both of their biological parents but ra ther by single mothers children living in household maintained by nevermarried mother are among the poorest population groups in the us even in cases in which cohabiting parents start off raising their children together it is often of shor t duration this section presents some of the major findings of the report after stabilizing in the 1990s nonmar ital births are again increasing in 2006 385 of all births were nonm arital births this surpasses the percentage in 1960 that prompted some policymakers to claim that the black family was disint egrating because large share of nonmarital births were to black women in 2006 707 of african american births were nonmarital births compared with 646 of american indian birt hs 499 of hi spanic births 266 of white births and 163 of asian births6 nonmarital births can be first birt hs second births or higherorder births they can precede marriage or occur to woman who has never married nonmarital births can occur to divorced or widowed women moreover woman with several children may have had one or more births within marriag and one or more births outside of marriage7 after declining for 14 straight years all teen births increased in 2006 contrary to public percepti on women in their early twenties not teens have the highest percenta ge of births outside of marriage in 2005 women ages 20 through 24 accounted for 38 of the 15 million nonmarital births the comp arable statistic for females under age 208 was 23 however many women who have nonmarital births in their twenties were also

an impor tant component of nonmarital births because more than 80 of births to teenagers are nonmarital births although women have been postponi ng marriage women of all ages do not view marriage as requirement for sexual activity10 with the longer time span between the onset of sexual activity and marriage the trend of high numbers of nonm arital births may could continue although nonmarital births are incr easing many more children than in previous decades live with both biological parents in cohabiting situations for some period of time according to analysts marriage is considered better option for children than cohabitation because marriage is more stable ie lasts longer than cohabiting situations growing up in singleparent family is one of many factors that put children at risk of less favorable outcomes the economic social psychological and emotional costs associated with children with absent noncustodial parents are si gnificant nevertheless most children who grow up in single parent families become productive adults children living in singleparent home are more likely to do poorly in school have emotional and behavioral problems become teenage parents and have povert ylevel income as children and adults compared to children living with married biological parents11 in 2007 678 of the 737 million us children under age 18 lived with both of their married parents 29 lived with both parents who were not married 179 lived with their mother and 26 lived with their father the advent of multiple relations hips that produce children adds complexity to the problem these relationships often referred to as multiple partner fertility ie when mothers and fathers have had children with more than one partner generally complicate the family situation of children httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34756crs5 12 andrea kane and daniel t lichter re ducing unwed childbearing the missing link in efforts to promote marriage center on children and families brief 37

children women with children who were born outside of marriage are less like to marry12 if they do marry their spouses are more likely to be economically disadvantaged13 demographically without nonmarital births the us would be far below population replacement levels having the birth rate reach the replacement rate is generally considered desirable by demographers and sociologists because it means country is producing enough young people to replace and support aging workers without population growth being so high that it taxes national resources nonmarital births are expected to increase over time because of projected population sh ift toward more minorities the census bureau projects that by 2050 54 of the us population will consist of minority groups ie hispanics blacks indians and asians minorities now roughly onethird of the us population are expected to become the majority in 2042 with the nation projected to be 54 minority in 2050 by 2023 minorities will represent more than half of all children the hispanic population is projected to nearly triple and its share of the nations total population is projected to double from 15 to 30 thus nearly one in three us residents will be hispanic14 in 2005 48 of hispanic births were nonmarital birthshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34756crs6 15 even though one of the underlying purposes of this report is to discern why women get pregnant outside of marriage this report solely uses birth data rather than pregnancy data the reason for this is that birth data are more current and reliable than pregnancy data because of the difficulty in gathering the abor tion and miscarriage data needed to calculate pregnancy data pregnancy data lag about tw to three years behind birth data reports 16 the proportion ie percent of births that occur to unmarried women is sometimes referred in the literature as the nonmarital birth ratiotrends in nonmarital births 19402006 in this report births to unmarried wo men are termed nonmarita l births data on nonmarital births15 are usually expressed by three measures the number of nonmarital births the percent of births that are nonmarital and th rate of nonmarital births per 1000 unmarried women the number of nonmarital births provides th absolute count of babies who are born to women including adolescents w ho are not married the percent of all births that are nonmarital16 is the number of all nonmarital births divided by all births both nonmarital births and ma rital births the nonmarita l birth rate is defined as the number of nonmarital birt hs per 1000 unmarried women during the 66year period from 1940 through 2006 there was 17fold increase in the number of babies born to unmarried women living in the united states the number of babies born to unmarried women increased from

slowing of nonmarital births dropping from an average increase of 64 year in the 1980s to an average of 12 year in the 1990s du ring the first six years of the 2000 to 2010 period the average annual increase in nonmarital births increased to 36 the percent of births to unmarried women increased substantially during the period from 19402006 see figure 2 and the appendix table however from 19942000 there was almost change in th is measure in 1940 38 of all us births were to unmarried women by 2006 record 385 of all us births were to unmarried women httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34756crs7 17 the nonmarital birth rate during this period ranged from 429 to 443 births per 1000 unmarried women ages 1544the nonmarital birth rate provides meas ure of the likelihood that an unmarried woman will give

her income status whether or not she marries and whether or not she is in cohabiting relationship some of the highlights include the following black women are more likely to ve children outside of

among women with less education than among welleducated women substantial share of nonmarital bi rths 44 were to women who had already given birth to one or more children significant number of unwed

called the negro family the case for national action21 one theory that attempts to explain the disproportionate share of nonmarital births to black women hypothesi zes that the universe of males ages 15 and above who are unmarried is disproporti onately lower for blacks for example in 2005 there were 74 black unmarried male s for every 100 unmarried black females 87 white nonhispanic unmarried males fo r every 100 unmarried white nonhispanic females 98 asian unmarried males for every 100 asian unmarried females and 113 hispanic unmarried males for ever 100 hispanic unmarried females22 supporters of this theory argue that if the universe of possible marriage pa rtners is reduced to desirable marriage partners eg hetero sexual men men with steady jobs men without criminal record and men with similar educational background the black male shortage is drastically increased23 age teen marriage and birth patterns have sh ifted from general trend of marrying before pregnancy to

born to unwed teens there are two reasons for this phenomenon the first is that marriage in the teen years which was not uncommon in the 1950s has become quite rare as men tioned earlier the typical age of first marriage in the us has risen to 255 for women and 275 for men the second is that this general trend of marriage post ponement has extended to pregnant teens as well in contrast to the days of the shotgun marriage very few teens who become pregnant nowadays marry before their baby is born26 contrary to public perception it is not t eenagers but rather women in their early twenties

marriage fathers of children born outside of marriage it has been pointed out that fathers are far too often left out of discussions about nonmarital childbearing it goes without sayi ng that fathers are an integral factor in nonmarital childbearing it appears that one result of the soca lled sexual revolution was that many men increasin gly believed that women coul d and should control their fertility via contraception nd abortion as result ma ny men have become less willing to marry the women they impregnate57 there are myriad reasons why so many children live in homes without their fathers some reasons are related to choices people make bout fertility marriage and cohabitation but others are the result of unexpected events such as illness or incarceration some noncustodial

several ears older than his female partner some data indicate that the man is three or more years older than the woman in almost four in 10 relationships today theref ore it is not unexpected that similar pattern exists for sexually active teenagers however such age differences often have adverse conse quences for young women60 several studies have found that the unequal power dynamic that is often present in relationships between teenage girls and older men is more likely to lead to sexual contact not wanted by the female less frequent use of contraceptives and greater incidence of

social security and possibly veterans benefits it also may be important for the health of the child for doctors to have knowledge of the fathers medical history the ch ild also may have chance to develop relationship with the father and to develop sense of identity and connection to the other half of his or her family the public policy interest in paternity establishment is based in part on the dramatic increase in nonmarital births over the last several decades and the economic status of single mothers and their child ren the poorest demographic group in the us consists of children in singleparent families paternity establishment generally is seen as means to promote the social goals of 1 providing for the basic financial support of all minor children regardless of th marital status of their parents 2 ensuring equity in assessing parental liability for the financial support of their children and 3 promoting responsibility fo r the consequences of ones actions68 many observers maintain that the social psychological emotional and financial benefits of having ones father legally identified are irrefutable they suggest that paternity should be establis hed regardless of the ability of the father to pay child support they argue that the role of bot h parents is critical in building the self esteem of their children and helping the children become selfsufficient members of the community current literature and studies suggest that in most cases visitation with the noncustodial parent is important to the healthy emotional deve lopment of children children with

for the increase in nonmarital childbearing declining marriage rates increased childbearing among unmarried women increased number of unmarried women in the childbearing ages ie 1544 and decreased childbearing among married women have contributed to the rising share of children being born to unwed women many social science analysts attribute the increase in nonmarital births to the decadeslong decline of shotgun marriages rather than to an increased incidence of nonmarital conceptions they contend that when the social pressure to get married once pregnancy became obvious ended th likelihood that women would marry between conception and birth decreased substantially70 the entry of more and more women into the paid labor force also made childbearing outside of marriage more economically feasible through the 1960s most americans belie ved that parents should stay in an unhappy marriage for the sake of the childre n by the 1970s this view was not as prominent divorce and not getting

analysts agree that marriage is now more likely to be viewed through framework of adult fulfillment rather than through framework of childbearing and childrearing71 factors that have contributed to an unprecedented level of nonmarital childbearing include an increase in the median age of first marriage ie marriage postponement delays in childbearing of married couples increased marital dissolution an increase in the number of c ohabiting couples increased sexual activity outside of marriage participa tion in risky behaviors that often lead to sex improperhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34756crs24 72 in general the use of contraceptives has incr eased substantially over the last twenty years and women have become more proficient in properly using contraceptives thus contraceptive misuse or nonuse is not discussed in this report as reason for increased nonmarital childbearing nonetheless it is im portant to note that shifts in the types of contraceptives used has had offsetting influenc on the risk of unintended pregnancy the chances of contraceptive failure including thod failure and incorrect or inconsistent use in the first 12 months of use are higher fo r the condom 14 than for oral contraceptives 8 and lowest for injectables 3 impl ants 2 and sterilization thus the mix of methods used by women included greater pr oportions of both more effective and less effective methods source

does not try to verify refute or support any of the reasons commonly cited for nonmarital births instead its purpose is to give the reader better understanding of the nonmarital birth phenomenon by synt hesizing and simplifying the large body of research on the subject and presenting the views of analysts and other observers in way that helps to clarify the complexity of the topic demographic fact ors contributing to the increase in the number and percen t of nonmarital births the combined factors of more unmarried women of childbearing age in the population and the increased birth rates of unmarried women resulted in dramatic increases in the number of nonmarital births over the last several decades the text box shows that the percentage of women of childbearing age increased about 16 during the period from 1960 to 1990 from 397 to 460 table 3 shows that the percent of women who never married increased from 119 in 1960 to 220 in 2006 an 85 increase in addition the percent of all births to unmarried women rose substantially over the last several decades as well the reason for the increase was primarily due to three concurrent demographic factor s first the number and proportion of unmarried women increased as more and more women from the baby boom generation postponed marriage postponement of marriage since the 1960s couples have postponed marriage table 2 shows that in 1950 and 1960 the dian age at first marriage was 228 years for men and 203 years for wome n in 2006 for both men and women the median age at first marriage had increased by more than four

the proper progression by most americans75 today most americans continue to view marriage as natural stage in life they also generally perceive marriage as way toward personal growth and deeper intimacy some view it as way to share ones life with someone in committed loving relationship76 others view it as sa fe haven that imbues sexual faithfulness emotional support mu tual trust and lasting commitment77 others are more cynical and view it as relationship mainly designed for the sexual and emotional gratification of each adult78 although attitudes towards marriage ve changed most people eventually marry and the desire to marry is widespr ead generally teens think that having good marriage is important and most say that it is likely they will get married but they are less than

1987married is considered accepta ble by most young people79 moreover sex outside of marriage especially for adults is almost considered the norm and has virtually stigma attached to it there is much agreement that the link between marriage and parenthood has weakened considerably many policymakers contend that the link must be firmly reestablished for the wellbeing of children and the good of the nation80 lack of marriageable partners the socalled shortage of marriageab men both the number of unmarried men and the quality of unmarried men as viewed in terms of their ability to support family has been cited as one expl anation for declining marriage rates and to lesser extent for why nonmar ital childbearing has increased81 in effect although some women may have sexual relations with certain men it does not mean that they consider those men to be viable marriage partners national survey of unmarried adults under age 35 found that more than tw othirds of the women surveyed and one third of the men said that they would be not at all willing to marry someone who was not likely to hold steady job this sentiment was shared across racial and ethnic groups82 nonetheless the shortage of marriageable men argument is primarily associated with black men and women in the truly disadvantaged william julius wilson argued that as rates of employment and rates of labor force participation dropped for young black men the number of desirable marriage partners for black women also decreased83 in other words many black women and women generally limit their marriage universe to men with steady jobs and other desirable attributes biological cl ock issues women may choose to have children outsi of marriage because of concerns that they are older unmarrried and ma longer have the

many children born outside of marriage are born to cohabiting parents rather than to biological parents who live in separate households nonetheless it is generally agreed that coha biting relationships are less stable than marriage in 1977 there were 11 m illion fa mily households with children under age 18 that consisted of cohabiting couples in 2007 64 million family households with children under age 18 consisted of cohabiting couples thus in that 30year period cohabiting c ouples as share of all family households increased from 2 to 82 according to one report just as it has become more common for couples to have in tercourse and to live togeth er without marrying it has become more likely that couples who conceive outside marriage will remain unmarried85 growing up with two conti nuously cohabiting biological parents is rare the fragile families study indicates that about onefourth of cohabiting biological parents are longer living together one year after the childs birth86 another study of first births found that 31 of cohab iting couples had broken up after five years as compared to 16 of married couples study using the 1999 national survey of american families

side of the issue on the whole for children twoparent families are preferable to singleparent and stepfamilies103 others assert that although marriage of biological parents is associated with greater child wellbeing little is known about why or how much of the relationship is caused by marriage and how much by other factors in other words it could be that the effect of marriage on child wellbeing is derived not from marriage itself but rather from the distinctive characteristics of the individuals who marry and stay married sometimes referred to as the selection effect104 it is sometimes argued that some of the problems associated w ith nonintact families may be the effect of poverty rather than the fathers absence further most children who grow up in motheronly families or stepparent

state and local costs 701 billion of which is federal costs106 the report states that these costs arise from increased taxpayer expenditures for antipoverty criminal justice and education programs and

specific estimates cited were 23 billion in child welfare benefits 19 billion in health care expenses 21 billion in spending on incarceration for the sons of women who had children as adolescents and 63 billion in lost tax reve nue because of lower earning s of the mothers fathers and children when they were adults dded to these cost figures are 36 billion in savings that result from the declines in births to teens112 research indicates that teens who give birth are less likely to co mplete high school and go on to college thereby reducing their potential for economic selfsufficiency the research also indicates that the children of teens are more likely than children of older parents to experience problems in school and drop out of high school and as adults are more likely to repeat the cycle of teenag pregnancy and poverty the 2006 report contends that if the teen birth rate had not declined between 1991 and 2004 the annual costs associated with teen childb earing would have

at which given generation can exactly replace itself the fertility level require d for natural replacement of the us population is about 21 births per woman ie 2100 births per 1000 women the replacement rate was reached in 2006 for the first time in many years116 given that the marital birth rate has been decreasing over time if the birth rate of unmarried women had begun to revers itself the us population would cease growing if the immigration factor is excluded117 from geopolitical perspective this means that those who support policies to lower nonmarital fertility do so at the risk of lowering overall u s fertility that has been hovering near replacement levels118 in the united states nonhispanic white women and asian women 40 to 44 years old had fertility leve ls below the replacement vel 18 and 17 births per woman respectively the fe rtility level of black women ages 40 to 44 20 births per woman did not differ statistically from the natural replacement level119 hispanic women ages 40 to 44 had an average of 23 births and were the only group that exceeded the fertility level required for na tural replacement of the us population120 nonmarital births are also

childbearing has been varied the federal government acknowledges that an effective approach for teenagers may be inappropriate for older women some observers criticize women much farther along the age

single motherhood is the norm who entrench themselves and their children in less favorable economic lifestyle by having child outside of healthy marriage many of these women become mothers in their teenage years in order to address these two distinct groups of females federal policy toward teens has primarily focused on pregnanc prevention programs whereas federal policy toward older women has

youth did not differ in their rates of unprotected sex either at first intercourse or over the last 12 months overall the programs improved identific ation of stds but had overall impact on knowledge

comprehensive approach to sex education argue that todays youth need information and decisionmaking skills to make realistic practical decisions about whether to engage in sexu activities they contend that such an approach allows young people to make informed decisions regarding abstinence gives them the information they need to set relationship limits and to resist peer pressure and also provides

limited by methodologi cal problems or constraints because the approach taken is so multilayered that resear chers have had difficulty disentangling the effects of multiple components of program in other cases the approach may have worked for boys but not for girls or vice versa in some cases the programs are very small and thereby it is harder to obtain significant re sults in other cases

sexual activity sex education mentoring and counseling health care academic support career counseling cris is intervention sports and arts activ ities and community volunteer experiences youth programs receive funding from wide array of sources including the federal government state and local governments community organizations private agenci nonprofit organizations and faithbased organizations the sex education component of many youth programs usually includes an abstinence message which enables teens to avoid pregnancy along with discussions about the correct and consistent use of contraception which reduces the risk of pregnancy for sexually active teens there is significant difference between abstinence as message and abstinenceonly interventions although the bush administration continues to support an abstinenceonly program intervention with some modifications others argue that an abstinence message integrated into comprehensive sex educati on program that includes information on the use of contraceptives and that enha nces decisionmaking skills is more effective method to prevent teen pregnancy recent na tionally representative survey found that 90 of adults and teens agree that young pe ople should get strong message that they should not have sex until they are at least out of high school and that majority of adults 73 and teens 56 want teen s to

religious services are more likely to delay sexual initiation 2 girls who participate in sports also delay sex longer than those who do not and 3 teens whose friends have high educati onal aspirations who avoid such risky behavior as drinking or using drugs and who perform well in school are less likely to have sex at an early age than teens whose friends do not144 some youth programs have an underlying goal of trying to decipher the root reasons behind teen pregnancy and childbearing is it loneliness or trying to find love or sense of family is it carelessness not bothering with birth control or using it improperly or shame not wanting to go to the doctor to ask about birth control or not wanting to be seen in pha rmacy purchasing birth control is it need to meet the sexual expectations of pa rtner is it trying to find individual independence or is it defiance mentality of you cant boss or control im grown is it trying to validate or provi purpose to ones life is it realistically facing the probability that the entrylevel job she can get at the age of 18 is the same or similar to the one she will likely have when she is 30 thus why should she wait to have child in addition many youth programs also want to prevent second or additional births to teens and they realize that di fferent approach may be needed to prevent secondary births as compared to first bi

and less likely to live in poverty further mothers who choose to give up their infants for adoption are more likely to marry than those who parent their baby164 although adoption is not an interventi on to negate nonmarital childbearing it does present an alternative living arrangem ent for children born to unmarried parents adoption is the legal process of adding person to an existing family adoption unlike foster care is meant to be permanent the goal of adoption is to provide lifelong security to the child according to some studies children placed in adoptive homes have better scores in school and engage in ss delinquent behavior than children raised by single parent165 shotgun marriages and adoption were once viewed as the common remedies for nonmarital birth even so historica lly

other wo rds by raising the cost of fatherhood to unmarried men effective paternity establis hment and child support enforcement deter nonmarital births170 in contrast stronger child support enforcement may reduce the cost of children for women making them more willing to have children outside of marriage171 however according to recent evid ence once single woman becomes mother her

termed outofwedlock out side of marriage or nonm arital births the stigma and shame that had once been attached to these children is longer recognized by the public175 further some commentators argue that the facts have been twisted in such way that mothers are justified in having nonmarital birth and that having baby without husband represents higher level of maternal votion and sacrifice than having baby with husband176 they assert that it is often the case that adults pursue individual happiness in their private re lationships which is in direct conflict with the needs of children for stability security and permanence in their family lives177 some observers contend that the probl em is not the weakening of marriage about 75 of all women ages 15 and older eventually marry but rather

that there is widespread agreement that healthy stable ie low conflict family with two biological parents is the best environment for children179 finally some observers assert that we as society have not strayed too far and that it is not too late to return to the somewhat oldfashioned but not simplistic precept of falling in love getting married and having baby in that order180 although marriage and family life are gene rally considered private issues they have become part of the pub lic arena primarily because of public policies that help families affected by negative outcomes associ ated with nonmarital births to maintain minimum level of economic sufficiency181 the abundance of research on the subject of the impact on children of various living environments also raises the stakes in that it is now almost unanimously agreed that children living with both biological parents fare better on host of measures economic social psychological and emotional than children liv ing with single parent or in step parent or cohabiting situation182 one of the things that this report highlig hts is that although there has been rise in nonmarital births it does not mean that ther has been subsequent rise in mother only families instead it reflects the rise in the number of couples who are in cohabiting relationships because the number of women living in cohabiting situation has increased substantially over th last several decades many children start off in households in which both of their biological parents re side nonetheless cohabiting family situations are disrupted or

attention and more debate in congress although this report does not base the analysis of increased nonmarital childbearing by segmenting teen births from other births it is important to note that more than half of first nonmarital births are to teens this means that policies that are successful in reducing births to teenagers would significantly lessen the pr oblem of nonmarital childbearing

birth d child born outside of marriage for women ages 20 through 24 the percentage was almost 60 these figures reflect the new paradigm of women in all age gr oups not just teenagers having children outside of marriage some observers and analysts assert that new strategies that account for this new paradigm must be veloped to significantly reduce nonmarital births others argue that the nation must decide whether to try to change the fertility behavior of women in their thirties and forties they contend that given the new economic framework and the scarcity of resources in most areas of public finance it may be wiser to pursue strategy that focuses primarily on adolescents and women in their early twenties given the patterns of swift transitions in to and out of marriage and the high rate of single parenthood family policy that relies too heavily on marriage will not help the many children who will live in singleparent and cohabiting families many of them poor during most of their formative years184 moreover national data from the 2002 panel of the national survey of family growth indicate that 14 of white men 32 of black men and 15 of hispan ic men had children with more than one woman185 thus children in the same family may potentially face different outcomes for example children with the same mother and different fathers may potentially face less desirable outcomes if their mother marries the biological father of their halfbrothers or halfsisters186 the advantages married couples and th eir children have over those in other living arrangements led the bush adminis tration and congress to propose marriage promotion initiatives the knowledge that american society has changed in ways that will longer pe rmit all ch ildren to live with their biological parents led the bush administration and congress to support responsible fatherhood programs both the healthy marriage programs and the responsible fatherhood programs were funded by the same legisl ation ie pl 109171 under the auspices of the tanfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34756crs54 187 the healthy marriage program and the responsible fatherhood program are designed to accommodate individuals of all ages although individual programs may cater to persons in specific age groups administrators of the pr ograms point out that the message of the programs are applicable to persons of all ages from teens to middleaged couples 188 although several evaluations are underway to scientifically determine whether healthy marriage programs and responsible fatherhood programs work they are many years from impact findings most are still at the in itial stage of providing information on the implementation of the programs 189 the animosity mainly centered around funding concerns in some of the early proposals marriage promotion initiatives were earmarked up to five times as much money as fatherhood initiatives supporters of responsible fatherhood programs argued that the promotion of marriage debate was overshadowin g the precept that fathers should participate in the lives of their children regardless of the marital status of the parents 190 also it is interesting to note that many analysts contend that the many of the soft skills individuals learn in healthy marriage or res ponsible fatherhood programs are transferrable to the workplace they assert that skills such as being able to communicate effectively with others being consistent and being ontime are abilities that may help individuals gain entry into the workforce as well as he lp them advance in their jobs 191 both abstinenceonly education programs nd comprehensive sex education programs are currently focused on middleschool and highschool aged children 192 shari l dworkin and john santelli do abstinenceplus interventions reduce sexual risk behavior among youth public li brary of science medi cine september 18 2007block grant program187 the rationale for implementing these two approaches in complementary manner was to promote the best interest of children188 although there was some animosity be tween proponents of healthy marriage programs and proponents of re sponsible fatherhood programs189 when they were debated during the period from 2001 through 2005 there is growing consensus that the two programs can be implemented in complementary manner to promote the best interest of children190 some of the impact analysis on the two programs based on scientifically designed ev aluations with experimental and control groups is to be completed during the next congress this may help the 111th congress and the new administration to determine whether or not they need to shift priorities between the programs redistribute funding or make other changes that will improve the effectiveness of both programs similarly there is now some disc ussion about middle ground between abstinence education and comprehensive sex education191 some call this approach abstinenceplus under the abstinenceplus education approac h participants are given hierarchy of safesex strategies at the top of the hierarchy is the promotion of sexual abstinence as the safest rout to pregnancy prevention and hiv and std prevention recognizing that some particip ants will not be abstinent the abstinence plus approach encourages individuals to use condoms and to adopt other safersex strategies192 proponents of the abstinenceplus approach contend that it does not encourage teens or young adults to have mo re sex it just encourages them to do so safely if they do have x some policymakers main tain that this middle ground approach accepts the reality that sexual activity among older teens and young adults is an entrenched byproduct of todays soci ety they argue that it is not bad policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34756crs55 but rather good planning to educate persons who thought they would remain abstinent until marriage but do not with the appropriate information regarding contraceptive methods they contend that an abstinenceplus education approach is in the best interest of young people nd in the best interest of the nation as mentioned earlier federal funding is specifically earmarked for comprehensive sex education some obs ervers contend that the debate over abstinenceonly education versus comprehensive sex education will likely continue for several more years they surmise that the issue of which approach is more appropriate and more effective for adoles cents and older teens may receive renewed attention by the 111th congress and the new administration they also note that the abstinenceplus approach may be further scrutinized within the context of the debate on abstinenceonly versus co mprehensive sex
