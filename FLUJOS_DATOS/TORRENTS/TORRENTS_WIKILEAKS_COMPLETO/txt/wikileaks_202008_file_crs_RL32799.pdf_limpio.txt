total fe deral research funding the sum of basic and applied research is pr ojected to increase 1 billion to 57 billion however the majority of that increase would go to nasa while most of the remaining federal agencies would receive below inflation increases for research funding while the president essentially requested flat funding for the department of defense dod rd programs congress approved an timated 721 billion dod rd 42 increase over fy2005 funding leve ls most of that increase is result of congress increasing dods proposed science and technology budget by 25 billion more

this requested reduction and allocated 35 million and 51 m illion respectively for directed projects the final bill restored the entire reduction with 130 million for congressionally directed projects to improve utilization of office of science research facilities in seve ral programs the house nd senate provided 66 million and 100 million respectively to fund in creased facility operating time the

while the senate increased it by 73 million the final bill provided 34 billion an increase of 147 million above the re quest within these totals the house increased inertial confinement fusion and reduced most other programs the senate did the pposite c ompletely eliminating funding for continued construction of the national ignition facility and the final bill approx imately accepted the house

million and the chemical agents and munitions destruction program 48 million the sixyear budget plan estimates spending 4046 billion for rdte through fy2011 when compared to last years budget estimate funding for rdte would be reduced by nearly 9 billion between fy2006 and fy2009 reflecting an overall re duction in the dods proposed budgets to help reduce the fe deral budget deficit while the

development 61 62 and 63 activitie s in the rdte account the fy2006 st request represents nearly 20 reduction from fy2005 st funding not counting inflation all dollar figures and comparisons made in

chemical and biological defense program which would be increased by 34 over half of dods basic research budget is spent at univers ities and represents the major contribution of funds in some areas of science and technology the fy2006 st request is 25 of the overall department of defense budget request of 4193 billion this is below the 3 target that both the bush adminis tration and congress ve set the fy2006 budget request for missile defense rdt is 78 billion decrease of 1 billion from the amount available for missile defense in fy2005 the house approved its defense appr opriations bill hr

space shuttle program would be terminated in 2010 when space station construction is expected to be completed us space station res earch activities would be descoped from the broadlybased program that was planned to only research needed to support extended stays by humans on the moon and eventual trips to mars and nasa would end its involvement in the space station program by 2016 by terminating the shuttle and space station earlier than expected and re ducing funding for space station research those funds can be redirected to accomplis hing other aspects of the vision nasa is building new crew exploration vehi cle cev and launch vehicle for it the crew launch vehicle or clv whose prima ry purpose is transporting astronauts to and from the moon it also could be used to take astronauts to and from the space station the president directed that the cev be available by 2014 but nasa administrator michael griffin wants to accelerate that to 2012 in order to minimize the gap between the

act congress expressed its support for the vision but stressed th at nasa needs to maintain balanced program that includes aerona utics and science other issues include whether the shuttle should be terminated in 2010 or re tained until the cev is available and whether us use of the space station s hould end in 2016 and its research agenda narrowed or if nasa should continue using it as originally planned see crs issue brief ib93062 space launch vehicles governm ent activities commercial competition and sate llite exports and crs issue brief ib93017 space stations both by marcia s

mission had been pl anned prior to the 2003 space shuttle columbia accident but thennasa administrator okeefe canceled that mission primarily because of shuttle safety concerns hu bble advocates sought reversal of that decision arguing that hubble can continue to deliver important sc ientific data for many more years if the new instruments and other equipment ar installed nasas current administrator dr griffin pledged to revisit the hubble issue after the space shuttle completes its two return to flight missions and its current safety characteristics are better understood the firs t
