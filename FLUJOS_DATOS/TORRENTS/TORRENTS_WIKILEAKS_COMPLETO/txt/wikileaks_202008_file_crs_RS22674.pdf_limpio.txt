action in support of recovery such response presumes the existence of an ongoing functional government to fund support and oversee recovery efforts to support the provision of essential government activities nspd 51hspd 20 sets out policy to maintain comprehensive and effective continuity capability composed of continuity of operations6 and continuity of government7 programs in order to ensure the preservation of our form of government under the constitution and the continuing performance of national essential functions nef under all conditions the directive identifies eight nefs that are the foundation for all continuity programs and capabilities and represent the overarching responsibilities of the federal government to lead and sustain the nation during crisis these are as follows ensuring the continued functioning of government under the constitution including the functioning of the three separate branches of government 8 providing leadership visible to the nation and the world and maintaining the trust and confidence of the american people defending the constitution of the united states against all enemies foreign and domestic and preventing or interdicting attacks against the united states or its people property or interests maintaining and fostering effective relationships with foreign nations protecting against threats to the homeland and bringing to justice perpetrators of crimes or attacks against the united states or its people property or interests providing rapid and effective response to and recovery from the domestic consequences of an attack or other incident protecting and stabilizing the nations economy and ensuring public confidence in its financial systems and 6 nspd 51hspd 20 identifies continuity of operations coop as an effort within individual executive departments and agencies to ensure that primary missionessential functions continue to be performed during wide range of emergencies including localized acts of nature accidents and technological or attackrelated emergencies 7 nspd 51hspd 20 identifies continuity of government cog as coordinated effort within the federal governments executive branch to ensure that national essential functions continue to be performed during catastrophic emergency catastrophic emergency is defined as any incident regardless of location that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties damage or disrupti on severely affecting the us population infrastructure environment economy or government functions 8 the directive notes that each branch of the federal government is res ponsible for its own continuity programs and requires an official designated by the chief of staff to the president to ensure that the executive branchs coop and cog policies are appropriately coordinated with those of the legislative and judicial branches in order to ensure interoperability and allocate national assets efficiently to maintain functioning federal government the legislative branch and the federal judiciary maintain continuity programs consonant with their positions as coequal branches of government nspd 51hspd 20 does not specify the nature of appropriate coordination with continuity planners in the legislative and judicial branch httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22674g16g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g5g152g151g157g146g151g158 g146g157g162g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g497

51hspd 20 re quires that continuity planning be incorporated into the daily operations of all executive departments and agencies executive branch continuity planning emphasizes g eographic dispersion of leadership staff and infrastructure to alternate facilities to incr ease survivability and maintain uninterrupted government functions the directive requires the application of risk management principles to ensure that appropriate operational readiness decisi ons are based on the probability of an attack or other incident and its consequences by mandating planning based on risk analysis

implementation of continuity policy for executive branch departments and agencies in consultation with the heads of appropriate executive departments and agencies the ncc was required to lead the development of national continuity implementation plan for submission to the president 10 nspd 51hspd 20 does not explicitly specify the appropriate departments and agencies the directive specifies continuity policy coordination committee cpcc chaired by senior director from the homeland security c ouncil hsc staff appointed by the ncc and designated as the main daytoday forum for continuity policy coordination but also indicates that the ncc will coordinate with the assistant to the president for national security affairs the directive designates the secretary of homeland security as the presidents lead agent for coordinating overall continuity operations and activities of executive departments and agencies other than explicitly denying the ncc the capacity to exercise directive authority the extent to which any official charged with continuity coordinating responsibilities can enjoin executive branch agencies to comply with their guidance or recommendations is unclear 11 9
