legislation establishing committee be fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed and that the commissions recommendations not be inappr opriately influenced by th appointing authority or by any special interest in the 35 years since facas enac tment in 1972 congressional oversight hearings have revealed that while facas original goals were still relevant some of its provisions were in need of clar ification from 1983 through 1989 legislation was introduced in the senate to strengthen facas management controls as well as to establish new ethical financ ial and conflict of interest disclosure requirements for committee members4 in 1997 faca was amended to provide for public observation of meetings of committees created by the national

the complete text of the statutory charters for these 12 commissions can be found at the end of this report commission establishment commissions establishment is generally prescribed in brief introductory paragraph in the first section of the enacting statute the commission on online child protection20 was established as follows there is hereby established temporary commission to be known as the commission on online child protection for the purpose of conducting study under this section regarding methods to help reduce access by minors to material that is harmful to minors on the internet sometimes legislation may authorize an agency head to create an advisory panel at later date as illustrated by the following language the secretary of the treasury should establish an internati onal monetary fund advisory committee 21 as stated earlier the president also has the authority to establish his own commissions by executive order cong ress can also authorize national or presidential study bodies by statute as it did when it established the presidents council on counternarcotics22 this 18 member council chaired by the president is mandated to advise and assist the president in overseeing and coordinating national drug cont rol strategy commission mandate often one of the initial sections of statute establishing major advisory committee provides congressional findings identifying the c onditions justifying the creation of panel for instance the tablishment authority for the trade deficit review commission23 contained six major findings pe rtaining to us trade andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30260crs5 24 112 stat 2681210 25 112 stat 2681722 26 112 stat 2681689account deficits that led to congressional determin ation of the need to authorize commission study section on duties nd functions generally specifies the commissions mandate or responsib ilities the statutory charter of the national commission on terrorism24 prescribed three specific duties for the commission to review and assess the federal statutes and policies relatin g to counterterrorism and to recommend changes in preventing and punishing intern ational terrorism directed toward this country study commissions objectives and the scope of its activities are best stated in specific terms to guide the panels members and staff in carrying out their responsibilities ideally the assigned obj ectives of commission should be realistic and manageable taking into consideration the time needed for appointment of staff research and approval of the commissions final report the legislation authorizing the trade deficit review commission containe d separate issues to be addressed section listing eight specific areas for review as the commission undertakes its deliberations and research in preparation of the final report membership requirements membership requirements in faca are broad enough to allow great deal of discretion in determining the compos ition of commission therefore the membership of an advisory committee will often depend upon its functions and mandate the legislation mandating commission may require that particular federal officials serve as members the pres idents council on counternarcotics is composed of 18 members including the president vice president and other cabinet officers such as the secret aries of state treasury fense transportation health and human services and education the advisory commission on electronic commerce25 requires membership consisting of the secretaries of commerce and treasury and the united states trade re presentative the president may also be required to make appointme nts to major policy commissions created by congress the 16member parents advisory council on youth drug abuse26 specifies four presidential appointments from the private sector major policy commissions often requi re membership appointments by congressional leaders the statutory charter for the trade deficit commission contains the following memb ership requirements the commission shall be composed of 12 members as followshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30260crs6 27 112 stat 2681220i three persons shall be appointed by the president pro tempore of the senate upon the recommendation of the majority leader of the senate after consultation with the chairman of the committee on finance ii three persons shall be appointed by the president pro tempore of the senate upon the recommendation of the nority leader of the senate after consultation with the ranking minority members of the committee on finance iii three persons shall be appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives after consultation with the chairman of the committee on ways and means and iv three persons shall be appointed by the minority leader of the house of representatives after consultation w ith the ranking minority member of the committee on ways and means commission charters may also require that members be appointed from the private sector to represent particular interests scientific or technical advisory committees are likely to have majority of members who have specialized backgrounds but are still representative of di fferent points of view or employment members appoi nted to the international monetary fund advisory committee are required to include representatives from industry agriculture organized labor banking and financia l services environmental nd human rights organizations the selection of members representing di fferent points of view helps to ensure that commissions final recommendations or report does not give the appearance of being inappropriate ly influenced by any special interests faca does not provide guidance on th number of members commission or committee should have or their terms of appointment the membership generally should be large enough to allow for represen tation of differing points of view and to facilitate quorum for commission meetings advisory committees of shortterm existence usually keep the same memb ers for the committees duration with any vacancies filled in the same manner as the original appoin tments were made some advisory panels ma have staggered membersh ip terms so that only one portion of the members will be new at any given time thereby ensuring continuity in the committees operations the 16 member s of the parents advisory council on youth drug abuse are appointed to three year terms however five of the initial appointments are for oneyear term and an additional five appointments are for term of two years to ensure staggered terms of office it is also possible for enabling legislation to specify how officers of an advisory panel are to be selected the chairman of the 11member international financial institution advisory commission27 for example is designated by the majority leader of the senate after consultation with the speaker of the house and the minority leaders of the house and the senate in contrast the chairman and the vicechairman of the parents advisory council on outh drug abuse are chosen by the commission membership the chairman assigns committee duties relating to the council such as authorizing the executive director to convene hearings and other administrative businesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30260crs7 28 112 stat 2681637the statutory authority of th sevenmember denali commission28 authorizes the governor of alaska or an individual selected by the governor to serve as the state cochairperson in addition federa l cochairperson is appointed by the secretary of commerce from nominations submitted by the president pro temporare of the senate and the speaker of the hous the federal cochairperson serves as an employee of the department of commerce and may be remove d by the commerce secretary for cause this individual is res ponsible for developing research plan and also casts the deciding vote in the event of tie vote by the commission members member compensation and travel expenses advisory panel members who are not fede ral employees or officers may or may not receive compensation for their work on commission members of the national commission on terrorism who are not govern ment employees are paid at rate not to exceed the daily equivalent of the annual rate of basic pay prescribed for level iv of the executive schedule under section 5315 of title 5 united states code for each day including tr avel time during which such member is engaged in performing the duties of the commission they may also be allowed travel expenses and per diem at rates authorized for employees of agencies under subchapter i of chapter 57 of title 5 united states code while away from their homes or regular places of business in the performance of services for the commission commission staffing pressures of time are often not compatible with an advisory committees mandate for detailed research and inve stigation and staff must be quickly assembled generally speaking the staff is composed of the executive director staff members and consultants the quality of the final report can produce tension between the staff members and commission members however commission members make the final decisions on conflicting interpretations and recommendations provisions in the legislation creating the trade deficit review commission authorize the chairman without regard to the title 5 requirement s to appoint and terminate an executive director subject to confirmation by the commission the chairman may compensate the executive director and staff without regard to the provisi ons of chapter 51 and subchapter iii of chapter 53 of title 5 united states code relating to classification of positions and general schedule pay rates except that the rate of pay for the executive director and other personnel may not exceed the rate payable for level v of the executive schedule under section 5316 of such title httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30260crs8 the trade deficit commission is also authorized to obtain administrative support services from the general services administration on reimbursable basis advisory panels may also use the servi ces of outside consultants and experts as defined in 5usc3109b the denali commission contains language authorizing the chairman to employ temporary and inte rmittent services at pay rates not to exceed the daily equivalent for leve l v of the executive schedule federal employees may also be detailed to staff an advisory committee the commission on online child protection for exam ple is authorized to request staff and necessary resources from the departme nt of commerce statutory language creating the national commission on terrorism authorizes the chairman to request the detail of any federal agency personne l without reimburse ment to assist in carrying out its duties commission reports commission may be required to prepare an interim an annual or final report for transmittal to the president and congress or other department heads these reporting requirements usua lly can be found under the duties or functions sections of panels statutory charter or special section may mandate the production of final report the parents advisory council on youth drug abuse is authorized to issue annual reports in addition to any other reports or recommendations it considers ppropriate to the director of national drug control policy and subsequently to congress since the recommendations contained in the final report are only advisory changes in public policy occur on the authority of commission therefore the implementation of such recommendations is dependent upon their expression in statute or presidential or agency directive as appropriate to ensure greater accountability for nd oversight of panels final report specific provisions can be included in the establishment authority to require follow up or implementation of the final recommendations as an example the international financial advisory commissions statutory mandate requires the president through the secretary of the treasury to repor t to the appropriate oversight committees within three months after receiving the commissions final report and recommendations in addition the president through the secretary of the treasury must report annually on the implementa tion of any of the commissions final recommendations for three years follo wing the commissions termination another approach is to require commission to incorporate its final recommendations into formal legislative or administrative language the final report of the advisory commission on electronic co mmerce must include such legislative recommendations as required to address the findings of the commissions researchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30260crs9 29 this information is available at httpfidogovfacadatabasepowers of commission explicit authority is needed for accomplishing the special duties for which an advisory committee might be responsible vesting commission with subpoena power however is done on very selec tive basis depending largely upon the investigatory mission of the panel in nother example the trade deficit review commission is authorized to hold hearings take testimony receive evidence and use the franking privilege in the same manner as other federal agencies at the request of the chairperson the commission may also secure information directly from any federal agency bylaws and procedural requirements specific procedural requirements can of ten be found in the statutory mandate that establishes an advisory panel for example the national commission on terrorisms enabling statute contains section entitled administrative matters which sets requirements fo r meeting times and quorums commission statutes can also contain references to ot her procedural rules such as voting requirements election of chairperson membership vacancies and appointments unless otherwise addressed in co mmissions statutor mandate gsas designated federal officers are responsible for implementing the procedural rules pertaining to approving and calling advisory committees approving agendas adjourning meetings and chairing meetings when directed by agency heads commission funding gsa reported that in fy2007 federal departme nts and agencies spent total of 6269 million to operate advi sory panels compensate members and reimburse travel and per diem expenses of this total nearly 1547 million was spent to reimburse federal sta ff support assigned by the agencies to assist and monitor their advisory committees29 commissions may be direc tly funded by congress or provided with monies indirectly through general agency appropr iations as in the case of the commission on online child protection congress has au thorized onetime appropriation of 2 million for the trade deficit review commission for fy1999 while the national commission on terrorism is authorized 20 million for fy1999 and such sums as may be necessary for fy2000 through fy2003 although it happens rarely federal advisory commission can also receive funds from private sources the advi sory commission on electronic commerce is authorized to accept use and dispose of gifts or grants of services or property both real and personal for purposes of aiding or facilitating the work of the commissionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30260crs10 gifts or grants not used at the expira tion of the commission shall be returned to the donor or grantor in addition to its congressional funding the denali commission is also authorized to accept and dispose of gifts dona tions of services or property when allowing the acceptance of priv ate gifts or donations the commissions statutory mandate might also include re ference to the accounting procedures that may be necessary to allow for public disc losure of said funds if commission does not receive congressional funding or agency sponsorship thought must be given as to how the proposed panel will go about finding suitable office space or administrative assistance in general ideally statutory provision in the commissions mandate w ill provide the necessary guidan ce if not the newly formed commission will find itself at disadvantage that could hinder and adversely affect the research and work of the group faca exemption congress may exempt an advisory pane l from faca requirements as was done in the case of the commission on online child protection and the denali commission when commission is exempted from facas guidelines it also is exempted from complying with gsas management guidelines for advisory committees as result commission would not be required to file an annual report with gsa with membership funding and mee ting data it would not ve to publish advance notice of meetings in the federal register however the final recommendations of commission can be criticized or ignored if it is perceived that its findings are made without regard to public par ticipation and the considerati on of diverse points of view commission termination unless statutorily mandated or otherwise extended by the president or federal officer an advisory committ ee will automa tically terminate two years after its establishment consequently most advisory committees must be rechartered with gsa every two years most statutory national study commissi ons are mandated so as to terminate 30 days after the submission of final reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30260crs11 appendix commissions created by the omnibus
