bolle specialist in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division summary since 1993 the administration has negotia ted and congress s approved 10 free trade agreements ftas that contain bor provisions with different degrees of enforceability three more with colombia peru and south korea await congressional consideration this report id entifies two types of labor forcement issues 1 those that relate to the fta provisions themselves including their definitions and their enforceability and 2 those that relate to executive branch responsibilities such as resource availability and determining dispute settlement case priorities this report will be updated as events warrant background the inclusion of enforceable labor provisions that is those subject to dispute resolution procedures in various trade pr omotion authorities and free trade agreements negotiated under them has evolved slowly1 at first us trade policy focused on lowering tariffs on goods it was later ex tended to various type s of nontariff barriers labor provisions have not been part of multilateral trade agreements because the regulation of labor was generally considered to be dom estic issue and not applicable to trade early on the responsibility for monitoring labor protections fell to the international labor organization ilo founded in 1919 and now an arm of the united nations for nearly 90 years the ilo has been workin g to create through adoption at its annual international labor conferen ces of member countries conventions which set international standards the ilo has adopted at least 183 conventi ons eight of which reflect four core labor standards this occurred when first social summit in copenhagen denmarkhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22823crs2 2 united nations world summit for social development copenhagen march 612 1995 3 ilo declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work and its followup about the declaration from the ilo website at httpwwwiloorg 4 see httpwwwwtoorgenglishthewto_eminist_emin96_ewtodec_ehtmin 1995 declared that four categories of princi ples and rights at work are fundamental 1 freedom of association and collective bargaining 2 the elimination of forced labor 3 the elimination of child labor and 4 the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation2 the ilo then responded by pulling these together as the 1998 ilo declaration on fundamental principl and rights at work and its followup the declaration commits all ilo member states whether or not they have ratified the specific conventions to resp ect the labor principles in these four key areas the follow up among other things calls for reports by veloping countries th at have not ratified one or more of the core conventions on the status of implementing the various rights3 meanwhile on separate track the united states had unilaterally promoted the development of list of standards similar to those in the ilo declaration through its trade preference laws for developing countri these trade preference laws cover four programs the generalized system of preferences gsp 1975 the caribbean basin initiative cbi 1983 the andean trade preference act atpa 1991 and the african growth and opportunity act agoa 2000 these laws all require that as condition of obtaining and maintaining program eligibility beneficiar countries must be taking steps to afford their workers internationally recognized worker rights these rights are listed in trade act of 1974 as amended sec 507 as similar to ilo core labor standards listed above except the us list substitute s for d above labor standards relating to minimum wages maximum hours and occupational safe ty and health in 1996 backed by the united states nd other developed c ountries th then124 member wto debated whether to form co mmittee to look into the relationship between trade and labor standards developing countries in the majority were concerned that even studying the relationship between trad and labor standards could affect their comparative advantage in lowcost labor ultimately they prevailed the singapore ministerial declaration reporting on what they decided stated that the ilo rather than the wto would be the competent body to set and deal with internationally recognized core labor standards4 the ilo has enforcement tools but rather promotes labor standards through consensus mo ral suasion and t echnical assistance inclusion of labor and envi ronment provisions in bilateral us trade agreements came about incrementally the first two us ftas with israel 1985 and canada 1988 did not include labor provisions even though such provisions already existed in the gsp and cbi legislation this pa ttern began to change after 1993 when number of factors came into play first the united states be gan to undertake fta negotiations with lesser developed countries second it became incr easingly accepted that labor issues were related to trade and trade policy third c onsensus broadened that globalization had both costs and benefits the benef its tend to be broadly disperse d and include relatively higher economic growth and productivity and greater access to lowerpriced goods the costs tend to be concentrated in importcompeting sectors where there may be downward pressure on wages and job displacement in developing countries pressures to becomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22823crs3 5 governments would not expect or intend to apply the agreements dispute settlement continueda lowcost producer can lead to diminishe d working conditions and diminished worker rights fourth business groups have increas ingly been willing to make some concessions to labor groups in order to promote trade ag reements and pave the way for greater trade with and investment in developing countries labor enforcement in u s free trade agreements since 1993 the united states has negotiate d 13 ftas that include 19 countries these are chronologically the north am erican free trade agreement nafta with mexico and canada bilateral agreements with jordan chile si ngapore australia morocco bahrain and oman regional ag reement known as caftadr with the dominican republic and the five central amer ican countries costa rica salvador guatemala honduras and nicarag ua and bilateral ftas w ith peru colo mbia panama and south korea the last four agreements reflect bipartisan compromise on labor language as delineated in the new trade policy with america jointly agreed to by the leadership in congress and the administr ation on may 10 2007 this policy calls for among other things two key labor provisions in ftas the first is fully enforceable commitment that fta countries will adopt maintain and enforce in their laws and practice the basic international bor standards as stated in the 1998 ilo declaration the second is the use of id entical enforcement provisions for labor and commercial disputes labor and enforcement provisions in these various trade agreements can be categorized into four different models model 1 for nafta labor provisions are included in the north american agreement on labor cooperation naalc side agreement rather than in the main agreement under naalc countries agree to enforce their own labor laws and standards however under naalc the only provision enfo rceable with sanctions is partys persistent pattern of failure to effectively enforce its ccupational safety and health child labor or minimum wage technical standards where that failure is traderelated and covered by mutually recognized labor laws article 29 by co mparison all provisions relating to commercia l operations are enforceable under the nafta furthermore the labor side agreement has different enforcement procedures than does the main agreement and places limits on monetary enforcement asse ssments with suspension of benefits for noncompliance there are m onetary assessments under the nafta model 2 i n t h usjordan free trade agreement labor provisions and commercial provisions share the same dis pute resolution procedures among labor provisions parties agree to not fail to effectively enforce its labor laws in manner affecting trade article 64 under the jordan agreement labor laws are defined as us internationally recognized worker rights all labor provisions and commercial provisions are equally enforceable if the dispute is not resolved under procedures specified the affected party shall be entitled to take any appropriate and commensurate measure article 172b however in an exchange of letters between the ustr robert zoellick and jordanian ambassador marwan muas her before congress considered the implementing legislation in 2001 the govern ments reportedly agreed to resolve any potential disputes without re sorting to trade sanctions5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22823crs4 5 continued enforcement procedures in manner that results in blocking trade jordan free trade agreement approved by finance and ways and means inside us trade july 27 2001 6 text congress administration trade deal inside us trade may 11 2007 and trade facts bipartisan trade deal office of the ustr bipartisan agreement on trade policy may 2007model 3 seven trade agreements with 12 di fferent countries chile singapore australia morocco bahrain oman and the six caftadr countries include only one enforceable labor provi sion each country shall not fail to eff ectively enforce its labor laws in manner affecting trade between the parties the agreements define labor laws as partys statutes or regulations th at are directly related to the list of us internationally recognized worker rights all provisions in these agreements relating to commercial operations are enforceable the seven trade agreements share many of the same procedures for labor nd commercial disputes proce dures for labor disputes place limits on monetary penalties whereas those for commercial disputes do not suspension of benefits is last recourse option for both types of disputes model 4 on may 10 2007 the democratic leadership in congress and the administration agreed to new trade policy for america it included four enforceable labor concepts which pending free trade agr eements with peru colombia panama and south korea would be amended to include these are 1 fully enforceable commitment that parties to free trade agreemen ts would adopt and maintain in their laws and practices the ilo declaration 2 fully enforceable commitment prohibiting fta countries from lowering their labor standard s 3 new limitations on prosecutorial and enforcement discretion ie countries cannot defend failure to enforce laws related to the five basic core labor standards on the basis of resource limitations or decisions to prioritize other enforcement issues and 4 the same dispute settlement mechanisms or penalties available for other fta obligations such as commercial interests6 the four concepts have been inserted into all four agreements as template language agreed to by the administration and cong ressional leadership and then inserted into all four agreements in virtually identical form the template language appears to limit item 1 in the new trade policy described above by including two footnotes to the key provision that each party shall adopt and maintain in its statutes regulations and practices the rights as stated in the ilo declaration and its followup the first footnote limits obligations of parties to those specified in the ilo declaration ie without also including the followup described on p 2 th second footnote requires that party seeking to challe nge violations must demonstrat that the failure to adopt or maintain ilo core labor standards has been in manner affecting either trade or investment between the two c ountries article 17 footnote 1 of the fta with peru in model 4 agreements there are caps on penalties only the agreement with peru has been approved by congress at th is time pl 110138 december 14 2007 enforcement issues based on the differences between labor and commercial fta pr ovisions articulated in the four models policy issues can be di vided into two categories the differences in labor vs commercial provisions themselv issues 13 below and the differences stemming from the agencies charged with that enforcement issues 4 and 5 belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22823crs5 7 see httpwwwdolgovilabprogramsnaosubmissionshtm 8 see crs report rl33864 trade promotion authority tpa renewal core labor standards issues by mary jane bolle 9 see ustr trade facts labor may 2007 which says in part as with commercial provisions panel decisions are not selfexecuting that is they would not alter us law1 only some labor provisions are enforceable under models 2 and 4 all labor provisions in trade agreements are enforceable in models 1 and 3 only certain labor provisions in trade agreements are enforceable all commercial provisions in trade agreements are fully enforceable under all models under nafta covered by model 1 the labor side agreement naalc as mentioned includes one enforceable provision country must enforce few of its labor standards those relating to child labor minimum wages and occupational safety and health country is not required to enforce its laws relating to the most basic core labor rights the right to organize and bargain collectively issues which account for 16 out of the 21 labor submissions filed with naalc 7 the ftas covered by model 3 also include only one enforceable labor provision but it is broader in scope than that in the naal c countries must enforce all of their own laws relating to internationally recognized worker rights in manner affecting trade between the parties 2 different enforcement procedur for and caps on penalties for labor provisions model 1 has separate and dissimilar enforcement procedures for labor as opposed to commercial disputes m odel 3 has relatively s imilar procedures for both types of disputes however both place caps on potential maximum monetary penalties for labor disputes but place caps on pena lties for commercial disputes models 2 and 4 have the same enforcement procedures for labor and commercial disputes and place caps on penalties 3 limits placed on scope of defini tion of term in labor provisions labor provisions in model 4 agreements are fully enforceable through the same dispute resolution procedures available for commercial disputes however footnote limits key labor provision that count ries adopt and maintain in their laws and practices the rights as stated in the ilo declaration the footnote limits the scope of the definition as mentioned by saying the obligations set out in article 172 as they relate to the ilo refer only to the ilo declaration this would suggest that trading partners could be held to the principles of the declaration but not the details of the conventions and not the followup procedures the house committee report on the usperu trade promotion agreement implementation act hrept 110421 is silent on the issue the us council on international business usc ib the american affiliate of the international chamber of commerce argues that if trading partners were held to the details of conventions supportin g the standards number of us labor laws could need to be changed to comply with the ilo core labor standards as defined and clarified by the various conventions8 the department of labor argues and ustr statement reiterates that while us labor laws c ould be challenged under the agreement challenge could not force change in us labor laws rather the ultimate recourse under an fta would be suspension of trade benefits9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22823crs6 10 phone conversation

assistant ustr for labor april 4 2008 4 differentials in federal resources available for labor as compared with commercial disputes in the us government there appears to be sizable differential between support av ailable to enforce labor pr ovisions and support available to enforce commercial provisions of trade agreements for nonagricultural commercial provisions monitoring and enforcement activities are centered in the department of commerce doc international trade administration itas office of market access and compliance mac mac has budget for fy2008 of 46 million within the itas budget of 412 million for labor provisions these activities are centered in the department of labor dol bureau of inte rnational labor affairs ilabs office of trade and labor affairs otla the otla does not have budget line item it is one of three offices in ilab whose budget for fy2008 is 81 million after the president initially requested 14 million congress re stored the difference up to the 81 million for international laborre lated grants and contracts the department of labor states that while the dol budget for monitoring and forcement may seem small compared with the doc budget it is large in proportion to th relative number of provisions in the trade agreements for labor vs commercial operations the doc receives complaints about comp liance with trade agreements from the macs trade compliance center tcc hotline industry groups trade associations congress us foreign commercial service officers the ustr national trade estimates report and other sources it uses its many resources to conduct re search on compliance cases10 for the dol there is comparable hotline for reports of alleged labor violations in other countries the dol states 1 that its core mission is primarily to protect the needs of us workers rather th an those of other countries which is where complaints about labor conditions related to trade agreements typically arise and 2 that its international responsibilitie s include ensuring complian ce with labor provisions of trade agreements and trade preference programs the dol receives information on foreign labor conditions from number of sources including trade unions congress department of state labor officers at u s embassies and the state departments country reports on human rights practices the dol like the doc may take action to resolve an issue at any stage prior to dispute resolution11 any case not so resolved may be referred by the respective agency to the office of the ustr 5 priorities for disputes to be pursued by the ustr to date labor dispute under any of the free tr ade agreements has reached the ustr therefore this discussion is purely hypothetical should case not be resolved short of dispute resolution the ustr must d ecide which cases it will pursu based on priorities the ustr is small operation entering into th dispute resolution process is lengthy involved expensive process in terms of both personnel and resources the ustr typically chooses cases to pursue based on number of factors these may include cases that could showcase or clarify particular issues strengthen support of us positions reflect political considerations andor be cases the ustr believes it can win
