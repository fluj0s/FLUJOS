eo 12958 decl 06302016 tags prel sp subject scenesetter for secretary rices june 1 visit to madrid classified by ambassador eduardo aguirre for reasons 14 b d summary 1 c dear secretary rice i welcome you to spain on behalf of our 367 american and spanish colleagues serving the united states at mission spain your visit is milestone in our work together with you to overcome the differences over iraq with the spanish government and convince them that further strengthening cooperation coincides with spains national interest at the same time your visit can serve as catalyst to encourage spain to become an even more active but responsible member of transatlantic partnership marked by cooperative efforts on our shared values including counterterrorism and promoting democracy freedom and human rights throughout the world this means that you will need to speak frankly to the spanish government about cuba despite their desire to avoid the issue the issue need not be the central one in rich agenda on wide variety of fronts in which we work closely with spain however cuba must be an element of your discussions on democracy and spains own special responsibility as democracy leader that has successfully undergone the transition from dictatorship to thriving democracy your discussions will also include kosovo afghanistan spains osce chairmanship russia iran iraq latin america and the middle east moratinos will raise thorny childcustody case involving spanish woman currently jailed for contempt of court in new jersey your interview with the spanish press will provide an opportunity to reach out to the spanish people and underscore the significant value of our alliance and convey our views on issues on which we differ we see this visit as great opportunity to advance our relations with spain and the spanish government shares this view end summary 2 c the spanish government has long awaited your first visit as secretary of state and views it as sign of the importance of strong usspain relations they will use your visit to counter criticism that the zapatero government has shattered the transatlantic relationship per the spain strategy you approved two years ago we have sought to move this government away from visceral and reflexive antius policies and sentiments carving out areas in which zapateros government can offer support for the presidents broad global agenda we have made clear to the zapatero government that the price of our willingness to publicly promote good bilateral relations is real contributions on world issues while we have made some positive headway the zapatero government has not hesitated on occasion to pursue an agenda counter to our own when deemed in the socialist partys domestic political interest your visit should encourage spain to be an even more active member of transatlantic partnership that works cooperatively in pursuit of shared values on freedom democracy human rights and development xxxxxxxxxxxx 18 c two important bilateral issues fall in the judicial area moratinos has said he will raise with you the child custody involving spanish citizen maria jos carrascosa who is currently jailed for contempt of court in bergen county new jersey for failure to return her child to the us as required by new jersey court decision during this political season in madrid the case has become cause celebre with pictures of carrascosa viewed as mother separated from her child in handcuffs entering the new jersey prison the gos agrees that this is case for the courts and both governments agree that mediation of the dispute is the appropriate response however moratinos for political reasons has to show the government is doing something about the case on our side you should note continued usg concern about the court case against the three us servicemen charged with alleged war crimes8 in the case of the death of spanish tv camerman jose couse in the palestine hotel in baghdad in 2003 the gos has been helpful behind the scenes in getting the case appealed by the spanish prosecutor the case now moves to the appeals tribunal of the national court which will rule on the substance of the charges we want continued vigilance and cooperation by the gos until the case is dropped 19 c moratinos holds you in very high regard and values the contacts that he has had with you your efforts and those of other senior usg officials along with mine to help guide moratinos on key issues such as handling russia in the osce and on the full range of middle east issues can prove effective the more outreach the better as we try to play to his desire to have role on major issues while helping to direct some of these efforts toward policies that work to support us global objectives 20 u you may want to congratulate moratinos on the upcoming celebration of the 50th anniversary of the commission for cultural educational and scientific exchange between the united states and spain the fulbright commission and express how you look forward to hearing more about the events planned to take place in washington to commemorate this major milestone the spanish fulbright commission the second largest in europe is truly binational organization with the majority of funding provided by the spanish central government as well as regional autonomous communities and private sector entities 21 c in all you will find rich agenda with spain which your visit can advance substantially again welcome to madrid we are looking forward to your visit on june 1 aguirre
