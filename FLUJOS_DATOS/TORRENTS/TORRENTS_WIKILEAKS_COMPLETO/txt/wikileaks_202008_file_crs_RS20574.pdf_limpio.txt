httpwwwbeptreasgovfigureshtmeisenhower dollar coin the anthony dollar is 1043 inches in diameter and weighs 81 grams total of 8475 million anthony dollar coins were minted for circulation in 1979 and 1980 the anthony coin program was not successful negative public reaction and the decision not to eliminate the 1dollar note are given as the two major reasons for the failure1 major criticism of the anthony dollar was that it resembled the quarter too closely in size appearance and color two countries with coinage and currency systems similar to the united states australia and canada initiated successful dollar coin programs in the 1980s in both countries the dollar coin was distinguished by different color the two countries phased out the dollar note when they created the dollar coin in addition both countries had successfully circulating 2dollar bill while the anthony dollar failed the economic and practical interests supporting us dollar coin program remained advantages of coin cost advantages major savings component of successfully circulating dollar coin stems from the life expectancy of coin versus paper dollar the 1dollar note has an average circulation life of 17 months while the circulation life of coin has been estimated at 30 years the cost of producing the coin is greater 08 verses 035 but the durability of the coin would outweigh the difference because of the public demand for the dollar2 in fy 1999 the treasury produced 45 billion 1dollar notes which accounted for 40 percent of the total production of all denominations of currency for the year from fy 1980 to fy 1999 the number of 1dollar notes printed annually more than doubled from 19 billion to 45 billion3 treasury production costs would be greatly reduced if dollar coin gained widespre ad circulation and significantly reduced the demand for 1dollar notes additional savings would be realized from reduced processing costs the federal reserve system incurs the costs associated with servicing circulating currency and coin when federal reserve banks receive deposits of currency from financial institutions they must distinguish these on notebynote basis counterfeit and unfit currency is identified and destroyed notes fit for reintroduction into circulation are used to fill future currency orders coin operations consist primarily of storage and distribution but not processing because coins are not generally piece verified rather coin bags are weighed to verify the value of the coin receivedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20574crs3 4 1dollar coin reintroduction could

the one dollar coin hearing 104th congress 1st session may 3 1995 p168in 1992 the federal reserve using model it had developed calculated savings estimate for dollar coin program savings were estimated over 30year period for this estimate it was assumed that the 1dollar note would be phased out and completely replaced by the 1dollar coin in addition based on experience in other countries it was assumed that 25 percent of the demand for 1dollar notes would be replaced by demand for 2dollar notes and two 1dollar coins would replace each remaining 1dollar note general accounting office report discussed their findings may 1992 federal reserve study indicated that the united states government could save 395 million per year on average over 30 years by substituting 1 dollar note with 1dollar coin the annual average savings would consist of 1 109 million from not having to print 1dollar notes 2 47 million in lower federal reserve processing costs of notes in circulation and 3 430 million in interest avoided from the decreased government borrowing resulting from seigniorage recognized on dolla r coin less 4 20 million in startup costs and 5 171 million in lost earnings on 1dollar notes4 the federal reserve provided an updated savings estimate during 1995 hearings on the 1dollar coin question the new estimate was 460 million per year on average over 30 years5 major portion of this savings would come from anticipated seigniorage seigniorage is the difference between the face value of coin and the coins cost of production these costs include the metal used coinage processing operations transportation costs and related overhead seigniorage appears as balance held by the federal reserve for the treasury after newly manufactured coins are deposited with federal reserve banks seigniorage is not considered as part of the budget it does not directly offset expenditures instead seigniorage is used to reduce the amount of money that must be borrowed from the public to finance deficit and in turn interest which must be paid on these borrowings in times of budget surplus seigniorage allows the treasury to redeem more debt than it otherwise could thus reducing interest which must be paid to the public the accounting and budget processes for currency notes are different the federal reserve system is required to hold portfolio of government securities equal to the value of the federal reserve notes outstanding paper money issued into circulati on the federal reserve transfers the earnings on these securities to the treasury and the federal budget accounts treat these earnings as miscellaneous receipt the federal reserves savings estimate includes deduction for earnings lost by stopping the production of paper dollarshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20574crs4 6 the united states 1 coin act of 1997 hr 2637 hearing 105th congress 1st session october 21 1997 171p 7 us library of congress congressional research service

many commercial situations6 circumstances where coin could be useful included pay phones vending machines municipal transit systems and toll booths the mass transit administration of maryland where the anthony dollar has been used as token for the baltimore subway system is often cited as an example in additi on in the mid1990s the us postal services stamp machines began to give change using the anthony dollar many proponents of us dollar coin have argued that the 1dollar note must be eliminated from circulation if the 1dollar coin is to achieve widespread circu lation in addition proponents have urged vigorous marketing and public education campaign to promote public acceptance of the changes past experience with the anthony dollar and the 1976 2dollar bill neither of which achieved wide circulation has shown the resistance of the american public to changes in coin and currency in addition co circulation of the coin and note could prove troublesome to retailers judging customer demand for 1dollar notes and coins could be problem as well as arranging space in the cash drawers new dollar coin the united states 1 coin act of 1997 was enacted on december 1 1997 as section 4 of pl 105124 section 4 was adopted as an amendment to s 1228 during markup by the senate banking committee the act authorized the secretary of the treasury to design new dollar coin the statute required that the new coin be golden in color and have distinctive edge the secretary was authorized to select new designs for both sides of the dollar coin the law directed the treasury to create marketing program to promote the use of the new coin the act did not address the issue of withdrawing the 1dollar note in major departure from previous discussions concerning the need for us dollar coin the major support for the 1997 coin legislation focused on reinvigorating the current circulating coinage and the fact that renewed demand for anthony dollars was exhausting the treasurys supply pl 105124 also created program to issue quarters commemorating each of the 50 states7 supporters argued that the new coins would be educational and would encourage coin collecting in addition the treasury was reporting that the governments supply of anthony dollars was dwindling because of demand from the postal service and several mass transit authorities opposition to redesigning the 1 dollar coin
