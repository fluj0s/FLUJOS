america have increased congress has responded the way hundreds of their constituents have by going back to school early organization and orientation ve provided members leg up in addressing pressing needs when the first congress convened over 200 years ago farmers and soldiers journalists and scientists car penters and statesmen travelled from throughout the colonies to new york to take the oath of office as members of the first congress they adopted rules organized the structure of their chambers and began legislating each in accordance with the members own indivi dual understanding of just how to do that and how to be both representative and legislator that is how to be member of congress there was specific precedent to follow educational ins titution to attend to explore the intricacies of the legislative pro cess classes to take to practice the politics of bicameralism and bipartisanship management consultant to teach them how to administer their offices and so these mbers and the hundreds who followed them learned on the job learned from their predecesso rs and each other and learned from their mistakes as the nation grew and prospere d and the number of members increased withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21339crs2 manifest destiny it became clear that on the job training was longer sufficient the issues were becoming more complex the procedures more intricate in the early 1970s nearly 200 years after the first members arrived to legislate congress began to consider formalizing its pr econgress preparations both structural and educational the belief seemed to be that the sooner the organizational decisions were made and the structure was in place the fast er the start members would have in solving the problems of the day as well the mo re members knew about the intricacies and complexities of those problems the more s ophisticated the deliberations would be the sooner those deliberations coul d begin and the more compre hensive and appropriate the eventual response would be formalizing the process accordingly in 1974 pursuant to the adop tion of hres 988 93rd congress the committee reform amendments of 1974 the h ouse authorized early organizational meetings for its members the senate followed it soon thereafter speaker carl albert and minority leader gerald ford agreed that during the transition time between congresses preparation for the next congress would be of invaluable help in reducing the organizati onal and legislative congestion that normally accompanies the start of congress pr ior to the convening of new congress
