have owned the home for at least two years and lived in the home as the taxpayers main residence for two years the exclusion on the gain from the sale of principal residence is often combined with 1031 exchange in order to avoid paying tax on the exchange sale of the taxpayers investment property prior to 2004 this d been very attractive arrangement for taxpayers who wanted to relocate or retire to different area for example consider the case of taxpayer who owned his own home and also owned an investment property the taxpayer could perform 1031 exchange of his investment property for another investment property usually residential unit in the area where the taxpayer wanted to relocate there would be tax due on th is exchange of i nvestment properties the taxpayer could then sell his principal residence and move into the recently acquired property in the new location th taxpayer would pay tax on up to 500000 of gain from the sale of his principal residence after living in the newly acquired investment property for two years the taxp ayer could then sell the property and again using the principal residence exclusion void paying income tax on up to 500000 of the gain the taxpayer could then use the proceeds from the sale of this investment property and possibly the proceeds from the sale of his original principal residence to acquire new principal residence the end result is that the taxpayer was able to realize up to 500000 of gain on the sale of his principal residence and up to 500000 of gain on the sale of his investment property tax free provisions of the

2004in likekind exchange within the past five years in effect this requires the taxpayer to hold property acquired in likekind exchange for full five years before it would qualify as principal residence1 this change reduces but does not eliminate the attractiveness of combining 1031 likekind exchanges with the principal residence exclusion the holding period is now five ears rather than two years discussion provision allowing taxfree exchanges of likekind property was included in the first statutory tax rules for capital gains in the revenue act of 1921 and has continued in some form until today various restrictions over the years took many kinds of property and exchanges out of its scope but the rules fo r real estate in par ticular were broadened over the years by court decisions the genera l rationale for allowing taxfree exchanges has been that the investment in the new property is merely continuation of the investment in the old however in moves to reduce some of the more egregious uses of the rules the deficit reduction act of 1984 set time limits on completing exchanges and the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989 outlawed taxfree exchange s between rela ted parties the most recent change affecting 1031 lik ekind exchanges occurred in october 2004 with the enactment of the american jobs creation act of 2004 this act contained provisions which restricted th application of the princi pal residence exclusion irc 121d if the property had been acquired through section 1031 likekind exchange under the new regulations the exclusion fo r the gain from the sale of principal residence will not apply if the principal residence had been acquired in likekind exchange in which any of the gain had not been recognized within the prior five years the provision became effective for sales or exchanges after october 22 2004 the date of enactment the joint committee on taxation jct has identified section 1031 exchanges as tax expenditures section 33 of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 defines tax expend itures as those revenue losse s attributable to provisions of the federal tax laws which allow sp ecial exclusion exemption or deduction from gross income or which provide special credit preferential rate of tax or deferral of tax liability2 in effect tax expenditures may be viewed as spending programs channeled through the tax systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22113crs4 3 joint committee on taxation stimated budget effects of the conference agreement for hr 4520 the american jobs creation act of 2004 jcx6904
