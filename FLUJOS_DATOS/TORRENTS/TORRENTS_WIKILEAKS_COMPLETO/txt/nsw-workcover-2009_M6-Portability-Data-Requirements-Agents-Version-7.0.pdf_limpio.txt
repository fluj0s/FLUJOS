the requirements for the portability of claims and policies under the new scheme arrangements including the data required to facilitate the transfer of claims and policy records and the changes to the workcover wca submission data requir ements this manual assumes an understanding of the current wca claims and policy data requirements and should be read in conjunction with the claims technical manual the policy technical manual and the records management and file transfer manual wca cts for and exercises the powers of the nominal insurer and will manage contracts on behalf of the nominal insurer the remains the insurer for all workers compensation claims and policies and scheme agents act on behalf of the 2 background portability data requirements were introduced to enable controlled movement of claims and policy data between agents this movement could be result of programmed redistribution due to change in contract or due to other market forces when and if the directs the transfer of claims andor policies those claims and policies selected for transfer will be based on specific criteria and will be randomly selected from an available pool the will endeavour to transfer claims to scheme agents with demons trable claims management skills and will benefit workers by helping injured workers recover their health and return to work in way that is safe and durable improving case management ensuring the most effective and appropriate care particularly for t hose requiring specialist treatment workers will retain their right to choose doctor and treatment provider with continuity of care and benefits being maintained claims could move independently of policies policies will move at renewal only transfe rring policies will consider the benefit to employers with improved management of scheme agents performance consistent approach to scheme issues such as fraud compliance and recoveries improved management of their employees claims there may be tr ansfers of claims andor policies between agents during the period of the contract in the event of transfer part way through the contract period transferring agents will be expected to meet the same requirements for data transfer outlined in this manua l 4 3 data transfer proces s wca provides an extract list to scheme agents detailing the claims and policies identified for transfer from the exiting scheme agent to the receiving scheme agent transfer files detailing claims and policies to be transferred nd list of errors that are outstanding for claims scheduled for transfer in consultation with scheme agents guidelines were developed for the direct transfer between scheme agents of paper files and case note text files 31 extract lists policy extract the criteria for the

workcover that renewal notices have been successfully forwarded to each policyholder refer to the records management and file transfer manual it is important to note that for the life of claim the claim number provided to receiving scheme agent must be utilised for all c orrespondence in regards said claim be this with the claimant employer wca including claim submission workers compensation commission or any other person or persons it is also important to note that any policy number provided to receiving scheme gent must be utilised for renewal of all subsequent policy renewal years pry

case note first followed by case notes in date order claims must be recorded in the text file in ascending order by claim number the body of c ase note field will be broken into multiple fields of 240 characters maximum partitioned by the separator 5 scheme agent system requirements portability requires scheme agents to modify their claims management and policy management systems as well as mee t the changes required to the wca submission requirements 511 claim and policy upload each scheme agent must be able to automatically upload as required the claims and policy transfer files as detailed in section 32 where claims or policy transfer files h ave been uploaded the receiving scheme agent is required to undertake reconciliation of the claims or policy count details provided on the trailer record with those accumulated during the upload process receiving scheme agents should also reconcile th claims and policies received on each transfer file received back to the relevant extract list determined by the extract number in the header of the extract list and transfer files the scheme agent is responsible for advising wca that the upload has oc curred successfully and that all relevant reconciliations have been undertaken wca will monitor activity against transferred claims during the transition period and will verify that transferred policies have been established for the upcoming policy period 512 claim transferred status where wca has transferred claim to another agent the exiting scheme agent is required to update their claims management system to reflect the transfer each exiting scheme agent must be able to update transferred claims to s tatus that ensures the claim is longer considered active and accordingly longer reported to wca via claims submission 513 policy transferred status where wca has notified the exiting scheme agent of policies to be transferred to new scheme agent at renewal the exiting scheme agent is required to suspend the renewal process ie for each policy that will be transferred the exiting scheme agent must change the policy status code p 216 to the value 7 final policy period employer transferre d on their system this status will be reported to wca via the policy submission to indicate that the policy will not be renewed with this scheme agent for the following policy renewal year
