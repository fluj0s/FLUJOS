specialist in telecommunications resources science and industry division lennard g kruger specialist in science and technology resources science and industry division broadband internet regulation and access background and issues summary broadband or highspeed internet access is provided by series of technologies that give users the ability to send and receive data at volumes and speeds far greater than internet access over traditional telephone lines in addition to offering speed broadband access provides continuous always on connection and the ability to both receive download and transmit upload data at high speeds broadband access along with the content and services it might enable has the potential to transform the internet both what it offers and how it is used it is possible that many of the future applications that will best exploit the technological capabilities of broadband have yet to be developed there are multiple transmission media or technologies that can be used to provide broadband access these include cable an enhanced telephone service called digital subscriber line dsl fibertothehome ftth satellite mobile and fixed wireless including wifi and wimax broadband over powerlines bpl and others from public policy perspective the goals are to ensure that broadband deployment is timely and contributes to the nations economic growth that industry competes fairly and that affordable and highquality service is provided to all sectors and geographical locations of american society the federal government through congress and the federal communications commission fcc is seeking to ensure fair competition among the players so that broadband will be available and affordable in timely manner to all americans who want it some areas of the nation particularly rural and lowincome communities continue to lack full access to highspeed broadband internet service in order to address this problem the 110th congress is examining wide range of issues including the scope and effect of federal broadband financial assistance programs including universal service and the broadband programs at the us department of agricultures rural utilities service the adequacy of broadband data collection by the fcc and the impact of telecommunications regulation and new technologies on broadband deployment one facet of the debate over broadband services focuses on whether present laws and subsequent regulatory policies are needed to ensure the development of competition and its subsequent consumer benefits or conversely whether such laws and regulations are overly burdensome and discourage investment in and deployment of broadband services this report which will be updated as events warrant contents what is broadband and why is it important 1 broadband

background and issues what is broadband and why is it important broadband or highspeed internet access is provided by series of technologies that give users the ability to send and receive data at volumes and speeds far greater than internet access over traditional telephone lines currently number of telecommunications companies are developing installing and marketing specific technologies and services to provide broadband access to the home meanwhile the federal government through congress and the federal communications commission fcc is seeking to ensure fair competition among the players so that broadband will be available and affordable in timely manner to all americans who want it broadband is being increasingly viewed as vital public infrastructure significant to the nations and to individual regional state and local economic growth and vitality broadband access along with the content and services it enables has the potential to transform the internet both what it offers and how it is used for example twoway high speed connection could be used for interactive applications such as online classrooms showrooms or health clinics where teacher and student or customer and salesperson doctor and patient can see and hear each other through their computers an always on connection could be used to monitor home security home automation or even patient health remotely through the web the high speed and high volume that broadband offers could also be used for bundled service where for example cable television video on demand voice data and other services are all offered over single line in truth it is possible that many of the applications that will best exploit the technological capabilities of broadband while also capturing the imagination of consumers have yet to be developed broadband technologies there are multiple transmission media or technologies that can be used to provide broadband access these include cable modem an enhanced telephone service called digital subscriber line dsl satellite technology fiber mobile or fixed wireless technologies and others cable and dsl are currently the most widely used technologies for providing broadband access both require the modification of an existing physical infrastructure that is already connected to the home ie cable television and telephone lines each technology has its respective advantages and disadvantages and competes with each other based on performance price quality of crs2 service geography user friendliness and other factors the following sections summarize cable dsl and other broadband technologies cable the same cable network that currently provides television service to consumers is being modified to provide broadband access because cable networks are shared by users access speeds can decrease during peak usage hours when bandwidth is being shared by many customers at the same time network sharing has also led to security concerns and fears that hackers might be able to eavesdrop on neighbors internet connection the cable industry is developing next generation technology which will significantly extend downloading and uploading speeds digital subscriber line dsl dsl is modem technology that converts existing copper telephone lines into twoway high speed data conduits speeds can depend on the condition of the telephone wire and the distance between the home and the telephone companys central office ie the building that houses telephone switching equipment because dsl uses frequencies much higher than those used for voice communication both voice and data can be sent over the same telephone line thus customers can talk on their telephone while they are online and voice service will continue even if the dsl service goes down like cable broadband technology dsl line is always on with dialup required unlike cable however dsl has the advantage of being unshared between the customer and the central office thus data transmission speeds will not necessarily decrease during periods of heavy local internet use disadvantage relative to cable is that dsl deployment is constrained by the distance between the subscriber and the central office dsl technology over copper wire only works within 18000 feet about three miles of central office facility however dsl providers are deploying technology to further increase deployment range one option is to install remote terminals which can serve areas farther than three miles from the central office wireless mobile or fixed wireless systems transmit data over the airwaves from towers or antennas to receiver mobile wireless broadband services also referred to as third generation or 3g allow consumers to get broadband access over cell phones pdas or wireless modem cards connected to laptop1 the fcc has auctioned frequencies currently occupied by broadcast channels 5269 these and other frequencies in the 700 mhz band are possible candidates for wireless broadband applications number of wireless technologies corresponding to different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum also have potential these include the upperbands above 24ghz the lowerbands multipoint distribution service or mds below 3 ghz broadband personal communications services pcs wireless communications service 23 ghz and unlicenced spectrum unlicensed spectrum is being 1 for further information see crs report rs20993 wireless technology and spectrum demand advanced wireless services by linda k moore crs3 increasingly used to provide highspeed shortdistance wireless access popularly called wifi to local area networks particularly in urban areas where wired broadband connections already exist new and developing wireless broadband technology called wimax has the capability to transmit signals over much larger areas fiber another broadband technology is optical fiber to the home ftth optical fiber cable already used by businesses as high speed links for long distance voice and data traffic has tremendous data capacity with transmission speeds dramatically higher than what is offered by cable modem or dsl broadband technology while the high cost of installing optical fiber in or near users homes has been major barrier to the deployment of ftth both verizon and att formerly sbc are rolling out fiberbased architectures that will offer consumers voice video and high speed data sometimes referred to as triple play some public utilities are also exploring or beginning to offer broadband access via fiber inside their existing conduits additionally some companies are investigating the feasibility of transmitting data over power lines which are already ubiquitous in peoples homes2 satellite satellite broadband internet service is currently being offered by three providers hughes network systems direcway starband spacenet inc and wildblue like cable satellite is shared medium meaning that privacy may be compromised and performance speeds may vary depending upon the volume of simultaneous use another disadvantage of internet oversatellite is its susceptibility to disruption in bad weather on the other hand the big advantage of satellite is its universal availability whereas cable or dsl is not available to some parts of the united states satellite connections can be accessed by anyone with satellite dish facing the southern sky this makes satellite internet access possible solution for rural or remote areas not served by other technologies status of broadband deployment according to the latest fcc data on the deployment of highspeed internet connections released march 2008 as of june 30 2007 there were 1009 million high speed lines connecting homes and businesses to the internet in the united states growth rate of 22 during the first half of 2007 of

crs4 adoption rate stands at roughly 58 of us households4 broadband availability is much higher as of june 30 2007 the fcc found at least one highspeed subscriber in 99 of all zip codes in the united states the fcc estimates that roughly 20 percent of consumers with access to advanced telecommunications capability do subscribe to such services according to the fcc possible reasons for the gap between broadband availability and subscribership include the lack of computers in some homes price of broadband service lack of content and the availability of broadband at work5 according to the international telecommunications union the us ranks 24th worldwide in broadband penetration subscriptions per 100 inhabitants in 20076 data from the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd found the us ranking 15th among oecd nations in broadband access per 100 inhabitants as of december 20077 by contrast in 2001 an oecd study found the us ranking 4th in broadband subscribership per 100 inhabitants after korea sweden and canada8 while many argue that the us declining performance in international broadband rankings is cause for concern9 others including the administration maintain that the oecd and itu data undercount us broadband deployment10 and that crosscountry broadband deployment comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and inherently problematic11 finally an issue related to 4 percentage assumes one high speed line per household 659 million residential high speed lines per june 30 2007 fcc data and 114 million households in the us

divide13 while the number of new broadband subscribers continues to grow the rate of broadband deployment in urban and high income areas appears to be outpacing deployment in rural and lowincome areas according to the latest fcc data on the deployment of highspeed internet connections released march 2008 highspeed subscribers were reported in 99 of the most densely populated zip codes as opposed to 91 of zip codes with the lowest population densities similarly for zip codes ranked by median family income highspeed subscribers were reported present in 99 of the top onetenth of zip codes as compared to 92 of the bottom one tenth of zip codes14 similarly 2008 data from the pew internet american life project indicate that while broadband adoption is growing in urban suburban and rural areas broadband users make up larger percentages of urban and suburban users than rural users pew found that the percentage of all us adults with broadband at home is 60 for suburban areas 57 for urban areas and 38 for rural areas15 some policymakers assert that disparities in broadband access across american society could have adverse consequences on those left behind many believe that

ecommerce may increasingly depend on high speed broadband connections to the internet thus some say communities and individuals without access to broadband could be at risk to the extent that ecommerce becomes critical factor in determining future economic development and prosperity fcc activities the telecommunications act of 1996 pl 104104 addressed the issue of whether the federal government should intervene to prevent digital divide in broadband access section 706 requires the fcc to determine whether advanced telecommunications capability ie broadband or highspeed access is being deployed to all americans in reasonable and timely fashion if this is not the case the act directs the fcc to take immediate action to accelerate deployment of such capability by removing barriers to infrastructure investment and by promoting competition in the telecommunications market on september 9 2004 the fcc adopted and released its fourth report pursuant to section 706 like the previous three reports the fcc concluded that the overall goal of section 706 is being met and that advanced telecommunications capability is indeed being deployed on reasonable and timely basis to all americans16 while the fcc is currently implementing or actively considering some regulatory activities related to broadband17 major regulatory intervention pursuant to section 706 of the telecommunications act of 1996 has been deemed necessary by the fcc at this time the fcc noted the future promise of emerging multiple advanced broadband networks which can complement one another for example in urban and suburban areas wireless broadband services may fill in the gaps in wireline broadband coverage while wireless and satellite services may bring highspeed broadband to remote areas where wireline deployment may be costly having multiple advanced networks will also promote competition in price features and qualityofservice among broadbandaccess providers18 two fcc commissioners michael copps and jonathan adelstein dissented from the fourth report conclusion that broadband deployment is reasonable and timely they argued that the relatively poor world ranking of united states broadband penetration indicates that deployment is insufficient that the fccs continuing definition of broadband as 200 kilobits per second is outdated and is not comparable to the much higher speeds available to consumers in other countries and that the use of zip code data measuring the presence of at least one broadband 16 fourth report p 8 17 see appendix c of the fourth report list of broadbandrelated proceedings at the commission pp 5456 18 ibid p 9 crs7 subscriber within zip code area does not sufficiently characterize the availability of broadband across geographic areas19 the government accountability office gao has also cited concerns about the fccs zip code level data of particular concern is that the fcc will report broadband service in zip code even if company reports service to only one subscriber which in turn can lead to some observers overstating of broadband deployment according to gao the data may not provide highly accurate depiction of local deployment of broadband infrastructures for residential service especially in rural areas20 on march 19 2008 the fcc adopted an order that substantially expands its broadband data collection capability specifically the order expands the number of broadband reporting speed tiers to capture more information about upload and download speeds offered in the marketplace requires broadband providers to report numbers of broadband subscribers by census tract and improves the accuracy of information collected on mobile wireless broadband deployment additionally in further notice of proposed rulemaking the fcc is seeking comment on broadband service pricing and availability21 also on march 19 2008 the fcc adopted the fifth report to congress on broadband deployment under section 706 of the telecommunications act of 1996 as did previous reports the fifth report found that broadband services are currently being deployed to all americans in reasonable and timely fashion commissioners copps and adelstein again dissented citing flawed data collection methodologies lagging us broadband penetration internationally and the lack of comprehensive us broadband strategy administration activities the national telecommunications and information administration ntia at the department of commerce doc was tasked with developing the bush administrations broadband policy22 statements from administration officials indicated that much of the policy would focus on removing regulatory roadblocks to investment in broadband deployment23 on june 13 2002 in speech at the 21st 19 ibid p 5 7 20 us government

importance of broadband deployment at the august 13 2002 economic forum in waco texas subsequently more formal administration broadband policy was unveiled in march and april of 2004 on march 26 2004 president bush endorsed the goal of universal broadband access by 200724 then on april 26 2004 president bush announced broadband initiative which advocates permanently prohibiting all broadband taxes making spectrum available for wireless broadband creating technical standards for broadband over power lines and simplifying rightsofway processes on federal lands for broadband providers25 on january 31 2008 ntia released report entitled networked nation broadband in america 200726 according to ntia the report shows that the administrations technology regulatory and fiscal policies have stimulated innovation and competition and encouraged investment in the us broadband market contributing to significantly increased accessibility of broadband services27 regulation and broadband convergence and the changing marketplace rapid technological advances and the resulting convergence of telecommunications providers and markets has prompted the reexamination of the existing telecommunications industry regulatory framework the telecommunications act of 1996 pl104104 redefined and recast the 1934 communications act to address the emergence of competition in what were previously considered to be monopolistic markets despite its relatively recent enactment however consensus has been growing that the modifications brought about by the implementation of the 1996 act are not sufficient to address the nations changing telecommunications environment technological changes such as the advancement of internet technology to supply data voice and video as well as the growing convergence in the telecommunications sector have according to many policymakers made it necessary to consider another rewrite or revision of the laws governing these markets 23 continued 2002apt_020802htm 24 allen

which existing regulations should be applied to traditional providers as they enter new markets where they do not hold market power the extent to which existing regulations should be imposed on new entrants as they compete with traditional providers in the same markets and the appropriate regulatory framework to be imposed on new andor converging technologies that are not easily classified under the present framework28 the regulatory treatment of broadband technologies continues to hold major focus in the policy debate major facet of the debate centers on whether present laws and regulations are needed to ensure the development of competition and its subsequent consumer benefits or conversely whether such laws and policies are overly burdensome and discourage needed investment and deployment of such services what if any role regulators should play to ensure the internet remains open to all often referred to as open access requirements or net neutrality is also major and contentious part of the dialogue29 in addition to the debate over economic regulation concern over how and to what extent social regulations such as emergency 911 access disability access and law enforcement regulations should be applied to new and converging technologies continues to be debated the continued growth and expressed interest in municipal broadband networks has also focused debate on what the appropriate role of the government sector should be and whether it should be competing with the private sector how traditional policy goals such as the advancement of universal service mandates should be revised to accommodate the changing marketplace has also come under scrutiny for example issues such as who should receive and who should contribute to universal service funds and whether the definition of universal service objectives should be expanded to include new technologies such as broadband continue to be debated30 activities in the 109th congress in the 109th congress

2686 hr5252ator the senate commerce committee held series of hearings on wide range of telecommunications issues in preparation for developing comprehensive telecommunications legislation senate commerce committee chairman stevens introduced on may 1 2006 comprehensive 135 page telecommunications bill s 2686 the major provisions of that measure dealt with wide range of topics including universal service reform streamlining of the video franchising process requiring the fcc to report annually to congress on the net neutrality issue interoperability of public safety communications systems interconnection and municipal broadband ownership the bill also contains number of provisions relating to broadcast issues such as the digital television transition the reinstating of the fccs broadcast flag rules access to sports programming and use of unlicensed white space additional provisions relating to protecting children from child pornography and amending the fccs sunshine rules are also included although senator inouye the ranking minority member of the committee signed on as bill cosponsor he stated that s 2686 needed considerable amendment to gain his support he circulated draft proposal containing provisions addressing video franchising internet access broadband deployment and universal service for consideration that addressed his concerns the lack of strong net neutrality provision was one of the issues he specifically singled out for attention s 2686 provisions relating to streamlining the video franchising process universal service fund reform and net neutrality were the major focus of commerce committee hearing held on may 18 and may 252006 the commerce committee crs12 issued revised draft of the bill which was the subject of hearing held on june 13 2006 after lengthy and intense markup the senate commerce committee approved 157 on june 28 2006 the newly titled advanced telecommunications and opportunity reform act which technically is an amended version in the nature of substitute for hr 5252 in addition to new bill name and number the threeday markup led to the approval of significant managers amendment containing new title and 70 amendments resulting in the passage of 200plus page omnibus telecommunications measure s 2686 which was referred to as the senate committee passed version of hr 5252 contains 11 titles covering wide range of telecommunications issues including video franchise reform net neutrality universal service reform municipal broadband broadcast flag the digital television transition interoperability the illegal transmission of child pornography and fcc reform the issue of net neutrality proved to be major point of contention during the markup despite the addition of new title title ix establishing an internet consumer bill of rights net neutrality advocates continued to press for net neutrality nondiscrimination provision nondiscrimination amendment offered during markup was defeated by an 1111 vote the lack of cable franchise buildout provision federal preemption of state authority over wireless services as well as provisions added during markup to exempt for three years wireless providers fromnew and discriminatory taxes and make permanent the internet tax moratorium also resulted in concern while senator stevens continued to express confidence that the senate version of hr 5252 would come to the floor for vote the 109th congress ended without full senate consideration of the measure both the senate and house judiciary committees also examined issues related to telecommunications reform the house judiciarys telecommunications and antitrust task force held hearing on april 25 2006 to examine competition issues relating to internet access and net neutrality house judiciary committee chairman sensenbrenner and representative conyers the ranking minority member stated in letter sent to then house speaker hastert that the judiciary committee had oversight over market conditions consolidations and antitrust protections in the telecommunications sector and asked for sequential referral of hr 5252 that request was denied however chairman sensenbrenner representative conyers and others introduced bipartisan bill hr 5417 focusing on internet access from an antitrust perspective that passed 2013 the judiciary committee with amendment on may 25 2006 request to the
