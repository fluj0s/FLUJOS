6309c12 shspec305 service facs the difficulty with getting pcs case forward is that the pc has hidden standard which is that by which he measures his progress it is often unknown even to the pc that is why it is hidden an aberration is an outofcontrol exaggeration of the positive or negative of anything thetan can do hence aristotles doctrine of the golden mean the fact that something is normal doesnt mean that it isnt aberrated for instance the difficulty of exteriorization is accepted but it is not anything much in line with the thetans abilities so departure from the normal is particular index of case state auditors sometimes have trouble because pc runs too easily so in judging case level dont use the pcs behavior as an index use the amount of ta motion by running service facs the case can change very quickly so worrying about the pcs normal behavior is unnecessary and irrelevant it is easier to measure persons case against some scales of abilities than against behavior and it is more accurate the condition of restimulation of the case has more to do with understanding the pc and handling him effectively than does the pcs behavior the only things you worry about with pc are 1 can he do the process 2 is he getting any gains 3 is he getting ta motion the fact that someone has hidden standard merely means that he has chronic restimulation that is throwing extra charge on the case it is some facsimile or whatever in chronic restimulation if it was changed in the session the pc had gain if you got ta some of the chronic restimulation will have gone so the pc will have had gain and will probably say so that unfortunately isnt all that happens with hidden standard the pc is also trying to fit every process to this thing to resolve it he is so introverted in session as result that he doesnt asis anything and you dont get ta action time and the ta fit together and the pc drags his hidden standard facsimile up into every incident or whatever in order to evaluate it therefore the pc is always misdating something the hidden standard isnt the date of it whatever date he is in that is why it is the most effective ta stopper there is way of getting rid of the hidden standard process called r3t now called r4t in this process one simply asks the pc for his chronic psychosomatic what he is experiencing and what is always present he answers and you date it whatever it is then you get the itsa line in on it in most cases that is the end of the hidden standard the hidden standard always expresses itself physiologically it is never hidden physically it will be what the pc complains about sometimes it will take you an hour or so of itsa to find out what it is when the pc spots it he will feel better and you will have been getting ta dont let him start giving you problems or you have had it since problems are not itsa so perhaps you should stick to what physical condition are you trying to solve he will finally itsa it out if he doesnt tell you all at once if he gives it to you right off the bat you might get some ta with when has this troubled you in auditing or in this lifetime you can take it up with r3t and date it taking it back as far as need be sometimes dating it will cause it to blow on the spot especially if you dont get it so narrowed down that you get the pc into an engram and have to run it with r3r or if he gets stuck in his own gpm with r3m2 or if in another gpm with r3n r3t seems to be the precursor to the date portion of the datelocate for handling intractable pressure somatics r3t is commonly overrun youve got to watch the pc when you first start using r3t you are likely to overrun it roughly 80 of the time eventually you get slippy and stop overrunning it not every pc has hidden standard to the point where it ruins the auditing but hidden standard exists in every case that has difficult or delicate ta that the auditor has to worry about so r3t is the weapon to use to get the ta moving again when all else has failed r3t can fix it but little goes long way dont try to run the whole case with r3t since if you tried to do this you could end up with messedup pc however you could do r3t on everything the pc is worried about in pt you could clear somebody with r3t as long as you you kept good control over the pc and just dated all his pt hidden standards the service fac has to be severely located on the time track in this lifetime so that it will key out handle every hidden standard that the pc could dream up but dont let him pull anything up from the back track in the meantime use tr2 if r3sc goes nowhere you can still clear the pc using r3t the tough case is the pc whose service fac is his hidden standard the only workable handling is carefully to get it dated this is all destimulation so you have to be careful not to run anything the reason you are trying to destimulate the case is so that the pc doesnt have ptps so that he can put his attention on the session if you start destimulating action and then go backtrack and start running something the pc will get restimulated and if the pcs service fac includes making you wrong that is the first thing he will do he will try to restimulate more than he can handle how do you keep the itsa line in on pc that wants to restimulate more be awful damn careful of your whatsits remove all social actions and chitchat from your auditing avoid all violent attention shifts and attention shifts directed by whatsit and dont direct the pcs attention in way that arc breaks him so that he has to get even with you by whatsiting the type of model session to use on case that isnt getting much ta is your wunit type model session social frills w unit was next after the v unit which was heavily supervised r210 and r212 on coaudit basis w unit contained ruds havingness cchs and assists it used gf model session or goal finders model session see hcopl 8dec62 training saint hill special briefing course summary of subjects by units for description of w x and z units gf model session is given in hcob 15oct 2 goal finders model session this bulletin is not on the shsbc overrestimulation leads to selfinvalidation and invalidation of scientology and other dynamics the pc invalidates his own case chews himself up all the time and he doesnt know so let that be warning sign to you the case minus the service fac is subject to less restimulation because he pulls in fewer ptps in his environment case without good processing gains has ptps the way to handle them is by handling service facs there is way of listing for service facs that nails ptps 1 whats safe assumption about your environment 2 what would be safe method of handling your problems here and now in life this is only one of many solutions to this situation such question will drop into your lap the stable datum that the person is using to hold at bay various sectors of his existence so in that respect it becomes method of destimulating the environment you wind up with what he uses to handle his family his job etc take the pcs whole environment to pieces find out where his life is in conflict and what it is in conflict with in pt get what pt consists of this orients the pc and is good scientology i see p 479 above for description of scientology i note also the similarity to the pt environment list in expanded dianetics you should both categorize things and locate them spatially this is good for the pcs itsa after you have all of pt use the above process on it you could plot the pt environment out and find where most of the pcs problems are the pc gets gloomiest when talking about this area the ta dies down as you keep talking about it indicating that there are more problems there than the pc can confront he cant put any itsa into the vicinity as the pc looks at the stable datum that he is using to hold sectors of existence at bay and as he finds out more about it you will get his confront on the environment increasing and increasing as his ability to differentiate comes up this is terrific hgc approach now that you know about the hot spots and fixated areas in the pcs environment you have subjects where he cant itsa you can assess by rising ta to get zone where there is service fac in operation as long as one cant itsa something he will continue to have ptps with it so since the pc cant confront the areas of rising ta he will have ptps there make mistakes etc the frequency of ptps is the measure of noconfront noconfront is caused by substitute confront which is service facsimile it isnt that the thetan cant confront it is that as long as the pc has the service fac the things he is notconfronting can keep caving him in and restimulating him here is lesson that you should learn about life dont stay in places that you dont want to keep confronting because your nonconfronting will lead you to pick up stable datum to do your confronting for you in that vicinity and the next thing you know this is going to be gorgeous piece of mass and will give you more ptps than you can ordinarily count and your life will become very restimulative the rising ta is less observable than the pcs attitude if the pc hasnt got anything to say about something he isnt observing it something is observing it for him and that something is service fac find this and run r3sc steps on it if you are having trouble with r3sc you have collided with the ri of the pcs ongoing gpm it will still handle with r3sc if with some difficulty you use several assessments to get something to run on r3sc you can use scientology list one assessment or discussion of pt doingness and environment with observation of where the pc goes downtone and where the ta rises indicating areas where the pc cant confront and itsa when you run the brackets step of r3sc you will get ta by asising stable data and letting confusion fly off do thorough pc assessment sheet you can use the pc assessment sheet to find out about the pcs pt if you treat it as leisurely 2wc activity looking for ta action not data ie doing it as an r3sc assessment when dealing with this lifetime let the itsa run free when dealing with past track control the itsa line very closely assessment at scientology iv is rapid bangbang assessment
