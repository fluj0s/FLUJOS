the united states currently provides tps to nationals from seven countries burundi salvador honduras liberia nicaragua somalia and sudan under the ina the executive branch grants tps congress however has also granted tps legislatively and legislation pertaining to tps has received action in the 110th congress background the immigration and nati onality act ina provides that all aliens ie persons who are not citizens or nationals of the united states must enter pursuant to the ina the major categories of aliens are immigrants refugees and asylees all admitted for or adjusted to legal permanent residence and nonimmigrants admitted for temporary reasons eg students tourists or busin ess travelers aliens who lack proper authorization are generally of two kinds those who entered the united states without inspection according to immigration procedures or those who entered the united states on temporary visa and have st ayed beyond the expiration date of the visa unauthorized aliens of both kinds are subject to removal as signatory to the united nations protocol relating to the status of refugees hereafter protocol the united states agrees to the principle of nonrefoulement which means that it will not return an alien to country where his life or freedom would be threatened nonrefoulement is embodied in several pr ovisions of us immigration law most notably it is reflected in the pr ovisions requiring the government to withhold the removal of aliens to c ountry in which the aliens life or freedom would be threatenedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20844crs2 1 208 of ina 8 usc 1158

by andorra bruno 3 the term humanitarian migrant is not defined in the ina nor in this context is it meant to imply that sympathetic policy response is warrant ed rather it refers to factors underlying the aliens justification for immigrationon the basis of race religi on nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion1 humanitarian migrants not all humanitarian migrants are eligible for asylum or refugee status the legal definition of asylum in the ina is consistent with the protocol which specifies that refugee is person who is unwilling or unable to return to his country of nationality or habitual residence because of wellfounde d fear of persecution on account of race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion the definitions of refugee and asylee are essentially the same in the ina with the notable difference being the physical location of the persons seeking the status those who are in the united states or at us port of entry apply for asylum while those who are displaced abroad apply for refugee status the standards of proof and minimum thresholds are similar but the procedures and priorities are quite different2 if the motivation of the migrant is determined to be economic improvement rather than the political reasons that underpin the legal definition the person is not considered eligible for asylum this distinction is sometimes difficult to discern because persecution as well as war may lead to economic hardships and economic deprivation may trigger persecution or insurrection since factors ch as extreme poverty deprivation violence and the dislocation brought on by famines or natural disasters ma evoke humanitarian response the term humanitarian migrants compasses all those who emigrate to the united states for such reasons including those who receive asylum3 the concept of safe haven embraces human itarian migrants it covers those who may not meet the legal definition of re fugee but are nonetheless fleeing potentially dangerous situations safe ven also assumes that the host country in this instance the united states is the first country in which the fleeing alien arrives sa fely or is the country where the alien is temporarily residing when the unsafe conditions occur safe haven is implicitly temporary in nature because it is given prior to any decision on the longterm resolution of the aliens status it is also form of blanket relief because it is premised on more generalized conditions of turmoil or deprivation in the country of origin in contrast to the individual ci rcumstances weighed in the casebycase asylum process in terms of permanent residence over the long term the united states endorses the internationally held position that voluntary repatriation is the best outcome for refugees resettlement in the country to which the asyl um seeker fled is considered secondary option and resettlement in third country as the last alternativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20844crs3 4 244 of ina 8 usc 1254a 5 under the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 the former immigration and naturalization service was transferred to the

status tps is the statutory embodiment of safe haven for those aliens who may not meet the legal finition of refugee but are nonetheless fleeing or reluctant to return to potentially dangerous situations tps is blanket relief that may be granted under the following conditions there is ongoing armed conflict posing serious threat to personal safety foreign state requests tps because it temporarily cannot handle the return of nationals due to environmental disaster or there are extraordinary and temporary conditions in foreign state that prevent aliens from returning provided that granting tps is consistent with us national interests4 the secretary of homeland security in consultation with the secretary of state can issue tps for periods of 6 to 18 months nd can extend these periods if conditions do not change in the designated country5 to obtain tps eligible aliens report to us citizenship and immigrant services uscis in the department of homeland security dhs pay processing fee and receive re gistration documents and work authorization the major requirements for aliens seeking tps are proof of eligibility eg passport issued by the designated country continuous physical presence in th united states since the date tps went into eff ect timely registration and bein g otherwise admissible as an immigrant the regulation specifies grounds of inadmissibility that cannot be waived including those relating to criminal convi ctions and the persecution of others6 aliens who receive tps are not on an immig ration track that leads to permanent residence or citizenship the temporary nature of tps is apparent in the regulation ins has made clear that information it collects when an alien registers for tps may be used to institute exclusion or deportati on proceedings upon the denial withdrawal or expiration of tps7 moreover the tps provision in the ina states that bill or amendment that provides for the adjustment to lawful temporary or legal permanent resident lpr status for any alien receiving tps requires supermajority vote in the senate ie threefifths of ll senators voting affirmatively8 other blanket forms of relief in addition to tps the attorney gene ral has provided under certain conditions discretionary relief from deportation so that aliens who have not been legally admitted to the united states may remain in this country either temporarily or permanently the statutory authority cited by the agency for th discretionary procedures is generally thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20844crs4 9 240 of ina 8 usc 1229a 240b 8 usc 1229c 10

the law cove ring the authority for voluntary departure9 such blanket relief is an exercise of the disc retion of the attorney general and thus the secretary of state n eed not be consulted prior to the enactment of tps the attorney general provided relief by means of the suspension of enforcement of the immigra tion laws against particular group of individuals the two most common discreti onary procedures to provide relief from deportation have been deferre d departure or deferred enforced departure ded and extended voluntary departure evd the di scretionary procedures of ded and evd continue to be used to pr ovide relief the administration feels is appropriate and the executive branchs position is that all blanket relief decisions require balance of judgment regarding foreign policy humanitarian and immigration concerns unlike tps aliens who benefit from evd or ded do not necessarily register for the status with uscis but they trigger the protection when they are identified for deportation if however they wish to be employed in the united states they must apply for work authorization from uscis nationalities receiving temporary protections aliens from six

the proponents are not asserting that the governments of these countries are repressing people or violating human rights rather they maintain that illegal forces within the country are creating danger ous conditions that the governments have not been successful in remedying others main tain that many countries around the world are comparably dangerous and that conditions in peru and colombia do not
