social security act of 1935 establis hed federal oldage pension financed with employeeemployer payroll taxes fo r most workers in commerce and industry congress since then has changed the social security program many times amendments to the original act ve added survivor s and dependents benefits added disability hospital and medical insurance expanded coverage to new groups of workers lowered the minimum age for retirement benefits increased payroll taxes raised benefits provided for automatic adjustment of benefits to reflect inflation and made numerous other change s this paper reviews the major votes taken by the house and senate in passing the original act and in amending it from 1936 through 2006 discu ssion centers on oldage survivors and disability insurance oasdi votes although medicar and other programs are brought up occasionally the discussion of the votes is set forth in terms of house action senate action and conference agreements and it gives the party breakdown for most votes discussed d demo crat rrepublican i inde pendent the paper looks not only at votes on final passage of bills and adoption of conference reports but also at votes on amendments considered on the fl oor of the house and senate and at votes for recommittal to committee just before passage it generally does not examine votes that occurred at the committee level the primary source of the vote information was the congressional record the primary source of the information for the separation of the vote by political party was the congressional quarterly from the start the oldage benefits pr ogram aroused argument opponents said that the payroll or social security tax was likely to overburden industry reduce the purchasing power of workers and endanger the growth of private pension plans in addition some argued that huge reserves to be built up in the oldage reserve account would become tempting source of funds that the government could borrow for current spending and thus would lead to an increase in the federal debt fear that the reserve account would be used to subs idize new deal projects was one reason why some members argued for current financ ing payasyougo of oldage benefits some opponents maintained that the federal government did not have the constitutional power to create national pension plan some questioned whether the system could be kept fina ncially sound and whether ade quate earnings records could be maintained for so many millions of workers still others said that the programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30920crs2 was not generous enough they protested that it gave only partial protection and minimal benefits and that it imposed regressive soakthepoor tax proponents maintained that social secu rity would provide protection against destitution and dependency in old age and that it would provide persons with an opportunity to care for themselves on more adequate basis than could be obtained from state oldage assistance pa yments welfare some re garded the proposals self financing method payroll taxes on employ ers and employees as strength as workers would be required to pay taxes on their wages in order to receive social security they would acquire an earned righ t to benefits and income test would apply further some said that because the system would be financed by earmarked payroll taxes it would be relatively free from political and economic pressures that might impair its financial soundness nd capacity to do the job intended table 1 social security laws 19352006 year title public law bill

congress prominent republicans in the house and senate made attempts to delete the provi sions creating the oldage pension system they said they preferred to rely solely on the assistance charitywelfare approach to help the aged they argued that the payroll taxinsurance mechanism of the old age benefits provisions might be unconstitutional and that it would impose heavy tax burden on businesses that would retard economic devel opment members of the minority stated in the ways and means committees report to the house that the oldage benefits program t itle ii and the method by which the money was to be raised to pay for the program title v iii established bureaucracy in the field of insurance in competition with private business they contended further that the program would

said that the financing arrangement was unconstitutional he indicated that the tax would be particularly burdensome on industry running up to 6 on payrolls he said that business and industry are alread operating under very heavy burdens and maintained that to add payroll tax to their burden would probably cause more unemployment and more uncertainty7 mr jenkins roh supporter of the treadway amendment stated that making each worker pay 3 of his money for oldage benefits whether he wanted to or not and requiring employers to do the same was clearly unconstitutiona l he said why talk about wanting to relieve the depression why talk about charity why talk about all these other things when you are placing financial lash upon the backs of the people whose backs are breaking under load of debts and taxes he described the oldage benefits system as compul sion of the rankest kind8 the treadway amendment was defeated by 49125 teller vote9 d on april 19 1935 mr treadway ma motion to

hearing mr townsend stated that his plan was only incidentally pension plan he sa id the principal objectives of the proposal were to solve the unemployment problem and to restore prosperity by giving people purchasing power he cited census bureau data that four million people over the age of 60 held jobs in 1930 he reiterated that in order to be eligible for the proposed pension of 200 month those elderly peopl would have to give up their jobs which he said meant that 4 million jobs would become available to middleaged and younger people in addition he said th at requiring 8 million elderly persons to buy 200 worth of goods and services each m onth would increase demand and result in more jobs31 mr sabath dil said he thought it was decidedly out of place to bring the townsend bill to the

oasdi tax rates when there have been changes in the law and in the experience of programs and in order to keep all the programs on more or less even reserve ratio reallocation means that th formula

onehalf of their benefits exceed 34000 s ingle and 44000 couple and eliminated the maximum taxable earnings base for hi ie subjected all earnings to the hi tax effective in 1994 as part of his plan to cut the federal fiscal deficit president clinton proposed in his first budget that the proportion of benefits subject to taxation should be increased from 50 to 85 effective in 1994 his budget document said this would move the treatment of social security and railroad retirement tier i benefits toward that of private pensions and would ge nerate 32 billion in new tax revenues over five years the proceeds would not be cred ited to the social security trust funds as under current law but to the medicare hosp ital insurance program which had less favorable financial outlook th an did social security doing so also would have avoided procedural obstacles that could have been raised in the budget reconciliation process the budget also proposed that the maximum taxable earnings base for hi be eliminated entirely beginning in 1994 both proposals especially the increase in the taxation of benefits were opposed vigorously by the republican minority critics maintained that the increase was unfair as it changed the rules in the middle of the game penalizing recipients who relied on old law and who cannot change past work and savings decisions regardless of abstract arguments about tax principles many recipients regard increased taxation as simply reduction in the benefits they had been promised they regarded taxation of benefits as an indirect means test which would weaken the earned right nature of the program and make it more like welfare where needhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30920crs80 376 subsequently after the republicans gained c ontrol of the house of

supported hr 4277 s final passage interest in making ssa independent began in the early 1970s when social securitys impact on fiscal policy was made more visible by including it in the federal budget during congressional budget discussions in the early 1980s proponents of independence wanted to insu late social secur ity from benefit cuts designed to meet short term budget goals rather than policy concerns about social security many argued that making the agency independent w ould help insulate it from political and budgetary discussions w ould lead to better leadership and reassure the public about social securitys longrun survivability opponents argued that social security s huge revenue and outlays should not be isolated from policy choices affecting other hhs social programs and that its financial implications for th economy and millions of recipi ents should be evaluated in conjunction with other economic and soci functions of the government they further believed that making ssa indepe ndent would not necessarily resolve its administrative problems which were heavily influenced by ongoing policy changes to its programs resulting from legislation and court decisions starting in 1986 number of attempts were made in congress to make ssa independent various administrations generally opposed the idea and disagreement persisted between the house and senate over how such an

not in fact retired also they argued that eliminating or significantly liberalizing th benefit would primarily help those who do not need help ie the betteroff however over the years probably the main impediment to eliminating the earnings test was its negative effect on th financial status of the program and on current federal budgets which perennially were in deficit by 2000 the federal budget was r unning large surplu ses so major alterations to the test were deemed affordable also it was projected that eliminating the test would have negative impact on social securitys l ongrange financing because of offsetting savings the ground work for this offsetting effect had been laid in 1983 when congress increased the delayed retirement credit d rc the drc increases benefits for retirees by certain percentage for each month they do not receive benefits after they attain their full retirement age the 1983 legislation provided for long phasein of the increase in the drc so that its ultimate rate would not be achieved until 2008 at that point it would be actuarial mean ing that the additional benefits person would receive over his or he r lifetime due to the drc w ould be approx imately equal to the value of the benefits lost due to th earnings test thus the longrange cost of eliminating the earnings test for those above the full retirement age would be offset by the savings produced by fewer payments of drcs because there was threat to social securitys longrange solvency and the short range costs were judged to be affordable the momentum to repeal the test for those at or over the retirement age was overwhelming 1 house action on march 1 2000 the house approved h r 5 bill that would eliminate the earnings test for recipients who have attained the full
