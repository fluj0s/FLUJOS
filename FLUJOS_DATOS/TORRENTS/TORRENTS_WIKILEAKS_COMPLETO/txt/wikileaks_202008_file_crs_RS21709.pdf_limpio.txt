cattle that reduces the supply of culled animals available for export large number of canadian cull cattle that are currently older than eight years and thus disqualified from export eligibility by the age requirements in mrr2 and strengthening of canadian cattle prices as the mrr2 rule goes into effect14 us imports of canadian cattle had fallen to 512000 head in 2003 and virtually none in

besides concerns about competition from increased canadian live cattle imports there were worries that opening the border to what some believe are potentially risky canadian animals will undermine
