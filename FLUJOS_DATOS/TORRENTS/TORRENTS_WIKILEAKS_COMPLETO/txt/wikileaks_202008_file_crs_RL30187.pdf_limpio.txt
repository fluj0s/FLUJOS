and return kosovar albanian refugees to their homeland th admini stration and congress have paid less public attention to the resolution f kosovos longterm future but this i ssue may move to centerstage in the next phase of discussions ultimately congressional support for continued us militar involvement may be linked to the viability of the settlement being pursued the united states has number of interests relative to kosovos future status including providing protection and justice for kosovos albanian and ser b populat ions encouraging the establishment of new democratic government i n serbia enhancing security and avoiding turmoil in neighboring countries preserving nato credibility and cohesion avoiding harmful precedents and unintende d consequences keeping western relations with russia on constructive path and limiting the size and duration of the us comm itment to enforcement of settlement several alte rnative models for kosovos status have been discussed informally one possibility is restoration of kosovar autonomy within yugoslavia proponents of autonomy argue the virtue of not requiring border changes that could rekindl other border disputes in europe the main concern is that it may not give albanian refugees the nece ssary confidence to return in which case ethnic cleansing will have succeeded and the international community will be left with the consequences another possibility is an international protectorate involving defact separation from yugoslavia but not spelling out its ultimate status it could b placed under united nations nato organization for security and cooperation in europe osce or other organization supervision combined with protection from credible international force proponents ar gue that kosovar refugees would be able to return safely the yugoslavia government would be deterred from furthe r aggression and troublesome precedents would not be set critics note that thi s outcome would postpone but not permanently settle the status of kosovo indepen dence is an option advocated mainly by ethnic albanians outsid observers believe that independence would be unworkable at the present time without adequate preparation it could sink kosovo into chaos and heighten tensions in the balkans partition with serbia keeping part and the rest becoming protectorate independent or attached to albania has been advocated by som observers as the most realisti c solution given their belief that serbs and albanian are unlikely to be able to live together any time in the foreseeable future finally kosovos status c ould be left to wider balkan peace conference to deal with all of the sources of conflict and backwardness in the region some think it is the only way of breaking the cycle of conflict and creating lasting peace in the region given that the issues and problems are so interrelated skeptics argue that expecting to be able to solv all of the balkan problems at once is unrealistic and making kosov hostage to wider settlement would reduce the prospects of ever returning normalcy to the provincehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30187contents introduction 1 us interests involved 2 alternate

governments against their own populations see also crs report rl30152 kosovo and nato selected issues of international law by david m ackerman kosovos future status alternative models introduction the current focus of us and nato attention is on military and diplomati c efforts to achieve serb pullback of forces from kosovo deploy an internationa l peacekeeping force there and return the nearly one million kosovar albania n refugees to their homeland little official attentio n by the administration or congress has been paid to the resolution of kosovos longterm future it may in fact be impossible to design solution until it is clear under what terms the conflict will end however the question of kosovos stat us is likely to move to the center once peace is restored congress and the president are likely to seek settlement that will break the cycle of turmoil that has so deeply engaged the united states and europe in the balkans over the last decade congressional support for continued us military in volvement may be linked to the longterm viability of the settlement being pursued history suggests that finding stable and lasting settlement may be difficult beyond conclusion of the military campaigns and restoration of peace choices will have to be made among difficult and imperfect alternat ives any settlement must take into account competing local and internatio nal interests and perhaps even wider plans to stabilize the balkan region settlement must balance accepted internationa l principles that are not always easy to reconcile most of the possible outcome s1 discussed in this report have historical precedents with possible lessons for the current situation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30187crs2 us interests involved the united states and its allies have to be mindful of larger interests relative to kosovos future status ny proposed settlement will be judged in light of how well it satisfies those interests considerations include providing protection and justice for kosovos albanian and ser b populations the principal requirement of any settlement is that the refugees be returned to kosovo this means creating the conditions in which most of the kosovo albanians can and are willing to re turn and live in safety while the serbs in kosovo are also prote cted this is humanitarian interest primarily but also serves the selfinterest of ot her countries the refugees cannot be left in neighboring macedonia and lbania without threatening the fragile stability of those countries europea n north american and other nations would find it very difficult to absorb refugees in the numbers that have fled or been forced out of kosovo nor is the interna tional community likely to want to let stand the example that brutal regimes can simply export large populations leaving other countries to deal with the consequences encouraging the establishment of new democratic government in serbia and preserving democrac in montenegro because milosevics power rests on strife turmoil and whipping up nationalist hatreds there is widespread belief that serbia will remain danger in the region as long as he stays i n power so far milosevic has been at the center of successive conflicts i n slovenia croatia bosniahercegovina and kosovo if he stays in power it is feared he w ill foment new conflicts in montenegro target ethnic minorities within vojvodina and other parts of serbia or seek to destabilize macedonia and albania already the milosevic regime is reported ly seeking to undermine the democratically elected government of montenegro under milosevic the process of building civil society in serbia has been set back significantly many observers hope that new leadership can be establ ished that will respect human rights reorient its foreign policy to joining europe and longe r present threat to its own population or its neighbors preservin g peace and reconstruction efforts in bosnia three years f extensive and costly effort to rebuild bosnia and bring eventual multiethni c reconciliation is seriously threatened by the conflict in kosovo tension s among serbs muslims and croats are likely to grow the milosevi c government could try to reignite separatism among bosnian serbs also bosnian refugees may be even more reluctant than they are now to return to areas in which other ethnic groups fo rm majority natos failure might fuel separatism among all the groups on the other hand if nato prevails i n kosovo bosnians may be convinced to try to make their multiethnic stat work enhan cing security and avoiding turmoil in neighboring countries especially macedonia and albania macedonia has potentially volatile mix of ethnic groups including slavic majority living in uneasy coexistence with large ethnicalbanian population albania is weak fragile state with ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30187crs3 barely functioning economy it has small but significant greek minority but greekalbanian relations have im proved recently the presence of masses of kosovar banian refugees has strained both countries severely any further spillover of the conflict in yugoslavia could cause an explosion in eithe r country and threaten wider balkan crisis beyond these two countries the entire balkan region is susceptible to potential strife sparked by turmoil i n yugoslavia as result of economic problems reciprocal historical grievances and ethnic tensions any settlement in kosovo should be consistent with wider efforts to bring peace security and economic development to the balkans preserving nato credibility and cohesion nato is in transition and it s future role is being defined it is still widely seen as the most potent force to guarantee peace and stability in europe although some question its continued relevance in the post cold war world opinion is divided on whether nato ever should have committed its forces to defend kosovo now that nato is engaged in its first war ver its performance is being watched closely many believe that the alliance must prevail against milosevic if is to maintai n credibility an unsatisfactory outcome in kosovo may lead to new questioning of the alliance on both sides of the atlantic some observers also stress that nato credibility is inseparable from us credibil ity the united states is not only seen as the leader of nato but also as the principal actor in the yugoslav military campaign some are likely to wonder whether nato can ac t successfully in any conflict if it cannot muster the political will to prevail over relatively small and weak opponent so clearly acting against europea n stability others are likely to see negative nato experience in kosovo as evidence that nato should return to its traditional defensive role and give up plans to enlarge its membership and missions avoiding harmful prece dents and unintended consequences the ultimate outcome of the kosovo crisis could set far reaching precedents elsewhere in the balkans europe and the world thnic cleansing and atrocities on scale not seen in europe since world war ii and its aftermath are believed to have been carried out by milosevics forces events in kosovo like those tha t preceded them in the previous yugoslav conflicts have shaken the widelyheld belief that in europe at least such atrocities were l onger possible given the elaborate structures and norms developed in the last 50 years and the lessons learned from european history any kosovo outcome that is interpreted s international acquiescence to ethnic cleansing could significantly heighte n national tensions els ewhere outcomes that substantially change the status of kosovo are likely to set their own precedents for better or worse keeping weste rn relations with russia on constructive path russia has strongly opposed nato military action against serbia russian nationalists in particular have rallied in support of serbia as historic ally many experts believe that t he fact that nato has acted in disregard of russian wishes has added to russias sense of anger and humiliation further endangering n already fragile relationship there is an opposi ng view that yugoslavia despite the rhetoric is largely irrelevant to the struggle in russia or to growing anti western sentiments still settlement that would be acceptable to an d provide significant role for russia might help improve relations as well shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30187crs4 final theoretical possi bility would be transfer of the territory to albania however one2 is pressing for such an outcome at the present time not even most kosovars or othe r albaniansdeprive russian communists and ultranationalists of major issue to us against reformist and pr owestern leaders russia may be in good position to broker settlement given its ties to the yugoslav government and th perceived sympathy of many russians toward serbia limiting the us role in enforcement of settleme nt many in congress and among the public are wary of longterm illdefined and costly us commitment to nforce balkan peace this may argue for settlement that can stand on it s own within reasonable period of time it also argues fo r encouraging european countries to take more of the responsibility fo r implementing and overseeing any agreement finally it suggests that an settleme nt should create an entity that has the prospect of becomin g economically viable many in congress and among the public would oppose any openended us military role in implementing kosovo settlement opponents of longterm us commitment argue that the united states does not h ave sufficient interests in this part of the balka ns to insert troops to keep peace in kosovo on the other hand proponents of us involvement suggest that us presence together with our allies in the region that now represents the greates t threat to european peace may be worth the cost some argue that us troops are already in europe for the long haul t preserve peace to move some forces from germany and elsewhere to the balkans along with forces of allied nations would not significantly add to the cost and would do much t diminish the main threats to european security while allowing thos forces to continue to perform other nato missions alternate models for kosovos future several alternative models for kosovos status have been discussed the include1 restoration of kosovar autonomy within yugoslavia with borde r changes 2 creation of an international protectorate for an indefinite perio d involving defacto separation from yugoslavia but not spelling out its ultimat status 3 independence 4 partition with serbia keeping pa rt and the rest becoming independent or attached to albania or 5 resolving kosovos status as part of larger balkan agreement kosovos status could evolve over time through mor e2 than one of these models initially the international community is unlikely to g formally beyond autonomy or estab lishment of facto protectorate either model could lead in the future to independence partition or even union with albania depending on how the situations in kosovo and serbia develop each model s possible strength s and weaknesses as well as wider ramifications for us interests each has historical precedents that might suggest prospects for success or failure the feasibility of alternatives presented

robust international military force that has the confidence of the population and whose authority is also accepted by the kosovo liberation army kla is not deployed to kosovo substantial return of the refugees will be very difficult t accomplish and serb leaders will have achieve d their goal of ethnic cleansing under those circumstances the prospects for any of these alternatives would be sharpl reduced as result some observers question whether there is much useful middle ground between nato demands and the positions of the milosevic government on which compromise solution could be based restoration of autonomy within yugoslavia autonomy for kosovo could mean return to the pre1989 s tatus quo kosovo would rema in part of serbia but would have substantial control over its own affairs until 1989 kosovo and vojvodina in northern serbia were two autonomou s regions within the serb republic of yugoslavia with very substantial local self httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30187crs6 government prior to 1989 the treatment of ethnic minorities in yugoslavia wa s viewed by many as positive example for the region though the tito governmen t would periodically crackdown against nationalist dissidents the albanian ethni c majority had considerable cultural language and religious freedom in kosovo t the same time the serb population felt increasing alienation and left the province in large numbers serb president milosevic revoked kosovos auton omy along with that of vojvodi na which had multiethnic mix of serbs hungarians and othe r nationalities living in relative peace the revocation of autonomy for the two regions led directly to the unraveling of the yugoslav fe deration both alarmed and liberated by milosevics moves to upset the constitutional order first slovenia then croatia bosniahercegovina and macedonia declared their independence only the republic of montenegro stayed within the yugoslav federation autonomy was the status for kosovo generally supported by the united states and allied governments before the milosevic government escalated its campaign i n kosovo it may still be the preferred solution of many officials and experts especially if the united states and allies want quick way out of the conflict the us governm ent has said repeatedly that it does not seek an independent kosovo bu t rather restoration of autonomy within yugoslavia the question now is whethe r autonomy remains realistic option in the aftermath of serb ethnic cleansing an d systematic atrocitie s in kosovo some observers believe that this solution may prove unworkable the terms of autonomy might have considerable effect on its viability autonomy can take many forms at the low end this could mean very limited self rule with yugoslav forces and police still in place and serb laws taking precedence over any local legislation at the other end of the spectrum autonomy could be very far reaching most serb forces would be wit hdrawn and kosovars would govern and police themselves kosovos local law s could prevail over national ones in stipulated spheres many see withdrawal of most serb forces as an absolute prerequisite fo r making autonomy work an international military presence would be needed t ensure the safety of kosovo albanians another critical factor in determining the feasibility of autonomy is whether there would be change of government in belgrade settlement inv olving continued serb sovereignty would be particularly hard for kosovo albanians to swallow if the present government remains in belgrade proponents of autonomy argue the virtue of not requiring border changes that could rekindle other border disputes in europe such solution would satisfy th serbian desire to keep kosovo within its bo rders with its serb churches monasteries and historic sights russia would probably support an autonomous kosovo withi n serbia if this outcome were conditioned on replacement of the present ser b government it might encourage the opposition to try to oust the milosevic regime on the other hand such conditions might also harden serb resistance for the nato alliance autonomy accompa nied by the presence of natoled implementation force could provide an avenue for flexible settlement adjusting to events over time in this view the kosovars could have the opportunity to develop workable institutions free from politica l or military pressure from belgrade if serbiahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30187crs7 continues on nationalistic and authoritarian path kosovo could evolve to status of independence conversely democratic serbia respectful of minority rights could encourage an eventual rapprochement the main drawback of autonomy as solution is that virtually kosova r albanians now support this option especially the kosovo liberation army kla autonomy may not give albanian refugees the necessary confidence to return t kosovo most albanians may not believe that they can get protection and justic under serb sovereignty if refugees do not return ethnic cleansing will hav succeeded nato will be seen as having fail ed and the international community will be left with the consequences including the need t absorb the refugees and deal with any other contingencies resulting from the kosovo precedent under thos circumstances an greement to restore some autonomy to kosovo would have little meaning regional autonomy as an instrument to bring peace and rmony among national groups within coun try has worked better in some past cases and less well in others where it has encouraged separatism cases in which it has worked well includ switzerland with its canton system canada where quebec has considerable autonomy and ironically within the previous serbian republic of yugoslavia after sout h tyrol was transferred to italy from austria in the postworld war i peace treaties south tyrolean separatism was very strong as result of subs equent agreements that restored very considerable autonomy to south tyrol the situation has becom relatively stable in few cases has the granting of autonomy to an ethnic regio n complet ely erased aspirations for independence separatist aspirations have bee n rekindled even in countries that have enjoyed relative ethnic harmony czechoslova kia split peacefully into the czech and slovak republics in 1993 movements for local independence can be s een today in spain italy canada and the united kingdom the relevance of his torical cases to kosovo may be diminished by the level of atrocities curr ently being carried out against the albanian population and the fear and hatred they are fueling international protectorate many analysts see creation of an international protectorate over kosovo for an indefinite period as the best or least objectionable outcome of the conflict for th present time without necessar ily addressing its ultimate legal status kosovo would be separated from serbia facto and the province would be placed under som international authority all serb military paramilitary and police forces would b removed from kosovo and replaced by an international military force includin g significant nato participants but possibly including nonnato forces as well unlike the situation in bosnia control of the territ ory would be wrested from national and local officials the key distinction between the autonomy model and an internationa l protectora centers on who controls and governs the territory in the autonom model control is shared according to an agreed formula between the national an d local authorities with an international force overseeing and perhaps enforcin g implementation in the case of protectorate the international authority assumes full control of the ter ritory to some extent the international authority role is not muchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30187crs8 madrid daily pais may 9 1999 cited in rferl newsline may 10 19993different from that of an occupying power the previous sovereign has role nor does the local population govern itself prot ectorate can be for fixed or indefinite period settlement of this type would represent an acknowledgment by thos imposing it that neither serbia nor the kosovars are seen as fit or capable to rul kosovo at the present time as kosovo became ready local democratic governin g institutions could be built up and given increasing responsibility for the day to day running of government authority could gradually be turned over to rebuilt local military and polic structures with ultimate control still held by the international authority as long as the protectorate continued some elements of the rambouillet ag reement that was signed by kosovar albanian leaders but never accepted by the milosevic government could be revived number of influential voices have been added to those who supp ort this option carlos westendorp the outgoing chief international representa tive in bosnia said that the international community made mistakes in bosnia which it should avoid i n kosovo he argued that kosovo must become true intern ational protectorate with foreign control over the judicial police and military functions 3 how such an international protectorate would be managed has not yet bee n determined the only exis ting structure specifically created to oversee protectorates is the united nations trusteeship council the council is still in existence although it has been dormant for number of years since all of the trust territories have gained their independence under the trusteeship system individual countries were assigned to administer trust territories often they were the previous colonial power in the case of kosovo group of countries rather than any single country would be responsible kosovo protectorate could still be established under u n auspices or it could be placed under nato osce eu or even the council f europe supervision however besides the none of these institutions has mechanism for or previous experience with performing such role the strength of such solution would be that kosovar refugees would be able to return safely with robust and trusted international force including nato both albanians and serbs would be protected such an outcom would hopefully deter the yugoslav government from acting against montenegro minorities in vojvodina or exacerbating problems in macedonia or albania while such settlement would be bitter pill for serbia to swallow it would still be preferable to outright permanent loss of the pro vince serbia would have incentives to modify its policies in the hope of eventual restoration of kosovo to serbia nato would preserve its credibility by not allowing ethnic cleansing to stand such an outcome would avoid settin g problematic precedents it would discourage those who might contemplate ridding themselves of ethnic minorities in similar way and those who would seek to press separatist aims based on the kosovo outcome the main weakness of settlement establishing an indefinite protectorate over kosovo is th at it would only postpone but not permanently solve either the problemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30187crs9 for fuller definition and

press 1994 p933972of kosovo or wider balkan issues in the meantime the united states and its allies would have to bear the full burden and costs of supporting and rebuilding kosovo probably for an indefinite period of time serbia would be unhappy with the outcome as might t he kla and russias stance would be uncertain the fact that nat wants russia to support an d participate in settlement makes the choice of jure protectorate less likely in general the historical experience has given the concept of protectorates negative image in most cases they were simply mechanism for strong powers to4 dominat weaker entities and to extend colonial rule in the case of the league f nations mandates former colonies of the world war i defeated powers wer transferred to the temporary control of other countries with the understanding that these would be administered by them to varying degrees until they were ready t assume independence different types of mandates were defined for example the former colony of southwest africa now namibia was placed der complete control of south africa on the other hand countries which were considered to be further along toward independence such as transjordan pales tine lebanon and syria were given considerable local autonomy by the mandatory power under the postworld war ii trust system former mandates territorie s detached from defeated powers and some former colonies of other states were placed under the trustee ship system with the purpose of developing them to independence individual countries were named trustees most of the trust territories were in africa and the pacific 5 the kurdish enclave in northern iraq protected by an allieden forced nofly zone and in the past some liaison personnel on the gro und is current example of very limited facto not jure form of inter national protection the united states and its allies have ruled out independence for the kurdish enclave which would b opposed by rkey and other countries with kurdish populations or partition which would create power vacuum that could be exploited by other countries while post world war ii germany and japan as defeated powers were never protectorates their postwar evolution may have some relevance to kosovo s situation for example in germany the four victorious allied powers occupied the country and took full control of running it in the western zones the united states britain and france introduced tough measures of demilitarization an d denazific ation they tried and punished war criminals over time as new civi l society took root power was gradually restored to the german people german yhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30187crs10 on the other h and this example might be even more relevant if nato decided to introduce6 ground forces into serbia and went on to defeat serb forces made highly successful transition to become one of europes most powerful an d stable democracies 6 independence settlement granting immediate independence to kosovo is not generall viewed as realistic near term option it has been advocated mainly by albanians kosovars and the kosovo liberation army unless the situation on the groun d changes drastically this outcome seems very unlikely for the present in the lon g term autonomy an international protectorate or wider balkan settlement coul d lead to independence an argument made in favor of an independent kosovo is that it woul d compen sate the albanian victims of serb aggression and fulfill their aspirations indepen dence would be an acknowledgment that kosovar albanians would neve r again accept living under belgrades authority certainly kosovo albanians would cheer independence there are those who believe that independence for kosovo is inevitable in view of demographics and recent events they would argue that such settlement simply accepts the inevitable in terms of what they perceive as th eventual outcome bypassing any intermedi ate stage of some other settlement might diminish the burden and cost to the international community they might argue however even many kosovar supporters of independence say they are t ready kosovo would need to provide for its self governance its economic needs and its lf defense making independence possible might require arming the kla as some have prop osed an independent kosovo that was unprepared could plunge into chaos without massive outside support and assistance over long period of time the united states and allied governments would still have costs to bear such solution could even heighten tensions in the balkans militant kla leaders who may have little democratic inclination could gain control of kosovo the serb minorit would be unprotected and vulnerable such an outcome could heighten tensions in macedonia and inspire serb irredentism it might encourag ethnic separatists in other countries an independent kosovo would be strongly opposed by russia some of the closest precedents for independence are provided by the forme r republics of yugoslavia although kosovo never held the status of an independen t republic within yugoslavia slovenia croatia mace donia and bosnia have declared and won their independence since 1989 slovenia had the easiest road with it s relatively homogeneous population it gained freedom after brief conflict wit h yugoslav forces croatia only won its independe nce after much more bloody conflict with yugoslav forces resulting in initial ss of territory and eventual reconquest by croatian forces some ethnic cl eansing was carried out by both sides though not on the scale witnessed in bosnia or kosovo bosnias declaration of independenc resulted in bloody ethnic conflict atrocities on large sca and massive displacementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30187crs11 this precedent

components parts even as the individual units seek to becom part of larger entities this is very visible in europe where disintegrative forces are at work in number of countries even as all groups see

washington post may 4 1999 pa23 of populations the uneasy peace brought by the dayton accords has left the future national integrity and ethnic peace dependent on an outside military presence partition partition of kos ovo has been advocated by some observers as the only realistic solution giv that serbs and albanian are unlikely to be able to live together in one country in the foreseeable future some observers have suggested that milosevics ultimate aim for kosovo is partition with s erbia holding onto as much of the territory cleansed of lbanians as possible the displaced albanians could be resettled in the other part however clear pattern has emerged from the serb campaign t substantiate such an aim in any case partition along with transfer of populations remains an option if kosovo is to be par titioned several crucial questions must be decided first how much territory goes to each side what is an acceptable settlement given that before the flight of refugees the population was 90 percent albanian and 10 percent serb second where would the border be drawn taking int account what each side values most third how would each part be governed presumably the serb portion would remain an integral part of serbia would the remainder be independent become an int ernational protectorate or be transferred to albania would this new entity be viable politically or economically the appeal of partition t some is that it would separate the albanians from the serbs presum ably if the partition were drawn up in way that at least partl satisfies the interests of both sides the outcome would be more durable and require less outside enforcement on the negative side partition would reward the milosevic policy of ethni c cleansing at least partially it would require further population transfers since th albanian s and serbs are mixed throughout kosovo partition could reduce th economic viability of each part severing important t ransportation and resources links rather than defusing serbalbanian tensions it could increase them irredentis m could emerge on both sides it wo uld set precedent encouraging unhappy national minorities or for that matter majorities to seek partition or separation it could7 put an immediate strain on macedonia which has large albanian minorit populatio n and on bosnia where the republika srpska seeksselfrule man

turkey would worry about precedent for i ts kurdish regions russia with many nationalities still living inside i ts territory would also oppose such settlement there are many histo rical precedents for settlement involving partition andor the forcible transfer of populations population exchanges took place between th greeks and turks in 1922 after world war ii germans w ere expelled from poland czechoslovakia and other countries one case with certain parallels though on much larger scale is the partition of india and creation of pakistan as would be the case in kosovo the partition was designed to separate warring ethnic and religious groups muslims were minority in britishcontrolled india and efforts to bring the parties together failed ultimately even indian leader s agreed to partition as an alternative to civil war and chaos but muslims were scattered throughout india and the partition touched off vast an d bloody exchange of populations partition did not bring stability it spawned political extremism decades later tensions between india and pakistan remain high th continuing conflict between india and pakistan over kashmir provides microcosm of the subcontinent problems that partition was meant to resolve the united nations general assembly passed resolution resolution 181ii on 29 november 1947 calling for the partition of palestine into jewish state n arab state and an international zone of jerusalem the resolution prove d unenforceable and the parties continue to press conflicting claims frequently wit h violence in some cases partition was carried out defacto without formally changing the status of country or region clear recent example was in c yprus now divided into greek and turkish sectors as result of turkish military intervention to protec t turkish cypriots the partition has not been recognized internationally and i s adamantly opposed by greece the greeks would probably see partition of kosovo as negative precedent for cyprus neighboring countries especially macedonia would also be concerned about any transfer of part of kosovo to albania and th prospect of creating greater albania resolving kosovos status as part of wider balkan settlement thus far the balkan turmoil result ing from the disintegration of yugoslavia and the policies of losevic has been addressed piecemeal with the united states and europe responding reactively to each new challenge despite international efforts stopping one conflict appears to have simply given way to the next yet the crises are interconnec ted both as result of history and milosevics ambitions they may be difficult to solve i n isolation many fear that the kosovo conflict could be followed by troubles in montenegro and voiv odina as well as renewed tensions in macedonia and bosnia especially if milosevic is left in power few believe that the bosnia n dispute is settled there the presen ce of foreign troops has pacified the territory for the timebeing however advances in nationbui lding or national reconciliation havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30187crs13 good historical source is rene albrecht carrier diplomatic history of europe ince the8 congress of vienna harper and row 1973 764been very modest removal of the foreign presence would b likely to plunge bosnia back into civil war therefore growing number of specialists are suggesting wider balka n negotiation to try to devise viable regional settlement acceptable to the majo r parties that diffuses the main potential trouble spots and sets the balkan region including serbia on path to security prosperity and integration into europe they argue for dealing with the status of montenegro addressing the question f restoring autonomy for vojvodina and reexamining the future of bosnia som would go so far as to consider redrawing the borders within the former yugoslavia others would see any mo ve to try to create ethnically homogeneous states as huge and futile step backwards in an era in which ethnic diversity is growing realit throughout europe and in which borders are gradually coming down instead they suggest comprehensi ve development plan for the region tied to more open borders and an agreed code of conduct on ethnic relations as well as serious steps to integrate all of the balkans more closely with the rest of europe any settlement would have to include massive program to strengthen civil society support economi c development for the region and create r oad map for closer integration with europe and nato history has seen number of attempts by the great powers to fashion comprehensive settlement for the b alkan region some of these have brought peace8 for while but each has sowed the seeds for new tensions nd conflicts for example the establishment of the kingdom of serbs croats and slov enes soon to be renamed yugoslavia at the end of world war was designed to meet the national aspirations of those three groups however the new country was soon plagued by infightin g among the national groups and gave rise to ethnic disgruntlement as serious as had existed when much of the country was under the austrohungarian regime muc h of the balka ns remained poor backwater of europe however in each of the past efforts the great power s were pursuing their own narrow interests with little regard for the popularity or longterm sustainability of the settlements they imposed proponents of settling kosovos status in the context of wider balka n settlement argue that comprehensive negotiations now could for the first time truly focus on bringing viable peace and prosperity to the region rather than on unrelated great power interests they also maintain that this would be the only way f breaking the cycle of conflict and creating lasting peace in the region it woul d provide way of engaging all interested countries in constructive way especiall greece and turkey whose active positive parti cipation might ease their own disputes even as they help to set the region onto stable course skeptics would argue that an effort to simultaneously resolve all of the intricate and complex balkan troubles at once would be too ambitious and unrealistic it might also open pandoras box of new troubles it might create exaggerate d expectations and actually introduce ne w instabilities in countries that are doing better now it would be extremely difficult to find the consensus or the resources to carryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30187crs14 out such an endeavor in this view making kosovo hostage to wider settlemen t would retard and reduce the prospects of ever returning normalcy to the province it would also require sustained leadership probably by the united states
