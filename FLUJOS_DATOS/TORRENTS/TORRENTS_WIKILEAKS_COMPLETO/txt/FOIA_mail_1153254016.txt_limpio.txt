from fortunat joos joosclimateunibech to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject re new fig 614 date tue 18 jul 2006 162016 0200 cc tim osborn tosbornueaacuk jonathan overpeck jtouarizonaedu eystein jansen eysteinjansengeouibno xflowed hi keith thanks my concerns comes from the following i am not convinced that one gets the same response when forcing model with smoothed volcanic forcing instead with the spikes i suspect that the ocean will gain more heat in the later case due to the longer time to respond to the forcing however this remains to be tested but nobody has done this as far as i know in other words postprocessing the output of model forced with high resolution data does not necessarily give the same results as forcing the model with smoothed input there is chance to get different results that is why i prefer to show the real forcing ie the volcanic spikes as long as nobody has done such tests run i would prefer to be scientifically on the save side with the figure sorry but this is my modellers view on this forcings do not need to be on the same scale here we know that temporarily volcanic forcing albeit negative is much larger than anthropogenic forcing why should we hide this wellknow fact sceptics my call on this readers of our chapter are hopefully able to interpret the yaxis the tsteam in this case neither nor peck asked us to show the volcanic spikes point of the figure is to show the implication of low solar forcing wls versus bard that is why i prefer to blow the solar panel somewhat up we have varied solar forcing between the different runs of course the point about the natural forcing only simulation not able to get the 20th century warming is very important indeed i believe that this important conclusion is underscoored if we make it very clear that we have varied solar forcing over wide range by factor of 3 it would also be nice to show the 11yr solar cycle that is in the data sun spots but also 14c as far as normalisation of the forcing is concerned i have strong opinion there is consistency issue with chapter 2 where radiative forcing is always defined relative to 1750 17500 this point may especially be important for the ts there is also the issue about agreement over recent decades this is why i slightly prefer to normalize the forcing to be zero around 1750 the sulfur figure will show volcanic spikes we have agreed in bergen that we add sentence to the caption to point out that sulfate deposition may strongly vary regionally i think we have with fig 13 and 14 now the opportunity to convey to the readers the same information in two different ways perhaps we should not miss this opportunity in any case we will find solution and then go forward cheers fortunat keith briffa wrote fortunat et my opinions were consistent with tims expression we discussed his response the importance of consistency between different modelling figures time response of filters and in the absolute magnitude of forcing scale are the most important aspects to start showing apparently different volcanic spikes in the sulphate and emic figure will lead to confusion also ultimately we should remember that the point of this figure is to show that you can not get simulated temperatures to match observations without anthropogenic forcing not to show proportional responses to different solar or volcanic events cheers keith at 1345 18072006 fortunat joos wrote dear tim sorry that was very careless and totally inappropriate choice of words i seriously apologize of course smoothing is not dishonest i do it also all the time to the contrary i very much apreciate all your hard work to do these figures i know that it is very time consuming from own experience that is perhaps why i did not reflect on my wording when writing the email what i wanted to say is that if one has the opportunity to show directly what forcing was used by the model than i very much prefer to do so i hope there remains misunderstanding i realize now that i should have used more modest wording at various places let us see what eystein peck and keith are thinking about it with best wishes fortunat tim osborn wrote hi all thanks for the responses peck and fortunat i drafted the new figure 614 following as closely as possible the approach used for the original forcingsimulation figure now 613 this is why i smoothed all series and used common anomalisation period for all curves across all panels it can greatly help to interpret why the simulated temperature responds in the way it does because the zero or normal level is comparable across plots and because the strengths of different forcings can be compared on the same timescale as the simulated temperatures are shown and for 613 with so many different forcings and models shown it would have been impossible to use unsmoothed series without making the individual curves indistinguishable or indeed fitting them into such compact figure now that the emic panels are separate from the original 613 we do have the opportunity to make different presentational choices but i think nevertheless that some of the reasons for i proportional scaling ii common anomalisation period and iii smoothing to achieve presentation on comparable time scales that held for 613 probably also hold in 614 however i also appreciate the points raised by fortunat specifically that i it is nice to be able to compare the magnitude of the 11yr solar cycles with the magnitude of the lowfrequency solar variations and ii that using modern reference period removes the interpretation that we dont even know the forcing today so we have various advantages and disadvantages of different presentational choices and set of choices will satisfy all these competing demands one thing that i am particularly perturbed about is fortunats implication that to show smoothed forcings would be scientifically dishonest i disagree and i was also upset by your choice of wording if it were dishonest to show smoothed data then presumably the same holds for 613 but its impossible to distinguish all the different volcanic forcings if shown unsmoothed but also to every other graphic should i be showing the emic simulated temperatures without smoothing too so you can see the individual yearly responses to the volcanic spikes but annual means are formed from the temperatures simulated on the model timesteps so we still wouldnt be showing results that had not been postprocessed most climate models even gcms respond in quasilinear way such that the smoothed response to unsmooth forcing is very similar to the response to smooth forcing so if we are interested in the temperature response on time scales of 30 years and longer it seems entirely appropriate and better for interpretationcomparison of forcings to show the forcings on this time scale too because the forcing variations on those time scales are the ones that are driving the temperature response even though the forcing may be intermittent like volcanoes or have 11yr cycles like solar the choice of smoothing smoothing is not therefore anything to do with honestydishonesty but is purely presentational choice that can made accordingly to what the purpose of the figure is here our purpose seems to be longterm climate changes rather than response to individual volcanoes or to the 11yr solar cycle so the position is 1 smoothing or smoothing there are arguments for both choices though clearly i prefer smoothing and fortunat prefers smoothing i could make figure which kept the smooth lines but put the raw annual histogram volcanic spikes underneath in pale grey as peck requested anyway and possibly put the 11yr solar cycles in pale brown underneath the smoothed brown solar series this would be compromise but the main problem is that the scale of the largest volcanic spikes would far exceed the scale i am using to show the smoothed series so the panel is not large enough to do this 2 preindustrial or presentday anomalisation reference period again there are arguments for both choices whatever we choose i firmly believe it should be the same for all curves in this figure which can make dramatic difference 3 exaggeration of solar scale or proportional vertical scales this is the one that i have the firmest opinion about i see reason to exaggerate the scale of the solar forcings relative to volcanic or anthropogenic forcings the difference between the forcings looks clear enough in the version of the figure that i made exaggerating it will wrongly make the bard 25 case look at first glance bigger than the anthropogenic forcing and make it look more important than volcanic forcing ill hold off from making any more versions till decisions are made on these issues cheers tim at 0901 18072006 fortunat joos wrote hi tim and co thanks for the figure i like the figure showing the model results and the general outlinegraphic style however i am concerned about what is shown in the forcing figure 1 volcanic panel i strongly believe that we should show what was used by the model and not some 40 year smoothed curves for volcanic forcing or any other forcing so please use the original data file scientific honesty demands to show what was used and not something postprocessed 2 solar panel 2a we must show the wangleanshirley data on the original resolution as used to drive the models in this way we also illustrate the magnitude of the 11yr annual cycle in comparison with the background trend the record being flat apart from the 11yr cycle during the last decades is reality 2b do not apply any smooting to the bard data just use them as they are and how they were published by bard and used in the model 2c it is fine to supress the bard 008 case after 1610 not done in my figure version 2d the emphasis of the figure is on the solar forcing differences so please show solar somewhat overproportional in comparison to volcanic and other forcings 3 other forcings again smoothing needed here it would be hard to defend double smoothing 4 normalisation of solar forcing to some period mean if the different solar forcings disagree for today as in your option we may send the signal that we do not even know solar forcing today thus i slightly prefer to have the same mean forcing values for all solar records during the last few decades as shown in the attached version however i also can see some arguments for other normalisations to illustrate points 1 to 4 i have prepared and attached version of the forcing panel other points your choice of colors is fine time range 10002000 ad is fine suggest to remove the text from the ylabels except the units wm2 sorry for this additional comments coming bit late however i did not realise that you planned to smoothed the model input data in any way with best wishes fortunat tim osborn wrote hi peck eystein and fortunat ive drafted two versions of the new fig 614 comprising new panel showing the forcing used in the emic runs plus the old fig 613e panel showing the emic simulated nh temperatures keith has seen them already first you should know what i did so that you especially fortunat can check that what i did was appropriate 1 for the volcanic forcing i simply took the volcanic rf forcing from fortunats file and applied the 30year smoothing before plotting it 2 for the solar forcing there are 2 curves for the first i took the bard 025 column from fortunats rf file for the second i took the bard 008 column from fortunats rf file from 1001 to 1609 and then appended the wls rf forcing from 1610 to 1998 then i smoothed the combined record note that for the bard025 the line is flat from 1961 onwards which probably isnt realistic even though that is what was used in the model runs 3 for the all other forcings there are 2 curves for the first i took the co2 concentrations provided by fortunat then used the standard ipcc formula from the tar in fact the first of the three options for co2 in ipcc tar table 62 to convert this to radiative forcing i then added this to the nonco2 radiative forcings data from fortunats file to get the total radiative forcing for the second i replaced all values after 1765 with the 1765 value for the natural forcings case then i smoothed the combined record as in fig 613c i only applied 10year smoothing when plotting the all other forcings because it is fairly smooth anyway and using high smoothing results in lower final values when there is strong trend at the end of time series now some comments on the figures themselves please print them and refer to them when reading this 1 file chap6_f614_option1pdf is strongly preferred by keith and this shows the three forcing components separately which helps with understanding the individual causes of specific warming and cooling periods i have managed to reduce the size of this considerably compared to the equivalent panel in fig 613 because with only few series on it i could squeeze them together more and also reduce the range of the vertical axes 2 although we dont prefer it i have also made chap6_f614_option2pdf which is even smaller by only showing the sum of all the forcings in the top panel which version do you prefer please let know so i can make final changes only to the preferred version some more comments 1 fig 614b was originally fig 613e when it was part of that figure the colour bar showing the shades of grey used to depict the overlapping ranges of the published temperature reconstructions was only on fig 613d do you think i should now also add it to the emic panel 614b now that it is in separate figure it will be bit of squeeze because of the legend that is already in 614b 2 another carry over from when 614b was part of 613 is that the time range of all panels had to match 9002010 now that the emics are in separate figure i could start them in year 1000 which is when the forcing and simulations begin unless you want 613 and 614 to remain comparable again please commentdecide 3 i wasnt sure what colours to use for the forcing series in option 1 the volcanic and other forcings apply to all runs so i chose black with thickthin used to distinguish the all forcings from the naturalonly forcings basically the thin flat line in all other forcings the cyangreenblue runs used strong solar forcing so i used blue for that forcing the redorangebrown runs used weak solar forcing so i used brown for that forcing sound ok sorry for the long email but i wanted to get everything explained to avoid too many iterations please let know your decisionscomments on these questions or on any other aspects of the new figure cheers tim dr timothy j osborn academic fellow climatic research unit school of environmental sciences university of
