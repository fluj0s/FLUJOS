congressional concerns summary the decade of the 1990s saw increasing aw areness of the dangers to innocent civilians posed by the indiscriminate use of antipersonnel landmines apl in many conflicttorn countries the deployment of u s military forces to bosnia as part of the natoled implementation force ifor refocused the attention of the congress and citizenry on the dangers of apl prio r to participation by the us military in ifor the us congress had manifested concern with the larger issue of aplandmine proliferation through hearings and legislation the history of warfare evinces three uses of ap landmines the first use is as tactical weapon employed to protect friendl forces from an enemy advance or to canalize an enemy into fields of fire ap landmines are also used in conjunction with antitank mines at mines second landmines have also been used as weapon to intimidate and control populations use of landmines as terror weapon is prevalentduring irregular warfare the third conseque ntial role of landmines in warfare is as an indefinite hazard to civilians landmi nes left in place after the termination of hostilities have served as hindrance to refugee resettlement development andpeacekeeping operations the response of the united states congr ess to landmine proliferation has been multifaceted moreover to control the tac tical role of landmines the us military is guided by law and doctrine advances in the technology of mine warfare such as remotely delivered or scatterable mines have been accompanied by the developmentof selfdestructing and selfdeactivating capabilities to curtail the indiscriminateuse of mines the us congress has prohibited the export of ap mines by uscompanies congress has reviewed prot ocol ii of the convention on prohibitions or restrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons an amended protocol remains before the senate public law 104107 will ban us use of apl in 1999 the administration has asked for repeal lastly congress has appropriated funds for demining training and other assistance to nations with landmine problemsresearch and development of countermine technology and grants for deminingequipment current us policy is eventually to ba n the use of all apl worldwide the administration however wants to retain th use of dumb mines in korea and the use of smart mines in potential combat situations until alternative technologies areavailable advocates for more rapid ac tion support joining the ottawa treaty which was ready for signing in december 1997 imme diately the administration prefers the stepbystep approach traditionally adopted by the conference on disarmament in geneva to gain more universal participation but has set goal of signing theottawa treaty in 2006 if alternatives to apl

congressional concerns introduction throughout the decade of the 1990s thousa nds of innocent civilians have been injured or killed by residual antipersonnel landmines apl from many local andregional conflicts around the world humanitarian organizations and concernedindividuals strove to raise world consci ousness of this tragedy the deployment of us military forces to bosnia as part of the natoled implementation force iforand the prospect of subsequent casualties resulting from landmines focused theattention of congress journalists and the citizenry on the larger dangers of antipersonnel ap landmines efforts to meet the concern of landmine threat to us service members included first existing us military doctrine for both the tactical employment ofmines and demining operations second legislative history 1 of the efforts of congress and individual members to ban the use and export of ap mines and third an amendment to protocol ii of the conve ntion on prohibitions or restrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons ccw by the treaty signatories two efforts towards an international treaty to ban apl are ongoing in essence theproblem of landmine proliferation particularly in countries such as cambodiaafghanistan and angola was recognized by both the congress and the clinton administration prior to the creation of ifor moreover both the globalproliferation of ap mines and congre ssional efforts to curtail the export and production of landmines hold significant implications for several facets of americanforeign policy the landmine easily manufactured and tran sported serves role in the military doctrines of our own forces and those of allies and potential enemies and impedes the work of humanitarian relief workers and peace keepers thus the subject of landmine proliferation is and in all lik elihood will remain recurring theme before the congress the purpose of this report is to review the basic definitions issues past legislation and administration policies concerning antipersonnel landmines asa context for understanding ongoing policy debateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96362crs2 the role of landmines the current debate issues throughout the history of warfare the ro of the landmine as weapon has been disparate and manifold as warfare and science have evolved so too have the design technology and function of the landmine much of the current debate within the congress and between nations regardi ng ap landmine design and proliferation centers around question of political purpos how for what and by whom are ap landmines to be used three distinct present and potentially future functions for ap landmines are discernible from witness testimony delive red during congressional hearings existing legislation and the various negotiating positions assumed by the signatories toprotocol ii of the ccw during series of review conferences the first role is as traditional weapon of warfare employed to canalize the advancing forces of an enemy either armor dismounted or mechan ized infantry into avenues of approach that are covered by direct and indirect fire weapons this traditional or tactical role of the ap landmine has been expanded through advances in technology such as thefamily of scatterable mines fascam mo reover landmines used in the first role serve as means to channel enemy forces into terrain designated as preplannedtarget where the preponderance of fire power and advanced weapons can be brought to bear or as weapon to erode the advancing forces of an enemy the second roleis as weapon of warfare di rected less toward specific tactical objectives and more toward broad political objectives such as denying civilian populations access toarable land homes and commerce for ma ny forces that employ ap landmines in the second role as weapon against civilian populations ap mines are primarysource of their firepower landmines emplaced for these two purposes when left in place after the termination of hostilities and unmarked create tertiary consequential roleindefinite hazard to civilians the current debate concerning landmine proliferation represents an effort to reconcile the traditional role of th landmine with the objective of limiting or ending the second role and abolishing the third in the following section this report will briefly review the role of landmines in

minewarfare revitalizing production and trai ning programs that had suffered from neglect allied and axis armies whose strengths were insufficient in northafrica used mines to comp ensate for shortages of artillery armor and infantry neither side believed though that the va lue of mines extended beyond temporary tactical advantage to strategic import 8 perhaps the mine did not extend beyond st rategic import although general mcnair touring north africa following the allied victory of 1943 concluded that the land mine was almost new arm of warfare9 several important developments in the tactics and technology of mine warfare grew from the second world war first both the germans and the americansexperimented with nonmetallic mines the us requirement for such minelessened as the war proceeded and the allied strategy turn ed to the offensive an army ground forces project which sought to develop nonmetallic ap mine was canceled in the summer of 1944 10 second the at mine came

enemy maneuver 11 throughout the cold war the us military continued to use landmines for the purposes described above during the korean war both the united nations command and the north koreans employed landmines to stifle enemy movementand protect friendly forces two combat ope rations that were indicative of american encounters with enemy landmines were the fight for yond ungpo by us marines subsequent to the amphibious landing at inchon and the us army battle for bloody ridge 12 two relevant aspects of mine warfar that inform the current debate were present during the korean war

clear requirements of powerprojection must be balanced speed of deployment which mitigates against heavyforces and lethality of the force which demands heavier weapons which are lessmobile 19 to

brought into question following the initial deployment of the 82nd airborne division and the 7th marine expeditionary brigade to saudi arab ia in 1990 in the initial stages of desert shield 21 one proposal to increase the 82nd airborne divisions antiarmor capability was the armored gun system ags the ags was designed to replace the antiarmor capability of the m551 sherid an light tank that

field manual that prescribes the emplacement of scatterable mine field emphasizes that thecharacteristics of fascam require im peccable communication and coordination to ensure friendly units know

means of commerce directly conflicts with the laws of war despite whether one views the vietnam war as an example of national liberation movement communist insurgency civil war or combination of these theconduct of the war provided examples of mines used in this second role 27 several features of the vietnam war are important in the evolution of mine warfare first the mobility provided to us forces by the helicopter greatly nullifiedthe concepts of the front this helped to somewhat diminish the importance of landmines in the tactical sense second as the viet cong and north vietnamesesought to avoid major conventional confront ation and preferred to rely on surprise attack nearly all territory was thus battlefield third due to the nature of an insurgency distinctions between combatan ts and noncombatants were eroded as robert leckie described the problem 12 year old girl leaning bicycle up against wall might be planting vehicle of death whose tubular frame was packed with explosive on

guerrilla and insurgent somewhat interchangeably this is not to add any political gravity to these terms and merely to make distinctions between c onventional conflict and irregular warfareinextricable link between the fighter and the population but the fighters categorical refusal to be linked to single identity29 during 1961 in reaction to the growing attention given to unconventional guerilla or counterinsurgent warfare j ohn shy and peter paret published small book guerrillas in the 1960s the authors observations have only grown more salient in light of the american experience in vietnam the soviet experience inafghanistan the insurgency of the khmer rouge in cambodia and several otherconflicts in which the landmine has been us ed indiscriminately against the civilian population the authors observed that forces engage in guerilla war in pursuit of political objective not as preferred lternative to open battle but as matter of necessity in describing the historical accounts of the civil wa r confederate leader john mosby and irregular warfare as he prac ticed it in northern virginia paret and shy are critical of historians for failing to consider the consequences of guerilla warfare one doubts mosbys skill in making union operations in this area very difficult but in 1864 sheridan devastated the shenandoah valley and systematicallyand successfully destroyed the guerrillas base sheridans counter strategy wasruthless and effective and it demonstrates some of the special costs of resorting to guerilla warfare 30 in irregular conflict conventional forces are hard pressed to separate the civilian from the soldier insurgents on th other hand find security in anonymity coercion and control of the population is goal of both sides moreover asguerrillas or insurgents turn to irregular wa rfare out of necessity they are also likely to disdain much of the law that guides conventional conflict one critical element of the second role of mine warfare has emerged during and since the vietnam war landmines have been used indiscriminately against civiliansthe indiscriminate use of landmines reflects the fact that in irregular warfare the distinction between combatants and noncombatants is blurred and at times nonexistent or to borrow andreopoulos phrase guerilla tactics render one of themost fundamental principles of the laws of war untenable namely the distinctionbetween combatants and noncombatants 31 during the vietnam war the viet cong and the north vietnamese were able to pursue the twin objectives of intimidating the local population and killingamericans through placing landmines on ro ads and trails the vcpavn reliancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96362crs10 32hidden killers p 67

soviet union also employed mines in this second role during the invasion of afghanistan one account of the soviet occupation describes how soviethelicopters and planes strewed the provin ces bordering pakistan with thousands of butterfly mines colored green for vegeta ted areas beige for deserts to terrorize the local population antipersonnel mines were placed along fields and mountain passes 33 the us committee for refugees in 1995 report estimated that total of 10 to 15 million landmines were planted in ngola belts of landmines were emplaced to ring cities deny civilians access to roads and despoil agricultural lands the uscommittee for refugees report states that among the victims of landmines have been women and children who were killed or crippled while searching for food orfirewood the widespread use of land mines as weapons used to deny irregular forces access to territory serves the second role of denying this same land tocivilians the central point that irregular warfare is undertaken out of necessity rather than choice is essential for understanding the second role of mine warfare minesare political and military weapon of choice because they are plentiful inexpensive and effective as such they are lik ely to be employed irrespective of any restrictions that exist within the law of war two important approaches now exist for preventing mines produced for the first role in warfare from being used for the second role the technological approachwherein mines designed for tactical purposes would selfdestruct or eventually self inactivate and the legal approach wh erein the production export and use of ap mines would be curtailed by treaty both of these approaches will be discussedbelow following brief review of the third role of landmines mines left in place attermination of hostilities that then become an indefinite hazard to civilians the consequential role landmines as indefinite hazards when employed for tactical purposes and left in place unmarked minefields can pose an indefinite risk to civilians living working or traveling in once contestedlands of even greater risk to civilians are mines emplaced to separate peoples or irregular forces from roads wells or arab land this third consequential role of landmines as an indefinite threat to civilians complicates the processes whichfollow the termination of hostilities resettlement of refugees

1970 cambodia stood as net exporter of food the provinces ofbattambang and svey rieng were the most productive areas after years of warfare cambodia is now an importer of food and battambang and svey rieng are largelyunusable due to landmines moreover infras tructure development such as the repair of bridges and roads is impossible until surrounding areas are cleared of mines 34 second problem created by landmines is the slowed pace of refugee resettlement as one example hidden killers considers mozambique to be country where fear of landmines has been cited as significant cause of the slow pace of repatriation of refugees35 the state department report also estimates that within angola mozambique somalia afghanistan and cambodia remainapproximately 30 million mines which inhibit and endanger the return andreintegration of some 6 million refug ees and 55 million internally displaced persons 36 further complicating the problems ssociated with repatriating refugees are the high medical costs of treating landmine victims37 the medical economic and social effects of mines left in place after the cessation of hostilities are both astounding and well documented the internationalcommittee of the red cross human rights watch the international rescuecommittee and the united nations development program have all published reportsconcerning the human costs associated with the third role of landmines moreover congress has held hearings on both the gl obal landmine crisis and developments in countermine technology 38 unsurprisingly institution or nation advocates the third role of landmines as it exists only as derivative of the first and second roles this fact of coursedoes nothing to diminish the manifold problems resulting from the third role oflandmines

manual 2032 minecountermine operations minefields are used to produce specific effect on enemy maneuver ther eby creating vulnerability that can be exploited by friendly forces second cause the enemy to piecemeal his forcesthird interfere with enemy command and c ontrol fourthinflict damage to enemy personnel and equipment and fifth protect friendly forces from enemy maneuverus military requirements for minefields comply with the geneva convention theccw and nato international standardizati on agreements minefields are to be marked with signs 10 to 50 meters apar t depending on the terrain and documented in accordance with standardized format 40 the advent of scatterable mine technology added to the capability of us commanders to expeditiously deploy minefield before advancing enemy forces such capability does not allow however for the precise accounting of the locationof each mine deployed the locations of scatterable minefields once emplaced arerecorded and disseminated to friendly units all us scatterable mines are designedto selfdestruct or selfdeactivate ie battery within the mine exhausts itself rendering the mine inert the location of remotely delivered fascam minefields are calculated and marked by either estimating the area around aimpoints or byplotting the respective corner points of minefield thus us military doctrine attempts to fulfill the first role of mine warfare through both doctrine and technology us military doctrine does not provide for or allow the indiscriminate use of landm ines against noncombatants last us military doctrine attempts to end the third role of mine warfare by using mines with short and finite lifespans httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96362crs13 41ltc john j spinelli us army commented to the author that when both the self destructing and selfdeactivating battery expires features of us scatterable mines areconsidered the reliability rate exceeds 999 that scatterable mine will cease to be hazard to civilian population

protests pending congressional action on landmine moratorium inside the army june 13 1994 p 89criticism of military doctrine within the current debate concerning the role of landmines several critics have argued that the tactical use of landmines by the us military undermines the larger foreign policy goal of abolishing the third role of landmines second criticismleveled against military doctrine is that landmines do not provide any appreciable value to battlefield commanders are ap landmines effectiv in tactical role critics of the tactical role of landmines frequently observe that landmines produce friendly and enemycasualties alike second critics argue that once deployed fascam minefields are difficult to mark and therefore contribute to fratricide and the indiscriminate killing of civilians third critics have also contended that until the design of scatterablemines achieve complete reliability in the cap acity to selfdestruct or selfdeactivate they should not be used 41 mine warfare is an integral part of us military doctrine and has become more important as army force structure becomes smaller in recent battle lab simulations and exercises at the national training center the army found that friendlycasualties were lower and enemy casualties were higher by factor of two whenadvanced landmines were used rather than not used 42 second ap mines were developed to prevent enemy forces from breaching or tampering with antitankminefields this presents stark difference with mines emplaced around villageto deny the local populace food and wate r ground combat is intrinsically dangerous disorderly and confusing us military doctrine places strict guidelines on the employment of mines by us forces these restrictions were designed tominimize the loss of american life and the occurrence of fratricide when used in accordance with planning gui delines which seek to avoid civilian casualties scatterable mines whether dropped by aircraft or emplaced from anartillery projectile pose comparatively little risk to civilians arguably much less than from concentrated gunfire the common alternative to mines to impose rate of reliability of 100 percent on these weapons as some critics have suggestedsuggests that foreign policy goal of abo lishing landmines supersedes any tactical value ap mines may hold for us forces this reasoning further assumes that

addressing the roles of landmines international treaties the international community has and is addressing the problem of ap landmines in several ways for some time efforts to restrict landmine use in order to protect innocent civilians were em bodied in the convention on conventional weapons ccw treaty this treaty was however ignored by many combatants andjudged inadequate by most observers in light of continuing and appalling innocent casualties in many regions of the world recently efforts to improve that treaty havebeen overshadowed by initiatives to achieve universal ban on ap landmines the canadian government sponsored the ottawa treaty presented for signing byinterested parties in december 1997 and the united nations is sponsoring landmine ban negotiations under the conference on disarmament framework in geneva convention on conventional weapons an early effort of the international co mmunity to reconcile the divergent roles of landmines is represented by the convention on

prohibitions or restrictions on the use of mines boobytraps and other devices protocol ii this convention was concluded at geneva on october 10 1980 was signed by the united states on april 8 1982

ottawa fasttrack effort by participating in its negotiation the administrationcould not achieve accommodation to its cerns and decided not to sign the treaty president clintons explanation was there is line that i simply cannot cross and that line is the safety and security of our men and women in uniform 55 general impediment to treaty effectiveness would be the many nations not participating to include major users of land mines such as china india and russia other nations that perceive serious secu rity concerns and consequent utility for landmines include cuba egypt finland iran israel kuwait north koreavietnam and south korea specific us concerns were that the treaty would not allow special case for use of apl ong the border with north korea until suitable substitute could be devised and that smart apl could not continue to bemixed into smart antitank minefields to protect those temporary barriers fromdismounted enemy for those reasons the pr esidents obligations to

longstanding international attempt to reconcile the divergent roles of landmines notably the ccw greatly resembles us militarydoctrine in that mines used responsibly can serve limited tactical role on thebattlefield without unduly endangering ci vilians second the ccw attempts to restrict the use of scatterable or remotely delivered mines some deficiencies in theccw as noted by the senate foreign rela tions committee report and the clinton administration were addressed by amendmen t the ccw must deal with civil war if it is to include the sec ond role of landmines and the treaty requires some form of verification mechanism strong verification measures which would include uninspections were opposed by china pakistan cuba and india 59 the ccw continues to be criticized by nongovernment organizations such as the international committee of the red cross that believe the only measure that will abolish the third role of landmines is total ban on landmine production and use60 this position rests upon the assumption that th first and third roles of landmines are indivisible according to this view the humanitarian interest of ending the third role of landmines enjoys precedent over any tactical advantage the us military may gainfrom landmines moreover this positi on depends upon the notion that complete and total ban will somehow end the second role of mine warfare which in itself was inherently unlawful from inception as robert w tucker observed any weapon may be put to unlawful use for example it would be unlawful to use an otherwise legal weapon against the civilian population of an enemy state or as means of inflicting unnecessary suffering or destruction 61 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96362crs20 61continued warfare chapel hill university of north carolina press 1975

effects of landmine proliferation in response to the global landmine crisis congress has debated and passed varied legislative proposals each of which addresses the problem of landmineproliferation number of these proposals such as bills that appropriate money for demining training attempt to alleviate single role of landmines in warfare in the case of demining operations the intent is to

completed destruc tion of over 33 million nonselfdestructing apl that represented the entire us stoc kpile of dumb ap landmines except for about one million maintained for use in th korean peninsula and small numbers at various training locations for demining training purposes74 the remaining obstacle to us landminebanning policy centers around smart apl these selfdestructingor selfdeactivating devices were designed to negate the indefinite hazard threat of landmines but they were also banned by th ottawa treaty initial efforts to devise effective substitutes were disappointing faced with daunting deadlines thepentagon rejuvenated its search for apl alternatives in late 1997 but funding anddefinitive technological directions were not clear 75 finding suitable apl alternatives for us

antipersonnel mines mines can be very simple devices easily manufactured from universally available materials the primary component is an explosive charge that damages the victim by blast or from dispersal of the casing fragments another necessarycomponent is detonator fuse which can be mechanical chemical or electrical finally sensing device is needed to initiate the chain of detonation in simplemines the sensing can be achieved by direct pressure of footstep the pull of atripwire or release of pressure when the mine is picked up or uncovered the simple blast mine is difficult to detect because it can be very small and encased in plastic larger somewhat more mechanical minethe bounding fragmentation mineis more lethal an additional component pr ojects the main charge one or two meters into the air where it explodes and propels fragments throughout radius of ten tothirty meters this technology is over thirty years old but still effective it will deny an area and create casualties until trained and equipped personnel clear ordemine the mined area advanced technologies because current technology for antipersonnel mines is very costeffective there exists little incentive for advancing ap mines per most recent research and development has been in conjunction with creating more effective antitank systems many of these systems continue to include ap mines most of the new systems beingdevised are incorporated into modern mechanized forces and include automatic selfdestruction the most advanced component s are often the sensing methods these include seismic sonic and infrared sens ors in conjunction with computer software recognition of target signatures most of this technology is not costeffective against personnel and is not likely to exacerbate current problems with control of apmines 81 to alleviate incidents of fratricide the us military employs selfdestructing mines some antipersonnel mines employed by the us military are not

that ban on th military use of ap mines will serve to reduce landmine proliferation 100 proponents of total ban also reason that such measure will reduce the indiscriminate use of ap mines against civilians during and after war during war the laws for the conduct of armed conflict jus in bello are occasionally subsumed by the right to go to war jus ad bellum 101 thus it is unlikely that legislation enacted by the congress to ban the use of landmines by the usmilitary will result in the disappearance anytime soon of these small cheap weapons from all battlefields nevertheless the us
