oversight of the administrative bureaucracy or when members of congress intervene in agency proceedings on behalf of private constituents or other private entities with interests affecting the memb erss constituency such interventions involve varying degrees of intrusion into agency decisionmaking processes this report will briefly examine the currently applicable legal and ethical considerations and standards that mark the limits of such intercessions the report initially reviews the judicial development and application of standards for determining whether congressional pressure or influence will be deemed to have tainted an agency proceeding it concludes that the courts in balancing congresss performance of its constitutional and statutory obligations to oversee the actions of agency officials against the rights of parties before agencies have shown decided predilection for protecting the congressional prerogatives thus where informal rulemaking or other forms of informal decisionmaking are involved the courts will look to the nature and impact of the political pressure on the agency decisionmaker and will intervene only where that pressure has had the actual effect of forcing the consideration of factors congress did not intend to make relevant where agency adjudication is involved stricter standard is applied and the finding of an appearance of impropriety can be sufficient to taint the proceeding but even here the courts have required that the pressure or influence be directed at the ultimate decisionmaker with respect to the merits of the proceeding and that it does not involve legitimate oversight and investigative functions before they will intervene the report next examines the conduct of members of congress and their staffs intervening in administrative matters from the perspective of ethics and conflict of interest rules statutes and guidelines bearing upon members and staffers official duties it notes that since congressional intervention and expressions of interest in administrative matters from members office are recognized as legitimate official representational and oversight functions and duties of members of congress the primary focus of the ethical and statutory conduct restraints is limited to1 any improper enrichment or financial benefit accruing to the member in return for or because of his or her official actions and influences including the receipt of gifts or payments or existing financial interests in or relating to the matter under consideration and 2 any overt coercion or threats of reprisals or promises of favoritism or reward to administrators from the members office which could indicate an arguable abuse of members official representational or oversight role additionally ethical guidelines in congre ss incorporate an appearance standard for members which would counsel member to adopt office procedures and systems which would prevent an appearance of linkage between inte rventions and the receipt of things of value particularly legitimate campaign contributions and which would assure that decisions to intervene are based on the merits of particular matter

inevitable tension between congress and the executive created by our constitutionally mandated system of separated but shared powers has been the source of continual interbranch conflict one manifestation of this struggle occurs when congressional committees engage in oversight of the administrative bureaucracy another when members of congress attempt to intervene in administrative proceedings on behalf of private constituents or other private entities with interests affecting the members constituency both such interventions involve varying degrees of intrusion into agency decisionmaking processes on relatively rare occasions these interventions have resulted in court actions challenging the congressional intercession as exertions of undue political influence on agency decisionmakers which violate the due process rights of participants in the proceedings in question and impugn the integrity of the agency decisional processes or in disciplinary procee dings before ethics committees of either house alleging that such member actions violated institutional rules or other ethical standards such challenges have arisen in the context of congressional intercessions into rulemakings ratemakings informal decisionmaking adjudications and agency investigations that arguably would lead to an adjudicatory proceeding past high profile incidents raising questions regarding the legal and ethical propriety of congressional exertions of influence on administrative decisionmaking have surprisingly produced only paucity of authoritative comment ary on and analysis of the guiding principles and standards applicable to the constitutional bases of the roles members play when they act as part of the committee oversight process or in their individual representative capacities 1 this report is designed to provide contemporary overview of applicable guidelines and considerations in the judicial and congressional forums toward that end part ii reviews the judicial development and applica tion of standards for determining whether congressional pressure or influence will be deemed to have tainted an agency proceeding it concludes that the courts in balancing congresss performance of its constitutional and statutory obligations to oversee the actions of agency officials against the rights of parties before agencies have shown decided predilection for protecting the congressional prerogatives thus where informal rulemaking or other forms of informal decisionmaking are involved the courts will look to the nature and impact of the political pressure on the agency decisionmaker and will intervene only where that pressure has had the actual effect of forcing the consideration of factors congress did not intend to make relevant where agency

the ultimate decisionmaker with respect to the merits of the proceeding and that it does not involve legitimate oversight and investigative functions before they will intervene part iii of the report examines the conduct of members of congress and their staffs intervening in administrative matters from the perspective of ethics and conflict of interest rules statutes and guidelines bearing upon members and staffers official duties in this area it notes that since congressional intervention and expressions of interest in administrative matters from members office are recognized as legitimate official representational and oversight functions and duties of members of congress the primary focus of these ethical and statutory conduct restraints is limited to1 any improper enrichment or financial be nefit accruing to the member in return for or because of his or her official actions and influences including the receipt of gifts or payments or existing financial interests in or relating to the matter under consideration and 2 any overt coercion or threats of reprisals or promises of favoritism or reward to administrators from the members office which could indicate an arguable abuse of members official representational or oversight role additionally there are ethical guidelines in congress incorporating broad appearance standards for members which could raise ethical concerns in relation to the acceptance of gifts favors donations and benefits including campaign contributions by members from those who are directly affected by the members official duties even in the absence of showing of any corrupt bargain express payment or any direct connection to an official act while campaign contributions from private individuals to members have facial legitimacy and necessity in our government and electoral system which other forms of monetary transfers to legislators such as gifts do not and may be treated differently both houses of congress advise members and staff to avoid any appearance of linkage between campaign contributions and interventions such guidance would counsel member to adopt office procedures and systems for evaluating requests for assistance which would prevent any appearance that interventions decisions are based upon the receipt of things of value particularly legitimate campaign contributions and which would assure that decisions to intervene are rather based on the merits of particular matter

for claims that an exercise of congressional influence in an agency proceeding may serve as basis for challenge to the end product of that decisional process rest on two foundation cases 1966 decision of the fifth circuit court of appeals in pillsbury co v ftc 2 and 1971 ruling of the district of columbia circuit court of appeals in dc federation of civic associations v volpe 3 and relative handful of judicial rulings since then which have grappled with the question of whether particular instances of exertion of congressional pressure would serve to taint such proceeding while this case law makes it clear that there are limits to congressional intercession whether those limits have been breached in particular instance is often far less clear analysis has been made difficult by the relative dearth of decisions and the reluctance of courts in those 2 354 f2d 952 5th cir 1966 3 459 f2d 1231 dc cir 1971 cert denied 405 us 1030 1972

of congressional spokesperson in most of the cases to present the legislative interest may also be complicating factor close analysis of the apparently disparate and sometimes seemingly conflicting judicial decisions however reveals consistent underlying pattern that allows for rationalization of the holdings and for the formulation of guidelines for applic ation in future situations the determinative factors for the courts appear to be the nature of the proceeding involved the impact the political pressure had on the decisionmaker and whether the object of the political intercession is to reflect the views of members on issues of law and policy this part of the report will examine the extant case law to explicate the manner in which the cour ts are formulating the differing standards that are applied to the various types of administrative proceedings and the underlying rationale for their actions

jurisprudence that does not as yet yield ready answers when applied to particular complex and often politically charged fact situations the relatively small body of case law that has developed however reflects the growing sensitivity of the courts to appearing to be engaging in unwarranted intrusions into the political process problems in this area are not subject to easy categorization or generalizations case by case evaluations have been the norm however the case law does provide broad guidelines within which analysis may proceed where agency actions resembles judicial action where it involves formal or informal adjudication or formal rulemaking insulation of the decisionmaker from political influence through public pressure or unrevealed ex parte contacts has been deemed justified by basic notions of due process to the parties involved4 but where agency action involves informal rulemaking of generally applicable policy thus closely resembling the legislative process there is deemed to be far less justification for judicial intervention to protect the integrity of the process5 in practice however these categorizations serve only as useful starting points for analysis the courts have eschewed mechanical application of these categories that is an agency proceeding that has adjudicatory elements will not be pigeonholed automatically as case requiring the highest level of judicial scrutiny6 similarly an informal rulemaking may not be reflexively dealt with as matter of pure policymaking and accorded extreme deference7 rather the courts appear to be making their determinations in this area by ascertaining where on the adjudicationpolicymaking continuum the proceeding falls and then applying the factors most appropriate to that particular situation 8 the task of analysis in such cases is thus threefold 1 4 eg pillsbury co v ftc 354 f2d 952 5th cir 1966 5 sierra club v costle 657 f2d 298 40001 dc cir 1981 6 see eg gulf oil corp v fpc 563 f2d 588 3d cir 1977

application of the factors relevant to that type of proceeding and if tain t is involved 3 determining the remedies that may be available the following discussion will treat each of these issues in turn it seems useful however to start with an overview and description of the distinguishing elements of the various proceedings in the continuum as it moves from adjudication toward varieties of informal non record decisionmaking administrative action pursuant to the administrative procedure act apa9 is either adjudication or rulemaking the two processes differ fundamentally in purpose and focus and as consequence have imposed on them sharply divergent statutory and constitutional procedural requirements10 thus the apa defines adjudication as the agency process for the formulation of an order11 the term order is then defined as the whole or part of final disposition whether affirmative negative injunctive or declaratory in form of an agency in matter other than rulemaking but including licensing12 rulemaking is the agency process for formulating amending or repealing rule13 finally rule is defined to mean the whole or part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement interpret or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization procedure or practice requirements of an agency and includes the approval or prescription for the future of rates wages corporate or financial structures or reorganizations thereof prices facilities appliances services or allowances therefor or of valuations costs or accounting or practices bearing on any of the foregoing 14 the definitive explanation of the interrelationship of these definitions and the dichotomous scheme of the apa was provided the attorney general in 194715 the object of the rule making proceeding is the implementation or prescription of law or policy for the future rather than the evaluation of respondents past conduct typically the

flavor and may result in disciplinary action16 in sum then rulemaking involves the formulation of policy or interpretation which the agency will apply in the future to all persons engaged in the regulated activity adjudication is the administrative equivalent of judicial trial it applies policy to set of past actions and results in an order against or in favor of the named party the focus of rulemaking is prospective the primary focus of adjudication is retrospective administrative rulemaking and adjudication may be conducted pursuant to either informal or formal procedures informal rulemaking requires the administrative agency following publication of proposed rule in the federal register to provide interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking through submission of written data views or arguments 17 courts reviewing such proceedings are required to uphold informal rulemaking decisions unless those decisions are arbitrary capricious an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law18 formal rulemaking is invoked when rules are required by statute to be made on the record after opportunity for agency hearing19 under the apa formal rulemaking must include trialtype hearing at which party is entitled to present his case or defense or oral or documentary evidence to submit rebuttal evidence and to conduct such crossexamination as may be required for full and true disclosure of the facts20 judicial review of formal rulemaking requires court to set aside rule that is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record21 formal adjudication is governed by section 554 of the apa and arises in every case of adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing22 section 554 incorporates the procedural requirements of section 556 and 557 and affords parties to formal adjudication the right to present evidence and to conduct cross examination23 judicial review of formal adjudication like that of formal rulemaking is governed by the substantial evidence standard informal adjudication occurs when an agency determines the rights or liabilities of party in proceeding to which section 554 does not apply24 the apa makes provision for informal adjudicationsadjudications unaccompanied by the protections of an on the record formal judiciallike trial but since these informal adjudications involve individual rights rather than issues of general policy the courts have recognized they implicate constitutional due process 16 see also us v florida east

scale judicial trial informal adjudications must nevertheless conform with the notion of fair hearing and with the principles of fairness implicit in due process26 in such proceedings the agencys final decision is reviewed under the apas arbitrary and capricious standard which requires court to conduct searching and careful inquiry based upon the full administrative record that was before the agency decisionmaker at the time he made his decision27 it is important to note that informal decisionmaking that is governmental actions that are taken without an evidentiary hearing and formal record constitute by far the vast bulk of government decisionmaking as one commentator has noted however defined informal action is the mode in which government operates common and loose figure is that ninety percent of the governments business is accomplished by informal action the figure is much too low in terms of quantity surely much less than one percent of the actions of the federal government are based upon evidentiary hearings and if one were possessed of divine calibrator that could measure importance it is doubtful that weighing the transactions by their importance would reduce the predominance of informal action in the operations of government 28 as consequence this category of decisionmaking has been accorded special attention by the courts final important category of agency action that has been the subject of undue influence litigation is investigation most administrative action including much of that which occurs in an informal as well as in formal proceeding is conditioned by information obtained through an agencys prior investigation administrative agencies do not have unrestricted power to demand information merely for satisfying their curiosity the agencys command can be enforced only if it is authorized by law and issued in lawful manner additionally constitutional limitations hedge administrative power to investigate within these constraints the courts have acknowledged the importance of judicial deference to administrative agencies in conducting investigations 29 agency decisions to conduct investigations are deemed committed entirely to agency discretion30 and are unreviewable except where they are made in bad faith and the enforcement of the administrative process would be an abuse of the judicial process31 25 vermont yankee nuclear

adjudicatory or quasiadjudicatory proceedings is the 1966 decision of the court of appeals for the fifth circuit in pillsbury company v federal trade commission32 which held federal trade commission ftc divestiture order invalid because the commissions decisional process had been tainted by impermissible congressional influence at issue was an intense interrogation at senate subcommittee hearing of the ftc chairman and several members of his staff on key issue in an antitrust adjudication involving the pillsbury company which was then pending before the commission the senators expr essed opinions on the issue and criticized the ftc for its interpretation of section 7 of the clayton act in previous interlocutory order in pillsburys favor 33 the clear message of the senate committee criticism was that the ftc should have ruled against pillsbury34 in its subsequent final decision the commission ruled as the committee had suggested the appeals court found the senate inquiry to be an improper intrusion into the adjudicatory process of the commission the court based its holding on the fact that the agency was acting in judicial capacity as consequence the private litigants had right to fair trial and the appearance of impartiality as part of the general guarantees of procedural due process when the agency is acting in judicial or quasijudicial capacity the court emphasized the judicial nature of the function the agency was performing and explained that in order to protect the integrity of that type of process it was proscribing the subcommittees action because it cast doubt upon the appearance of impartiality of the decisionmakers and not because of any finding that the commission had actually been influenced however when congressional investigation focuses directly and substantially upon the mental decisional processes of commission in case which is pending before it congress is longer intervening in the agencys legislative function but rather in its judicial function at this latter point we become concerned with the right of private litigants to fair trial and equally important with their right to the appearance of impartiality which cannot be maintained unless those who exercise the judicial function are free from powerful external influences continued corp 648 f2d 118 3d cir 1981 banc united states v rfb petroleum inc 793 f2d 528 53233 em

congress to the federal trade commission it may be argued that such officials as members of the federal trade commission are sufficiently aware of the realities of governmental not to say political life as to be able to withstand such questioning as we have outlined here however this court is not so sophisticated that it can shrug off such procedural due process claim merely because the officials involved should be able to discount what is said and to disregard the force of the intrusion into the adjudicatory process we conclude that we can preserve the rights of the litigants in case such as this without having any adverse effect upon the legitimate exercise of the investigative power of congress what we do is to preserve the integrity of the judicial aspect of the

claim of undue congressional influence but not within the context of judicial or quasijudicial proceeding the principles enunciated by the court as necessary to establish claim of taint in such situation mark out the boundaries of permissible congressional action which have influenced courts since then dc federation involved the approval by the secretary of transportation of construction of the three sisters bridge across the potomac river two issues were presented first whether the secretary failed to comply within statutory requ irements prior to approval of construction and second whether the secretarys determinations were tainted by extraneous pressures with regard to the first issue majority of the court found that in number of critical respects the secretary had failed to comply with applicable statutory standards which therefore required remand for further agency determinations although this finding would have been sufficient to dispose of the case judge bazelon chose to deal with the taint issue that involved the alle gation that threats by the chairman of the house appropriation subcommittee which had jurisdiction over the funding of district of columbias transportation construction projects to deny funds for the districts proposed subway system unless the bridge project was approved and whether those threats had legal impact on the secretarys subsequent approval decision judge bazelon stated that he was convinced that the impact of this is sufficient standing alone to invalidate the secretarys action even if the secretary had taken every formal step required by every applicable statutory provision reversal would be required in my opinion because extraneous pressure intruded into the calculus of considerations on which the secretarys decision was based 37 judge bazelon pointed out that he was alone in this opinion judge fahy on the other hand has concluded that since critical determinations cannot stand irrespective of the

ground38 but it is to be noted that the disagreement between judges bazelon and fahy was not as to the applicable principle of law but rather as to whether the district court below had found there had been any consideration by the secretary of extraneous influence while judge fahy is not entirely convinced that the district court ultimately found as fact that the extraneous pressure had influenced the secretarya point which is for clearhe has authorized to note his concurrence in my discussion of the controlling principle of law namely that the decision would be invalid if based in whole or in part on the pressures emanating from representative natcher judge fahy agrees and we therefore hold that on remand the secretary must make new determinations based strictly on the merits and completely without regard to any considerations not made relevant in the applicable statute 39 judge bazelons opinion makes it clear that the courts standardthat extraneous congressional influences actually shown to have had an impact on an agency decision will taint such administrative action40is crafted for the special administrative circumstances of the situation before it where the decisional process was neither judicial or legislative in nature the district court was surely correct in co ncluding that the secretarys action was not judicial or quasijudicial and for that reason we agree that much of the doctrine cited by plaintiffs is inapposite if he had been acting in such capacity plaintiffs could have forcefully argued that the decision was inva lid because of the decisionmakers bias or because he had received ex parte communications wellestablished principles could have been invoked to support these arguments and plaintiffs might have prevailed even without showing that the pressure had actually influen ced the secretarys decision with regard to judicial decisionmaking whether by court or agency the appearance of bias or pressure may be less objectionable than the reality but since the secretarys action was not judicial that rationale has application here if on the other hand the secretarys action had been purely legislative we might have agreed with the district court that his decision could stand in spite of finding that he had considered extraneous pressures beginning with fletcher v peck the supreme court has maintained that statute cannot be invalidated merely because the legislatures action was motivated by impermissible considerations ex cept perhaps in special circumstances not applicable here indeed that very principle requ ires us to reject plaintiffs argument that the approval of the bridge by the district of columbia city council was in some sense invalid we do not sit in judgment of the motives of the districts legislative body nor do we have authority to review its decisions the city councils action constituted in our view the approval of the project required by the statute thus the underlying problem cannot be illuminated by simplistic effort to force the secretarys action into purely judicial or purely legislative mold his decision was not judicial in that he was not required to base it solely on formal record established at public hearing at the same time it was not purely legislative since congress had already established the boundaries within which his discretion could operate but even though his action fell between these two conceptual extremes it is still governed by principles that we 38 id at 1246 39 id 40 judge bazelon emphasized that he believed that under the circumstances of the case the congressional threats involved were taken into account by the secretary in my view the district court clearly and unambiguously found as fact that the pressure exerted by representative natcher and others did have an impact on secretary volpes decision to approve the bridge 459 f2d at 1246

reaching his decision secretary volpe took into account considerations that congress could not have intended to make relevant his action proceeded from an erroneous premise and his decision cannot stand the error would be more flagrant of course if the secretary had based his decision solely on the pressures generated by representative natcher but it should be clear that his action would not be immunized merely because he also considered some relevant factors 41 thus the court appeared to view undue influence cases as classifiable on continuum with the applicable standard dependant on where on the continuum the nature of the case places it if proceeding is one in which judicial or quasij udicial functions are being exercised then the highest standard of conduct is required and only showing of interference with merely the appearance of impartiality without proof of actual partiality or other effect of the extraneous influences is necessary42 if the decisionmaking is purely legislative policymaking in nature such as takes place in informal rulemaking then the courts will be most deferential even in the face of heavy extraneous pressures to the political nature of the process finally where decisional process involves application of ascertainable legislative standards by an agency official in situation that cannot be categorized as either judicial or legislative ie informal decisionmaking then claim of impermissible interference will be sustained only on showing of actual effect the courts appear to have been guided by this suggested mode of analysis

by the decisions 44 pierce agrees that the pillsbury court reached defensible result in light of the circumstances presented the contested issues of fact were at least arguably adjudicatory in nature rather than legislative and the intense interrogation could be viewed as pressure to resolve the facts against pillsbury thereby creating the appearance of impropriety thus even though it is impossible to determine whether the ftcs resolution of those facts was in fact influenced by the hostile questions pierce argues that one could infer that the ftc purposely resolved adjudicative facts against pillsbury in response to the committees attacks pierces concern however is that the 5 th circuit did not decide the case on this narrow ground but announced the far broader principle that when congressional investigation focuses directly and substantially upon the mental decisional processes of commission in case before it congress is intervening impermissibly in the agencys adjudicatory function 45 application of such broadly stated prohibition in future cases pierce asserts could result in findings attributable to congressional pressure without regard to the actual context of the congressional proceeding and would constitute an unjustified judicial interference with the political process of policymaking whether to apply the rule of reason or per rule to acquisitions under the

process values only when an agency has singled out an individual for adverse treatment 46 while finding pillsbury s holding defensible professor pierce deems dc federation indefensible standing for the principle that two politically accountable branches cannot compromise their frequently differing policy preferences47 in pierces view the case was about political dispute over the allocation of transportation funds between the administering agency and the key congressional appropriating subcommittee the secretary preferred seeing subway built the subcommittee and congress wanted bridge built after heated public dispute political compromise was effected whereby both projects would go forward but the appeals court intervened finding that the secretarys decisions which were part of the political deal were infected with impermissible bias as result of legislative branch pressure in the words of the court the impact of this pressure is sufficient standing alone to invalidate the secretarys action 48 in professor pierces view dc federation is hard to explain in democracy in which two politically accountable branches of government share the power to make policy the agency was not adjudicating dispute involving individual rights nor was it resolving contested issues of adjudicative fact perhaps the case stands for the principle that the two politically accountable branches cannot compromise their frequently differing policy pref erences but if so it is singularly arrogant decision the constitution created system of shared and coordinated policymaking by the two politically accountable branches the framers included many features to force compromise between the two branches the presidents role in the legislative process the senates role in approving policymaking officials for the executive branch the senates role in ratifying treaties and the exclusive power of the house to initiate tax and appropriations bills our nation would be ungovernable in the absence of constant policy compromises between the executive and legislative branches 49 as will be seen in the following review of the undue influence case law since the decisions in pillsbury

in koniag v kleppe50 in which district court set aside adjudicatory decisions of the secretary of the interior with respect to the eligibility of several communities to receive land and money under the alaska native claims settlement act ansca at least in part because it found improper congressional pressure exerted on the department and the secretary there congressional subcommittee held oversight hearings on the administration of the act while the proceedings in question were pending the district court however found that the hearings went substantially beyond the oversight function the hearings took place during the time that the validity of certain claims being advanced by the plaintiffs was being litigated before the secretary and following upon earlier correspondence which the congressman had addressed to various subordinates of the secretary the stated purpose of the hearings was to present forum for discussing the implementation of the act but in fact the committee through its chairman and staff members probed deeply into details of contes ted cases then under consideration indicating that there was more than meets the eye the entire rulemaking process was reexamined travel vouchers and other information were sought to probe the adequacy of the investigations made all papers in the pending proceedings were demanded the accuracy of data and procedures was questioned and cons tantly the committee interjected itself into aspects of the decisionmaking process 51 when the departmental officials expressed concern about the integrity of the quasijudicial administrative process the chairman several times stated that it was not his purpose to pressure the department but he many times stated his do ubts that the law was being properly carried out the court noted on key issues now in dispute before the court representatives of the government were obligated to take positions as to the interpretation of the act strenuous effort was made by the chairman to encourage protest and appeals coupled with comments indicating his clear impression that all that could be done was being done and that some of the results being reached were contrary to congressional intent 52 two days before the secretary made his determination on the eligibility of the villages the chairman sent letter to him requesting that he postpone his decision on the matter pending review and opinion by the comptroller general because it appears from the testimony at the hearings that village eligibility and native enrollment requirements of ansca have been misinterpreted in the regulations and that certain villages should not have been certified as eligible for land selections under ansca53 on these facts the district court vacated the secretarys eligibility decisions and reinstated the decisions initially rendered by the bureau of indian affairs bia 50 405 f supp 1360 ddc 1975 modified sub nom koniag v andrus 580 f2d 601 dc cir 1978 cert

disagreed in part with the lower courts application of the relevant law but not with its validity thus with regard to the chairmans conduct of the hearings the appeals court found fault with the district courts ruling because none of the agency officials subjected to the chairmans interrogations was an agency decisionmaker the hearings in question were called by congressman dingell in june of 1974 at the time the board and the secretary were considering most of these cases during the hearings congressman dingell made secret of his displeasure with some of the initial bia eligibility determinations nevertheless we think the pillsbury decision is not controlling here because none of the persons called before the subcommittee was decisionmaker in these cases one possible exception was mr ke n brown close advisor to the secretary who briefed him on the cases at the time he decided to approve the boards recommended decisions however even if we assume that the pillsbury doctrine would reach advisors to the decisionmaker mr brown was not asked to prejudge any of the claims by characterizing their validity see pillsbury co v ftc supra at 964 the worst cast that can be put upon the hearing is that brown was present when the subcommittee expressed its belief that certain villages had made fraudulent claims and that the bia decisions were in error this is not enough 54 with regard to the chairmans letter however the court of appeals found it compromised the appearance of the secretarys impartiality and thereby tainted the decision citing pillsbury approvingly but rather than reinstate the bia decisions the matter was remanded to the secretary since three and half years had passe d and new secretary of new administration had taken office thus making possible fair and dispassionate treatment of the matter55 g344g495g561g9g158g149g143g561g17g146g149g561g5g152g155g153g152g155g138g157g146g152g151g561g159g495g561g8g18g5 g561 other than koniag reviewing courts have consistently upheld congressional intercessions into adjudicatory proceedings against undue political influence challenges in gulf oil corporation v fpc56 for example petitioners sought to overturn federal power commission fpc order requiring delivery of larger quantities of natural gas in upholding the order the appeals court rejected claim that members and staff of the fpc had been subjected to improper interrogation and interference in the decision of the matter by the subcommittee on oversight and investigations of the house interstate and foreign commerce committee at hearings and in correspondence the court recognized the relevance of pillsbury to such an adjudicatory proceeding but acknowledged that it had to be sensitive to the legislative importance of congressional committees in oversight and investigation and recognized that their interest in the objective and efficient operation of regulatory agencies serves legitimate and wholesome function with which we should not lightly interfere 57 balancing the interests of integrity of an adjudicatory proceeding and congressional oversight the court found determinative distinctions between pillsbury and the case before it first the court found that the subcommittee was not concerned with the merits of the agencys decision as was the situation in pillsbury but was directed at accelerating the disposition and enforcement of the fpcs compliance procedures58 54 580 f2d at 610 55 id 56 563 f2d 588 3d cir 1977 57 563 f2d at 610 58 id at 611

reaching any decision on the specific facts of the case or any factual prejudice any intrusions into the merits of the fpcs decision were found to be incidental to the purpose of accelerating the agencys disposition of the case those incidental intrusions were found not to have had serious influence on the agency because 1 the interrogation did not reflect the majority view of the subcommittee 2 the agency did not accede to members requests and continued with the show cause proceeding and 3 the ultimate resolution of the issue was the same as it had been in proceedings concluded year prior to the hearings in question 59 concluding that the claim of prejudice could not be sustained under the facts and circumstances of the case the court recapitulated the factors it had taken into

commissions identical resolution of each issue in its prior decision the entirely legal nature of the commissions decision and our agreement with that decision against our commitment to the principle that administrative agencies must be allowed to exercise their adjudicative functions free of c ongressional pressure we conclude that the legislative conduct in this case did not affect the fairness of the commissions proceedings and does not warrant our setting aside the commissions order 60

g561 in peter kiewit sons co v us army corps of engineers61 the appeals court dealt with the effects of the conduct of senator at prior congressional investigations on the subject of debarment of government contractors convicted of bidrigging and similar offenses and his recommendations and status inquiries contemporaneous with an ongoing debarment proceeding the plaintiff the subject of the debarment proceeding claimed that the senators persistence in the subject area and his particular interest in its case compromised the integrity of the administrative proceeding the district court agreed on appeal the district of columbia circuit court reversed the appeals court acknowledged that judicial or quasijudicial proceeding could be invalidated by the appearance of bias or pressure and that under that standard pressure on the decisionmaker alone without proof or effect on the outcome is sufficient to vacate decision 62 thus the test is whether extraneous factors intruded into the calculus of consideration of the individual decisionmaker63 in the case before it the court found neither actual nor apparent congressional interference since the senator had never communicated directly with the ultimate decisionmaker in the debarment the assistant judge advocate general for civil law nor was it shown that that official was even aware of the senators communications 59 id 60

declaratory order regarding the allocation of power generated by waters of the niagara river the communications in question consisted of letter from two house members to president reagan whic h the president forwarded to the chairman of ferc and press conference attended by the four defendants ferc officials and the public at which the petitioners urged reversal of an administrative law judgess decision against them at the time ferc was considering petitions for rehearing one of the petitioners filed motion with ferc to deny rehearing because the proceeding had been tainted the commission denied the motion on the ground that the ex parte communications had not undermined the integrity of the commissions processes that same decision also resolved the merits of the proceeding and the municipal electric utilities association of new york meua and other parties sought appellate review the second circuit court of appeals summarily re jected meuas contentions with the following analysis ex parte communications by congressmen or any one else with judicial or quasi judicial body regarding pending matter are improper and should be discouraged on the other hand the mere existence of such communications hardly requires court or administrative body to disqualify itself recusal would be required only if the communications posed serious likelihood of affecting the

among others that letters from the chairman of the house energy and commerce committee unduly influenced and thereby tainted the entire sequence of federal energy regulatory commission orders which resulted in the conditioned license relying on the pillsbury case in three letters to ferc the chairman complained that the agency had not followed the recently enacted dispute resolution procedures under the federal power act67 in response to those complaints ferc reopened dispute resolution negotiations with state and federal fish and wildlife agencies prior to the conclusion of the licensing process the chairman also sent two letters to the agency urging it to review its two decades old interpretation of the federal land policy and management act flpma that hydroelectric project sponsor was not required to obtain rightofway permit over public lands from the bureau of lands mana gement of the department of interior because ferc had exclusive jurisdiction over federal hydroelectric development the chairman put forth contrary view and requested and received pport for that view in report by the general accounting office gao ferc after initiall rejecting the chairmans contention and reaffirming its long held interpretation during the course of the licensing proceeding reversed its course after receiving the gao report the appeals court rejected both objections holding that neither rose to the level of undue congressional influence described in pillsbury nor do they adversely affect the appearance of impartiality in this case68 fercs decision to open the dispute resolution process after receipt of the chairmans letters was designed the court found to correct procedural problem and was based on its own independent analysis of the record in this proceeding and was an effort to establish fair procedures to allow the parties and the commission to investigate69 since the negotiation requirements were so recent both the chairman and the commission were understandably concerned about getting off to good start 70 with respect to the successful urging that ferc change its long held interpretation of flpma the court explained that pillsbury was not implicated because ferc gave reasoned explanation for its reversal of its original interpretation of flpma and this provides substance for its claim that it addressed and resolved the rightofway issue under its own independent and detailed analysis of the issue71 the court further noted that the fact that it found later in its ruling that the reversal of its past interpretation was legally incorrect was irrelevant since the record of the proceeding supported that it had gone through process of reasoned analysis in short the chairmans letters expressing his views on the 10j and flpma issues do not constitute the type of intense and undue congressional influence that was present in pillsbury 72

of the application on the ground that tx was unfit was reasonable the pertinent facts of the controversy are essentially as follows congressional opposition to tx arose even prior to the filing of its application based largely on the perceived reputation of frank lorenzo its founder and majority owner from hi s previous record of management of major airline twenty one members of congress wrote th secretary of dot urging him to deny atxs application even before it had been filed because of lorenzos alleged unfitness to own and operate an airline74 most of the signatures on the letter were members of the house committee with jurisdiction over dot including the chair of the full committee the chair of the aviation subcommittee and the chair of the oversight subcommittee after tx filed its application 125 house and senate members wrote the secretary to declare their opposition to lorenzo two congressmen introduced legislation to prohibit lorenzo from reentering the airline industry 75 the secretary responded by acknowledging receipt of the letters refusing to comment on the merits and putting the correspondence in file for contacts outside the record of the case76 during the hearing on the application one of the congressional letter writers was allowed to testify as to his opposition ultimately the department rejected the application on the ground that atx lacked both managerial competence to operate an airline and disposition to comply with regulatory requirements77 in rejecting the undue influence challenge the court acknowledged that the size vocality and source of the congressional opposition toward the applicant in this quasijudicial proceeding required close judicial scrutiny to allay due process concerns with the alleged appearance of bias the court explained in the nonjudicial context we have suggested that the way to cure the appearance of bias may be to establish full scale administrative record which might dispel any doubts about the true nature of the agencys action volpe 459 f 2d at 1249 with respect to the nexus requirements we have never questioned the authority of congressional representatives to exert pressure see id and we have held that congressional actions not targeted directly at the decision makerssuch as contemporaneous hearingsdo not invalidate an agency decision see koniag 580 f 2d at 610 under this framework it is apparent that none of the congressional pressure challenged by atx is sufficient to invalidate the adjudication 78 the court commented that the influence with which it was concerned is when congressional influence shapes the determination of the merits the court commented that the lengthy opinion supporting the decision based on the administrative record was clear and open to scrutiny and the decision was fully supported by the record there is reason for us to infer that the letters influenced his decision inasmuch as he did not reverse the aljs recommendation nor was the merits decision close one on the record 79 the testimony of the congressman at the hearing did not create fatal appearance of bias as it was based almost entirely on information already 74 41 f3d at 1524 75

subcommittee counsels adversarial interrogation about particular factors in the cost analysis of opinion 770 formed the basis of the claim of prejudice83 in reaching the question whether the commission should be disqualified the court related the facts of pillsbury and described its holding at length it then observed we doubt the utility of classifying the ratemaking undertaken in the present proceedings by the power commission as entirely judicial or legislative function or combination of the two for in any event the need for an impartial decision is obvious congressional intervention which occurs during the stillpending decisional process of an agency endangers and may undermine the integrity of the ensuing decision which congress has required be made by an impartial agency charged with responsibility for resolving controversies within its jurisdiction congress as well as the courts has responsibility to protect the decisional integrity of such an agency 84 however despite this rhetorical obeisance to the spirit of pillsbury the court did not disqualify the agency because the producers though fully aware of all these facts failed to ask the commission to disqualify itself the court said that party cannot with knowledge of the alleged taint stay silent in hopes of favorable decision and then when the decision is unfavorable seek its reversal on the ground of partiality party knowing of ground for requesting disqualification cannot be permitted to wait and decide whether he likes subsequent treatment that he receives 85 but the court did not end its analysis there it went on to ask whether the interference was so serious as to require it sua sponte to void the result and set forth the factors it took into account in concluding that it would not the character and scope of the interference alleged the fact that the parties who raise the disqualification question seem not to have deemed what occurred to impair the impartiality of the commission itself independent of the result it reached the fact that in one important respect and indeed the issue that was most vehemently examined by the congressmen namely the correctness of the commissions decision respecting the income tax component the commission left standing the disposition criticized at the subcomm ittee hearing the fact that there is nothing to lead the court to find that actual influence affected opinion 770a and the fact that insofar as any actions of the commissioners themselves are concerned appearance of partiality is evident 86 in essence then the courts decision turned on its finding of actual impact of the congressional intervention on the agency decision since the court earlier made clear it understood the differing standards applied by the pillsbury and dc federation rulings87 it would appear to have considered the proceeding closer in type or form to dc federation 83 567 f2d at 1068 84 id at 1069 85 id 86 id at 1070 87 compare the

the town sought to prevent the environmental protection agency epa and the new york stat department of environmental conservation nysdec from approving grants that would modernize an outmoded and overloaded sewage treatment plant it was argued that improper political pressure by state and local officials on epa caused epa to reconsider and relax certain conditions on the grants that it had originally imposed that were important to the town the second circuit held that in nonadjudicatory proceeding involving the disbursement of funds it had to be shown that political pressure was intended and did cause the agencys action to be influenced by factors not relevant under the controlling statute 89 here the court stated the potential effect of proposed grant on area development is one of the relevant factors for the epa to consider and elected officials should not be precluded from bringing those factors to administrators attention citing sierra club v costle orangetown may not rest upon mere conclusory allegations of improper political influence as means of obtaining trial90 since the epa decision whether to impose conditions on the grants was not adjudicatory in nature but an administrative one dealing with the disbursement of grant funds and required adversary proceeding the appeals court concluded that he town did not have the status of party and was not entitled to notice and opportunity to be heard consequently such communications as the epa d with the two public officials did not deprive the town of due process 91

administration faa to locate and build flight service station the contract was originally awarded to elmira new york in chemung count but was rescinded and then awarded to buffalo new york it was claimed that the change was improperly effected by the political pressure brought on the faa by two new york congressmen adopting the rule announced in its town of orangetown ruling the appeals court found undue political influence the full extent of representatives kemp and nowaks efforts on behalf of the nfta was their having written letters to the faa and their staffs and having met with the gao investigator appellees object to the representatives letter to the faa asking it to refrain from formally entering into contract with chemung county while the gao audit was underway the faa had right to suspend performance of contract pending gao audit if the audit proved that nfta had submitted the lowest bid as it did so prove the faa had the obligation to award the contract to nfta see 41 usc 253b 1982 thus this letter urged the faa to take action directly authorized by the statutory scheme governing the award of contracts similarly the representatives letter to the faa urging the agency to reevaluate its telecommunications cost estimates in light of the gaos findings was also proper this letter was also an attempt to persuade the faa to abide by its statutory obligations not ignore them as noted above an award of government contract to anyone except the bidder with 88 40 f2d 185 2d cir 1984 89 740 f2d at 188 90 id 91 id at 18889 92 804 f2d 216 2d cir 1986

denial of farm subsidy payments had been tainted by the intercession of powerful congressman prior to commencement of department of agriculture adjudication and thereby required the application of pillsbury s mere appearance of bias standard the adjudication was to be held to determine whether an aggregation of 51 irrevocable agricultural trusts was entitled to large subsidies in the face of statute that limited farm subsidies to 50000 per person the effect of the trust scheme would have been to allow dcp farms 14 million in subsidies for the 1989 crop year prior to the award decision the departments inspector general ig issued report on abuses of the farm subsidy program which highlighted dcp farms as an example of egregious violations of the 50000 per person limit 95 the report received considerable publicity and reached the attention of the jurisdictional subcommittee of the house agriculture committee staff of the subcommittee chairman met with department officials to discuss the issues raised by the ig report in late 1989 dcp farms was specifically discussed in december 1989 the chairman wrote to the secretary of agriculture about the reports of abuses in the subsidy program and cited dcp farms as an example of the continued abuse of the statutory limit he urged careful review of schemes involving irrevocable trusts particularly in light of the fact that he had had assurances in the past from usda officials that legislative action was needed with respect to the treatment of such trusts the chairman received assurance from the secretary that the dcp farms case was under administrative review and that the department would take very aggressive position in dealing with this case 96 in june 1990 an administrative decision was issued finding that dcp farms had adopted schemes to evade the payment limitation provisions of the law and was ineligible to receive any subsidy payments for the 1989 1990 and 1991 crop years dcp farms appealed and requested hearing which was set for december 12 1990 before the hearing date dcp farms learned of the meeting with the chairmans staff and of the chairmans letter and successfully sued to enjoin the hearing on the ground among others that improper congressional interference denied then due process 97 the fifth circuit rejected the argument in an opinion that recognizes the need to permit political oversight with respect to policy issues congress has entrusted to agency decisionmakers the appeals court first rejected the applicability of pillsbury because the contact here occurred well before any proceeding which could be considered judicial or quasijudicial there was hearing on the merits of dcp farms application for farm subsidy payments because dcp farms abandoned the administrative process for this litigation98 the court saw the dispute between dcp farms and the department as part of larger policy debate and rejected any connection 93 804 f2d at 222 94 957 f2d

appeals hearing that would raise pillsbury issues in short the congressional communication here was not aimed at the decisionmaking process of any quasijudicial body congressman huckaby was concerned about the administration of congressionally created program the dispute between the usda and dcp farms was part of larger policy debate applying pillsburys stringent mere appearance of bias standard at this juncture of administrative process would erect small barrier to congressional oversight it reflects an insular view of these administrative processes for which we find warrant we are unwilling to so dramatically restrict communications between congress and the executive agencies over policy issues appearance of bias is not the standard 99 the proper standard for this type of case the court advised is whether the communication actually influenced the agencys decision this is appropriate the court explained because it protects the proper and effective workings of the political process this focus on the intrusion of improper extraneous factors into the agencys decision making process recognizes the political reality that members of congress are requested to and do in fact intrude in varying degrees in administrative proceedings sec v wheelingpittsburgh steel corp 648 f 2d 118 126 3d cir 1981 banc it would be unrealistic to require that agencies turn d eaf ear to comments from members of congress the agencys duty so long as it is not acting in its quasijudicial capacity is simply to give congressional comments only as much deference as they deserve on the merits id we are cautious in reading extraneous factors too broadly lest they impair agency flexibility in dealing with congress in particular an agencys patient audience to member of congress will not by itself constitute the injection of an extraneous factor nor would simple plea for more effective enforcement of law be the injection of an improper factor truly extraneous factor must take into account considerations that congress could not have intended to make relevant dc federation 459 f 2d at 1247 congressional interference and political pressure are loaded terms we need not attempt portrait of all their sinister possibilities even if we were able to do so we can make plain that the force of logic and ideas is not our concern they carry their own force and exert their own pressure in this practical sense they are not extraneous that congressman expresses the view that the law ought not sanction the use of fiftyone irrevocable trusts to gain 14 million in subsidies is not impermissible political pressure it certainly injects extraneous factor we find due process right in these preliminary efforts to persuade the government to grant farm subsidies sufficient to exclude the political tugs of the different branches of government and we see nothing more here we reject the holding of the district court that dcp farms could ignore the administrative procedure yet available to it and turn to the consequence of this bypass of remedies 100 99 id at 118788 100 id at 1188

after dc federation district court applied its principles to find an impermissible congressional intervention in an agency rulemaking proceeding in texas medical association v mathews 101 the court considered plaintiffs contention that congressional pressure should invalidate decision of the partment of health education and welfare hew dividing texas into nine professional standa rds review organizations psro hew after consulting with the plaintiff and several other interested groups first announced it would form one statewide psro but after lengthy meeting with senator wallace bennett sponsor of the psro legislation and senior staff member of the senate finance committee an hew official abruptly changed his mind and called for the division of texas into nine psros the court noted that while it had evidence as to what senator bennett or the staffer may have said during the meeting hew was unable to adequately explain its sudden reversal of decision with regard to the number of ps ros so soon after the meeting102 moreover the court found proof of pattern of undue influence by the same congressional sources permeating hews entire administrative process relative to psro designation for texas103 applying dc federation s principle that agency action is invalid if based even in part on pressures emanating from congressional sources104 the court concluded that the fact that an agency decision is little pregnant with pressures emanating from congressional sources is enough to require invalidation of the agency action especially should this be the law where as here the invasive congressional source has financial leverage on the involved agency105 the fact that the agency action involved in mathews was in the nature of rulemaking would not appear to be an inapt or inconsistent application of dc federation when judge bazelon noted there that the courts would give absolute deference to legislative actions it is clear from the context that he was referring to such action by legislative body there the dc council political body directly accountable to its constituency in the electoral process where similar legislative action informal rulemaking is taken by an administrative agency the courts accord great but not absolute deference to that process since it is not directly accountable to the electorate finding of taint in an informal rulemaking is therefore not foreclosed by the dc federation rationale thus the court in mathews held that the normal presumption in favor of the agencys decision was overcome by the evidence of the pervasive and invasive nature of the congressional intrusions however while the ruling is not inconsistent with dc federation the holdings in us ex rel parco v morris and sierra club v costle to be discussed next appear to reflect more accurately the nature and extent of the currently prevailing judicial deference to congressional attempts to influence policymaking in the rulemaking process 101 408 f supp 303

morris106 involved challenge by deportable aliens to the rescission by the immigration and naturalization service of longstanding operating instruction which would have allowed them to extend the date of their voluntary departure plaintiffs contended inter alia that the change in policy was precipitated by the direct pressure applied by representative peter rodino who was then chairman of the subcommittee responsible for the oversight of the administration of the immigration laws it was conceded that representative rodinos request was the direct impetus for the change in policy the court rejected the contention based on its reading of the dc federation that holding it said was based upon public and enforceable threat by congressman to withhold public funds for particular purpose unless an agency official acceded to the congressmans wishes and evidence that the officials decision was based in part on that pressure 107 the court went on to note the importance of the nature of the proceeding in analysis of such cases however judge bazelons analysis of this principle distinguishes sharply between agency action which is judicial or quasijudicial and agency action which is legislative the former concept related to agency adjudication of particular individual case or when it renders decision on the r ecord compiled in formal hearings in such instance the consideration of

designed to force him to decide upon factors not made relevant by congress in the applicable statute and also that the determination made must be affected by those extraneous considerations113 more particularly it was alleged that an ex parte blitz conducted after the comment period for an informal rulemaking had caused the environmental protection agency epa to back away from its support of more stringent emission standard and was therefore unlawful and prejudicial114 post comment period communications included number of oral conversations and briefings between agency officials and private parties and other government officials including the majority leader of the united states senate and the president of the united states the appeals court initially noted that the statute in question there did not require the docketing of all postcomment period conversations and meetings and refused to apply blanket rule requiring such docketing to the contrary where the nature of the rulemaking is general policymaking the court expressed the view that the concept of ex parte contacts is of more questionable utility indeed the court deemed informal contacts vital to the effectiveness and legitimacy of our governmental processes under our system of government the very legitimacy of general policymaking performed by unelected administrators depends in small part upon the openness accessibility and amenability of these officials to the needs and ideas of the public from whom their ultimate authority derives and upon whom their commands must fall as judges we are insulated from these pressures because of the nature of the judicial process in which we participate but we must refrain from the easy temptation to look askance at all facetoface lobbying efforts regardless of the forum in which they occur merely because we see them as inappropriate in the judicial context furthermore the importance to effective regulation of continuing contact with regulated industry other affected groups and the agency to win needed support for its program reduce future enforcement requirements by helping those regulated to anticipate and shape their plans for the future and spur the provision of information which the agency needs 115 however the court inferred from the statutory scheme that oral comments of central relevance to the rulemaking should be placed in the record although the court conceded that this allows the agency to decide in its own discretion which comm ents are relevant the court did not find this to be persuasive enough consideration to require more stringent rule edf is understandably wary of rule which permits the agency to decide for itself when oral communications are of such central relevance that docket entry for them is required yet the statute itself vests epa with discretion to decide whether documents are of central relevance and therefore must be placed in the docket surely epa can be given less discretion in docketing oral communications concerning which the statute has explicit requirements whatsoever furthermore this co urt has already recognized that the relative significance of various communications to the outcome of the rule is factor in determining whether their disclosure is required judicially imposed blanket requirement that all post comment period oral communications be docketed would on the other hand contravene our limited powers of review would stifle desirable experimentation in the area by congress and the agencies and is unnecessary for achieving the goal of an established proceduredefined 113

justification given by the agency for its final rule116 the appeals court concluded that none of the nondocketed postcomment meetings including those with the senate majority leader and the president required docketing it underlined its view that informal rulemaking involving general policymaking is akin to the legislative process and therefore the courts should be wary of attempting to probe too deeply it stated that before an administrative rulemaking could be overturned simply on the grounds of political pressure it had to be shown that the content of the pressure on the decisionmaker is designed to force him to decide upon factors not made relevant by congress in the applicable statute and also that the determination made must be affected by those extraneous considerations 117 although the meetings were called at the behest of the majority leader in order to express strongly his views 118 on the subject of the rulemaking it found that the agency made commitments to him nor was there evidence that he used extraneous pressures to further his position the court characterized the senators efforts since they were exerted in rulemaking proceeding as within the accepted boundaries of the political process americans rightly expect their elected representatives to voice their grievances and preferences concerning the administration of our laws we believe it entirely proper for congressional representatives vigorously to represent the interests of their constituents before administrative agencies engaged in informal general policy rulemaking so long as individual congressmen do not frustrate the intent of congress as whole as expressed in statute nor undermine applicable rules of procedure where congressmen keep their comments focused on the substance of the proposed ruleand we have substantial evidence to cause us to believe senator byrd did not do so hereadministrative agencies are expected to balance congressional pressure with the pressures emanating from all other sources to hold otherwise would deprive the agencies of legitimate sources of information and call into question the validity of nearly every controversial rulemaking 119 similarly with regard to meeting involving the pr esident the court held that as long as there is factual support in the record for the agencys ou tcome it does not matter that but for the presidential input it would have gone the other way of course it is always possible that undisclosed presidential prodding may direct an outcome that is factually based on the record but different from the outcome that would have obtained in the absence of presidential involvement in such case it would be true that the political process did affect the outcome in way the courts could not police but we do not believe that congress intended that the courts convert informal rulemaking into rarified technocratic process unaffected by political considerations or the presence of presidential power 120 116 id at 40204

an agency investigation has been instigated by congressional pressure or influence and the claim is made by the subject of such investigation that it is tainted by the political intervention on even rarer occasions agencies have sought to fend off congressional oversight of closed or ongoing investigations because of concern that present and future open cases could be compromised by turning over requested internal deliberative documents agencies argue that such disclosures even from closed investigations might be utilized by attorneys representing potential targets of investigations or defendants in civil and criminal actions as evidence that the investigations or prosecutions are politically motivated and not driven by legitimate investigatory concerns and are thereby tainted this notion is said to be supported by the appellate court ruling in sec v wheelingpittsburgh steel corp 121 it is argued that wheelingpittsburgh precludes any agency contact with members of congress which would give the appearance that an agency is acting at the behest of member or committee and that its proper course is to avoid any appearance that its enforcement efforts are being pursued at congress bidding the claim however does not appear to be an accurate portrayal of either the wheelingpittsburgh ruling or the case law that preceded or followed it the wheelingpittsburgh court made it clear that court will deem request for the enforcement of an administrative subpoena an abuse of the judicial process only if it was in fact shown that the subpoena was issued because of congressional influence the agency knew its process was being abused that it knowingly did nothing to prevent the abuse and that it vigorously pursued the frivolous charges under the standard articulated by the appeals court the motivation of the members of congress is irrelevant the focus is on the actual impact of the congressional intercession on the motivation of the agency itself simply the appearance of impropriety is not enough to taint the proceeding sec v wheelingpittsburgh steel corp involved the initiation of an informal investigation of wheelingpittsburgh steel corporation after the receipt by the securities and exchange commission of letter from united states senator suggesting that wheeling had violated section 10b of the securities exchange act of 1934 and rule 10b5a promulgated thereunder during the period of the initial informal investig ation there was considerable contact between the sec staff attorney conducting the investigation and the senators office and with competitors of wheeling who were in alleged complicity with the senator the senator was also actively pursuing the passage of legislation that would prevent wheeling from obtaining federal loan guarantees if it was under investigation by federal agency thereafter the sec ordered formal investigation of the matter pursuant to the formal investigation order the sec issued subpoena duces tecum to wheeling and its chief executive officer he refused to answer certain questions and the agency sought enforcement wheeling defended on the grounds inter alia that the subpoena was issued in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment and that the investigation constituted an abuse of the secs investigatory power by competitors of wheeling who were opposed to the grant of certain federal loan guarantees to wheeling the district court refused to enforce the subpoena although it specifically rejected the claim of bad faith on the part of the agency it concluded that under the totality of

reached this conclusion because it believed that the sec had allowed bi ased third parties to improperly influence the investigation process although it conceded that the agency did not adopt the biased motives of the third parties123 panel of the third circuit reversed concluding that court could not refuse to enforce administrative subpoenas issued in good faith pursuit of statutorily authorized purpose the court concluded that bias of third parties was irrelevant where the agency had proceeded in good faith and that to invalidate agency action on the basis of an abuse of process theory independent of the bad faith defense was improper the case was reargued before the third circuit banc which by 64 vote remanded the case to the district court in light of its ruling that even in the absence of bad faith on the part of an agency it would not enforce an administrative subpoena if it was issued because of congressional influence and it was shown that the agency knew its process was being abused that it knowingly did nothing to prevent the abuse and that it vigorously pursued the frivolous charges 124 we do not doubt the usefulness to administrative agencies of information gained from third parties nor do we doubt that frequently the motivations of informants are less than altruistic see united states v cortese 614 f2d 914 3d cir 1980 but we cannot simply avert our eyes from the realities of the political world members of congress are requested to and do in fact intrude in varying grees in administrative proceedings one commentator has said recently of

allegation while an agency may be found to be abusing the courts process if it vigorously pursued charge because of the influence of powerful third party without consciously and objectively evaluating the charge126 the court also emphasized the point that it was improper for the district court to have taken into account the motivation of third parties in determining either bad faith or abuse of process this court has previously made clear that the proper focus in challenge to an administrative subpoena is motivation of the agency itself not that of third parties citing united states v cortese 614 f2d 914 921 3d cir 1980 127 the requirement of finding of institutional bad faith rather than that of an individual agent or the refusal to allow attributing the motives of third parties to an agency is well established128 the court concluded at bottom this case raises the question whether based on objective factors the secs decision to investigate reflected its independent determination or whether that decision was the product of external influences the reality of prosecutorial experience that most investigations originate on the basis of tips suggestions or importunings of third parties including commercial competitors need hardly be noted that the sec commenced these proceedings as result of the importunings of senator weicker or cfi even with malice on their part is not sufficient basis to deny enforcement of the subpoenas see cortese 614 f2d at 921 but beginning an informal investigation by collecting facts at the request of third party even one harboring ulterior motives is much different from entering an order directing private formal investigation pursuant to 17 cfr 2025 1980 without an objective determination by the commission and only because of political pressure the respondents are not free from an informal invest igation instigated by anyone in or out of government but they are entitled to decision by the sec itself free from thirdparty political pressure that likelihood of violation exists and that private investigation should be ordered see 17 cfr 2052a the sec order must be supported by an independent agency determination not one dictated or pressured by external forces if an allegation of improper influence and abdication of the agencys objective responsibilities is made and supported by sufficient evidence to make it facially credible respondents are entitled to examine the circumstances surrounding the secs private investigation order the court should be guided by twin beacons the cour ts process is focus of the judicial inquiry and the respondent may challenge the summons on any appropriate ground 129 in sum then it would appear that the third circuit while accepting the possibility of finding that political pressure can taint an investigative proceeding under variety of theories has imposed on litigant the burden of establishing the factua l predicate to support such determination which may prove quite formidable it certainly appears less an obstacle than the showing of actual effect required in other nonadjudicatory situations130 126 648 f2d at 125 n 9 127 648

be that the somewhat more expansive review of such situations afforded by wheelingpittsburgh may be limited to cases arising in the third circuit134 in any event we are aware of court that has

g561 in the most recent decision in which the target of an administrative investigation invoked wheelingpittsburgh principles the 4th circuit in united states v american target advertising inc137 rejected the claim of the defendant that the issuance of an investigative subpoena was tool of harassment and intimidation exercised by the agency the postal service at the behest of senator who the court conceded has demonstrated fair degree of hostility toward the defendant but the appeals court reiterated that that was not enough the appellant must show that the party actually responsible for initiating the investigation ie the postal service has done so in bad faith 138 the court found evidence of bad faith and rejected american targets request for discovery before the district court noting that such discovery is prohibited in these types of summary enforcement proceedings absent extraordinary circumstances the appeals court advised that in order to obtain discovery th target must distinguish himself from the class of the ordinary respondent by citing special circumstances139 the 4th circuit concluded that it had not done so there stating when presented with evidence of unlawful conduct the government is not bound to investigate only those potential wrongdoers who support its policies because american target failed to distinguish itself from the ordinary disgruntled respondent it is not entitled to discovery regarding the genesis of the postal services inquiry140 in sum it would appear that the assertions with respect to the wheelingpittsburgh precedent is unduly restrictive that case does not establish an appearance of partiality standard with respect to congressional contacts high degree of proof is needed to demonstrate that the agencys motivation in continuing an investigation is solely in acquiescence to congressional influence and without any regard to the adequacy of the grounds of the allegations

congresss performance of its constitutional and statutory obligations to oversee the actions of agency officials against the rights of parties before agencies have increasingly looked to the role of the political process in all types of agency decisionmakings and have attempted to give weight to that process on caseby case basis the result has been strong predilection of the courts to accept congressional prerogatives thus where informal rulemaking or other forms of informal decisionmaking are involved the courts will look to the nature and impact of the political pressure on the agency decisionmaker and will intervene only where that pressure has had the continued investigation was conducted for an improper purpose 137 257 f3d 348 4th cir 2001 138 257 f3d at 355 139 id 140 id at 356

not intend to make relevant where agency adjudication is involved stricter standard is applied and the finding of an appearance of impropriety can be sufficient to taint the proceeding but even here the courts have required that the pressure or influence be directed at the ultimate decisionmaker with respect to the merits of the proceeding and that it does not involve legitimate oversight and investigative functions before they will intervene and where congressional intrusion in an agencys investigative process is involved the courts will intervene only if it is in fact shown that an inquiry was instituted and subpoenas issued because of congressional influence the agency knew its process was being abused that it knowingly did nothing to prevent abuse and that it rigorously pursued frivolous charges 1989 legal commentary has severely criticized this decisional trend arguing that the case law in this area means that members of congress can intervene in ongoing agency proceedings by contacting either the close personal aides or the immediate periors of the ultimate decisionmaker convey their judgments on how those questions should be decided and avoid judicial review of their actions while knowing full well that their message will find its way to the relevant agency official in short the actual influence standard of dc federation is manipulable at the whim of congress and in the words of judge gesell those seeking to invoke the pillsbury doctrine must now shoulder the virtually impossible burden of proving whether and in what way the agency was actually influenced by congressional intervention 141 as remedy the author calls for the judicial application of pillsburys appearance of impartiality standard to any instance of informal congressional intercession regardless of the nature of the proceeding in question as legitimate and useful tool for controlling congressional abuse of the informal oversight mechanisms which are likely to see wider use in the post chadha era142 the comment suggests that the use of such informal oversight mechanisms is an unlawful circumvention of the supreme courts decision in ins v chadha 143 which invalidated the use of legislative veto devices because it allowed congress to evade the presentment and bicameralism requirements of the legislative process mandated by the constitution 144 if congress determines through the use of oversight mechanisms that an agency has misinterpreted statute the appropriate response is to take the formal step of amending the law not to use informal means to alter the agencys interpretation145 the comment would appear to misconceive the nature and scope of congress constitutional oversight and investigatory authority and the judicial recognition and approbation of informal congressional techniques to influence agency actions as both directly flowing from that authority and as being an integral part of the checks and balances mechanism underlying our scheme of separated but shared powers thus it is well settled that congress in legislating pursuant to the powers granted it under article i section 8 of the constitution has the authority under the

situation as an attempt to effect an unconstitutional purpose eg congressional appointment or removal of an officer148 have the courts felt constrained to intervene equally well settled is the breadth of congress authority to effectively monitor the work of its creations supreme court rulings have firmly established that the oversight and investigatory power of congress is so essential to the legislative function as to be implied from the general vesting of legislative power in congress149 in the absence of countervailing constitutional privilege or selfimposed statutory restriction upon its authority the congress and its committees has plenary power to compel information needed to discharge its legislative function from executive agencies private persons and organizations and within certain constraints the information so obtained may be made public150 moreover congress power to influence executive and other governmental conduct is not confined to its utilization of its lawmaking authority the courts have long recognized congressional authority to investigate and to express its opinion in an attempt to influence the manner in which the laws are executed 151 in upholding the exercises of similar kinds of authority courts have acknowledged that the issuance of subpoena to the executive152 the mandate of report and wait provision153 and the expression of disapprobation or the focusing of public attention on executive action154 do not themselves constitute improper control of executive decisionmaking155 the supreme court has also recognized congress right to investigate

the institution and prosecution of proceedings to punish crimes and enforce ap propriate remedies against the wrongdoerswas clearly one on which legislation could be enacted and was within the jurisdiction of the senate to investigate157 additionally the courts have explicitly held that agencies may not deny congress access to agency documents even in situations where the inquiry may result in the exposure of criminal corruption or maladministration by agency official s as the supreme court has noted but surely congressional committee which is engaged in legitimate legislative investigation need not grind to halt whenever responses to its inquiries might potentially be harmful to witness in some distinct proceeding or when crime or wrongdoing is exposed 158 thus the courts have recognized the potentially prejudicial effect congressional hearings can have on pending cases while not questioning the prerogatives of congress with respect to oversight and investigation the cases pose choice for the congress congressionally generated publicity may result in harming the prosecutorial effort of the executive but access to information under secure conditions can fulfill the congressional power of investigation and at the same time need not be inconsistent with the authority of the executive to pursue its case nonetheless it remains choice that is solely within congress discretion to make irrespective of the consequences the foregoing review of the case law concerning congress oversight and investigatory authority appears to abundantly demonstrate that the decisional law development in the area of undue influence is hardly aberrational but is rather subset and therefore mirror of the broad oversight power the courts have accorded congress over executive agencies generally in all such cases the courts balance congress constitutional oversight and investigatory prerogatives against the interests of the agencies or private parties involved in nonadjudicatory setting involving general policymaking it is hardly surprising that the congressional prerogatives are likely to be weighed and found persuasive unless the subject matter implicates countervailing constitutional privileges of the president or the pressure brought to bear results in decision that ignores applicable statutory considerations or procedures thus the sierra club court noted that rulemaking would be overturned because of congressional pressure only if two conditions were met first if the content of the pressure was designed to force the decisionmaker to decide on the basis of factors not made relevant by congress in the applicable statute and second if the decision was in fact affected by those extraneous considerations 159 the court explained its rationale as follows we believe it entirely prop er for congressional representatives vigorously to represent the interests of their constituents before administrative agencies engaged in informal general policy rulemaking so long as individual congressmen do not frustrate the intent of congress as whole as expressed in statue nor undermine applicable rules of procedure160 on the other hand underlying the greater judicial sensitivity to public or secret ex parte exertions of political pressure on an agency adjudication is the premise that such adjudications whether formal or informal involve individual rights rather than issues of general policy and thus implicate constitutional due process values although due process does not generally require 157 273 us at 170 17778 158 hutcheson v united states 369 us

conform to the fundamental notions of fairness implicit in due process161 both public and secret congressional attempts to influence agency decisionmaking may undermine the due process rights of parties to informal adjudications in several respects where the contacts are unrevealed parties to the adjudication are deprived of notice and an opportunity to respond with relevant information violation of fundamental canons of fairness162 moreover whether overt or concealed political pressure compromises the appearance of impartiality and objectivity of the decisionmaker qualities traditionally regarded as essential to due process163 thus the decisions in this area reflect common purpose of the courts to preserve the integrity of the judicial aspect of the administrative process164 but even in the adjudicatory setting the judicial deference to congressional prerogatives is apparent taint will not be found unless the pressure is directly on the decisionmaker concerns the merits of the case and is not minimal the gulf oil165 meua166 california v ferc167 and atx168 litigations serve to illustrate the current judicial practice all four cases involved proceedings adjudicatory in nature but in none was taint found in gulf oil the court found the following factors determinative the subcommittee interrogations were not concerned with the merits of the agencys decision but with its compliance procedures there was attempt to influence factual determination of the agency the commission in fact resisted the political pressure as evidenced by its resolution of key issues in manner identical to the way it had decided them before the committee hearings and the fact that the nature of the agencys decision was entirely legal in the meua case the second circuit found the ex parte communications involved there to be minimis the challenged communications were not secret and were in fact promptly placed in the public record they contained new factual information and opportunity for rebuttal was either required or necessary in california v ferc the court emphasized that the congressional intercessions were meant to correct procedural problems and to question whether the agency was applying the proper legal standard and that the agency determination made in each instance was based on its own independent ontherecord analysis of the congressional objections and was accompanied by reasoned explanation the court viewed the matter as properly involving the congressional interest in policymaking and policy application finally the intense congressional pressure in tx to deny an application to operate new airline was found not to taint the proceeding because close examination showed that it did not affect the outcome of proceeding the

remand to the agency for reconsideration of the decision in question in the final analysis judicial deference in this area appears to reflect the pragmatic conclusion that maintenance of congress ability to communicate as freely as possible with the administrative bureaucracy is essential to sustaining the public acceptability of the modern administrative state as one commentator has explained the legitimacy and acceptability of the administrative process depends on the perception of the public that the legislature has some sort of ultimate control over the agencies it is through the congress that the administrative system is accountable to the public if members of congress be corrupt others may be chosen the public may not however directly remove agency officials the public looks to its power to elect representatives as its input into the administrative process the public will perceive restrictions on congresss power to influence agency action as reducing the accountability of agency officials this will negatively affect the legitimacy of agency actions as well as seriously erode notion of popular sovereignty even administrators who may not perceive legislative intrusions into the administrative process as being particularly desirable recognize congressional supervision as necessary function in democratic society the nature of the government requires that the legislature maintain careful supervision over agency action 169

administrative matters on behalf of constituents have often been characterized as among the official responsibilities of members of congress on behalf of those whom they represent and such representational duties above and beyond purely legislative acts have evolved as traditional and longstanding discretionary practice of members of congress in discussing the theoretical as well as the ethical context for these representational activities the late senator paul douglas of illinois in his valued work ethics in government noted that congressional intervention in the administrative and executive process is grounded firmly in our concepts of checks and balances in representative democracy as well as our natural and historical distrust as nation of unelected governments much of the mail and time of members of congress is devoted to the requests of constituents about matters concerning which they the constituents are dealing with the administrative agencies of the government in countries dominated by civil servants such as imperial germany and to lesser degree great britain any intervention by legislators in such administrative matters is severely discouraged the bureaucracy in these countries contends that the function of the legislators is to make the laws and that of the public administrators is to administer them and that consequently neither should interfere with the work of the other these men consciously or unconsciously regard the civil service officials as devoted public servants in contrast to the impure legislator such attitude is fostered by those who would create an administrative state in which the real directing power would be exercised by selfselecting and selfperpetuatin g group of officials rather than by elected representatives of the people at its roots there is concealed but deep distrust of democratic government and democratic processes the truth is that legislation and administration should not be kept in airtight and separate compartments in order that each group may perform its own job adequately it should within limits interest itself in the work of the other there is then sound ethical basis for legislators to represent the interests of constituents and other citizens in their dealings with administrative officials and bodies besides this ethical justification there is practical necessity for it out of deep instinctive wisdom the american people have ne ver been willing to confide their individual or collective destinies to civil servants over whom they have little control they distrust and dislike selfperpetuating bureaucracy because they believe that ultimately it will not reflect the best interests of the people they therefore turn to their elected representatives to protect their legitimate interests in their relationship with the public administrators 170 the importance of the casework or service function of representing constituents individual interests before the agencies and officials of the federal executive bureaucracy was recognized and discussed in an important treatise on congressional ethics authored by the association of the bar of the city of new york congress and the public trust the casework or service function has become major responsibility of members of congress today in the performance of this function senator or representative negotiates 170 douglas paul

that arise out of their relations with the federal government this can involve the member in helping to obtain federal contract for his district interceding on behalf of selective service registrant inquiring why constituents social security check has not been delivered setting up meeting with federal official and arranging for tour of the white house for an important constituent 171 the practice of intervening in administrative and executive matters on behalf of constituents and other individuals has therefore not been perceived historically in the united states as an inherently wrongful act necessarily involving undue or improper political influence over executive or administrative matters but rather has customarily been seen as discretionary and arguably an expected function of ones representative in congress the house committee on standards of official conduct for example advises members and employees of the house that an important aspect of house members repres entative function is to act as gobetween or conduit between his constituents and administrative agencies of the federal government 172 similarly the senate select committee on ethics has stated that it is necessary function of senators office to intervene with officials of the executive branch and independent regulatory agencies on behalf of individuals when the facts warrant 173 there are of course opportunities and potential for abuse in this area and there are therefore statutory as well as ethical restraints and considerations in relation to such activities as there are for most official activities and duties of members of congress and their staff the most prominent and clear restriction is upon the receipt of compensation or anything of value in return for or because of such representational activity the supreme court of the united states in 1905 had occasion to rule on the propriety of united states senator intervening in an executive matter and noted that such activity although not required of member is within the members discretion may be done without impropriety and is not violative of statutory restraints as long as compensation is accepted for the activity the court in burton v united states in ruling that statute barring senator from receiving compensation for representing an individual before the agencies of the government did not unduly interfere with members constitutional duties to represent and present his views before those agencies explained statute like the one before us can be executed without in any degree interfering with the discharge of the legitimate duties of senator the proper discharge of those duties does not require senator to appear before an executive department in order to enforce his particular views or the views of others in respect of matters committed to that department for determination he may often do so without impropriety and as far as existing law is concerned may do so whenever he chooses provided he neither agrees to receive nor receives compensation for such services 174 171 association of the bar of the city of new york special committee on congressional ethics congress and the public trust at 10 new

things of value by member or staff from persons or organizations on whose behalf interventions before or inquiries to federal agencies were made prudence and caution must of course be exercised by members of congress and staff in accepting gifts at any time from private individuals or groups and even more so in accepting any gifts offers of entertainment or other things of value which could be interpreted as reward payment or additional compensation for doing ones official duties in assisting constituents or others in matters before federal agencies since campaign contributions are more common and arguably more acceptable and necessary monetary transfer from private individuals to members of congress than are outright gifts some of the more common but difficult questions in this area concern the receipt acceptance or solicitation of campaign contributions from those whom the member or his or her staff has assisted in matters before federal agencies in addition to statutory and rule restrictions relating to such things as the receipt of payments or gifts in return for representational activity or concerning members or staffs own personal interest in matter there are also general ethical considerations and guidelines which are concerned with the prevention of undue or improper influence by those in the legislative branch over the duties and functions of executive officers and employees separate from the issue of compensation or reward these considerations and guidelines are based in some respects on the separation of powers doctrine as well as on the notions of due process and fairness in administrative proceedings and the issues of the use or abuse of political influence over matters which are expected to be based substantially on competitive merit principles or which are to be decided strictly on particular statutory or regulatory criteria 175 executive or administrative decisions on some matters such as certain federal contracts or hiring in the civil service are often expressly required to be made on competitive merit basis and may be expressly required not to be made on the basis of political affiliation or influence

criminal penalties for any public official who corruptly seeks accepts or agrees to receive anything of value personally or for any other person or entity in return for being influenced in the performance of any official act 176 within the bribery statute is also the socalled illegal gratuities clause discussed below which penalizes public official who other than as provided by law agrees to accept anything of value personally for or because of any official act performed or to be performed 177 the bribery provision of federal law requires in the first place that anything of value be corruptly sought or received in return for being influenced in an official act the term anything of value is interpreted broadly and could include cash gifts discounts or even campaign contributions

gifts bequests or contributions which are sought not only for oneself as is an illegal gratuity but also things of value which are sought for third parties that is for any other person or entity as noted in the legislative history of this provision this subsection also forbids an attempt to influence public official by an offer or promise of something of value which will be to the advantage of somebody else in whose wellbeing he may be interested179 contributions of funds or things of value to third parties and other entities such as to campaign committees or to charitable foundations may thus be covered by the statute when the other elements of the law are satisfied180 the operative crux of the bribery statute specifically requires that the thing of value be corruptly received or sought by the public official in return for being influenced in the performance of an official act the central element of intent which is characteristic of bribe is thus corrupt or wrongful 181 bargain or agreement often described as some express or implied quid pro quo that is corrupt or wrongful understanding or agreement to do something in return for something else182 for bribe to occur the bribe must be shown to be the prime mover or producer of the official act performed or promised to be performed183 general contributions donations or payments to causes entities or to other persons or socalled goodwill payments which are given to create favorable atmosphere or feeling of gratitude in the recipient or with some generalized hope or expectation of ultimate benefit on the part of the donor but which are not given nor received in the context of any express or implied agreement to perform some official act that is without specific quid pro quo are not considered bribes under the statute 184 g344g495g561g11g149g149g142g144g138g149g561g9g155g138g157g158g146g157g146g142g156g561 within the federal bribery statute is the socalled illegal gratuities clause at 18 usc 201c this provision has been found to be lesser included offense of bribe185 and does not require corrupt intent for violation the different intent elements for an illegal gratuity that is the absence of required corrupt intent and the absence of need to show an intent to influence or be influenced are among the principal distinctions between bribe and an illegal gratuity 179 hr rpt 748 supra at 18

that public official receive or seek something of value other than as provided by law personally or for himself186 for or because of an official act done or to be done by him there does not have to be an express quid pro quo or corrupt bargain for an illegal gratuity187 but the thing of value must be received for the official and must be for or because of an official act done or to be done that is connected in some way to some official duty or function an illegal gratuity may be received even after an official act is performed as thank you or in appreciation for doing an act that would have been done in any event uninfluenced by the gratuity while bribe on the other hand must be shown to be the prime mover influencing the act although specific wrongful bargain or corrupt intent in receiving an illegal gratuity need be shown there is criminal intent required of an illegal gratuity which would distinguish this wrongful receipt of payment from mere gift unre lated to any official act or from such things as lawful campaign contributions given to an elected public official because of his stand vote or position on an issue the intent has been described by one court as the knowledge that one is being compensated or rewarded for particular official act or acts under the gratuity section otherwise than as provided by law for or because of any official act carries the concept of the offici act being done anyway but the payment only being made because of specifically identified act and with certain guilty knowledge best defined by the supreme court itself ie with knowledge that the donor was paying him compensation for an official act evidence of the members knowledge of the alleged bribers illicit reasons for paying the money is sufficient 188 while some cases in the circuits had gone so far as to find that specific official act need not be contemplated or identified for payment or compensation to constitute an illegal gratuity as long as payments were given to recipient who is in position to use his authority in manner which could affect the gift giver189 the supreme court in sundiamond in 1999 clarified that such socalled status gifts unconnected to any identified official act were not violation of the illegal gratuities provision190 in addition to the intent requirement under the illegal gratuities clause it must be shown that the compensation received by the public official was received personally or as stated in the earlier version of the law for himself if things of value are directed to independent third parties or entities such payments might not be considered to have been received or sought with the requisite intent to compensate the public official personally for his acts because they were not received by the official for himself or personally but rather by another entity or person 191 186 the statute was amended in 1986 pl 99646 46fg 100 stat 36013604 november 10 1986 to provide technical amendments to the criminal code including changing the terms for himself to personally there is indication of an intent to change the substance of the elements of the offense and therefore in this report the terms

but the compensation for them was not it was alleged that on numerous occasions may telephoned called personally or wrote officials of the war department in respect to these matter in which the garssons were interested and brought his official prestige and influence to bear upon those officers in order to promote the interests of the garssons if the money was received by may as compensation for acts done by him for the garssons it is immaterial that those acts were patriotic legitimate and within the scope of his official duties as congressman if judge receives payment from party for rendering correct decision he is nevertheless guilty of criminal act in receiving bribe so if congressman receives compensation for services rendered by him to person in relation to any matter in which the united states is interested before any government department he is guilty of violating the statute even though the service rendered was proper act on his part congressman cannot legally receive compensation from private person for doing his duty in respect to something in which that person and the united states have interests the gist of the offense is the receipt of compensation not the nature of the act done by the recipient in consequence thereof 195 although similar in nature and necessary proof to the illegal gratuities clause the statute is not necessarily duplicative of the illegal gratuities provision because the services rendered for which compensation may not be accepted under 203 need not be within the official duties of the officer or employee accepting such compensation as it must be for the illegal gratuities clause 192 united states v evans 572 f2d 455 480 5th cir 1978 cert denied 439 us 870 1978 193 united states v johnson 419 f2d 56 60 4th cir 1969

wider range of representational activities for private parties than would the illegal gratuities clause furthermore the statute bars an officer or employee from sharing in or receiving compensation

federal law commonly known as the hobbs act which prohibits the interference with commerce by way of extortion defined as the obtaining of propert from another with his consent induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force violence or fear or under color of official right 197 demands by elected public officials on private citizens for payments such as for campaign contributions even when the payments are to be made to third parties such as campaign committees may fall within the extortion provisions when there is some wrongful use of ones official position to induce or coerce the contribution as stated by one court the hobbs act would penalize those who under the guise of requestin g donations demand money in return for some act of official grace 198 federal courts have noted that the crime of extortion and the crime of bribery under federal law are really different sides of the same coin and that the intent requirements of the two federal offenses are parallel199 that is under the extortion provisions of the hobbs act there is generally with respect to such things as campaign contributions which have facial legitimacy need to demonstrate quid pro quo wrongful bargain or understanding that the campaign contribution solicited is exchanged for an official act requested or desired200

between two or more people to wrongfully exert influence upon an agency of the government might arguably sustain theory of violation of 18 usc 371 conspiracy to defraud the united states the conspiracy statute is quite broad in its application and could cover schemes to defraud the united states even when the object is not to defraud the united states out of money or property but rather to defraud the united states out of the proper and impartial duties it should expect from its officers and employees or which interferes with the proper functioning of an agency as noted by the supreme court conspiracy to defraud the united states does not necessarily require showing that the government was cheated out of money or property nor does it necessarily require that an illegal act be done to conspire to defraud the united states also means to interfere with or obstruct one of its lawful governmental functions by deceit craft or trickery or at least by means that are dishonest it is not necessary that the government shall be subjected to property or pecuniary loss by the fraud but only that its legitimate official action and purpose shall be defeated by 196 united states v

indictment charged that the defendants had misused the office and influence of the speaker of the house and had pressured various federal agencies and their employees concerning certain matters pending before the agency the court discussed the activities in which the defendants were alleged to have been involved paragraph 4 of the indictment says it was part of the conspiracy that voloshen would and did accept fees from various persons with matters pending before federal departments and agencies to exert the influence of the office of the speaker of the house to said agencies on behalf of said persons b that voloshen would and did use the offices telephone secretarial staff and goodwill of the speaker c that both defendants would agree to have sweig by various means express the

visits by both defendants to express the interest of the office of the speaker of the house in said matters pending before said agencies 205 although v oloshen was said to have received fees for his representations sweig the congressional employee was not alleged to have done so nevertheless the court sustained the indictment against sweig the fact that sweig is not alleged to have taken money or other things for his part in the alleged conspiracy does not justify dismissal of count one for facial insufficiency it may be doubted whether jury would or could be permitted to convict unless it found evidence to show for each alleged conspirator some meaningful stake in the enterprise but the interest need not have been monetary or material at all citations omitted 206 nathan v oloshen pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and three counts of perjury martin sweig who unlike v oloshen was actually in the employ of the office of the speaker and was not alleged to have accepted fees was acquitted by the jury on the influence peddling conspiracy charges but was found guilty on one charge of perjury207 as reported by the press in 1970 the verdict was personal triumph for defense counsel smith who argued that sweigs efforts in contacting federal agencies were customary practice on capitol hill and not unlawful even if the jurors might find the practice unfair208 earlier the press had quoted sweigs defense attorney concerning this argument relevant to the practice and ethics of congressional intervention on behalf of individuals before federal agencies congress has never made criminal the acts alleged against sweig says smith it would be presumptuous in the extreme and in clear violation of constitutional separation of powers for the judiciary to impose standards of conduct on legislative employees when the congress has declined to do so 209 in united states v burgin210 the court found that the count of conspiracy to defraud the government

agent of the united states by public official having financial quid pro quo interest in federally financed contract which amounted to an obstruction of lawful governmental function212 the courts finding agreed with the governments charge that the meaning of defraud includes any scheme of influence peddling whereby public official receives remuneration for the exertion of influence upon other officials213 the underlying motive or indirect financial interest in performing or influencing an official act affecting an agency decision might thus be relevant to conspiracy to defraud charge and could arguably provide the wrongful nature of the actions to influence federal agency decisions if such actions are motivated by factors other than the general public interest which one is elected to serve in conflict of interest case united states v podell 214 the court noted the principle of breach of trust by member of congress when the member sheds the duty of disinterested advocacy owed the government and his constituents in favor of championing private interests potentially inconsistent with this charge215 this wrongful breach of trust may arguably exist even when the means in conducting such intervention and exercising such influence are not in themselves improper or wrongful if the motivation is improper

and difficult issues in relation to interventions is the one concerning any connection nexus or linkage between official interventions and the making promising or solicitation of campaign contributions from those persons for whom such interventions were made campaign contributions unlike personal gifts and favors to officials are necessary and encouraged in our system of government where campaigns to congressional office are privately financed and thus have facial legitimacy that other transfers of things of value to members may not have the ethical inferences that might be raised concerning unrestricted personal gifts or entertainment provided to legislator might not be relevant in the case of congressional campaign contributions which are legitimate acceptable and necessary economic and monetary transfers to members of congress216 both the house and senate ethics committees thus note that it is perfectly acceptable and often necessary for members of congress to

certainly campaign contributions whether of soft money or regulated hard money could be the thing of value in bribe and can be implicated in bribery scheme if the other elements of the crime of bribery are present 218 however for bribe to be present in the case of campaign contributions there must be shown specific quid pro quo that is corrupt agreement or understanding between the parties that the public official will do some specific official act in return for the receipt of certain valuable cons ideration when such corrupt agreement exists eg i will intervene in this matter in return for your providing campaign contribution to my political committee there exists the requisite ement of being influenced to do the act in return for the campaign contribution219 when there is only campaign contribution and subsequent official act favorable to the donor or an official intervention with an agency and later campaign contribution but evidence of such an agreement directly linking the motivation for the official act to the contribution then there is bribe this is why the supreme court has noted that bribery is among the least subtle and most blatant forms of public corruption220 as to campaign contributions generally the courts have noted that politician who knows the identity and business interests of his campaign contributors is ever completely devoid of knowledge as to the inspiration behind the donation221 while campaign contributions can be bribes where there exists corrupt bargain quid pro quo arrangement campaign contributions given to candidate or official merely as support or in appreciation or thank you for certain official acts positions or votes taken as is the case for many or most campaign contributions are not considered to be bribes the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in united states v anderson supra for example where conviction of lobbyist was upheld for bribing senator with campaign contributions to

contributions donations or payments to causes entities or to other persons sometimes called goodwill payments which are given merely to create favorable atmosphere or feeling of gratitude in the recipient or with some generalized hope or expectation of ultimate benefit on the part of the donor but which are not given nor received in the context of any express or implied agreement and are therefore not considered bribes under the statute223 political contributions to entities such as candidates political campaign committee do not in themselves constitute bribes even though many contributors hope that the official will act favorably because of their contributions224 court of appeals in united states v allen interpreting bribery statute being used as predicate offense for rico charge explained as follows accepting campaign contribution does not eq ual taking bribe unless the payment is made in exchange for an explicit promise to perform or not perform an official act vague expectations of some future benefit should not be sufficient to make payment bribe 225 the concept of the lack of corrupt agreement generally in campaign contributions as distinguished from bribes was discussed in terms of reciprocity and obligation by judge john t noonan jr in his work entitled bribes discussing what he calls donations of democracy judge noonan raises the issue of the differences between such contributions and bribes and later in his work attempts to answer the question raised normally at any rate money is given to an officeseeker whose views on important issues coincide with the givers the money is given with the hope expectation purpose that particular views will be translated into particular votes tacit reciprocity exists how is money given candidate different from bribe campaign contributions are imperfect gifts because they are usually not set in context of personal relations they are intended to expre ss an identification with cause they are not wholly the recipients their purpose is restricted they are given in response to work done or expected to be done they do not express or create overriding oblig ations that is there is absolute obligation on the part of the contributor to recognize past work by the candidate and there is absolute obligation on the part of the candidate to do the work the contributor expects absence of absolute obligation creates one difference between contributions and bribes 226 it has been theorized that there may be some incidental reciprocity expected between donor and recipient in our political process legislators in congress unlike judges have specific constituency which they represent and on whom in return they rely for the donation of funds to their campaigns judge noonan argued that to some extent campaign contributions or at least large ones may be kind of access payment to our representative which is expressly permitted in practice in our system of private funding of campaigns for

access payments im not paying for my congressmans vote the large contributor will say i simply want to be sure he will listen to my side of the case the access payment in fact and function if not in hairsplitting theory is payment to establish reciprocity the access buyer is paying not only for attention but for favorable attention the payment is close to what would be called bribe if made to judge but access to and favorable attention by legislator has not generally been regarded in the same way as an approach to judge the hypotheticals show that legislator is not in the position of judge the judges office is modeled on the paradigm of the transcendent judge of the bible and sharp line distinguishes him from the litigants before him the legislator on the contrary is his constituents representative certain identity of interest is expected to exist between constituent and legislator given the acceptance of this mutuality of purpose between contributor and legislator the prevailing assumption in america has been that campaign contributions normally fall in the range of cases where specific votes are not being bought at times campaign contribution has been code word used as flimsy cover for payment intended to enrich an official personally in exchange for an official act benefitting the payor these cases have not disturbed the normal assumption that campaign contribution is different from bribe 227 that there may be some tacit reciprocity particularly concerning accessto an elected official by large contributor has not as yet been considered sufficient to satisfy the corrupt bargain or agreement required for bribe in part because mere access to that is meeting with an individual is not necessarily considered an official act performed or agreed to be performed by the elected representative 228

although for an illegal gratuity unlike bribe specific illegal bargain or corrupt intent need be shown there is criminal intent required of an illegal gratuity which would distinguish this wrongful receipt of payment from lawful campaign contribution given to member of congress even given because of the members acts such as intervention in an agency matter on behalf of donor as noted by the court in brewster every campaign contribution is given to an elected public official probably because the giver supports the acts done or to be done by the elected official229 the criminal intent required for an illegal gratuity as stated by the court however is knowing and willful receipt of payment as compensation other than as provided by law such as ones salary for doing an official act

campaign contributors is ever completely devoid of knowledge as to the inspiration behind the donation there must be more specific knowledge of definite official act for which the contributor intends to compensate before an officials action crosses the line between guilt and innocence under the gratuity section otherwise than as provided by law for or because of any official act carries the concept of the offici act being done anyway but the payment only being made because of specifically identified act and with certain guilty knowledge best defined by the supreme court itself ie with knowledge that the donor was paying him compensation for an official act evidence of the members knowledge of the alleged bribers illicit reasons for paying the money is sufficient 230 in addition to providing evidence of the guilty knowledge that public official had of being compensated for an official act it must be shown that the compensation received by the public official was received personally or for himself even if things of value such as contributions were arguably sought and received with the requisite guilty knowledge that they were given for or because of an act to be done or which had been done by the member if they were directed to lawful campaign committee even representatives or senators principal campaign committee or another independent entity such as charitable organization such payments might not be considered to have been received or sought with the requisite intent to compensate the member personally for his acts because they were not received for himself or personally but rather for another entity or person 231 if campaign contributions for federal elections are the thing of value received therefore it may then be difficult to satisfy this element of the offense that the thing of value was received by the official for himself or for the official personally under federal law all candidates for congress must have principal campaign committee to which campaign contributions are given and from which they are expended under authority of their treasurer for campaign or other designated purposes 232 and candidates and members of congress may not convert campaign contributions to their own personal use under statute and congressional rule233 thus even contributions to congressmancandidates own personal campaign committee would arguably as general matter not be considered contributions to the individual membercandidate for himself or to him or her personally and thus would not come within the illegal gratuities provision in the brewster case the court there found that the contributions were however given by lobbyist to sham committee which was merely the alter ego of the senator which did not file public reports nor keep records such as other political committees under the federal law at that time the old federal corrupt practices act and from which the senator freely drew funds for his own personal use 234 as such these illegal gratuity payments were distinguishable from 230 united states v brewster supra at 81 82 quoting from earlier supreme court decision in united states v brewster 408 us 501 527 1972 231 united states v

official acts done or to be done by member were in fact used or expended in manner to financially enrich or financially benefit the member personally then it might be argued that such funds were received for himself contributions to committee or any third party therefore which are used for example to pay for personal living expenses of member ones personal car or other personal expenses such

the supreme court has found that elected officials who ask for bona fide campaign contributions only violate the hobbs act extortion law when there is evidence of specific quid pro quo similar to the bribery statute the court noted in mccormick v united states 237 that the mere nearness in time of official acts by recipient public official and campaign contributions from the beneficiaries of those acts that is shortly before or after campaign contributions are solicited and received from those beneficiaries does not evidence extortion under the law and is an unrealistic assessment of the requirements of the crime particularly in light of how election campaigns are financed by private contributions and expenditures 238 rather the court found that the statute would be violated by request from an elected official to member of the public for voluntary campaign contribution only if the payments are made in return for an explicit promise or undertaking by the official to perform or not to perform an official act where the official asserts that his official conduct will be controlled by the terms of the promise or undertaking 239 the supreme court in mccormick explained serving constituents and supporting legislation that will benefit the district and individuals and groups therein is the everyday business of legislator it is also true that campaigns must be run and financed money is constantly being solicited on behalf of candidates who run on platforms and who claim support on the basis of their views and what they intend to do or have done whatever ethical considerations and appearances may indicate to hold that legislators commit the federal crime of extortion when they act for the benefit of constituents or support legislation furthering the interests of some of their constituents shortly before or after campaign contributions are solicited and received from those beneficiaries is an unreal assessment of what congress could have meant by making it crime to obtain property from another with his consent under color of official right to hold otherwise would open to prosecution not only conduct that has long been thought to be well within the law but also conduct that in very real sense is unavoidable so long as 235 to the contrary however public officials acceptance of thing of value unrelated to the performance of any official act and all

from an official or the officials campaign with the mere hope or expectation that one might be treated favorably in the future because of ones generosity and support in making such campaign contributions does not provide the necessary quid pro quo or corrupt character for an extortion charge the explicitness requirement serves to distinguish between contributions that are given or received with the anticipation of official action and contributions that are given or r eceived in exchange for promise of official action when contributor and an official clearly understand the terms of bargain to exchange official action for money they have moved beyond anticipation and into an arrangement that the hobbs act forbids 241

disclosed to the department of justice and that the payments were not bona fide campaign contributions or legal fees but were made simply to buy the congressman the bulk of the evidence submitted as

both the house committee on standards of official conduct and the senate select committee on ethics have warned members and staff about the appearances of impropriety that may occur or be drawn from certain linking of campaign contributions with offers or efforts to assist constituents with matters before federal agencies and departments regardless of whether such conduct rises to the level of federal criminal offense244 the senate rules now specifically provide that the decision to provide assistance to petitioners may not be made on the basis of contributions or services or promises of contributions or services to the members political campaigns or to other organizations in which the member has political personal or financial interest245 in its report on an investigation of members interventions with an agency on behalf of particular campaign contributor colloquiall known as the keating five investigation the select committee on ethics explained because senators occupy position of trust every senator always must endeavor to avoid appearance that the senator the nate or the governmental process may be influenced by campaign contributions or other benefits provided by those with significant legislative or governmental interests nonetheless if an individual or organization has contributed to senators campaigns or causes but has case which the senator reasonably believes he or she is obliged to press because it is in the public interest or the cause of justice or equity to do so then the senators obligation is to pursue that case in such instances the senator must be mindful of the appearance that may be created and take special care to try to prevent harm to the publics trust in the senator and the senate this does not mean however that member or employee is required to determine if one is contributor before providing assistance 246 the house committee on standards of official conduct has similarly explained that members should avoid appearances of linking contributions to actions but that this could not mean that members are prohibited from assisting their supporters like any other constituent based on the merits of the matter 243 the conspiracy counts were ultimately dismissed on sp eech or debate clause gr ounds b ecause the charges were in part connected with the motivations of johnson making sp eech favorable to the savings and

considerations such as political support party affiliation or campaign contributions should not affect either the decision of member to provide assistance or the quality of help that is given while member should not discriminate in favor of political supporters neither need he or she discriminate against them247 concerning the appearances in the receipt of campaign contributions from one for whom the member has interceded before federal agency the late senator paul douglas in his work ethics in government suggested caution specifically as to the receipt of such campaign contributions it is probably not wrong for the campaign managers of legislator before an election to request contributions from those for whom the legislator has done appreciable favors but this should never be presented as payment for the services rendered moreover the possibility of such contribution should never be suggested by the legislator or his staff at the time the favor is done furthermore decent interval of time should be allowed to lapse so that neither party will feel there is close connection between the two acts finally not the slightest pressure should be put upon the recipients of the favors in regard to the campaign it should be clearly understood that any gift they make is voluntary and there w ill be question of reprisals or lack of future help by the legislator if the gift is withheld in other words any contribution should not be quid pro quo but rather wholly voluntary offering based upon personal friendship and belief in the effectiveness of the legislator sharpened perhaps by individual experience 248 providing office management and workload systems and mechanisms whereby constituent requests for intervention assistance are routinely and consistently evaluated on the merits of the matter independently of campaign contributions or support from the requesting individual or entity could provide protection from appearances that decisions are based on campaign support considerations this may involve establishing certain criteria for authorizing interventions or assistance including prioritizing decisions on whether or not to intervene based on such factors as the strength of the constituents case the issues of justice and equity involved the type or level of intervention required consistency with regular office practices and the importance of the underlying issues to the district state or the nation the senate select committee on ethics set out several possible considerations and suggestions for offices to take into account in the case of requested interventions the merits of the constituents case the continuing viability of the constituents claim if the constituents claim initially appeared to have merit has the senator acted despite facts or circumstances that later undermined the merits of that claim the kind of agency involved and the nature of its proceedings is the agency performing in quasijudicial adjudicative or enforcement function if the senator or staff members knows that an individual is contributor the following issues should also be considered if the senator or staff member does not know if an individual is contributor he or she is not re quired or encouraged to find out most senate 247 house ethics manual supra at 250 248 douglas ethics in government supra at 8990

issues and concerns for number of years because of the potential for subtle influence of dependency upon and favoritism towards ones private benefactors 250 gifts to members and employees of both houses of congress are now regulated by both statute and internal house and senate rules federal law provides the basic prohibition that an officer or employee of the federal government may not receive any gift from certain prohibited sources that is those doing business with seeking some official action from or who are regulated by the agency or department of the official or those whose interests may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the officers official governmental duties 251 the statute notes that each supervisory ethics office may make rules and regulations for the receipt of gifts by the employees and officers under their jurisdiction carving out certain exceptions and circumstances252 under this provision as well as by virtue of congress constitutional rulemaking authority each house of congress has promulgated detailed rules and regulations for the acceptance of gifts when discussing gifts and the gifts rules it should be noted that gift may be distinguished from more sinister rewards remunerations or monetary transfers things of value presents items or tokens of appreciation received by members and congressional staff employees

it261 precedents exist which suggest that concurrent resolution technically expires at the end of that congress262 the code of ethics for government service was expres sly not intended by congress as legislation establishing new or different ethical standards in government nor creating new enforceable laws but rather as means of expressing existing ethical principles263 however the ethical standards in the code have been generally recognized as continuing guidance and principles for both elected and appointed officials in the government the rules of procedure of the senate select committee on ethics revised 1999 specifically note in part iii that one of the sources of the subject matter jurisdiction of the select committee is the code of ethics for government service264 the house of representatives has expressly recognized the terms of the code as continuing ethical standards and has used the provisions of the code of ethics as the basis for disciplinary charges and actions against members 265 although the senate has apparently never done so paragraph 5 of the code of ethics was intended substantially as gift rule barring the receipt of gifts favors and benefits from those persons and in those situations where it might be deemed to affect or influence the performance of ones official duties266 as noted this rule has never been specifically applied in senate disciplinary ruling nor interpreted in the senate but has been applied to certain fact situations involving gifts and favors in the house of representatives there is specific indication whether the provision if considered an actionable standard of conduct would go beyond current congressional rules on receipt of compensation for influence improperly exerted or the current gifts rules of the house or senate or apply to conduct at all in connection with such things as lawful campaign contributions it is possible to argue however that the terms benefit or favor in the code of ethics could go beyond and be broader than either the terms gifts or compensation in congressional rules 267 under this ethical standard it might not be required that there be any specific or provable connection or linkage between the continued binding or of legal effect 261 deschler brown procedure in the ushouse of representatives chapter 24 section 13 1982 262 hinds precedents of the house of

some of the more common questions in the area of constituent service arise when constituent grateful for assistance of members staff with such things as lost or missing social security checks veterans benefits that stop unexplainedly or myriad other problems with the federal bureaucracy send as thank you for such help small item purchased or made by the constituent the problem with the receipt of these small gifts is not the house or senate gifts rules which as noted above specifically exempt inexpensive items anything under 50 in value but rather that such items are thing of value that are accepted because of an official act performed by the staffer that is inquiries followups or other intervention into administrative matters in federal agency as such these items may implicate and technically satisfy the elements of the illegal gratuities clause of the bribery statute 269 the illegal gratuities provision of federal law has minimis exception expressly provided within the statute therefore items such as boxes of candy flowers or homemade goods while often perishable and inexpensive have some apparent value even if only minimis and may therefore still generally be considered anything of value as used in the federal illegal gratuities provision 270 such things of value if accepted by congressional staff for themselves with the knowledge that they are being rewarded or thanked for particular official act performed or to be performed may under close reading of the illegal gratuities clause involve technical violation of that provision since the statute itself has express minimis exception the under50 exception for gifts in the house and senate rules may not necessarily create an absolute safe harbor under the federal criminal illegal gratuities law for all tokens of appreciation received under that amount when such presents are connected to that is are for or because of an official act there are however indications that the department of justice would recognize reasonable permitted practices which are expressly provided in conduct rules and regulations of federal agency and which may include reasonable minimis exceptions to prohibitions on the receipt by federal officials of certain things of value from the public in the executive branch of government for example the office of government ethics has promulgated in consultation with the attorney general 271 standards of conduct regulations for executive branch employees which expressly provide for minimis exception to the executive branch gift prohibitions for gifts of 20 or less272 when such rules and exceptions are followed the regulations expressly provide that the receipt of things of value will not constitute an illegal gratuity under 18 usc 201c273 the 268 see for example

this safe harbor extends even to minimis things of value other than cash or securities given in appreciation or gratitude for an act within the scope of ones official duties such as for example when an employee of the defense mapping agency is invited by private organization to speak about his agencys role in the evolution of missile technology and receives token of appreciation from such group for that presentation274 similarly the house committee on standards of official conduct has explained that although they are not responsible for the enforcement of the criminal illegal gratuities law they consider such inexpensive tokens of appreciation in the form of perishable items from constituents to be outside of the illegal gratuities law when such items are physically placed in the office to be shared with staff and office visitors275 the committee stated while responsibility for enforcing this statute rests with the justice department in the view of this committee these provisions do not extend to token gifts of appreciation or goodwill intended as courtesy and consisting of either perishable items eg candy or flowers that the member or employee shares with staff and constituents or donates to charity or decorative items that are displayed in the office or donated to charity 276 the senate select committee on ethics has given similar advice with respect to perishable items and the gifts rule277 g5g495g561g18g142g155g156g152g151g138g149g561g8g146g151g138g151g140g146g138g149g561g11g151g157g142g155g142g156g157g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g15g138g157g157g142g155g561 there is now congressional rule similar in both the house and the senate that expressly prohibits staff employees who are required to file annual personal financial disclosure reports from participating in an agency interventi on into any nonlegislative matter affecting non governmental person or entity in which that employee has significant financial interest 278 this restriction can be waived in writing by the employing member of congress when the staff employees participation is deemed necessary even without this express prohibition and even though the prohibition does not apply expressly to members of congress all members and employees are under similar ethical rules and guidelines which establish what might be considered general conflict of interest rule or continued performance of an official act 274 5 cfr 2635204 example 2 the employee may accept gift of framed map with market value of 18 or book with market value of 15 but not both given in appreciation for his presentation dealing with official agency matters 275 it is possible that employing such items for office use transforms personal gifts into ones with arguably quasi public purposes 276 house committee on standards of official

to allow benefits or compensation to accrue to himself or herself or to his or her beneficial interest by virtue of influence improperly exerted from his position in congress279 this rule would appear to require the showing of some degree of connection or linkage between compensation or financial rewards on the one hand and the exertion of influence by member or employee on the other hand in the senate although the rule expressly covers only the receipt of compensation for influence improperly exerted the provision as adopted by the senate was not intended to be read in narrow legalistic manner but rather should be read as broad prohibition against members officers and employees deriving financial benefit directly or indirectly from the use of their official position 280 as instructed by the senate report on this measure although the receipt of compensation for certain official duties such as intervention before an agency may be also covered by the federal bribery statute 18 usc 201 203 the senate rule should be read to cover situations not covered by the bribery statute 281 the senate select committee on ethics found that senators offer to use his official influence to obtain government contracts for business venture in which he had personal financial interest was violation of this provision of senate rule 37282 as noted the provision prohibits influence improperly exerted in connection with the receipt of such compensation it does not appear however that the rule was intended to be limited only to influence which would standing alone be consid ered improper or undue even without regard to the compensation received in connection with that influence nor does the rule appear to require either in the house or the senate further evidence that the means of the influence consisted of undue pressure threats or coercion of agency officials beyond mere intervention if the end result or motive was improper as stated in the senate report on the measure for example if senator or senate employee intervened with an executive agency for the purpose of influencing decision which would result in measurable personal financial gain to him the provisions of this paragraph would be violated 283 the rule in the senate was patterned after and is substantially identical to the rule of the house of representatives house rule 433284 the house rule was adopted in 1968 as part of the code of official conduct285 and was at that time seen substantially as measure to deal with the difficult conflict of interest issue that is rule establishing standard seeking to prevent conflicts of interest which would be reasonably meaningful and to some degree enforceable 286 the rule is concerned with the potentially improper use of official influence or of ones office to

conducted an investigation into the activities of then representative fernand j st germain concerning several allegations relating to his interests in financial institutions including an allegation that he improperly exerted influence for his personal benefit as chairman of the house committee on banking finance and urban affairs on the federal home loan bank board bank board in an effort to achieve and expedite conversion of florida federal to stock association and florida federals acquisition of first mutual savings association of pensacola florida first mutual 288 such allegations arguably implicated potential violation of house rule 433 the committee however could not find evidence which showed that the member had an improper motive for the agency intervention even though the actual intervention and influence exerted may not in itself have been undue excessive or improper the implication of the committees decision was that the committee would apparently have found improper influence or improper action if it could have proven an improper motive for the intervention the committee reported its conclusions the investigation established that in 1983 while representative st germain was chairman of the committee on banking finance and urban affairs which had regulatory oversight of federally insured savings and loan institutes and the federal home loan bank board bank board paul nelson banking committee staff member made telephone calls apparently on behalf of the congressman to richard pratt then chairman of the bank board mr nelsons stated purpose for the calls was to check on the status of the bank boards deliberations regarding florida federal savings loans application to convert from mutual to stock ownership financial institution there is evidence or claim by the congressman supporting contention that mr nelsons calls had constituency basis there is circumstantial evidence that the purpose of the calls might have been to expedite the bank boards processing of the conversion application in an effort to obtain approval during particular time frame while there is evidence that any such effort was successful or otherwise influenced the ultimate agency disposition the bank boards approval the calls were made during time when representative st germain was depositor at florida federal he stood to derive personal economic benefit from the ownership interest such deposit gave him his ownership interest gave him the option to purchase shares immediately upon conversion one could speculate that motive for him seeking expedited conversion would be that it could give him the opportunity to purchase stock at bargain price relative to the aftermarket for the stock conversions to stock institutions had resulted in substantial price increases after the initial offering in the then recent past however the committee firmly believes that speculation about motive is not evidence and there is direct evidence that the congressman had any such improper motive or for that matter caused mr nelson to make the calls in mid1983 the congressman did purchase 30000 worth of florida federal stock upon conversion he failed to report this as transaction in his 1983 financial disclosure statement 288 hrrpt 10046 100th cong 1st sess at 2 1987

avoid situations in which even an inference might be drawn suggesting improper action 289 it is possible that concealed personal financial interest in matter about which member or staff employee makes an intervention with federal agency could provide the grounds for finding that such contact and conduct created fraud against the united states in united states v gallup290 for example an employee of the depart ment of housing and urban development was charged with conspiracy to defraud the united states in influencing the granting of contract in which he had an undisclosed financial interest in violation of hud conflict of interest regulations the conspiracy count upheld in that case charged that the defendant and his brother inlaw with whom he shared finders fee for that contract had

and senate rule xxxvii on interventions and constituent service while recognizing members legitimate role in intervening in administrative matters prov ides that certain conduct could render the means of members intervention activity improper or an abuse of the representational role of member regardless of the issue of the receipt or existence of any compensation or financial benefits connected to ones intervention such problematic conduct may concern such things as threats made against administrators or promises of favors or benefits to such agency personnel the guidelines adopted or recognized by either house of congress with regard to such conduct during interventions are more general ethical considerations and guidelines of propriety concerning legislators proper or improper conduct towards regulators and respect for the due process of the administration of the law many of the general ethical considerations involved in the guidelines on conduct of member or his or staff in intervention in administrative matters were explored in the 1950s by senator paul douglas of illinois subcommittee of the senate labor and public welfare committee chaired by the late senator douglas issued committee print in 1951 entitled ethical standards in government 292 which made number of recommendations and proposals in the area of governmental ethics in discussing what was then called the problem of reference which the subcommittee recognized as an important function of member of congress the subcommittee 289 hrrpt 10046 supra at 4243 290 812 f2d 1271 10th cir 1987 291 812

apply to congressional intervention in administrative matters the subcommittee concluded that it is ethically permissible to recommend specific action on an administrative agency matter and even to argue at length for such result as long as the matter is argued on its merits and the means used in the intervention are not themselves inherently damaging to the administrative process there are number of ways in which the legislator may proceed in raising these matters he may simply introduce the constituent and ask fo r fair consideration if he wishes to be very correct he will also state that he is asking for nothing more than fair consideration on the merits of the case second procedure is to vouch for the applicant in some way this amounts to recommendation for the constituent although not necessarily of his request the third step is to recommend that favorable action be taken on the matter at issue this may be done indirectly as well as directly and may be simply stated or argued at length with supporting data and explanations it is this third procedure which gives rise to ethical problems legislators have at least two moral obligations in these matters of reference one is to make sure that they are seeking to push cases only on their merits it is always possible to make sure that there is personal economic interest which is involved but it is more difficult for legislator to draw the line between proper and improper personal interests which are essentially political in character that is legislator who is seeking support in pending election and elections are always pe nding may feel that the noble objective of reelecting stout defender of the public interests may justify his guiding the hand of justice just little in relatively minor matter second moral obligation is to make sure that the methods of intervening in administrative matters are not themselves so inherently damaging to the administrative process or to legislativeadministrative relations that they offset any public benefit that might be gained from any such legislative pressure 293 senator douglas in his later work and collection of lectures entitled ethics in government expressed general ethical principles in relation to congressional intervention into administrative matters which he propounded with the caveat that probably there can be fixed set of rules governing the relationships between legislators and administrators which will be perfectly satisfactory in all respects the ethical principles which senator douglas submitted for consideration included the following 1 legislator should not immediately conclude that his constituent is always right and the administrator is always wrong but as far as po ssible should try to find out the merits of each case and only make such representations as the situation permits 2 legislator should of course not accept any money for representing constituents or anyone else before government departments if legislator accepts money entertainment or valuable presents in return for his services he is using his public office in reality not for the common good but for private gain 293 ethical standards in government

house committee on standards of official conduct in advisory opinion 1 and as suggested for consideration by the late senator douglas came into play in the investigation of the former speaker of the house representative james c wright one of the charges investigated by the committee and its special counsel concerned the possible exercise of undue influence in dealing with officials of the federal home loan bank board 295 although there were several incidents of intervention and contacts between speaker wright and members of the bank board and although certain bank board members such as edwin gray felt that the speaker attempted to coerce them296 the house committee on standards of official conduct did not find reason to believe that the speaker exercised undue influence over the board as there was evidence of reprisal or threat to agency officials297 the special counsels report in the wright matter argued that undue influence could be evidenced by either the exercise of influence for improper ends or by the use of improper means298 the first intervention examined concerned meeting in congressman wrights office between edwin gray then bank board chairman several bank board staff and four members of congress from texas including representative wright the substance of the meeting was that the members of congress had heard of reports that bank board regulators were using heavy handed and gestapolike tactics against certain savings and loan banks in texas and the members present expressed and passed their concerns on to the bank board members they emphasized the poor economic conditions in texas and their belief that such conditions were only temporary representative wright had left the meeting early and the other congressmen stayed the special counsel found that the meeting between the congressmen and the bank board staff represented proper interaction 299 the second intervention and contact concerned inquiries and statements by representative wright to edwin gray about an individual hall and his financial institution and the conduct of representative of the bank board who the speaker felt was not as flexible or understanding as he should be the speaker asked chairman gray if there wasnt anything i gray could do about this300 gray testified that representative wright did not threaten him or use coercive terms but that because of the members position gray felt that he had to do something and believed that the congressman wanted the bank board to change its position regarding hall301 it further appears that representative wright may later have held up recapitalization bill 294 ethics in government supra at 88 89 90 295 committee resolution of preliminary inquiry june 9 1988 296 report of special counsel in the matter of speaker james c wright jr

boards treatment of hall specifically and of texas savings and loans in general302 although the special counsel argued that these actions may have constituted improper activity because merits of the case were argued in asking for reconsideration of an agency decision and because of the alleged use of holding legislation hostage to express the members displeasure the house committee on standards of official conduct as noted above did not issue even statement of alleged violations because of such activity and thus dropped all charges of undue influence concerning these contacts other activities and interventions included intercession on behalf of constituent who expressed complaint about the bank board and the congressmans expression to the board for his hope for improved regulatory conditions303 complaints from the congressman to edwin gray that friend and political fundraiser had been mistreated by bank board regulators that gray needed to meet with his friend personally to hear his story and that because of speaker wrights power gray decided to appoint an independent counsel to investigate the constituents treatment by the bank board304 that in expressing complaints to then chairman gray about over zealous regulators the congressman said that he had heard that certain regulators were homosexuals and had established ring of homosexual lawyers in texas and that the member asked if chairman gray could get rid of one regulator in particular305 representative wrights intervention directly with the chairman gray to ask for delay in closing of thrift institution in texas and asking gray to report back306 meeting initiated by bank board personnel and an alleged indirect request from representative wright to have another bank board litigator removed the house committee on standards of official conduct examining the activity of speaker wright concerning all of these interventions and contacts found undue influence or abuse of his official influence or position in his expressions of interest in agency regulatory matters the committee believed that some of the congressmans conduct may have been intemperate but that displeasure with the personality and techniques of member in his expressions of interest in matter to an executive agency can not be used to interfere with or override the important duty of member to effectively represent persons and organizations having concern with the activities of executive agencies 307 specifically in dismissing these charges against speaker wright the committee found it is clear that under our constitutional form of government there is constant tension between the legislative and executive branches regarding the desires of legislators on the one hand and the actions of agencies on the other in carrying out their respective responsibilities 302 id at 235 303 special counsels report supra at 240 304 id at 240255 the special counsel argued that this intervention was improper because the

upon legislators expressions of interest jeopardizes the ability of members effectively to represent persons and organizations having concern with the activities of executive agencies accordingly while it may well be that representative wright was intemperate in his dealings with representatives of the federal home loan bank board the committee is not persuaded that there is reason to believe that he exercised undue influence in dealing with that agency in sum such finding cannot rest on pure inference or circumstance or for that matter on the technique and personality of the legislator but instead must be based on probative evidence that reprisal or threat to agency officials was made 308

years where congressional recommendations had actually been prohibited as part of the socalled hatch act revisions enacted in the 103 rd congress309 these amendments which were passed in 1993 and went into effect in february of 1994 had expressly prohibited member of congress from making recommendation on behalf of an applicant for federal employment to most positions in the federal government on any basis including the basis of ones political affiliation except that member may have provided statement which relates solely to the character and residence of the employee or applicant additionally the amended statute had prohibited an applicant or an employee from seeking or requesting from member of congress or from congressional employee any recommendation for employment or other personnel action other than the character reference described above however in 1996 congress amended the prohibitions on referrals and recommendations which had been in effect since 1994 and returned the state

executive branch from receiving and considering any recommendations from member of congress of an applicant for federal position in the competitive service except as to the character andor residency of the applicant but do not expressly prohibit member of congress from making such recommendations on any basis this language has in the past been interpre ted as actually anticipating that such referrals and recommendations will be made and as indicating that members are not necessarily prohibited from taking such action on behalf of applicants 311 current federal law continues to protect against potential political abuses in civil service hiring by prohibiting the consideration of political factors by appointing officials in referrals from members the general prohibition for anyone in the federal service to consider in recommendations or statements factors other than those that evaluate work performance ability qualifications and suitability312 and the express prohibition on discriminating in employment matters on the basis of political affiliation313 considering the statutory restraints on referrals the rules against the consideration of factors other than evaluation of work performance and suitability and the prohibitions on political influence in federal hiring the house committee on standards of official conduct has advised that with respect to competitive service employments if the member does not have personal knowledge of the applicants work ability or performance the letter of recommendation ma address only the applicants character or residence314 furthermore the committee notes that if member does not have personal knowledge of the applicants work ability or performance either through that constituents work for or with the members office then such recommendation for the competitive civil service should not be on official congressional letterhead stationery but rather on the members personal stationery315 with regard to letters of recommendations concerning positions in the competitive service the senate select committee on ethics has advised its members that members are now free to write letter on behalf of or relating to persons who is applying or under consideration for position or who is up for promotion in the executive branch and may include any information bearing on the suitability of the person for the position

senate guidance indicate that all of these activities should be based primarily on the concept of the overall public interest treating similarlysituated constituents equally and undertaking such actions irrespective of political contributions or other political considerations323 in communicating with agencies and advocating position and outcome members and staff are advised to address only the merits of matter and as in all communications the office may not use the direct or implied suggestion of either favoritism or reprisal for action taken by the agency contacted324 members are advised to assure that representations made on their behalf are accurate and conform to the members instructions325

regarding any informal interventions into or communications to court with respect to the merits of matters in the judicial process326 as general matter the separation of powers concept dictates that the authority over resolution of individual legal cases and challenges resides within the judicial branch of government and not the legislative branch327 furthermore it is intended under our system of government that this judicial br anch be composed of an independent judiciary which will in consideration of basic notions of due process and fairness make decisions on the facts before it grounded in the rule of law andor equity and not based upon political pressures partisan considerations or personal influences of those wielding authority in other branches of government328 more specifically there are provisions of law and rule which limit restrict and prohibit the receipt of ex parte communications by decision maker in an adjudicatory process and efforts to circumvent such rules may place judge or magi strate in an uncompromising ethical position and thus prove counterproductive to ones objective the general ethical standards of conduct for judges prohibit them from receiving or considering any ex parte communications on pending matter that is offtherecord or other informal communications from persons who are not parties to the legal proceeding in question the american bar associations model code of judicial conduct in provision which has been adopted by the judicial conference of the united states for federal judges provides at canon 3 that judge should except as

concerning pending or impending proceeding329 similar ethical obligations concerning the making or the receipt of ex parte communications attach to administrative law j udges or other administrative personnel in adjudicatory matters before federal agencies under the provisions of the administrative procedures act330 certain requests may of course be made from members of congress and members offices to the judiciary including seeking from clerk of the court information on the status of judicial matter and the request for information on the public docket furthermore while informal attempts at persuasion or influence of court or over judge are not deemed proper it is acceptable for member of congress who feels strongly about legal matter such as when the outcome of the matter may affect large numbers of his or her constituents or otherwise impact his or her state or district to seek to formally intervene in legal proceeding as party or to file brief amicus curiae friend of the court in matter on appeal 331 the senate select committee on ethics specifically advises as follows the general advice of the ethics committee concerning pending court actions is that senate offices should refrain from intervening in such legal actions unless the office becomes party to the suit or seeks leave of the court to intervene as amicus curiae until the matter has reached resolutio n in the courts the principle behind such advice is that the judicial system is the appropriate forum for the resolution of legal disputes and therefore the system should be allowed to function without interference from outside sources 332 similarly the house committee on standards of official conduct explains where member believes it necessary to attempt to affect the outcome in pending case he or she has variety of options member who has relevant information could provide it to partys counsel who could then file it with the court and notify all parties alternatively the member could seek to file an amicus curiae or friend of the court brief yet another option in an appropriate case might be to seek to intervene as formal party to the proceeding member could also make speech on the house floor or place statement in the congressional record as to the legislative intent behind the law member should refrain however from making an offthereco rd communication to the presiding judge as it could cause the judge to recuse him or herself from further consideration of the case where member does have personal knowledge about matter or party to proceeding the member may convey that inform ation to the court through regular channels in the proceeding eg by submitting answers to interrogatories being deposed or testifying in court members and employees should also be aware that special

contacting regulatory and administrative agencies or intervening into administrative matters by member of congress on behalf of constituents and others with interests affecting the members district or state is considered an important discretionary function of an elected representative for those whom he or she represents it has become fairly traditional role for members of congress to express concern for and to sometimes act as liaison or spokesman for their constituents to the unelected and arguably less responsive bureaucracy of the federal government in the process of such intervention it is expected that some tension between the desires of legislators and those in the executive branch will naturally exist in our constitutional form of government while it may be common discretionary practice for member to intervene with or contact an agency for constituent there may similar to any other official acts of members be several ethical issues that arise in such interventions in the first instance it is important to assure that nothing of value from private source is received in connection with in return for because of or as compensation for the members or the offices intervention campaign contributions are of particular concern in this area although outright bribes or extortion in relation to the receipt of campaign contributions and official interventions would require specific factual evidence of corruption and would cover only the most blatant forms of misconduct there are other more common and subtle ethical concerns concerning such contributions members have been advised to avoid any indications of connection or linkage between donations or solicitations of campaign funds to or for the member and the assistance provided by that member in light of the guidance opinions and rules in the house and senate on administrative intervention and campaign funds members may be advised to institute office practices and procedures which assure that requests for intervention are handled and evaluated in substantially similar manner for all constituents and that decisions whether to act on any particular request are made on the merits of the matter the strength of the constituents position and case the principles of fairness or justice that may be involved in the matter the overall public interest in the matter the consistency with past practices of the office and the consideration of the type of administrative proceeding involved and the type of intervention that would be necessary are all factors that may be involved in decisions on whether to intervene or not in event should decisions be based on whether or not constituent or other private petitioner has contributed to or assisted the members campaign and merely because one has contributed to the members campaign does not disqualify that person from representation by the member members and staff should also be aware that there is personal financial interest in the subject matter of the intervention as far as staff are concerned recusals or written waivers may be pursued in those instances 333 ethics manual for members officers and emplo yees of the us house of representatives supra

members offices are matters of ethical standards and guidelines expressed by the house and the senate the ethical guidance expressed on the subject of the methods of intervention is generally directed at assuring that member of congress does not attempt to exert undue influence upon and therefore cause an unfair or unjustified governme ntal decision or action by an agency through coercive activities such as threats of reprisal against or promises of rewards for federal regulators and administrators this does not mean that member or staff may not when appropriate express an opinion on policy matter argue matter on the merits or ask for consideration or reconsideration of an action or decision based on statutory regulatory or legal interpretative factors while an office should not attempt to intimidate an administrator it is obvious that some administrators and regulators are more thin skinned than others and members conduct will most likely be judged not on the subjective feelings of the administrator but on the more objective conduct of the member involved 334 in most of the cases of constituents asking for assistance contact or intervention consisting of more than status inquiry request to be kept informed of the process an introduction of the constituent to the agency andor request for fair and expeditious resolution of the issue will be sufficient to express and to alert the agency of the interest of the member and the members office in the matter g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561
