transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21pl 105206 expired on september 30 2003 the reauthorization debate was primarily characterized by two interrelated issues money and how that money would be distributed among the states the 108th congress came close to bill with surface transportation conference committee in place in the end however conferees were unable to reach agreement either among themselves or with the bush administration as to how large the sixyear reauthorization package would be in dolla r terms the conference was also unable to agree on solution to the long sta nding donordonee state funding distribution question with donor states insisting on 95 return on fuel tax revenues and donee states insisting that increased funding fo r donor states not come at their expense in the 109th congress the same issues thr eatened to undermine conference committee that began meeting in june 2005 this time however all parties found ways in which to compromise most importantly the administration allowed total funding in the bill to rise to 2864 billion for the sixyear aut horization period in actuality the act provides 2441 billion for th five years remaining before fy2009 this increase allowed the conferees to ultimately guarantee all states an eventual 92 rate of return an improve ment on the existing 905 ra while at the same time holding 27 states harmless meaning they w ill not receive less actual money than they have in the past with these key compromises in place many of the objections to the bill disappeared and the conference re port was agreed to on july 29 2005 in addition to money issues the act ddressed number of other issues these included the creation of new consolidated safety program enha nced environmental streamlining

legacy for users safetealu or safetea selected major provisions federal surface transporta tion programs are major component of national spending on transportation capital infrast ructure according to government accountability office gao report 46 of all us highway capital spending in fy2002 was attributable to fede ral funding likewise it is the availability of federal transit funding that has provided the possi bility of bus and rail transit projects in many communities during the last few decades structurally surface transportation legi slation normally c onsists of multiple separate legislative titles which can be viewed as the principal programs and their funding mechanism highways highway safety transit motor carrier safety research planning hazardous material s transportation rail and fi nance additional titles are sometimes included in reaut horization legislation that are often unrelated to transportation as is the case of certain tax provisions in safetea it should be pointed out that the term program has multiple meanings in discussion of federal surface transportation policy the larger federalaid highway program for example consists of number of separate programs such as the surface transportation program stp funds in the various programs are distributed on th basis of formulas known as apportioned programs in highway parl ance and on discretionary basis also referred to as the allocated prog rams in the highway program the majority of funding in the overall surface transportation bill and the vast majority of highway funding goes to the socalled core highway programs safetea increases the number of these core programs from five to six interstate maintenance im national highway system nhs surface transportation program stp bridge and bridge maintena nce congestion mitigation and air quality cmaq and the new highway safety improvement program hsip are all apportioned programs seventh progra m called the equ ity bonus ebwhich replaced the tea21 minimum guarantee prog ram is sometimes so referred to as core program most remaining highway funding goes to the allocated programs such as federal lands highways which are ostensibly under the control of the federal highway administration fhwa but in recent practice have been largely earmarked during the annua l appropriations process the structures of the highway safety re search and transit programs also include mix of formula and discretionary programs in the transit program for example about half of all funding is distributed directly to trans it operators by the urbanized area formula program and the nonurbanize d area formula program each of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33119crs2 major programs also includes planning envi ronmental and other elements that are major subjects of discussion durin g reauthorization debates major safetea provisions authorization period federal highway highway sa fety and transit programs are subject to periodic reauthorization prior to passage of sa fetea the most recent authorization was the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 pl 105278 which provided funds for the period fy1998 fy 2003 after october 1 2003 all federal surface transportation programs continued to operate on the basis of 11 short term extension acts although there have been numerous short term reauthorizations in the history of these programs there is consensus in the surface transportation community that longterm reauthorizations such as that afforded by tea21 better accommodate the longterm planning needs and construction horizons associated with the provision of highway and transit infrastructure reaut horization by shortterm extensions created great deal of uncertainty about the like lihood of future funding in the highway and transit community highway and transit interests at the state and local level and in the private sector have therefore we lcomed passage of safetea even though delays in its passage have converted it from sixyear bill to just over fouryear bill expiring in fy2009 surface transpor tation finance federal funding for surface transportation is closely linked to the revenue stream provided by the highway trust fund the trus t fund is in fact tw separate accounts highways and mass transit the primary revenue sources for these accounts are the 184 cent per gallon tax on gasoline and 244 cent per gallon tax on diesel fuel although there are other sources of reve nue for the trust fund these fuel taxes provide about 90 of the income to the funds of these amounts the transit account receives 286 cents per gallon and 01 cent pe r gallon is reserved for an unrelated leaking underground storage tank lust fund over the almost 50 year life of the trust fund there have been seve ral increases in the level of taxation the last increase in the fuel tax occurred in 1993 all of th funds were not actually deposited into the trust fund initially but were deposited in the treasury general funds for deficit reduction purposes until fy1998 for almost 50 years the trust fund has been reliable source of funding for surface transportation in fy2004 for exam ple the highway account received tax revenues of 31 billion while the mass transit account received 5 billion for most of its history the trust funds have collect ed more than has been expended relative to the size of the program defined by congress this situation has been changing in the last few years the fy2004 limitation on oblig ations was set at 336 billion and the fhwa total appropriation was 345 billion both amounts of which are higher than the revenues collected for the fiscal year for number of reasons however the trusthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33119crs3 1 recent events such as hurricanes katrina and rita the high price of oil and what some believe may be period of economic uncertainty are already raising questions about these forecasts it is now expected by some that new estimates by the department of the treasury and others will show trust fund revenue stream unable to fund all of the programs in safetea prior to fy2009 funds unexpended balance rema ins substantial but is d eclining because of this trend there is some uncertainty at the mo ment about the long term outlook for the financial health of the trust fund this is in spite of the fact that the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 passed in the closing days of the 108th congress provided the trust fund with additional future income by changing elements of federal gasohol taxation th changes could provide the trust fund with an additional 4 billion per year starting in fy2005 as mentioned earlier both the house nd senate had passed reauthorization legislation in the 2nd session of the 108th congress and conference committee was formed the conference committee congressional leadership especially in the house and the administration were unable to reach agreement about total program funding for the next reauthorization period this was largely because some members of congress backed level of project f unding larger than the bush administration was willing to support part of the admin istrations objection related to the above debate about the future health of the trust funds visavis the administrations adamant objection to raising fuel taxes either now or in the future some members of congress on the other hand had iden tified number of mechanisms including the now adopted gasohol changes other tax changes and rescissions that they felt would support larger program the ga sohol changes by themselves however would not have been sufficient to fund th program size desire d by many members conferees on safetea considered num ber of tax and other changes that would increase revenues to the trust fund and or offset additional highway and transit spending several of these provisions are included in the finance title of the act the revenue increases in this title are viewed as quite modest and derive mostly from cutting back on tax fraud and by transferri ng some treasury ge neral fund revenues associated with transportati on related activities to the tr ust fund it was believed at time of passage that the changes identifie d in safetea when combined with the changes in gasohol legislation enacted in 2004 and enhanced by expected economic growth would be sufficient to finance the 2864 billion program created by the act1 crs contacts john fischer and robert kirk trust fund budgetary treatment tea21 changed the way the highway trus t fund relates to th federal unified budget in two ways first by creating new budget categories and second by setting statutory limitations on obligations the act amended the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 to create two new budget categories highway and mass transit the act further amended the budget process by setting the limitation on obligations for each fiscal year from fy1999 to fy2003 in authorizing rather then appropriations legislation in addition tea21 provided mechanism revenue aligned budget aut hority raba to adjust these amounts in the highwayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33119crs4 account but not the transit account so as to correspond with increased or decreased receipts in highway generated revenues the provision also adjusts the highway program authorization level to correspond with this change it should be pointed out all of the above notwithstanding that nnual revenues and expend itures affecting the balances in the trust fund accounts remain part of the overall annual fe deral deficit calculation the net effect of the changes was to set predetermined level of funding for core highway and transit prog rams referred to in tea21 as discretionary spending guarantee these categories are separate d from the rest of the discretionary budget in way that prevents the use of funds assigned to these categories for any other purpose these so called firewalls were viewed in the tea21 context as guaranteed andor minimum levels of f unding for highway and transit programs additional funds above the fi rewall level could be made available for highway and transit programs through the annual appropriations process but for the most part this did not occur except in fy2003 safetea s retained this budget format largely unchanged guaranteed funding most of the debate about safetea wa s about money and its distribution at the end of the day saf etea provide s quite bit of additional money 2864 billion in guaranteed spending author ity for the sixyear period fy2004 fy2009 this is significant increase over the level in tea21 whic h provided 218 billion over the sixyear period fy1998 2003 dir ect comparison between the two bills however is difficult for number of reasons that are beyond the scope this report suffice it to say that safetea represents significant f unding increase for all federal surface transportation programs though not as much of an increase as many of the legislations orig inal authors had hoped for in reality safetea is fiveyear bill fy2004 is history and at time of passage only two months remained in fy2005 more useful representation of safetea therefore is that it provides just over 244 billion in guaranteed spending authority between fy2005 fy2009 as table 1 shows all major programs affected by the legislation receive significant new funding the exempt obligation category is provided for equity bonus nd emergency funding purposes and does not reflect program per see total annual sp ending increases occu r in each year and total spending in fy2009 is almost 23 higher than spending in fy2005 summary of funding for major programs nd activities can be found at the end of this report in appendix 1 even more deta iled programmatic in formation to the subprogram level can be found at http wwwfhwa dotgovsafetealu fundtableshtm the house version of wh at became safetea contained socalled re opener provision that would have require

intended to adjust annual highway program obliga tions to reflect changes in revenue in the highway trust fund the expectation was that this would provide for increases in obligational authority although the law did allow for re ductions in funding if trust fund revenues decreased in its first three years ra ba provided significan t additional spending authority in fy2003 however the raba computation called for program reduction congress choose through the ppropriations proce ss not to reduce spending and instead increased it as result of this experience there was push to change the way raba was calculated to make revenue swings less dramatic especially in the negative direction safetea changes how raba is calcula ted primarily by using two year calculation rather than the single year ca lled for in tea21 in addition it puts off raba calculations until fy2007 and reduces the likelihood of spending reductions by requiring that reductions occur so long as the unexpended balance in the highway trust fund exceeds 6 billion donordonee state remedies historically transportation policy battle lines have often formed along regional rather than partisan alignments the regional character of transportation policy is evident in the debate over the socalled quity of distribution of federal highway aid among the states since 1982 congre ss has included legislative provisions in every surface transportation reauthorizati on act to remedy these perceived funding distribution concerns through variety of minimum guarantee provisions for manyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33119crs6 years some states mostly southern as well as some mid western and western states have complained that they receive significantly less federal highway aid than their highway users pay in federal highwa taxes to the highway trust fund htf these states referred to as donor states have pressed fo r legislative remedies that would assure them higher share rateofreturn most recently 95 on their tax payments to the treasury donee states states that receive more federal highway aid than they pay in federal highway taxes have not opposed equity provisions per but have opposed any reduction in their existing shares the basic donor state argument is rela tively straightforward call for equity or fairness donor state advocates generally contend that for too many years they have been subsidizing the repair and improvement of donee state infrastructure especially the older highway infrastructure in the northeast most also argue that they are more road dependent and do not be nefit from federal transit spending to the same degree as some donee states southe rn and western donor states so argue that they are fast growth areas relative to most donee states and that consequently their needs are as great or greater finally they argue that with the completion of the interstate highway system there is valid rationale for the donordonee disparity donee state advocates argue that fairness should not be separated from needs they assert that the age of their highway infrastructure especially in the northeast the high cost of working on heavily congested urban roads and the limited financial resources in large sparsely populated western states ju stify their donee status they also argue that there are needs that are inherently federal rather than state and that national highway network cannot be based solely on state or regional boundaries donee states also argue that midwestern and southern states spend less local and state money on highways than donee states and chide them for pleading for federal funds when they are unwilling to up their own resources in broader sense the debate over quity remedies has implications for number of overarching issues an equity gu arantee of 95 rate of return could in the minds of some leave little room for addr essing other or additional transportation needs that are uniquely federal such as the federal lands highway program also the role of the federal government visavis the states comes into question as the minimum guarantee approaches 100 at wh at point does the federal role become so limited that converting the federal aid highway progra m to revenue sharing or block grant program make sense anothe r controversial issue is whether the mg should be broadened as some states ve proposed to incl ude federal transit administration programs the 109th congress faced difficult policy problem in resolving the seemingly contradictory goals of meeting donor stat demands for higher rateofreturn and donee state demands to be held harmless at time when the htf revenue base was expected to be insufficient to easily fund bot h goals part of the problem was that bill that simply reduced the shares of donee states to increase the shares of donor states would have had difficulty overcoming filibuster by donee states in the senate to construct minimum guarantee mg mechanism that could overcome this obstacle previous reauthorization bills had included hold harmless provisions that maintained certain base shares for all states this meant that part of the process of bringing donor state shares up to the mg percentage required increasing the overall federal highway program si ze usually by significant amount since donee statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33119crs7 funding could not be reduced in other wo rds providing equity remedies that keep both donor and donee states reasonably c ontent has been accomplished by giving more money to all states but giving even more to donor states to bring their shares up to designated per cent share 905 dur ing tea21 providing equity in this way has been very expensive in dollar rms the minimum guarantee program under tea21 in fact became the largest highway pr ogram in the end the constraints of limited funding availability and the practical politics of getting the surface transportation legislation through both houses of congress resulted in modest and gradual increase in the guaranteed rateofreturn to the states safeteas equity bonus innovation safetea replaces the entire tea21 mg program with an equity bonus program eb basically the individual program formulas will determine the initial pportionments and then the equity bonus funding will be dded to these levels to bring donor states up to their guaranteed rateofreturn levels the act directs the secretary of transportation to allocate to the states for each of the fiscal years 2005 through 2009 sufficient funds to ensure that each stat receives at least return of 905 for fy20052006 915 for fy2007 and 92 for fy20082009 on their estimated payments to the highway account of the htf the act keeps nearly all the programs subject to mg under tea21 im nhs stp cmaq hbrr recreational trails appalachian development highway system high priority projects and metropolitan planning subject to the equity provision as we ll as three new formula programs the coordinated border infrastructure program the safe routes to school program the highway safety improvement program and the existing railhighway grade crossing program the eb program also includes num ber of hold harmless provisions that provide that certain states will receive the greater of the annual percent return described above or their shar of total apportionments over the sixyear life of tea 21 to be held harmless the state must m eet one or more of the following criteria the state must have population density of less than 40 people per square mile and at least 125 of their total acreage must be under federal ju risdiction have population less than one million people have median household income less than 35000 have fatality rate on interstate highways in 2002 of greater than 10 per 100 million vehicle miles traveled or have an indexed state motor fuel excise tax rate that is more than 150 of the federal moto r fuel excise tax rate there are twenty seven states that qualify under these criteri alabama alaska arizona arkansas colorado delaware district of columbia florida idaho kentucky louisiana mississippi missouri montana nebras ka nevada new xico north dakota oklahoma oregon south dakota texas ve rmont utah west virginia wisconsin and wyoming the eb program also guarantees that state may receive less than set percentage of its average annual tea21 apportionments for each fiscal year in effect this sets an annua l percentage floor relative to states tea21 average apportionment beneath which state can fa ll the annual percentage floors are as follows 117 for fy2005 118 for fy2006 119 for fy2007 120 for fy2008 and 121 for fy2009httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33119crs8 the programmatic distribution of equity bonus program funds to the states is as follows each year the first 2639 billion is apportioned to the stp except that certain setasides such as for transpor tation enhancements and some population based substate allocations do not benefit from this distribution any equity bonus funds bove 2639 b illion are distributed to the six core programs im hbrr nhs stp cmaq and the hsip the distri bution among these programs is based on the ratio of each

crs contacts robert kirk and john fischer highway program and formula changes apportioned programs funds for all of the programs discusse d here are apportioned to the states on an annual basis using formulas found in safetea as result they are some times referred to as the apportione d programs in some in stances apportioned programs are also referred to as formula programs under tea21 most highway funding was reserved for five major apportioned programs which are usually re ferred to as the core programs they along with the minimum guarantee accounted for the vast majority of highwa

socalled core highway programs in addition to the core programs there are couple of additional and much smaller apportioned programs that existed in tea21 and are continued in safetea eg metropolitan planning nd the recreational trails program although many potential new programs we re considered during reauthorization only very few were finally included in safetea in addition to the hsip creates two new formula programs the coordinate d border infrastructure program cbi which replaces the tea21 discretionary program of the same name and the safe routes to school program srsp apportioned program formula changes under tea21 most of the funds distributed under the federalaid hi ghway program were apportioned to the states based on apportionment formula factors set forth for the individual programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33119crs9 2 the mg program and the proposed equity bonus program also apportion funds by formula for discussion of these prog rams see the donordonee remedies sectionunder title 23 of the us code2 some of these programs formulas include combination of weighted factors such as lane miles vehicl miles traveled and estimated tax payments to the highway acc ount of the htf others are primarily based on single factor such as the relative state share of total cost to repair or replace deficient bridges hb rr or weighted nonattain ment and maintenance area population under the clean air act cmaq although safetea did not make major changes in the existing program formulas the act did make some adjustments that are of note the act eliminates the 10 safety stp setaside that existed under tea21 the act continues the stp transportation enhancements setaside but ts it as the greater of 10 of the funds apportioned to state or the amount set aside for fy2005 adjustments were also made to the underlying calculation under cmaq of weighted nonattainment and maintenance areas for ozone under the ne w 8hour area standards safetea also creates 20 million nhs setaside for the construction of ferry boats and ferry terminal facilities in alaska new jers ey and washington national highway system setaside for the territorial highway

nonetheless numbered earmarks in the c onference report this compares with 1849 similarly labeled earmarks in tea 21 with value of 94 billion the hpps are not the only earmarks in the highway title of the act title i three new earmarked categories have been created the first projects of national and regional significance pr ovides almost 18 billion for 25 projects the individual earmarks in this category are mostly larger then those in the hpp program and as the name of the program suggests are larger in scope second set of earmarks is provided for national corridor infrastructure

category is for transportation improvements there are 465 projects listed with over 25 billion in dedicated funding this is totally new program and there is explanation in the conference report as to how or if the projects in this list are supposed to differ from those in the hpps pr ogram it should be noted that individual projects may appear in more then one earmarking list and that they may

were subject to the sip requirements section 176 of the clean air act prohibits federal agencies from funding projects in these areas unless they conform to the sips specifically projects must not cause or contribute to any new violation of any standard increase the frequency or verity of any existing vi olation or delay timely attainment of any standard because new highways generally lead to an increase in vehicle miles traveled and related emissions both the statute and regulations require that an areas transportation improvement program tip which identifies major highway and transit projects an area w ill undertake demonstrate conformity each time it is revised ie at least every two years highway and transit projects cannot receive federal funds unless they are part of conforming tip while conformity has been required for more than decade the impact of the conformity requirements is expected to grow in the next few years for several reasons the growth of emissions from suvs and other light trucks and greater than expected increases in vehicle miles traveled have both made it more difficult to demonstrate conformity recent court decisions have tight ened the conformity rules and the implementation over the next three years of more stringent air qualityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33119crs32 standards both for ozone and for fine particles such as those found in diesel exhaust will mean that additional areas are subject to conformity thus numerous metropolitan areas could face temporary suspension of highway and transit funds unless they impose sharp reductions in

of existing transit facilities can be funde d in lapsed areas the rules do not even allow funding of new projects that might reduce emissions such as new transit lines these limitations are among the issues of concern in addition many have raised concerns about mismatch between the sip tip and long range transportation planning cycles and have called for ss frequent but better coordinated demonstrations of conformity in its 2003 report the gao recommended that relevant federal agencies consider extending the threeyear time frame between required long range transporta tion plan updates and asking the congress to amend the clean air act to change the conformity rules to match this recommendation was generally supported by transportati on planners and highway builders but opposed by environmental gr oups and air quality planning officials as enacted pl 10959 requires less fre quent conformity monstrations at least every four years instead of every two years and will shorten the planning horizon over which conformity must be demonstrated to 10 years in many cases instead of the former requirement of 20 years the local air pollution control agency will need to be consulted and public comments solicited if the planning horizon is to be shortened the law also establishes 12month grace period following failure to demonstrate conformity before lapse would be declared for
