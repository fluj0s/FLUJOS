trademarks and copyrights1 the us international trade commission itc administers section 337 investig ations since 2001 over 90 of unfair competition acts asserted under section 337 have involved patent infringement these cases tend to be complex and re quire adjudication by the itc2 in the case of most copyrights and trademarks the cbp is empow ered to make onthespot determinations of ipr infringement3 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22880crs2 4 thus foreign companies with sufficient us ac tivity are able to file section 337 complaints 5 for instance in case with target date of twelve months the initial determination must be issued nine months before the target date 6 office of unfair import investigations reported in itc performance and accountability report fy2007requirements for filing section 337 complaint in general us companies must fulfill three requirements in order to assert unfair competition under section 337 first there must be an importation or sale for sale after or potential future impor tation of the infringing product into the united states it is not necessary for the imports to be in comme rcial or mass quantitie s second an unfair act of competition relating to the imported good must occur ie an infringement of valid us patent copyright or trademark third domestic company must be engaged in sufficient domestic activity such as inves tment in plant and equipment or employment of labor and capital in the united states re lated to the imported product in question us citizenship is not necessary to meet this third requirement4 standard section 337 itc investigations investigation process as shown in table 1 section 337 itc investigations involve mu ltiple steps that take pl ace over the course of many months the itc issues target dates for identifying when the itc pr oceedings should be fini shed ie the final determination is issued for cases with target dates of 15 months or less the initial determination must be issued at least three months before the target date5 for more complex cases with longer target dates the initial determination must be issued at minimum of four months before the target da investigation periods have increased over time prior to 2006 the average length for inve stigations in which final decision was reached was less than 15 months in fy2007 the average length increased to 166 months the shortest

of infringement7 institution and assignment of case upon receiving complaint the itc has thirty days to determine whether or not to initiate section 337 investigation if an investigation is instituted the itc assigns the case to an administrative law judge alj who will oversee and c onduct the investigation the itc also assigns an investigative attorney from its office of unfair import inve stigations ouii w ho provides his or her views to the alj regarding whether or not section 337 violation has taken place the attorney also represents the public interest during the investigation target date for completion of the investigation also will be set evidentiary hearing the alj will conduct formal evidentiary hearing typically lasting one to two weeks generally within seven to ten months of the filing initial determination of case the alj then will issue preliminary ruling an initial determination determining whether or not section 337 violation has occurred and proposing remedies discussed in next section if violations are found the alj decision will be based on the merits of the case for instance in section 337 case involving us patents the alj will eval uate the case based on patent infringement issues for cases in which the target date is 15 months or less the initial determination must be issued at least three months before the target date for longer target dates the initial determination must be issued at least four months before the target date final determination of case within 45 days of th initial determination the itc commissioners decide whether or not to review the initial determination the commissioners may decide to adopt the ruling alternately they may elect to change all or some parts of the initial termination or to co mpletely reject or remand it generally within three months of the initial deter mination the itc commissioners issue final determination which takes into account public interest considerations such as the impact on the publics health and safety or on the ability to satisfy us market demands settlement some cases before the itc are settled before final decision is made complainants typically the patent holder and respondents the lleged infringer may move to terminate an investigation for inst ance they may agree to crosslicensing or to resolve the dispute through arbitration review of determination the final determination is sent to the president for review based on national security considerati ons this decision is enforceable within 60 days if actions are taken by the president the president rarely has overturned the final determination during the 60 day review process responde nts who continue activities ruled by the itc to be in viol ation of section 337 do so under bond

in such activities stand to lose significan t amount of money in some cases the bond is 100 of the total value of the importe d products thus while remedies are not enforceable until the conclusion of the 60 day review period the bond frequently serves as deterrent from engaging in the section 337 violating activities this is especially the case because the president rarely disa pproves of itc final determinations appeals within the 60 day presidential revi ew period the respondent or anyone adversely affected by the final determination can file an appeal of the decision to the us court of appeals for the federal circu it depending on the circumstances the final determination may or may not be enforceable while the appeal is being heard amendments to section 337 in the original enactment of section 337 congress stipulated that the itc complete investigations within 15 months from institution of case to final determination section 337 was later amended to become compliant with the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt whose national treatment provision requires that member states not treat foreign member states nationals any less favorably than their own nationa ls there was concern that section 337 as initially enacted may not allow foreign companies to defend themselves adequately because the itc adjudication process generally takes place at faster pace than litigation in federal district courts the itc is now re quired by statute to complete investigations at the earliest practicable time trends in section 337 cases section 337 cases cover range of products with about onethird involving ectronics telecommunications computers semiconductors other cases involve products such as chemical biotechnolog ical pharmaceutical mechanical and consumer goods since 2002 there has been general uptic k in the number of section 337 cases in fy2007 the number of new cases was nearly 60 more than the number of new cases started in fy2003 there also were close to 80 more active cases in fy2007 than there were four years ago8 the overall rise in international ipr infringement has contributed to the increase in section 337 activity dditionally there has been increased publicity of the itc as an ipr border enforcement entity partly due to recent highprofile rulings9 moreover there is greater corporate awareness of the potential benefits of filing section 337 case rather than engaging in litigation throug h us district courts see next section alternative to section 337 us companies also may bring lawsuits against foreign entities in the venue of us district courts to challenge the entry of infringing products into the united states federal di strict courts unlike the itc can award monetary damages to the ipr holder and issue injunctions against infringers if the adjudicated infringer violates the injuncti on by continuing to import the infringing product it may face sanctions if the rights holder claims the infringer has acted in

technology law journal vol 19 4 april 2007imports as the ability to issue exclusion orders enforced by the cbp rests with the itc if the adjudicated infringer lacks assets in the united states enforcing us courts orders may prove difficult10 in addition litigation in us di strict courts tends to be more costly and to take longer to yiel d decisions than the section 337 venue section 337 remedies and enforcement the itc grants two primary remedies to us companies exclusion orders and cease and desist orders in fy2006 the itc comp leted twelve secti on 337 investigations11 issuing three general exclusion orders fi ve limited exclusion orders and two cease and desist orders12 the itc may not issue monetary damages to us companies exclusion orders exclusion orders prohibit the importation of the infringing good into the united states they are effectiv for as long as the patent is valid limited exclusion orders the most commonly issued type of exclusion order prohibit the importation of only those infringing goods orig inating from the parties named in the itc investigation in contrast general excl usion orders prohibit the importation of all goods of the kind determined to be infringing i rrespective of the source of the infringing good because general exclusion orders are broad in their scope they may disrupt international trade significantly in general they are issued only when circumvention of limited exclusion order would be likely or it would be difficult to identify all infringing parties the us customs and border protecti on cbp enforces exclusion orders cease and desist orders cease and desist orders require the termination of infringingrelated activities such as selling infringing articles previously imported that are currently in domestic inventories these orders frequently are issued in conjunction with exclusion orders particul arly in situations where the infringing goods are imported in commercial quantities cease and desist orders are enforced by the itc which is authorized to impose civil penalties on us im porters that violate ceas and desist orders penalties per day may be as high as 100000 or double the value of the goods involved13 time length for enforcement the time that it takes for remedies to become enforceable may vary because of differences in target dates and the possibility of appeals by respondents for example for standard investigation with 15 month target date from the time that company files complaint the maximum time that it would take for an exclusion order to be enfor ceable would be about 18 months preliminary relief us companies may request that the itc conduct expedite d temporary relief proceedings and issue temporary exclusion or cease and desist order while the

intellectual property federal enforcement has generally increased but assessing performance could strengthen law enforcement efforts march 2008investigation takes place for preliminary relief us companies must provide significantly more evidence prior to the h earing than for standard case the itcs decision to grant preliminary injuncti ons is based on the likeli hood of ccess for the complainants case and the extent to which the domestic industry respondents and the public interest would be adversely affected if preliminary injunction was not issued for temporary relief proceedings fina l determination following an initial determination by the alj is granted 90 days after institution for standard cases for more complex cases final determination is granted 150 days after institution of the case in cases where the complainant receives temporary remedy the complainant is required to put up bond following the pre liminary ruling the full section 337 standard case will proceed if the preliminary injunction is not upheld in the regular investigation the complainant may lose the bond money issues for congress some members of congress ve expressed concern that the section 337 venue does not provide immediate relief to us co mpanies facing unfair import competition proponents of faster process have argued that the us economy and public health and safety may be adversely affected by the continued importation of iprinfringing goods while section 337 investigations take place14 itc proponents maintain that the length of time for investigation has risen because of increased section 337 activity which has contributed to heavier dockets for aljs nd investigation backlogs in addition they indicate that recent cases tend to involve more technologica lly complex products and that filings increasingly name multip respondents whereas prev ious cases generally named one respondent15 others point out that itc inves tigations are generally faster than litigation in federal district courts where proceedings may take several years concerns also have been raised about cbp enforcement of exclusion orders recent government accountability office gao report notes that us companies spend millions of dollars to file sec tion 337 complaints before the itc but that enforcement of exclusion orders is limited because of lack of resources as of july 2007 cbp reported that 66 exclusion orders were in effect the number of exclusion order exams carried out by cbp has declined since fy2002 while us capacity to carry out ipr enforcement has increased according to gao challenges remain because ipr enforcement frequently may not be top cbp priority and there may not be adequate resources targeted to this effort16
