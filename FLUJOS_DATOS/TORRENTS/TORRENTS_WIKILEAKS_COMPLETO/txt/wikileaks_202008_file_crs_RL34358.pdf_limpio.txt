in public health and epidemiology domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34358obesity among older americans summary obesity defined as an unhealthy excess of body fat is serious and growing public health problem the number and proportion of people who are obese have risen notably in recent decades since th 1970s the prevalence of obesity has more than doubled in the adult popul ation in 2004 n early one in three adults 322 were classified as obese overweight and obese people are more likely to have chronic health problems such as diab etes high blood pressure and arthr itis they also are at greater risk for developing h eart disease cancer and alzheimers disease obesityrelated health care costs in the ited states were timated to be 91 of total annual medical expenditu res in 1998 and may have been as high as 785 billion 926 billion in 2002 dollars nearly lf of these costs are borne by public programs medicaid and medicare although americans of all ages are incr easingly overweight policy makers and health care providers have tended to overlook the problem of obesity in middleaged and older populations some physicians have neglected discussing the problem with older patients believing it t oo late to encourage substantive changes in their health behavior and the media ve tended to focus on obesity among children for whom excessive weight has been rarity until recently currently nearly one in eight americans is age 65 or older this ratio is expected to jump to one in five by 2030 due in part to longer life expectancies and the aging of the baby boom gene ration b ecause the highest rates of obesity are found among baby boomers aged 4462 in 2008 it is likely that the prevalence of obesity among older adults will continue to climb in coming decades as this population ages by 2010 37 of adults aged 65 and older are anticipated to be obese if this trajectory c ontinues unabated it is projected that nearly half of the elderly population w ill be obese in 2030 increasing levels of obesity among the elderly will be challenging policy issue at the state and federal levels because excessive weight gain is associated with an array of chronic conditions and because persons with multiple chronic illnesses generate more than 65 of all medicare costs to help inform congress about pattern s of weight distribution among older americans as well as to describe potential future trends in elderly obesity this report presents estimates of the prevalence of obesity for adults aged 65 and older differences in obesity between various raceethnicity groups and across age and gender lines are discussed in addition di sparities by region are presented including statelevel obesity timates for 1996 1999 2002 and 2005 the report

accumulation of body fat usually 20 or more over an individuals ideal body weight in recent years obesity has become an increasing concern for public health officials nd policy makers as the number of obese americans has increased significantly obesity increases mortality risk and is associated with serious chronic conditions including cardiovascular disease stroke diabetes growing list of cancers nd according to recent reports alzheimers disease1 moreover excessive weight gain is major cause of functional limitations among elderly individuals2 obesityrelated health care costs for adults in the united states were estimated to be 91 of total nnual medical expenditures in 1998 and may have been as high as 785 billion 926 billion in 2002 dollars3 nearly half of these costs were borne by federal h ealth care programs medicaid and medicare while the attention of policy makers has focused largely on the implications of obesity among children and adolescents the ffects of obesity on the health of older adults have been somewhat overlooked this report examines the causes and consequences of obesity among older amer icans and includes discussion of recent trends in obesity within this age

trajectories projections suggest that mo re than 37 of the population aged 65 and older will be obese by 2010 thus constitutin g the heaviest generation of elderly persons in us history13 if this trajectory continue s unabated it is projected that nearly half of the elderly population will be obese in 2030 experts anticipate that this high level of obesity among older americans will strain the countrys economic wellbeing in several ways first obesityrelated health problems will contribute to injuries absenteeism and decreases in overall productivity among workingage caregivers second unprecedented levels of obesity and overweight among the elderly could hasten functional decline after age 65 possibly causing significant social psychological or financial hardships for senior citizens or their families finally given that obesity is major risk factor for costly and deadly conditions including heart disease stroke cancer nd diabetes public insurance programs such as medicare

focus on eating nutr itious foods and engaging in physical activities sociologists and social epidemiologists by contrast have suggested that the recent rise in obesity is attributable to contextual factors such as increases in the amount of time spent watching television or using computers or the lack of pedestrianfriendly infra structure eg sidewalks bicy cle paths crosswalks they also point to aspects of the sociocultural environment that may c ontribute to societys expanding waistline for instance suburban sprawl has led to greater reliance on the automobile singleuse zoning in housing developments has compounded matters by segregating residences from schools retail stores and r ecreational facilities15 by designing and building neighborhoods that are increasingly less walkable urban planners and architects have helped reduce the average level of physical activity that americans get each day16 obesity rates in the united states may also be related to the increasing number of women who entered the workforce in the waning decades of the 20th century17 this shift prompted many families both to rely on prepackaged meals or frozendinners and to start eating in restaurants more often research demonstrates that individuals consume larger portions and hi ghercalorie foods in restaurants than when they eat meals at home 18 over time therefore the increasing reliance on restaurants for meals may have had an impact on obesity rates19 economists note that one reason obe sity and overweight have seen disproportionate increases among lowincome minorities is that fruits and vegetables are either prohibitively costly or simp ly inaccessible in their neighborhoods one study for instance has demonstrated that black communities have five times

body fat which increases the risk of medical illness and premat ure mortality because accurate measures of body fat mass require sophisticated technologies23 that are often available only in clinical settings an approximation called the body mass index bmi is used to screen and monitor overweight and obesity bmi expre sses the relationship of weighttoheight and correlates with the percenta ge of body fat person carries24 it is calculated as body weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters25 bmi is widely used and accepted as simple method to categorize people as healthy

collapses under the pressure of ones hand over many years spinal compression reduces the length of the spine and diminishes persons heightobese27 both the cdc and the world health organization concur that these bmi thresholds are gender and ageneutral despite distinct differences in body composition for men and women young and old table 1 illustrates bmis for fairly common heightweight combinations for example an adult who is 510 and weighs between 1740 and 2089 pounds is overweight at 2090 pounds and above he or she is classified as obese although bmi is proportional to the am ount of body fat person has it is important to emphasize that bmi is an in exact measure some people eg muscular athletes may have bmi that identifies them as overweight even though they do not have excess body fat conversely in elderly adults bmi measures may underestimate fatness because of agerelated changes in body composition for instance when person gets older muscle mass naturally decreases whereas abdominal and intramuscular fat increase28 as result the bmi formula may underestimate fatness in derly individuals on th other hand loss of height resulting from vertebral compression problem commonly associated with aging may lead to overes timates of body fat29 table 1 body mass index chart bmi 19 21 23 25 26 27 28 29 30 32 34 36 38 40 weight lbs height healthy overweight obese 410 91

of the lowfitness category they concluded enhancin g functional capacity also should allow older adults to achieve healthy lifestyle and to enjoy longer life in better health diabetes diabetes the sixthleading cause of death among elderly americans34 is disease in which blood glucose levels are ex cessive it is serious chronic illness that may lead to numerous health compli cations including heart disease blindness and kidney failure35 normally the pancreas secretes hormone called insulin which facilitates the absorption of glucose by cells in our bodies in type 1 diabetes the immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancr eas that produce insulin in order to survive type 1 individuals must intravenously in ject insulin into their bloodstream every day36 by contrast people with type 2 di abetes produce enough insulin but their bodies do not use the insulin effectively condition called insulin resistance type 2 diabetes is most often associated with older age and physical inactivity37 type 2 individuals must monitor their bl ood sugar levels carefully and watch their diets accordingly though they do not necessa rily need to selfadminister insulin obesity is known to induce insulin resistance to compensate for insulin resistance the pancreas produces even more insulin which leads to higher concentration of insulin in the blood stream this situation may continue for years but the pancreas is ultimately unable to maintain this high insulin output at that point blood sugar levels increase and type 2 diabetes is diagnosed extremely obese women bmi 400

alzheimers by 3656 while researchers have long suspected link between alzheimers disease and diabetes only recently have scientists demonstrated correlation between these conditions two competing explanations ve been offered for this association both hinge on the fact that overweight and insulinresistant individuals produce excess insulin as their pancreas tries to reduce the bodys blood sugar level this extra insulin can provoke inflammation of blood vessels one hypothesis is that swollen vessels in the brain may increase production of the protein betaamyloid which is an important component of the s ticky plaques that accumulate in the brain and lead to the development of alzheimers disease the notion that alzheimers may result when the brain is overwhelmed by insulin is supported by the results of recent research57 effect of bmi on mortality risk at various ages researchers have found that among dults between the ages of 30 and 74 increased bmi is associated with an incr ease in the risk of death from all causes58 indeed lifetable analysis showed that 40yearold nonsmokers who have bmi of at least 300 generally live six to seve n fewer years than their healthy weight peers59 however the relative risk associated with increased bmi appears to decline with age for example among 30to44yearolds the increase in mortality risk among overweight and obese

twofold firs t the mortality risk attributable to body mass loses prominence because so many ot her mortality risks become manifest as persons grow old second it is more diffi cult to find an association between obesity and mortality after age 75 because many obese individuals have already died by that age thus leaving behind persons who are healthier leaner or more resistant to potential

of body weight figure 2 shows the distribution of bmi scores among older men and women aged 65 and older in two time pe riods 19881994 and 19992002 specifically figure 2 demonstrates that the percentage of overweight elderly people has not dropped as the prevalence of obesity and extreme obesity has increased in recent years instead something somewhat more complicated has occurred between the two time periods highlighted the share of the elderly that was overweight remained virt ually unchanged going from 377 to 393 while the ranks of the obese and th severely obese both sign ificantly increased from 215 to 290 and from 18 to 32 respectivel during the same time period the fraction of individuals aged 65 and older w ho fell into the healthy weight category dropped significantly from 378 to 297 because the highest rates of obesity can be found among early baby boomers aged 5261 in 2008 followed closely by late boomers aged 4251 in 2008 obesity rates among the elderly are expected to rise within the next two decades as these individuals enter their retirement years this is especially true for women as the highest rates of obesity among women occur in their 50s the current degree of obesity among boomers has significant implica tions for the care that these individuals are likely to require in coming years it may also have policy ramifications given that persons who are obese in middleage are projected to incur twice as many medical expenses as medicare beneficiaries as will their healthy weight peers80 regional variations in obesity table 3 provides annual timates

are so commonplace in the united states85 their concerns reflect in part growin g consensus that obesity and overweight are social epidemics driven by contextual factors health economists have demonstrated that bmi is directly proportional to food prices and access to restaurants86 they also have shown that limite d access to supermarkets contributes to the risk of obesity because larger supermarkets are more likely to carry healthy foods at affordable prices87 finally the influence of technology on how individuals spend their free time has contributed in important ways to reducing

expending calories while at the same time lowering the cost of calorie intake by making food cheaper in creasingly sedentary lifestyles driven in large measure by the advent of the pe rsonal computer

the prices beneficiaries are charged for fruits and vegetables improving or encouraging the dist ribution and use of fresh produce in existing nutrition programs such as congregate meal programs in

is nicholas christakis and james fowler analyzed 32 years of data for 12067 dults who underwent repeated medical assessments as part of the framingham h eart study the study results demonstrate that if one person becomes obese those cl osely connected with him or her have greater chance of becoming obese themselves the authors suggest therefore that obesity is socially contagious spr eading from person to person in social network93 the greatest effect the researchers point out is seen not among family members or housemates but among friends moreover geography does not play role the impact of friends on obesity s eems to be independent of whether the friends live in the same region or not christakis and fowlers social network theory of obesity has additional policy implications they suggest that although people may directly influence each others behaviors the more significant mechanism is normative what appears to be happening is that person becoming obes most likely causes change of norms about what counts as an appr opriate body size people come to think that it is okay to be bigger since those around them are bigger and this sensibility spreads altering the physical activity norms of an entire neighborhood through community level interventions could have snowball effect both by ltering the lifestyles of the proximate social network and by influencing the health be haviors of friends at risk of overweight who live far outside of the community from this perspective policy makers may want to consider using the tools of urban planning to address the growing obesity crisis including smart growth development of suburban areas and increased funding to improve local infrastructure eg street lighting better sidewalk s common green space and better public transportation to facilitate the mobility of the citizenry for the most part these changes in land use policy would fall unde r the purview of local jurisdictionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34358crs26 94

array of food and nutrition programs such as the food stamp program the degree to which food labeling or food stamps contribute to bette r nutrition however has been questioned by many experts who assert that food labelin g is helpful only to people who have the knowledge and ability to dete rmine what they can purchase that will be healthy as well as an understanding of what could happen if they do not eat nutritious diet some contend that food stamps are of limited use to people who do not have access to wide range of healthful f oods94 the rural poor for example may not have any large grocery stores near where they live or may not have transportation available to get to grocery store with fresh produce finally in this view the food security programs may also be of limited be nefit
