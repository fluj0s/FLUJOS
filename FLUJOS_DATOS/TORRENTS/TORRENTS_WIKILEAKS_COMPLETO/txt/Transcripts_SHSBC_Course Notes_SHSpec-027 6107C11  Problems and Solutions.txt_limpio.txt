6107c11 shspec27 problems and solutions just going into session and running do fish swim would give gain if there were ptps arc breaks or whs this is hard to teach auditors though its been known since 1955 that if ptp was present youd get change in profile if an arc break was present youd have depressed graph and if wh is present you dont even have session its weird youre trying to hold the pc still so that you can audit him problem is postulatecounterpostulate resulting in indecision any time you have fixed stable postulate it accumulates or came about because of confusion problem has at least two stable data the two opposed postulates each surrounded by confusion so at mesty level it looks like confusion counterconfusion situation war is one of these twenty years after world war ii traces of it persist as nato the common market etc as for the bank someone set up some idea that he should oppose to some other idea however the idea that he set up to oppose the other idea commits overts against the other idea in that it confuses the other idea then it in turn gets back confusion and the other idea attacks his idea so you wind up with two opposed confusions which then gather more confusion this then goes down the ages as one aspect of the reactive mind problems have duration thus the reactive mind has duration how many ways could you take problem apart as motion as looking at two things as getting confusions of comparable magnitude all without adding new solution solving problems without being stuck with new solution has never been done before psychoanalysis by contrast lays in new solution that produces new confusions then more solutions thus you get branches and schools of psychoanalysis if someone has to have solution he didnt confront and asis the problem solution is always noconfront confronting produces vanishment of the problem if you want something to persist just dont confront it this gets us back to the original mechanism of structure in this universe preventing solution of the problems of the universe to guarantee the persistence of the universe so anybody who solved problems with regard to the universe was persona non grata with anyone who was trying to get total persistence of the universe the problem is that it is impossible to create and at the same time to say that something will persist things created tend to asis so if we want things persisting around us if we cant create weve got to preserve what was created the way to preserve it is to get in this mechanism of noconfront and solutions that we are now trying to undo in the reactive mind this is the idea that anyone who solves problems is dead duck horrible things will happen to anyone who solves problems and everybody agrees 100 and everybody does it to everyone and you get physical universe fact that enters the mental field with reference to the above quote i think hubbard means by solve asis this is where structure and mind take their first divergence if you want shakily persisting universe to persist forevermore youve got to prevent solution asising of its mysteries youve got to prevent it from being confronted so you say anyone who tries to solve this thing is gonna get it this goes over into pcs trying to solve their problems from day to day the terrors of having solutions asisings then bring about all these other mechanisms the universe poses lot of problems why is it here why does time go clicketyclick etc and person who could be tremendous mystery thought he could guarantee to himself tremendous persistence obviously the way to live was to be mysterious and if you confronted nothing youd live on and on so we developed whole genus of thetan who had decided not to solve anything because to solve something is dangerous if you just ask pc to solve something repetitively masses close in on him he dramatizes the cure of the impersistence of universes basically theres nothing wrong with solving asising problems but when youve got tremendous overts against people who were trying to solve problems of course it becomes impossible to solve problems the persistence of the reactive mind is q and aing with the physical universe so you find that most physical universe principles that affect the mind are in the area of problems gravity being trapped stillness etc the person gets threatened you solve asis problem and well put you in jail so the fellow has problem doesnt solve problem doesnt confront the problem doesnt create space between himself and the problem and of course he gets embedded in sort of black basalt of energy he solves the problem and jails himself he knows if you confront problem you get confused all this is protective mechanism resulting from an upperlevel creative failure the consequences of creating showed up with step six so after the universe was figured out on the basis of if you create one there are terrible consequences therefore its impossible to create another one so your havingness would be shot to pieces if you knocked out the one youve got because you couldnt create another one youve already had earlier on the track tremendous problems on the subject of creation it isnt enough to just create something and say thats it you have to agree its valuable and one can ever create another one like it etc you make something valuable by protecting it and by never being able to replace it these are all mechanisms of value by which people try to get you to lay off mest so everyone is convinced that creation carries penalties and that you have to protect creations against being asised and you get the problem sequence going we have legends against looking medusa pandora etc another threat would be you realize that if you solved the problem of time all time would cease actually if you could solve the problem of time the worst that would happen would be having to put it there for yourself again and mass without time probably wouldnt entrap anybody anyhow if you told the pc face solution repetitively hed get upset in the first place solutions are the easiest things thetan does and the easiest things to create and hed practically get his head knocked off with the confusion surrounding the solutions you didnt have him looking at the confusions only the solutions so the confusions just get more confused not confronting the confusions you have reason why any of the solutions ever occurred if we say look at the confusion they havent much inkling where to look whats communicable is the package of confusion solution which is the problem when he looks at problems he looks at future solutions too so it asises things bit youre not trying to get the fellow to solve or erase problems but to get him over his horror of problems and the piability of solving things youre trying to get him to recover from these things which were set up on the very earliest part of the track person who cant confront problems hasnt much judgment so this is the clue to judgment judgment can only take place in the presence of observation we can observe synthetically when using mathematics or when mocking something up judgment is absent in person who cant confront problem the auditor who cannot confront the problems of the pc wont see them as problems wont handle them and the pc wont make progress so this resolves auditing too the more confrontingness person has the better his judgment an auditor with judgment is valuable auditor so we want to get someone familiar with problems we start with reach and withdraw on the mest he has problems with any number of processes will increase the pcs familiarity with problems people go off onto the collection of solutions for which problems exist eg decorative knot tying or botany then there are people who will have nothing to do with problems but are overwhelmed with problems most of these problems wouldnt seem like real problems to you just facts as he describes them eg tell problem ok the sidewalk as you enter the area of problems with pc youll find him in one of these two conditions if its problem hes never been able to handle 1 pc in an obsessive automaticity of solutions 2 pc totally immersed in the problem as fact hell never be in the center line of these are problems until he wakes up to it when you run problems on someone he first starts coming up with solutions then on gradient he starts to relate them to the facts which for him appear to be problems or he goes into the processing announcing facts not solutions so it doesnt seem to you the auditor that you are listening to problems its not that he hasnt told you the whole story the fact hes given you is to him problem it starts peeling back onionlike until you find eventually there was some problem it was involved in usually with an overt in it and he can see it all and it blows the way to get the pc more familiar with problems is to get him to look at them recall problem is one way 6way confront bracket is another the two can be combined with profit you can also use recall ptp this situated him in the time of the problem its headon type of process with alteris of time for 6way confront see hcob 6jul61 routine 1a in view of the fact that the aberration about problems was originated to protect the universe and creations you find the early end of problems run appearing to run forever since it was put there to insure persistence however you will notice that the ta is active this then starts deteriorating and hell pass to either side either facts or solutions or cognitions he can alternate between facts and solutions too
