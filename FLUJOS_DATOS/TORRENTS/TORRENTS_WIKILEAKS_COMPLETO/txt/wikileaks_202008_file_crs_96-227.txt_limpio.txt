competition section 4e of the fair labor standards act william g whittaker specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division summary section 4e of the fair labor standards act flsa was added to the statute in 1961 it provides that if the secretary of labor has reason to believe that the act has had an adverse effect upon the competitive position of covered industries he will conduct an investigation and if an adverse impact is found report that finding to the president and the congress section 4e has rarely been utilized it is not entirely clear what action if any the president or the congress would take were such report made by the secretary further action is mandated by the statute this report briefly sketches the origins of section 4e examines its provisions and the potential for its implementation the context of enactment during the 19371938 debates on the federal wagehour legislation which would be enacted as the fair labor standards act some members of congress expressed concern that improving conditions of labor for american workers ie setting minimum wage and overtime pay standards restricting child labor etc would make it more difficult for american firms to compete with foreign production however language dealing with global competition was not then written into the fair labor standards act1 through the years the interrelationship of trade and us domestic labor standards remained an issue reemerging in policy context during the early 1960s in 1961 the 87th congress the house created special ad hoc subcommittee on the impact of imports on employment with representative john dent dpa to serve as chair congressman dent 1 see congressional record july 28 1937 p 7744 7747 and 7749 and crs report 89568 the fair labor standards act analysis of economic issues in the debates of 19371938 by william g whittaker p 6568 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 had frequently voiced concerns about this issue and as member of the full committee on education and labor was able closely to monitor the development of the new section 4e in the context of the 19601961 recession president kennedy february 2 1961 proposed program for economic recovery and growth as part of the program he urged that the minimum wage be increased to 125 per hour in steps over 2 years such an increase he affirmed can actually increase productivity and hold down unit costs with adverse affects on our competition in world markets and our balance of payments2 implementing legislation was promptly introduced in the house and senate3 consideration in the house while trade was not primary focus of congressional debate on the minimum wage in 1961 it was part of the general consideration of that issue in reporting hr 3935 the house committee on education and labor declared itself in agreement with the presidents views but added that it was concerned about the upward trend in imports of types of products which are produced in the united states by relatively low wage firms it continued in order to provide the information necessary for evaluating the matter the bill contains new provision section 4e which directs the secretary of labor to make investigations whenever he has reason to believe that in any industry under the act the competition of foreign producers has resulted or is likely to result in increased unemployment if he finds that increased unemployment has in fact resulted or is likely to result from such competition he will make report of his findings to the president and to the congress4 representative paul kitchin dnc noted that it is paradoxical to that we say in one breath the wage differential on foreign imports is killing our local industries by creating wage and price differential we cannot compete with and in another breath say that we ought to raise the minimum wage 5 although several versions of the 1961 flsa amendments were considered by the house each contained the section 4e provision on march 24 1961 the flsa amendments were passed the house on 34178 rollcall vote6 2 public papers of the president of the united states john f kennedy january 20 to

measure reporting an amended version of hr 3935 in general the committee appeared to concur in the position taken by president kennedy concerning global competition the committees report noted that an analysis of available data does not support the view that moderate increase in the minimum wage will have substantial adverse effect on the ability of american producers to compete with foreign producers in either the domestic or foreign markets it observed that most us firms pay wages far in excess of the minimum rate and would not be affected by an increase in the wage floor while conceding that the position of low wage firms competitive with foreign producers may tend to be adversely affected if minimum wage change were to result in higher prices it noted that department of labor dol studies have indicated that minimum wage increases did not result in any general pattern of increases in the prices of products of low wage industries therefore it concluded that moderate increase in the minimum wage will not have extensive adverse effects on the ability of us firms to compete with foreign producers7 however since the question had been raised the committee agreed to include the new section 4e provision in the reported legislation8 in dissent senators barry goldwater rariz and everett dirksen rill voiced general opposition to the wagehour legislation they noted in part that the american economy is faced with increasing foreign competition which requires that every effort be exerted to increase efficiency in manufacturing and similar occupations they argued that it is essential that job opportunities be created in the other segments of our economy so that workers displaced by automation and improving technological processes will not join the ranks of the unemployed raising the minimum wage they averred was inconsistent with expansion of job opportunities in the lowwage sector9 senator goldwater thereafter proposed substitute for section 4e which provided more extensive direction to the secretary of labor and other officials for dealing with global competition the goldwater amendment sparked immediate opposition senator hubert humphrey dminn pointed to the uncomplicated character of the house language the committee bill he observed simply authorizes the secretary of labor to study the employment effects of the import and export trade in industries covered by the act and to report such studies to the president and to congress senator goldwater on the other hand suggested that the house language was too simple he countered that if section 4e were to be left in the bill at all then let us make it effective because either we must have effective language to accomplish the purpose or we will admit that 7 us congress senate

noted extensive literature concerning the impact of changes in the minimum wage marked by variations in professional opinion see crs report 95202 the federal minimum wage and select bibliography by william g whittaker 8 srept 87145 p 22 9 ibid p 93 crs4 we are fooling the people of the country he added either we mean what we say or infer in the amendment or we do not i do not like to be privy to any action which will fool the american workers or the american public10 the goldwater amendment was rejected 55 nays to 39 yeas hr 3935 was agreed to and dispatched to conference section 4e was retained and approved with final provision added by the senate committee11 section 4e of the flsa as adopted in 1961 and as it stands in current law section 4e of the flsa reads as follows whenever the secretary of labor has reason to believe that in any industry under this act the competition of foreign producers in united states markets or in markets abroad or both has resulted or is likely to result in increased unemployment in the united states he shall undertake an investigation to gain full information with respect to the matter if he determines such increased unemployment has in fact resulted or is in fact likely to result from such competition he shall make full and complete report on his findings and determinations to the president and to the congress provided that he may also include in such report information on the increased employment resulting from additional exports in any industry under this act as he may determine to be pertinent to such report from the legislative history of section 4e its focus would seem to have been upon competitive disadvantage flowing from flsa coverage but from the wording of section 4e alone that interpretation is not clear section 4e is permissive leaving implementation first to the secretary and thereafter any supplemental action to the president and the congress the factors that the secretary might take into account in shaping his belief that foreign competition might have an adverse employment impact are not specified nor is it clear from the language of the statute upon what evidentiary standard that belief should rest similarly vague is the phrase has resulted or is likely to result in increased unemployment in the united states emphasis added different criteria would seem to be required when dealing with an actual rather than potential adverse employment impact one might read the phrasing in any industry under this act to suggest that the secretary consider each industry individually some might argue however that an adverse impact for one industry could be offset by positive impact in another and thus that the secretary should consider the economy as whole were secretary disinclined to act under section 4e he would seem to have ample justification for his or her inaction 10 congressional record april 19 1961 p 62276229 11 congressional record april 20 1961 p 6372 may 3 1961 p 70777108 71727195 provision was added allowing the secretary to report employment growth resulting from the export trade in industries covered by the act crs5 section 4e refers to the competition of foreign producers either in united states markets or in markets abroad or both given the context of the section did congress intend that dol investigate only where competitive disadvantage appears to be based upon differences in wages and working conditions further did the congress intend that dol conduct an investigation within other countries how extensive should such an investigation be where host country of competing industry enforces its own labor laws however inadequate they may be by us standards should the industry be deemed fair competitor12 how might dol measure adverse competitive impact in both domestic and foreign markets to what extent might competitive advantage be based solely upon labor standards might it result from better management economies of scale considerations of style quality or consumer taste absence of environmental requirements finally if the secretary were convinced that negative employment impact had occurred or was likely to take place he would be obligated to make study if the results of that study showed that his initial belief had been correct then he would be obligated to report his findings to congress and the president but here again section 4e is permissive there is requirement that either the president or the congress act upon the departments findings and authority is granted in section 4e for further action by the secretary implementation of section 4e by the labor department it would appear that the secretary of labor recognizing the permissive character of section 4e has rarely taken action under its provisions13 during the mid1960s study of international competition in the jewelry and silverware industry was made14 the resulting report appears to have shown negative competitive impact stemming from the flsa it is not now clear that any subsequent use has been made of section 4e recalling the concerns voiced during the debates of 1961 and from 40 years of experience with the provision some might question the utility of section 4e problems associated with documenting the impact of foreign labor standards notwithstanding would it be useful for the secretary to take action under section 4e first dol has authority to go beyond study and report were it to find evidence of an adverse impact section 4e contains avenue for redress beyond report to congress and the white house for example the secretary has power to waive the application of the flsa 12 during the debates of 1937 senator henry cabot lodge rmass questioned who would certify the conditions under which goods were produced abroad senator william borah rida doubting the utility of certification by foreign country responded i could mention countries whose certificate i would not regard as of any importance whatever congressional record july 28 1937 p 7747 13 this concluding segment of the report is based upon series of discussions with staff of the department of labor conducted over period of nearly 20 years as questions have been raised concerning the operation of section 4e the observations and findings above are composite of these discussions 14 us department of labor report submitted to the congress in accordance with the requirements of section 4d of the fair labor standards act mimeographed 1962 p 2 crs6 even were an adverse competitive impact observed nor based on section 4e has dol the independent authority or ability to assist distressed industry or its employees15 second taking into account diverse concerns it may be that dol has viewed any assessment of adverse competitive impacts on trade flowing from labor standards requirements as more of trade issue than one of labor standards per concluding comment do domestic labor standards protections have negative impact upon the competitive viability of usproduced goods and if so can remedy be found through the flsa should an effort be made to impose us labor standards protections upon offshore and foreign production is there clear tradelabor standards linkage might more appropriate vehicle for effecting worker protection be found in the international labor organization ilo or the world trade organization wto debate on this general issue has continued through the years and in ongoing16 if not actually implemented section 4e remains part of the flsa secretary of labor could utilize the section were he or she inclined to do so if useful purpose is to be served by section 4e it may be that its wording will need to be made clearer and more comprehensive or it may be that the time has come to remove the section from the statute as superfluous language 15 it may be useful to explore the relationship if any of section 4e of the flsa to other worker assistance and retraining initiatives for example those associated with the trade adjustment assistance program or the north american trade agreement 16 in this context see cappuyns elisabeth linking labor standards and trade sanctions an analysis of their current relationship columbia journal of
