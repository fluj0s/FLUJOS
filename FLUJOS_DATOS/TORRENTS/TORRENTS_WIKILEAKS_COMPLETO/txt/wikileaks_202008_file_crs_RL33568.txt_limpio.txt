united states europe japan and canada crews have occupied iss on 46 month rotating basis since november 2000 the us space shuttle which first flew in april 1981 has been the major vehicle taking crews and cargo back and forth to iss but the shuttle system has encountered difficulties since the columbia disaster in 2003 russian soyuz spacecraft are also used to take crews to and from iss and russian progress spacecraft deliver cargo but cannot return anything to earth since they are not designed to survive reentry into the earths atmosphere soyuz is always attached to the station as lifeboat in case of an emergency president bush prompted in part by the columbia tragedy made major space policy address on january 14 2004 directing nasa to focus its activities on returning humans to the moon and someday sending them to mars included in this vision for space exploration is plan to retire the space shuttle in 2010 the president said the united states would fulfill its commitments to its space station partners and the shuttle discovery made the first postcolumbia flight to the iss in july 2006 shuttle flights have continued and completion of the space station is scheduled before the shuttle is retired in 2010 meanwhile nasa has begun development of new crew launch vehicle named ares and crew exploration vehicle named orion nasa programs were funded for fy2008 in division b of the consolidated appropriations act pl 110161 the space operations program which includes the space shuttle and the iss was funded at 6734 billion for fy2009 nasa requested 5775 billion for these programs but in the process revised its budgeting to move its overhead costs to new account called crossagency support under the new system the fy2008 space operations program would have received 5526 billion

oneyear authorization bill was sense of the congress urging cooperation in the moonmars activities with other nations pursuing human space flight it also requires that nasa terminate or suspend any activity of the agency that if continued between the date of enactment of this act and april 30 2009 would preclude the continued safe and effective flight of the space shuttle after fiscal year 2010

space station skylab in 1973 three crews were sent to live and work there in 19731974 it remained in orbit unoccupied until it reentered earths atmosphere in july 1979 disintegrating over australia and the indian ocean skylab was never intended to be permanently occupied but the goal of permanently occupied space station with crews rotating on regular basis employing reusable space transportation system the space shuttle was high on nasas list for the postapollo years following the moon landings budget constraints forced nasa to choose to build the space shuttle first the first launch of the shuttle was in april 1981 when nasa declared the shuttle operational in 1982 it was ready to initiate the space station program in his january 25 1984 state of the union address president reagan directed nasa to develop permanently occupied space station within decade and to invite other countries to join on july 20 1989 the 20th anniversary of the first apollo landing on the moon president george h w bush voiced his support for the space station as the cornerstone of longrange civilian space program eventually leading to bases on the moon and mars that moonmars program the space exploration initiative was not greeted with enthusiasm in congress primarily due crs2 to budget concerns and ended in fy1993 although the space station program continued president clinton dramatically changed the character of the space station program in 1993 by adding russia as partner to this already international endeavor that decision made the space station part of the us foreign policy agenda to encourage russia to abide by agreements to stop the proliferation of ballistic missile technology and to support russia economically and politically as it transitioned from the soviet era the clinton administration strongly supported the space station within certain budget limits the international space station program thus began in 1993 with russia joining the united states europe japan and canada an intergovernmental agreement iga established three phases of space station cooperation the iga is treaty in all the countries except the united states where it is an executive agreement it is implemented through memoranda of understanding mous between nasa and its counterpart agencies during phase i 19951998 seven us astronauts remained on russias space station mir for long duration several month missions with russian cosmonauts russian cosmonauts flew on the us space shuttle seven times and nine space shuttle missions docked with mir to exchange crews and deliver supplies repeated system failures and two lifethreatening emergencies on mir in 1997 raised questions about whether nasa should leave more astronauts on mir but nasa decided mir was sufficiently safe to continue the program mir was deorbited in 2001 phases ii and iii involve construction of the international space station itself and blend into each other phase ii began in 1998 and was completed in july 2001 phase iii is underway president george w bush prompted in part by the february 2003 space shuttle columbia tragedy made major space policy address on january 14 2004 directing nasa to focus its activities on returning humans to the moon and eventually sending them to mars included in this vision for space exploration was decision to retire the space shuttle in 2010 the president said the united states would fulfill its commitments to its space station partners iss design cost schedule and lifetime under the original iss schedule assembly of the station would have been completed in 2002 with operations at least through 2012 president bush restructured the space station program in 2001 and left it unclear when assembly would be completed nasa briefing charts in march 2003 showed space station operations possibly continuing until 2022 under president bushs january 2004 vision for space exploration however nasa plans to complete its utilization of iss in 2016 though the other partners may continue to use it after that time iss segments have been and continue to be launched into space on us or russian launch vehicles and assembled in orbit the space station is composed of multitude of modules solar arrays to generate electricity remote manipulator crs3 systems and other elements details can be found at httpspaceflightnasagov homeindexhtml the us space shuttle has been the major vehicle taking crews and cargo back and forth to iss but the shuttle system encountered difficulties after the columbia disaster and did not resume flights until 2006 russian soyuz spacecraft are also used to take crews to and from iss and russian progress spacecraft deliver cargo but cannot return anything to earth since it is not designed to survive reentry into the earths atmosphere soyuz is always attached to the station as lifeboat in case of an emergency expedition crews have occupied iss on 46 month rotating basis since november 2000 originally the crews had three members two russians and one american or two americans and one russian crew size was temporarily reduced to two one american one russian while the us shuttle was grounded in order to reduce resupply requirements the number of astronauts who can live on the space station is limited in part by how many can be returned to earth in an emergency by lifeboats docked to the station only russian soyuz spacecraft are available as lifeboats each soyuz can hold three people limiting crew size to three if only one soyuz is attached the plan is that crew size will grow to six once assembly is completed the flight of the shuttle endeavour scheduled for november 2008 is aimed at beginning preparations for sixperson crew each soyuz must be replaced every six months the replacement missions are called taxi flights since the crews bring new soyuz up to iss and bring the old one back to earth therefore under normal conditions the long duration expedition crews are regularly visited by taxi crews and by the space shuttle bringing up additional iss segments or exchanging expedition crews when the shuttle is unavailable expedition crews are taken back and forth on the taxi flights in order to contract for soyuz service to the iss nasa has needed an exemption from the iran nonproliferation act ina pl 106178 which banned us payments to russia in connection with the international space station iss unless the us president determined that russia was taking steps to halt proliferation of nuclear weapons and missile technology to iran in 2005 congress amended ina to exempt soyuz flights to the iss from the ban through 2011 it also extended the provisions of the ina to syria and north korea and renamed it the iran north korea and syria nonproliferation act inksna nasa asked for legislated extension of this exemption and waiver authority was extended until july 1 2016 in the continuing appropriations act of 2009 pl 110329 for details see crs report rl34477 extending nasas exemption from the iran north korea and syria nonproliferation act by carl behrens and mary beth nikitin space station costs from fy1994 to fy2001 the cost estimate for building iss grew from 174 billion to about 25 billion the 174 billion estimate did not include launch costs operational costs after completion of assembly civil service costs or other costs nasa estimated the programs lifecycle cost all costs including funding spent prior to 1993 from fy1985 tofy2012 at 723 billion in 1998 gao estimated the lifecycle cost at 956 billion gaonsiad98147 more recent comparable lifecycle estimates are not available from nasa or gao crs4 as costs continued to rise congress voted to legislate 25 billion cap on development of the iss program plus 177 billion for associated shuttle launches in the fy2000fy2002 nasa authorization act pl 106391 in january 2001 however nasa announced that the cost would be over 30 billion 72 above the 1993 estimate and 5 billion above the legislated cap nasa explained that program managers had underestimated the complexity of building and operating the station the bush administration signaled it supported the legislated cap would not provide additional funds and nasa would have to find what it needed from within its human space flight account core complete configuration in february 2001 the bush administration announced it would cancel or defer some iss hardware to stay within the cap and control space station costs the decision truncated construction of the space station at stage the administration called core complete in 2001 the space station program office at johnson space center jsc estimated that it would cost 83 billion from fy2002 tofy2006 to build the core complete configuration described at that time as all the us hardware planned for launch through node 2 plus the launch of laboratories being built by europe and japan nasa subsequently began distinguishing between us core complete the launches through node 2 which prior to the columbia tragedy was scheduled for february 2004 and international partner ip core complete which included the addition of european and japanese laboratory modules then anticipated in 2008 the new policy was followed by president bushs january 2004 vision for space exploration which directs that us research on iss be restricted only to that which supports the vision new research plan incorporating the presidents vision was issued by nasa in june 2006 as mandated by the 2005 nasa authorization act pl 1091551 at january 2005 heads of agency meeting the partners endorsed final configuration of iss but nasa subsequently announced changes to it the agency now plans to conduct only 16 instead of 28 shuttle launches to the iss all before the end of fy2010 september 30 2010 and has dropped plans to launch the centrifuge and its accommodation module and russias science power platform the agency plans to meet with the other iss partners to discuss these changes the changes to the iss are largely due to the new direction nasa is taking in response to the vision for space exploration the vision calls for development of crew exploration vehicle now named orion to take astronauts to and from the moon and crew launch vehicle now named ares i orion also can take them to and from the iss and nasa administrator griffin stated at september 19 2005 press conference that orion would be used to take crews to and from the iss and to serve as lifeboat for them if orion is built as announced it would fulfill the us 1 the national aeronautics and

shuttle discovery on the first of two return to flight rtf missions sts114 on july 26 2005 and it successfully landed on august 9 on july 27 however nasa announced that piece of foam had detached from sts114s et during launch similar to what happened to columbia cameras and other sensors on discovery and on the international space station to which discovery was docked for much of its mission imaged the orbiter and determined that it was not damaged but further shuttle launches were suspended meanwhile the images revealed that two gapfillers ceramic coated fabric placed between thermal protection tiles were protruding on the belly of the orbiter that could have affected aerodynamic heating during reentry one of the discovery astronauts removed them during space walk the second rtf mission sts121 was scheduled for september 2005 but deferred sts121 launched on july 4 2006 and returned safely to earth on july 17 the shuttle atlantis launched september 9 on sts 115 during which

shuttle columbia synopsis of the report of the columbia accident investigation board by marcia s smith crs7 current plans for the shuttle include nine more flights to complete the iss before the shuttle is permanently grounded in 2010 also planned is another flight to service the hubble space telescope following the columbia disaster then administrator sean okeefe had cancelled the hubble servicing mission partly on the grounds that shuttle astronauts would not be able to reach the iss as haven in case the shuttle was unable to return to earth the decision was put under review by the new administrator michael griffin and on october 31 2006 he announced that the hubble mission would be undertaken in 2008 the servicing would extend the life of the telescope through 2013 to deal with emergencies nasa planned to prepare launch on need mission with second shuttle ready to launch on rescue mission if the first was found defective during the servicing mission the launch was in final stages of preparation when major data handling unit already in place in the hubble telescope failed in late september 2008 backup unit in the telescope was activated but the service mission was revised to include carrying second data handling unit which had been stored on earth to replace the failed one nasa determined that assessing and preparing the second unit for installation and service would delay the mission until may or june of 2009 the shuttles future nasa attempted unsuccessfully for many years to develop second generation reusable launch vehicle rlv to replace the shuttle in 2002 nasa indicated the shuttle would continue flying until at least 2015 and perhaps 2020 or beyond the columbia tragedy and president bushs 2004 vision for space exploration to return astronauts to the moon by 2020 and someday send them to mars forced nasa to revise that plan the presidents vision calls for the shuttle program which absorbs approximately 25 of nasas annual budget to be terminated in 2010 primary motivation is to make that funding available to implement other aspects of the vision although there also is concern about shuttle safety congress has been debating the vision including its impact on the shuttle and on us human access to space some members wanted to terminate the shuttle earlier than 2010 because they feel it is too risky andor that the funds should be spent on accelerating the vision others want to retain the shuttle at least until new spacecraft the crew exploration vehicle cev is available to take astronauts to and from the iss the cev is now planned for 2015 at the earliest leaving multiyear gap during which us astronauts would have to rely on russia for access to the iss the 2008 nasa authorization act pl 110422 included provision requiring nasa to terminate or suspend any activity of the agency that if continued between the date of enactment of this act and april 30 2009 would preclude the continued safe and effective flight of the space shuttle after fiscal year 2010 if the president inaugurated on january 20 2009 were to make determination to delay the space shuttles scheduled retirement sec 611d shuttle budget funding for the shuttle for fy2008 was 3981 billion for fy2009 nasa requested 2982 billion for the shuttle but that amount reflects nasas new system for funding program overhead costs which created new crossagency support account by the new accounting system the comparable shuttle funding for fy2008 was 3267 billion for details on the nasa budget crs8 see crs report rs22818 national aeronautics and space administration overview fy2009 budget and issues for congress by daniel morgan and carl behrens issues for congress in passing the 2005 nasa authorization act pl 109105 congress basically agreed with the presidents plan for directing nasas attention to return to the moon and manned missions to mars included in the moonmars vision is the plan to end flights of the space shuttle in 2010 and restriction of us experiments on the iss mostly to those that forward the goal moonmars goal number of critical questions remain however adequacy of funding is the chief question raised about nasas activities in presenting the moonmars vision the president did not request significantly increased money for nasa despite chronic indications that the missions it was already charged with were underfunded nasa has responded to the new mission by cutting back funding for its other activities primarily in scientific research and aeronautics although discoverys return to flight mission of july 2006 was success the ability of the shuttle fleet to carry out enough flights to complete construction of the iss by 2010 is still in question with history of more than hundred successful missions it might be assumed that another 15 or so would be considered more or less routine but instead each launch is still major and risky event the great complexity of the vehicle and the extreme environment in which it operates require constant attention to possible accidents and malfunctions many of which must be addressed on an ad hoc basis the future role of the iss is also unclear assuming that enough shuttle flights are made to carry out core completion of the station by 2010 it is not clear what will be done with the iss after that in particular there will be gap of several years between retirement of the shuttle in 2010 and beginning of flight of the crew exploration vehicle to be designed for the return to the moon but able to serve as vehicle to reach the iss for other versions of
