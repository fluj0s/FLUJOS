weborder code rs21696 updated february 21 2006 us intelligence and policymaking the iraq experience richard best jr specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division summary continuing issue for congress is the question of whether the us intelligence community failed to provide accurate info rmation about iraqi capabilities to develop and use weapons of mass destruction wmd and whether the bush administration systematically misused intelligence to garn er support for launching operation iraqi freedom in march 2003 and for continuing military operations in iraq the senate intelligence committee submitted report on the intelligence communitys performance in july 2004 srept 108301 but followon assessment of the use of intelligence has not been prepared and has become the source of controversy that led to rare closed session of the senate on november 1 2005 this report explores in general terms the relationship between the production of intelligence and the making of policy as reflected in the period prior to the war against iraq in march 2003 and the implications for congress this report w ill be updated if circ umstances warrant background intelligence has an important but not conclusive role in support of the policymaking process intelligence agencies collect info rmation process and analyze it they then disseminate analytical products to offici als throughout the federal government policymakers however base their decisions on wide variety of factor s including available intelligence but also on their own assessment of the costs and benefits of course of action or inaction considerations of geopolitical objectives ideology available resources diplomatic and domestic political risks va riety of factors well beyond the purview of intelligence agencies even when official justifications for chosen course of action highlight the conclusions of intelligen ce estimates there are usually multiple factors involved intelligence may be good or bad and policies may be good or ba d but in the real world good policy may be made in the absence of perfect intelligence and sound intelligence may not preclude making poor policy this is not to sa that intelligence is irrelevant to policymaking but that it is almost invariably imperfect because hostile foreign countries and groups work hard to mask their capabilities and intentions and many factors are i nherently unforeseeable in addition intelligence agencies do not ways perform at maximum effectivenesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21696crs2 1 in addition to the assessment of the senate intelligence committee srept 108301 discussed below see us commission on the intelligence capabilities of the united states regarding weapons of mass destruction the wmd co mmission mar 31 2005

mont hs of the bush administration in early 2006 paul pillar former senior intelligence official who has written critically of administration policies stated that intellig ence on iraqi weapons systems did not drive its decision to go to war rather the decision to topple saddam was driven by other factors namely the desire to shake up the sclerotic power structures of the middl east and hasten the spread of more liberal politics and economics in th region paul r pillar intelligence policy and the war in iraq foreign affairs marchapril 2006subsequent to the persian gulf wa r of 1991 the us intelligence community supplied vast quantities of information and analysis on iraq to policymakers including congress much of the intelligence derived from us national collection systems satellites intercepted signals agent reports and the like some derived from liaison relationships with the intelligence services of the united kingdom and other countries whereas the mass of documentation was large the quality of the collected data and the analysis based on it has been criticized with many pointing to the absence of direct reporting on saddam husseins close advise rs and his weapons acquisition offices postwar assessments have in general concluded that available human intelligence humint failed to provide reliable info rmation on decisions made within saddam husseins inner circle and most notably on iraqi capabilities for pr oducing and delivering weapons of mass destructi on wmd and the extent of iraqi wmd stockpiles1 despite the importance of intelligence the evidence collected and analyzed by us intelligence agencies in recent years may not ve been the central factor in framing us policies towards iraq the concerns that the u s and other countries had in regard to iraq were not under dispute hussein had used wmd against iran and against his own people he had pursued aggre ssive attacks on neighboring stat he had failed to comply with demands in regard to wmd restrictions some senior policymakers in the bush administration had come into office w ith deep conviction that saddam husseins government presented an ongoing threat to us and western interests in the middle east2 these views may not have been directly influenced by subsequent intelligence reportingsenior officials may even have discounted some analysts conclusions because they recalled that intelligence agencies were caught by surprise when the extent of iraqs nuclear programs in the late 1980s was revealed af ter the persian gulf war even with widespread agreement on the nature of the iraqi regime and the general parameters of its policies there were differing viewpoints on the most appropriate response both at the and in the u s however because much of the bush administrations explanation of its case especially beginning in the summer of 2002 included references to intelligence judgment s especially about iraqi wmds the wide ranging debate about iraq in the us came to focus on intelligence judgments this was the case in 20022003 and given postwar assessments of prewar inte lligence has remained so in particular the prewar intelligence estimate that iraq

pervasive and operational ties be tween iraq and qaeda has also brought prewar assessments into question the senate intelligence committees july 2004 report set forth the limitations of prewar intelligence at considerable length4 although the report was unanimous there have been sharp disagreements over the question of whether the committee should also address the use of prewar intelligence by the administration and by members of congress at one point chai rman roberts argues that t he threshold question for the committee should be whether our intelligence agencies produced reasonable and accurate analysis not how that intelligence was used by policymakers5 vice chairman rockefeller on the other hand cited section 14a1 of sres 400 which serves as charter for the select intelligence committee and includes use of information as matter of committee oversight he main tained that the committees republican chairman has refused to look at the whole pi cture excluding from the inquiry the subject of how intelligence was used or potentially misused and whether policymakers in any way shaped the intelligence they received6 an agreement was announced in february 2004 that the terms of reference of the committ ees investigation woul d address the issue of whether public statements by us officials were substantiated by intelligence information7 srept 108301 provided the committee s treatment of prewar intelligence assessments in july 2004 it served as phase i of the committees work the preparation of phase ii which is to include the committees assessment of the use of intelligence by government officials has been the source of continued differences of opinion among members senator roberts indicated that preparation of the phase ii report was very close but senator rockefeller maintained that only token work at best has been done8 the persistence of the disagreemen t was cited by senator reid the minority leader in his call for an unusual cl osed session of the

prior to military operations brief review of the bush administrations public statements provides some insights into the intelligence communitys contribution to the administration policymaking on iraq the lack of definitive intelligence was recurring theme even as the determination to confront iraq hardened in the months after the defeat of the taliban regime in afghanistan in an august 2002 speech vice president cheney warned about the threat from iraq and addressed the av ailability of intelligence many of us are convinced that saddam will acquire nuclear wea pons fairly soon just how soon we cannot really gauge intelligence is an uncertain business even in the best of circumstances10 the vice president articulated reasons for forcing regime change basing his argument on comprehensive assessment of ir aqs record before and after the persian gulf war of 1991 especially security council resolutions that iraq accepted and then evaded mr cheneys remarks indi cated certain skepticism about intelligence agencies also alluded to by other administration officials he recalled prior to the gulf war americas top intelligence analysts would come to my office in the defense department and tell that saddam hussein wa s at least five or perhaps even 10 years away from having nuclear weapon after th war we learned that he had been much closer than that perhaps within year of acquiring such weapon11 in major address to the united nations on september 12 2002 president bush also discussed the absence of intelligence he not ed that today iraq continues to withhold important information about its nuclear program weapons design procurement logs experiment data an accounting of nuclear materials and docum entation of foreign assistance he cited intelligence that has since been called into question by administration critics iraq employs capable nuclear scientists and technicians it retains physical infrastructure needed to build nuclear weapon ir aq has made several attempts to buy highstrength aluminum t ubes used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapon should iraq acquire fi ssile material it would be ab to build nuclear weapon within year he concluded that the first time we may be completely certain he has nuclear weapons is when god forbid he uses one12 later the president expressed views bout intelligence not unlike mr cheneys many people have asked how close saddam hussein is to developing nuclear weapon well we dont know exactly and th ats the problem before the gulf war the best intelligence indicated that iraq was eight to ten years away from developing nuclear weapon after the war internationa l inspectors learned that the regime hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21696crs5 13 remarks by the president on iraq cinci nnati oh museum center

pursuing several different methods of enriching uranium for bomb13 the 2003 state of the union speech delivered on january 28 also contained number of references to intelligence reports and judgments concerning iraq our intelligence officials estimate that saddam hu ssein had the material to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin mustard and vx nerve agent us intelligence indicates that saddam hussein had upwards of 30000 mun itions capable of delivering chemical agents from three iraqi defectors we know that iraq in the late 1990s had several mobile biological weapons labs in tion of the speech that became controversial the president described iraqs potential nuclear capabilities the international atomic energy agency confirmed in the 1990s that saddam hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program had design for nuclear weapon and was working on five diffe rent methods of enriching uranium for bomb the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase highstrength uminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production saddam hussein has not credibly explained these activities secretary of state colin powell in febr uary 2003 address to the stated that every statement that i make today is backed up by sources solid sources these

considerable deba speeches given by senior administration leaders did not desc ribe in detail the disparate sources or the complex analytical reasoning that lay behind the intelligence judgments that were cited some observers believe that intelligence was simplified to the point of distortion in order to shape the public debate former national intelligence officer paul pillar argues that the

complexities of intelligence analysis than the policymaking processes of the national security counc il according to one media account public discussion of the rationale for attacking ir aq was coordinated beginning in august 2002 in the white house by group of administra tion officials described as the white house iraq group whig consisting largel of communications specialists16 according to the account strategic communications task fo rce under the whig began to plan speeches and white papers the whig according to the account wanted gripping images and stories not available in the hedged and austere language of intelligence while intelligence analysts expressed greatest cern about iraqs chemical and biological warfare efforts speech writers focused on nuc lear issues according to the account for speech write r uranium was valuable because an yone could see its connection to an atomic bomb despite warnings from intelligence analysts the uranium would return again and again including the january 28 stat of the union address and three other bush administration statements that month17 as iraqi nuclear capabilities became major source of postwar controversy deputy national security adviser ste phen hadley acknowledged that the reference in the state of the union speech to british reports that iraq had attempted to obtain significant quantities of uranium in africa should not have been included given doubts among us analysts about the veracity of the british repor t but he maintained that other intelligence sources too sensitive to describe in public address did indicate other iraqi efforts to acquire uranium from africa18 implications of the process for congress intelligence estimates are normally written by analysts who attempt to portray all attendant ambiguities to provide policymakers with context rarely are matters described in terms of black or white but more often are portrayed using kaleidoscope of grays unclassified summaries may further blur analytical judgments to protect intelligence sources and methods some cr itics charge that summaries ma be edited to avoid political difficulties nevertheless the question of how well the intelligence community performs remains extremely important in view of certainties over the possession and possible use of wmds by iran north korea and terro rist groups congressional oversight can help ensure effective performance by the intelligence community by evaluating collection capabilities and analytical standards and by holding intelligence officials accountable ultimately however policies will be judged on their results intelligence analysis can inform policymaking but it does not substitute for it
