negotiations came to standstill in july 2006 the european union eu announced its intention to enter into more bilateral and regional free trade agreements ftas while the eu historically has been leading force for preferential trade agreements its main priority from 20012006 was negotiating an ambitious doha round agreement given that the eu is global economic superpower its resumption of bilateral and preferential trade strategy has implications for the global trading system as well as for us trade interests as articulated in an october 2006 report the eu will prioritize ftas with

efforts to foster economic growth and create jobs based on concern that european exports have not been successful enough in some of the most rapidly growing economies in the world the commission proposed shifting eu trade policy from sole reliance on multilateral trade negotiations to proposing new generation of bilateral and regional ftas1 the essence of the strategy will be that ftas should be negotiated with the eus most important trading partners around the globe as soon as possible whereas previous attempts to secure ftas were predicated on promoting development or boosting regional cooperation the new strategy now will be based on market potential economic size and growth and the level of protection against eu exports based on mostly economic criteria the commissi on identified south korea india and asean as priority negotiating partners these three trading partners combine high levels of protection with large market potential and they are active in concluding ftas with eu competitors the commission hopes to negotiate an fta with south korea in one year and to reach accords with india and asean within two years2 the commission also has identified mercosur brazil argentina paraguay and uruguay russia and the gulf cooperation council as the next tier of candidates because they combine market potential and fairly high levels of protection according to the commission china also meets many of these criteria but requires special attention in terms of content the commission states that the new ftas would need to be comprehensive and ambitious in coverage aiming at the highest possible degree of trade liberalization the ftas would also need to include such issue areas as services investment intellectual property rights public procurement and competition policy finally the commission maintains that any decision to launch an fta negotiation would not only be based on economic criteria but also broader political considerations this is because ftas are viewed by the commission as an integral part of the eus bilateral relations with the country or region concerned

1960s it concluded the yaounde agreements then reciprocal with former colonies this was followed in 1975 by the lome treaties giving easy often free nonreciprocal access for the mostly african 1 this

india asean december 7 2006 as of july 2008 the eu had completed 7 rounds of negotiations on comprehensive agreement with south korea but little progress has been made in negotiating an fta with india fta negotiations with asean have not started but remain under study 3 the eu which began with the establishment of the eur opean economic community eec is itself preferential trade area with an agenda of expansion the notion that granting trade preferences to partners is the norm rather than the exception for the eu is supported by the fact that it co nducts trade on nondiscriminatory or mfn basis with only half dozen trading partners including the united states and china

preferential non reciprocal agreements were signed with mediterranean countries such as turkey and greece and bilateral ftas in industrial goods with the then six european free trade association efta countries existing overseas territories had yet another special regime and the ec generalized system of preferences was initiated in 1971 creating what was dubbed pyramid of preferences4 second wave of regionalism began in the late 1980s after the berlin wall fell the eu concluded association agreements with 10 countries in central and eastern europe and trade and cooperation agreements with all of the commo nwealth of independent states comprised of most of the former soviet union states othe r major initiatives including ftas with south africa and mexico followed suit and by 1999 tota l trade between countries with which the eu has free trade and preferential agreements including intraeu trade was over three times us trade with its free trade agreement partners5 beginning in the mid1990s the eu began to give priority to the multilateralism of the wto over bilateral agreements for number of reasons most generally brussels saw multilateralism and the wto as mechanism for managing globalization by using the single european market as model for its global trade liberalization agenda european policymakers hoped to control globalization more tightly the steps involved in managing globalization in trade included widening the definition of trade issues subject to new issues such as investment services intellectual property rights and competition policy and redistributing the benefits and costs of globalization both outside and inside europe6 in the process the eu put itself forward as the leading champion of the global multilateral system while it did not abandon any of its preferential agreements under the leadership of its trade commissioner pascal lamy the eu in 2001 halted the negotiation of any new ftas while doha was underway other countries including the united states and china however did not follow the eus example beginning with the bush presidency in 2002 the united states which had shunned such arrangements for decades because it saw itself as the post1945 champion of an open multilateral system began pursuing bilateral and regional ftas with many countries around the world with much greater vigor under the banner of competitive liberalization many in the united states saw an opportunity to catch up with the eus long record of pursuing preferential agreements 7 suspension of the multilateral doha round of wto talks in july 2006 prompted the eu to move rapidly back towards strong reliance on bilateral agreements while the stated goal is to use these trade agreements as tool to enhance european competitiveness less obvious goal may now be to catch up to the united states in signing bilateral and regional trade deals bringing about convergence in the trade policies of the two economic superpowers 4 jacques

some as more natural policy position one scholar for example has argued that the eu has deeply rooted tradition of negotiating bilateral preferential agreements and of using trade policy as an instrument of foreign policy in the formulation of trade policy this scholar maintains that the eu is an incomplete state and uses trade policy as an instrument of completeness with all the attributes of sovereignty and since foreign relatio ns are inherently bilateral he argues that the use of trade policy instruments for foreign policy imparts bilateral bias8 in the context of transatlantic commercial relations case is sometimes made that the eu often uses trade for foreign policy purposes by challenging the united states on wide range of mostly technical issues not only does this approach help bolster the commissions role visavis member states as the protector of eu economic interests but also promotes its image as leading defender of rulesbased multilateralism and global governance 9 g11g150g153g149g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g143g152g155g561g157g145g142g561g9g149g152g139g138g149g561g22g155g138g141g146g151g144g561g21g162g156g157g142g150g561 eu trade officials acknowledge the risks that bilateral agenda could carry for the multilateral trading system by diverting and complicating trade by eroding the principle of non discrimination and by excluding the weakest economies to have positive impact the eu maintains that its ftas will be comprehensive in scope provide for liberalization of substantially all trade as required by the wto and go beyond current wto disciplines eu trade officials maintain that any new ftas will be wtoplus wh ich provides either wider or deeper obligations than currently exist 10 how likely one can ask might the eus potential ftas be wtoplus and serve to liberalize as well as simplify the world trading system if history is any guide the answer may not be encouraging similarly an analysis of the current hurdles posed in negotiating deep ftas across full range of sectors casts skeptical light over the eus claim that its bilateral agenda will likely become building block not stumbling block for multilateral liberalization in the long history of eu preferential agreements there has been such thing as standard trade agreement according to one study agreements usually cover most or all industrial goods but liberalization is sometimes asymmetric and transition periods differ in agriculture market access to the eu tends to be product specific selective and rarely without any form of restriction and the huge variety of preferential agreements tend to create confusing array of rules of origin that make trade more complicated and costly 11 during 2007 there was much criticism from some member states and ngos of the commissions efforts to negotiate economic partnership agreements epas with african caribbean and pacific acp developing countries these agreements were being negotiated to supplant one way preferences that expired on january 1 2008 most of the acp countries resisted signing new economic partnership agreements epas proposed by the eu on the grounds that they contained 8 patrick

round specifically many of these countries felt they were being forced to open their markets to subsidized european agricultural products or to negotiate on issues they do not want to discuss as result negotiations on full epas continue this year12 are any of the eus prospective ftas likely to buck these trends by achieving comprehensive coverage and reciprocal liberalization or market openings in sensitive sectors while it is impossible to predict with high degree of assurance reason for pessimistic view is that there are continuing strong political pressures to in sulate european agricultural producers against liberalization efforts for example to reach an fta with mercosur have been on and off for nearly decade due in part to eu reluctance to offer greater concessions on agricultural trade barriers particularly sugar and beef 13 in the view of one analyst any fta that the eu signs with the big boys such as india and china is likely to be quick and dirty and fairly tradelight furthermore he points out that both india and chinas existing ftas with other countries are narrow and shallow excluding many goods and sectors from cuts in protective tariffs prompting scepticism that they will be eager to enter into deep comprehensive agreements14 this is not to suggest that the eu is ever like ly to abandon its commitment to an open multilateral system regional blocs would be opposed by eu multinationals because they would lose far more from developments that threatened their access to global markets than they might gain from the protections that regional bloc would offer but at the same time the eu faces formidable obstacles in achieving its stated goal of driving the global trading system forward if it ends up negotiating weak and partial ftas 15

to the bush administrations agenda both economic superpowers assert that the ambitious bilateral agreements they seek to negotiate will serve to drive global liberalization forward in areas such as investment competition and public procurement where wto rules do not yet fully apply they both maintain that carefully constructed and comprehensive bilateral agreements with chosen partners can create new trade as well as new jobs for their most competitive companies and for both brussels and washington the choice of negotiating partners is based not only on market potential but also on broader political considerations while some may argue the united states thus is not in any position to complain about the thrust of the eu bilateral initiative the content of any of the eus bilateral or regional agreements reached could be different matter both comprehensive and shallow agreements may create their own set of challenges for us interests 12 judith crosbie commission defends

openness and create more trade than they divert the eu maintains that it is committed to negotiating comprehensive and balanced agreements this should benefit the united states as well but they may do so in distinctively european way the eu is itself system of market liberalization and it wants to use trade to spread its own model of regulation and market integration to the rest of the world if successful european rules on regulations affecting health and safety competition policy government procurement and investment will shape future parameters of trade liberalization beyond indirectly challenging the united states for global trade leadership this process of spreading rules and regulations for trade may also be intended to facilitate commercial success for european companies 16 shallow agreements on the other hand could lead to different kinds of tensions and rivalry hypothetically if the eu negotiated narrow deal with say south korea after the us failed to implement comprehensive agreement it could raise suspicions in washington that the eu action was driven as much by an effort to gain some kind of geostrategic advantage as commercial edge there is the possibility in turn that shallow agreements negotiated by the eu might prompt washington to move in that directi on as well with the two powers striving to outbid each other for fta partners competition between the united states and the eu to secure bilateral and regional trade agreements could be expected to promote normal commercial rivalry between the two superpowers for markets jobs and profits whet her such competition leads to form of rival regionalism between the united states and the eu remains unpredictable but the eus more activist bilateral agenda might be consideration in any congressional debate in 2008 or 2009 on the renewal of trade promotion authority some members of congress may ask what impact the eus new trade policy is likely to have on us interests particularly if the united states is not negotiating similar agreements on the one hand there may be concern that us nonparticipation in fta negotiations could affect washingtons ability to influence the international trade agenda as well as put some us exporters at competitive disadvantage on the other hand us efforts and even competition with the eu to craft new ftas could be viewed as counterproductive to the goal of strengthening the multilateral trading system g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 raymond j ahearn
