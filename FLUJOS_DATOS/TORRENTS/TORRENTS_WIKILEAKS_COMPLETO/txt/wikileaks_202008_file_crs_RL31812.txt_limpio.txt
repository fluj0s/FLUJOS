the annual legislative branch appropriations bill contains two titles appropriations for legislative branch agencies are contained in title i title ii contains general administrative provisions and from time to time appropriations for legislative branch entities for example in the fy2003 act title ii contained funding for the john c stennis center for public service training and development and the congressional award act congress changed the structure of the annual legislative branch appropriations bill effective in fy2003 prior to enactment of the fy2003 bill and effective in fy1978 the legislative branch appropriations bill was divided into two titles title i congressional operations contained budget authorities for activities directly serving congress included in this title were the budgets of the house the senate joint items joint house and senate activities the office of compliance the congressional budget office cbo the architect of the capitol aoc except the library of congress loc buildings and grounds the congressional research service crs within the library of congress and congressional printing and binding activities of the government printing office gpo title ii related agencies contained budgets for activities not directly supporting congress included in this title were budgets of the botanic garden the library of congress except the congressional research service the library buildings and grounds maintained by the architect of the capitol the government printing office except congressional printing and binding costs and the general accounting office gao periodically since fy1978 the bill contained additional titles for such purposes as capital improvements and special onetime functions crs2 in addition to activities funded in the annual legislative branch appropriations bill there are legislative budget authorities that include permanent budget authority for both federal funds and trust funds and nonlegislative entities permanent federal funds are available as the result of previously enacted legislation and do not require annual action1 permanent trust funds are monies held in accounts credited with collections from specific sources earmarked by law for defined purpose trust funds do not appear in the annual legislative bill since they are not budget authority they are included in the us budget either as budget receipts or offsetting collections2 the budget also contains nonlegislative entities within the legislative branch budget they are funded in other appropriation bills but are placed in the legislative section by the office of management and budget for bookkeeping purposes3 1 fy2004 estimated legislative branch permanent federal fund authority was 351 million comprised of house and senate member pay 109 million house and senate use of foreign currencies 8 million and library of congress payments to copyright owners 234 million source is the fy2004 us budget with figures rounded to the nearest million 2 fy2004 estimated permanent trust fund authority was 37 million comprised of library of congress gift and trust fund accounts 16 million us capitol preservation commission trust funds 1 million architect of the capitol us botanic garden gifts and donations 2 million john c stennis center for public service training and development trust funds 3 million and the russian leadership development trust funds 15 million source is the fy2004 us budget which contains figures rounded to the nearest million 3 the fy2004 us budget contains 80 million in federal funds for nonlegislative entities with one exception under two headings 1 us tax court 40 million and 2 other legislative branch agencies legislative branch boards and commissions 19 million which includes the us commission on international religious freedom 3 million subcategory titled other legislative branch boards and commissions 3 million and payment to the russian leadership development center trust fund 15 million for more accurate picture of the legislative branch budget as contained in the annual legislative branch appropriations bill the total fy2004 legislative branch appropriation figure in the fy2004 us budget must be adjusted this is accomplished by subtracting nonlegislative funds and permanent federal and trust funds nonlegislative funds are those for entities that are funded in other appropriations bills but for bookkeeping purposes are counted as legislative branch funds by the office of management and budget the fy2004 us budget contains legislative budget authority request of 42 billion after subtracting nonlegislative entities 80 million permanent federal funds 351 million and permanent trust funds 37 million the total is 37 billion crs3 table 1 legislative branch
