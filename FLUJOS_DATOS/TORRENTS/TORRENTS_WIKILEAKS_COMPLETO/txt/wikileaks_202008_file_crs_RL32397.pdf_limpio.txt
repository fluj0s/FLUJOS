office of information and regulatory affairs oira within the office of management and b udget omb executive order 12291 issued by president reagan in 1981 gave oira the responsibility to review the substance of agencies regulatory actions before publication in the federal register the offices regulatory review role was initially highly controversial and it has been criticized at different times as being both too active and too passive regarding agencies rules although oira has number of specific statutory responsibilities eg paperwork review and regulatory accounting as component of omb it is part of the executive office of the president and helps ensure that covered agencies rules reflect the presidents policies and priorities oiras current regulatory review responsibilities are detailed in executive order 12866 which was issued by president clinton in 1993 the office reviews significant draft rules from agencies other than independent regulatory agencies at both the proposed and final rulemaking stages and also informally reviews certain rules before they are formally submitted for rules that are economically significant most commonly defined as those having 100 million impact on the economy oira also reviews the economic analyses since 1994 oira has reviewed between 500 and 700 significant proposed and final rules each year and can clear the rules with or without changes return the rules to the agencies for reconsideration or encourage the agencies to withdraw them the executive order also requires oira or the rulemaking agencies to disclose certain elements of the review process to the public including the changes made at oiras recommendation september 2003 report by the general accounting office indicated that oira had significant effect on more than third of the 85 rules in the study but oiras most common effect was to suggest changes to explanatory language in the preambles to the rules at the start of the george w bush administration oira made number of changes to its review process including increased use of return letters added emphasis on economic analysis to support the rules and improvements in the transparency of the offices review process overall in contrast to the counselor role it played during the clinton administration oira appeared to have returned to the gatekeeper role that it had during its first 12 years of existence possible legislative issues involving oira include codification of the offices review function and principles increasing or decreasing the offices funding and staffing adding review of rules from independent regulatory agencies and improvements in the transparency of oiras review process this report will be updated if there are changes in oiras regulatory review responsibilities for

information and regulatory affairs oira is one of several statutory offices within the office of mana gement and budget omb1 and can play significantif not determinativerole in the rulemaking process for most federal agencies in addition to its many other responsibilities oira currently reviews the substance of between 500 and 700 significant proposed and final rules each year before agencies publish them in the federal register 2 and can clear the rules with or without change return them to the agencies for reconsideration or encourage the agencies to withdraw the rules between 70 and 100 of the rules that oira reviews each year are each considered economically significant or major eg have 100 million impact on the economy the office was created by congress and has number of specific statutory responsibilities but also helps ensure that agencies rules reflect the presidents policies and priorities oiras role in the federal rulemaking process has been highly controversial in all four of the presidential administrations in which it has been in existence but some of the criticisms directed at the office have varied over time in some administrations oira has been accused of controlling the agenda of the rulemaking agencies too much directing them to change substantive provisions in draft rules or even stopping proposed regulatory actions that it believes are poorly crafted or unnecessary at other times though oira has been accused of not exerting enough authority over the agencies rules other more persistent criticisms have focused on the lack of transparency of oiras regulatory reviews to the public and the sometimes unseen influence that regulated entities and other nongovernmental organizations can have on agencies rules through those reviews this report describes how oira reviews covered agencies draft rules oiras effects on the rules and changes in oiras procedures and policies in recent years much of that discussion is drawn from september 2003 report on oira by the general accounting office gao now the government accountability office 3 first though this report will provide brief history of presidential regulatory review and describe how

collectively referred to as the management side of omb are the office of federal financial management the office of federal procurement policy and the office of electronic government and information technology ombs resource management offices which review agencies budget submissions are sometimes collectively referred to as ombs budget side 2 the administrative procedure act of 1946 5 usc 551 et

director on federal information policy the act also said that the director of omb shall delegate to the oira administrator the authority to administer all functions under this chapter specific areas of responsibility in the pra that were assigned to the director and later delegated to oira included information policy information collection request clearance and paperwork control statistical policy and coordination records management privacy and automatic data processing and telecommunications 5 with regard to paperwork reduction the act generally prohibited agencies from conducting or sponsoring collection of information until they had submitted their proposed information collection requests to oira and the office had approved those requests the pras requirements cover rules issued by virtually all agencies including cabinet departments independent agen cies and independent regulatory agencies and commissions6 although the pra gave oira substantive responsibilities in many areas the bulk of the offices daytoday activities under the act were initially focused on reviewing and approving agencies proposed information collection requests oira had 77 staff members when the pra took effect in 1981 of which about half were involved in reviewing agencies information collection requests that year oira took nearly 5000 paperwork review actionsapproving new and revised collections extending existing collections and reinstating expired collections the offices paperwork clearance workload since then has generally been between 4000 and 6000 actions each year although the number of oira staff overall and those reviewing proposed collections has declined substantially 7 many federal regulations have an information collection component but the pra did not authorize oira to review or comment on the nonpaperwork elements of those regulations or on regulations without an information collection component8

in 1980 president reagan was elected on platform critical of governments role in society in general and of federal regulations in particular shortly after taking office he established presidential task force on regulatory relief headed by vice president george h w bush and composed of cabinet officers although the bulk of the task forces work was reportedly performed by omb staff the task forces responsibilities included 1 monitoring the establishment of ombs responsibility to coordinate and review new rules 2 the development of legislative changes to regulatory statutes and 3 the revision of existing regulations in 5 the pra was later amended in 1986 and again in 1995 and the list of oiras duties changed somewhat for example the 1986 amendments sharpened the management focus of the act and changed information policy to information resources management as discussed later in this report the 1986 amendment also required the administrator of oira to be appointed by the president subject to advice and consent of the senate 6 as used in this report the term independent regulatory agencies refers to agencies established to be independent of the president including the federal communications commi ssion the securities and exchange commission and the consumer product safety commission the term independent agencies refers to agencies that are independent of cabinet departments but not independent regulatory agencies eg the environmental protection agency and the office of personnel management 7 for example by 1989 oiras overall staffing had declined to fewer than 60 employees of whom oira estimated 35 were reviewing information collection requests by 1997 oira staffing declined 48 employees of whom 22 were reviewing paperwork requests see us general

identified total of 119 rules for alteration or cancellation by the issuing agencies nearly half of which had been issued by the department of transportation or the environmen tal protection agency although the task force said that implementation of the changes it recommended would save more than 150 billion over the next 10 years critics charged that this estimate ignored the benefits associated with the rules on what they referred to as the administrations regulatory hit list the task forces legislative efforts were less successful failing to get congress to enact revisions to clean air and water laws or to enact broad regulatory reform legislation that would have limited agencies rulemaking powers 9 in february 1981less than one month after taking officepresident reagan issued executive order 1229110 on federal regulation which greatly increased both the scope and importance of oiras responsibilities11 specifically the executive order generally required covered agencies cabinet departments and independent agencies but not independent regulatory agencies to refrain from taking regulatory action unless the potential benefits to society for the regulation outweigh the potential costs to society select regulatory objectives to maximize net benefits to society and select the regulatory alternative that involves the least net cost to society prepare regulatory impact analysis for each major rule which was defined as any regulation likely to result in among other things an annual effect on the economy of 100 million those analyses were required to contain description of the potential benefits and costs of the rule description of alternative approaches that could achieve the regulatory goal at lower cost and why they werent selected and determination of the net benefits of the rule the issuing agency was to make the initial determination of whether rule was major but the executive order gave omb the authority to require rule to be considered major and send copy of each draft proposed and final rule to omb before publication in the federal register the order authorized omb to review any preliminary or final regulatory impact analysis notice of proposed rulemaking or final rule based on the requirements of this order nonmajor rules were required to be submitted to omb at least 10 days before publication but major rules had to be submitted as much as 60 days in advance executive order 12291 authorized the director of omb to review any draft proposed or final rule or regulatory impact analysis based on the requirements of this order the executive order indicated that the review should be completed within 60 days but allowed the director to extend that period whenever necessary it also authorized the director to exempt classes of regulations from any or all of the orders requirements 12 and generally required agencies to refrain from 9 the task force was disbanded in august 1983 after issuing final report 10

not specifically mention oira shortly after its issuance the reagan administration decided to integrate ombs regulatory review responsibilities under the executive order with the responsibilities given to omb and ultimately to oira by the pra as result oiras responsibilities for substantive review of rules under the executive order were added to the offices substantial responsibilities under the pra in 1981 oira reviewed the substance of nearly 2800 rules under executive order 12291in addition to the nearly 5000 paperwork review actions it took that year in 1985 president reagan extended oiras influence over rulemaking even further by issuing executive order 12498 which required cabinet department and independent agencies but not independent regulatory agencies to submit regulatory program to omb for review each year that covered all of their significant regulatory actions underway or planned 14 previously executive order 12291 required each of those agencies to publish semiannual regulatory agendas of proposed regulations that the agency has issued or expects to issue and any existing rule that was under review15 these agendas were required to contain schedule for completing action on any major rule for which the agency had published notice of proposed rulemaking the new executive order went further saying that except in unusual circumstances omb could return any rule submitted for review under executive order 12291 to the issuing agency for reconsideration if it was not in the agencys regulatory program for that year or was materially different from what was described in the program in other words oira could return draft rule to an issuing agency if the office did not have advance notice of the rules submission even if the rule was otherwise consistent with the requirements in executive order 12291 16 the regulatory agenda and program requirements in these executive orders also permitted oira to become aware of forthcoming agency actions well in advance of the submission of draft proposed rule thereby permitting the office to stop or alter an objectionable rule before the rulemaking process developed momentum although reagan administration officials compared this planning process to the process used to develop the presidents budget critics noted that the budget process has final step that the regulatory process lacksreview and approval by congress continued substantial costs and that were unlikely to involve significant policy issues omb granted about 30 exemptions most of which were established in 1981 or 1982 13 although the task force was chaired by vice president bush the executive director was the administrator of oira other members included the director of omb the attorney general and the secretaries of commerce labor and the treasury 14 executive order 12498 regulatory planning process 50 federal register 1036 jan 8 1985 15 as discussed later in this report president cart er first required the use of these agendas in 1978 16 an oira representative said that although the office had th is authority it never used it noting that would have been difficult to defend the return of an agencys rule for purely procedural reasons

the establishment of this regulatory review function within oira was significant development both in the offices history and in the overall movement to reform the federal regulatory process in another sense though executive orders 12291 and 12498 represented the continuation of presidential review of rules not the start of ch reviews some form of centralized review of agencies regulations within the executive office of the president has been part of the rulemaking process since the early 1970s for example in 1971 president nixon established quality of life review program in which executive departments and independent agencies submitted all significant draft proposed and final rules pertaining to environmental quality consumer protection and occupational and public health and safety to omb which then circulated them to other agencies for comment 17 in their submissions agencies were to provide summary of their proposals including their principal objectives the alternatives that they considered and comparison of the expected benefits and cost of those alternatives agencies were also required to submit schedule showing estimated dates of proposed and final significant rules in 1974 president ford issued executive order 11821 which required agencies to prepare an inflation impact statement for each major proposed rule18 the statement was certification that the inflationary impact of the rule had been evaluated in accordance with criteria and procedures developed by omb the executive order directed omb to develop criteria for the identification of major rules that may have significant impact on inflation but specified that the office must consider costs effects on productivity effects on competition and effects on supplies of important products and services before major rule was published in the federal register the issuing agency was required to submit the associated impact statement to the council on wage and price stability cwps cwps would then either provide comments directly to the agency or participate in the regular rulemaking comment process in 1978 president carter issued executive order 12044 which among other things required agencies to publish semiannual agendas of any significant rules under development or review and to prepare regulatory analysis for at least all rules with 100 million impact on the economy 19 the analysis was to contain succinct statement of the problem description of the alternative approaches considered and the economic consequences of those alternatives omb was instructed to assure the effective implementation of this order but was not given specific review responsibilities president carter also established 1 regulatory analysis review group rarg to review the analyses prepared for certain major rules and to submit comments during the comment period and 17 this requirement was formally established through an october 1971 memorandum from thenomb director george schultz according to some observers the requirements were routinely imposed only on the environmental protection agency 18 executive order 11821 inflation impact statements 39 federal register 41501 nov 29 1974 the order also required such

conflicting requirements and duplication of effort in several ways though the analytical and review requirements in executive order 12291 were significantly different from these previous efforts for example the requirement in the new executive order that agencies choose the least costly approach to particular regulatory objective went further than the requirement in president carters executive order 12044 which simply required agencies to analyze and consider alternative regulatory approaches also whereas the regulatory oversight functions were divided among many offices omb cwps rarg and the regulatory council during the carter administration executive order 12291 consolidated these functions within oira 20 another major difference was the amount of influence that oira had compared to its predecessors under previous executive orders cwps and rarg had primarily an advisory role in contrast under executive order 12291 oira could overrule agency determinations regarding whether the rule was major and therefore required regulatory impact analysis and could delay the regulation until the agency had adequately responded to its concerns eg if it believed the agency had not considered all reasonable alternatives that its analysis was not sound or that it was contrary to administration policy oiras significant influence on rulemaking was underscored by its organizational position within ombthe agency that reviews and approves the rulemaking agencies budget requests finally and perhaps most importantly the nature and transparency of the review process was significantly different under executive order 12291 under the carter administ rations approach rarg and cwps prepared and filed comments on agencies regulatory proposals during the formal public comment period after they were published in the federal register in the case of rarg filings draft of the comments was circulated to all rarg members and the comments and any dissents were placed on the public record at the close of the comment period in contrast oiras reviews occurred before the rules were published for comment and executive order 12291 did not require that oiras comments on the draft rule be disclosed this prepublication review process made oiras regulatory reviews under executive order 12291 qualitatively different than its predecessors

executive orders 12291 and 12498 was highly controversial although some believed that the authority did not go far enough eg did not cover independent regulatory agencies most of the concerns were that the expansion had gone too far for example num ber of the concerns raised by members of congress public interest groups and others focused on whether oiras role violated the constitutional separation of powers and the effect that oiras review had on public participation and the timeliness of agencies rules 21 some believed that oiras new authority displaced the discretionary authority of agency decision makers in violation of congressional delegations of rulemaking authority and that the president ex ceeded his authority in issuing the executive orders others indicated that oi ra

focused on oiras ability to carry out its many responsibilities in 1983 gao concluded that the expansion of oiras responsibilities under executive order 12291 had adversely affected the offices ability to carry out its pra responsibilities and recommended that congress consider amending the act to prohibit oira from carrying out other responsibilities like regulatory review22 many of the early concerns about oira focused on the lack of transparency of the regulatory reviews and specifically questioned whether oira had become clandestine conduit for outside influence in the rulemaking process critics pointed out that in the first few months after the executive order was issued oira met with representatives from dozens of businesses and associations seeking regulatory relief and returned dozens of rules to the agencies for reconsideration23 in response to these concerns the omb director issued memorandum in june 1981 stating that any factual material provided to oira regarding proposed rules should also be sent to the relevant rulemaking agency the morandum did not however apply to information provided to oira orally and did not require that oiras meetings with outside parties be disclosed to the public oiras role in the rulemaking process remained controversial for the next several years in 1983 congress was so dissatisfied with oiras performance in the areas of regulatory and paperwork review that it permitted the offices appropriation authority to expire although the offices statutory authority under the pra was not affected and it continued to receive an appropriation via omb 24 in 1985 five house committee chairmen filed friendofthecourt brief in lawsuit brought against the department of labor regardin g the departments decision reportedly at the behest of omb not to pursue proposed standard concerning exposure to ethylene oxide sterilizing chemical widely used in hospitals and suspected of causing cancer the chairmen claimed that ombs actions represented usurpation of congressional authority congress reauthorized oira in 1986 but only after making the administrator subject to senate confirmation by 1986 congress began considering legislation to restrict oiras regulatory review role and to block oiras budget request in an attempt to head off that legislation in june 1986 the oira administrator issued memorandum for the heads of departments and agencies subject to executive order 12291 describing new oira procedures to improve the transparency of the review process for example the memora ndum said that only the administrator or the deputy administrator could communicate with outside parties regarding rules submitted for review and that oira would make available to the public all written materials received from outside parties oira also said that it would upon written request after rule had been published make available all written correspondence between oira and the agency head regarding the draft submitted for review 25 in 1987 the national academy of public administration published report on presidential management of agency rulemaking that summarized the criticisms of the oira review process as 22 us

described number of issues in regulatory review and offered recommendations for improvement for example the report recommended that regulatory management be accepted as an essential element of presidential management it also recommended that regulatory agencies log summarize and include in the rulemaking record all communications from outside parties omb or other executive or legislative branch officials concerning the merits of proposed regulations in 1988 the administrative conference of the united states also examined the issue of presidential review of agency rulemaking and concluded that the reviews could improve coordination and resolve conflicts among agencies27 the administrative conference also said though that presidential review does not displace responsibilities placed in the agency by law nor authorize the use of factors not otherwise permitted by law the conference recommended public disclosure of proposed and final agency rules submitted to oira under the executive order communications from omb relating to the substance of rules and communications with outside parties and also recommended that the reviews be completed in timely fashion 28

continued the implementation of executive orders 12291 and 12498 during his administration but external events significantly affected oiras operation and more generally the federal rulemaking process in 1989 president bushs nominee to head oira was not confirmed later in response to published accounts that the burden of regulation was once again increasing president bush established the presidents council on competitiveness also known as the competitiveness council to review regulations issued by agencies chaired by vice president quayle the council oversaw and was supported by oira and reviewed particular rules that it believed would have significant impact on the economy or particular industries according to oira representatives the council signified continued white houselevel interest in the regulatory arena and also represented continuation of the type of role played by the presidential task force on regulatory relief during the reagan administration many of the competitiveness councils actions were highly controversial with critics assailing both the effects of those actions eg rolling back environmental or other requirements and the secrecy in which the council acted 29 the council attempted to maintain strict secrecy regarding both its deliberations and those in the private sector with whom it communicated or consulted30 critics decried what they believed to be backdoor rulemaking by the competitiveness council but the council continued its operations until the end of the bush administration in 1993 26 national academy of public administration

president clinton issued executive order 12866 on regulatory planning and review which revoked executive orders 12291 and 12498 and abolished the council on competitiveness31 although different from its predecessors in many respects executive order 12866 which is still in effect continued the ge neral framework of presidential review of rulemaking for example it requires covered agencies again cabinet departments and independent agencies but not independent regulatory agencies to submit their proposed and final rules to omb before publishing them in the federal register the order also requires agencies to prepare costbenefit analyses for their economically significant rules essentially the same as major rules under executive order 12291 as discussed in detail below however executive order 12866 established somewhat new regulatory philosophy and new set of rulemaking principles limited oiras reviews to certain types of rules and established transparency requirements that included but went beyond those that had been put in place by the administrators june 1986 memorandum section 2b of the order assigns responsibility for review of agency rulemaking to omb and specifically names oira as the repository of expertise concerning regulatory issues the order also named the vice president as principal advisor to the president on regulatory policy planning and

regulatory philosophy executive order 12866 says among other things that agencies should assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives including both quantitative and qualitative measures it also provides that agencies should select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits unless statute requires another approach where permissible and applicable the order states that agencies should adhere to set of principles when developing rules including 1 consideration of the degree and nature of risk posed when setting regulatory priorities 2 adoption of regulations only upon reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify its costs and 3 tailoring regulations to impose the least burden on society needed to achieve the regulatory objectives some of the stated objectives of the order are to reaffirm the primacy of federal agencies in the regulatory decisionmaking process to restore the integrity and legitimacy of regulatory review and oversight and to make the process more accessible and open to the public according to oira representatives the primacy of the agencies provision signaled significant change in regulatory philosophy vesting greater control of the rulemaking process with regulatory agencies and taking away authority from oira also the requirement that the benefits of regulation justify its costs was noticeably lower threshold than the requirement in executive order 12291 that the benefits outweigh the costs 31 executive order 12866 regulatory planning and review 58 federal register 51735 oct 4 1993 for an

to result in rule that may 1 have an annual effect on the economy of 100 million or more or adversely affect in material way the economy sector of the economy productivity competition jobs the

rulemaking35 in each phase the review process starts when the rulemaking agency formally submits regulatory review package to oira consisting of the rule any supporting materials and transmittal form the oira docket librarian th logs the receipt of the review package and forwards it to the appropriate desk officer in some cases agencies withdraw their rules from oira during the review period and the rules may or may not be subsequently resubmitted at the end of the review period oira either returns the dr aft rule to the agency for reconsideration or oira concludes that the rule is consistent with the executive order oira codes the rule in its database as consistent with change if there had been any changes to the rule regardless of the source or extent of the change oira codes rules in its database as consistent with change only if they are exactly the same at the end of the review period as the original submission if the draft rule is proposed rule and is judged by oira to be consistent with the executive order the agency may then publish notice of proposed rulemaking in the federal register obtain comments during the specified comment period review the comments received and make any changes to the rule that it believes are necessary to respond to those comments executive order 12866 says that this comment period should in most cases be at least 60 days for significant rules reviewed by oira if the draft is final rule the agency may publish the rule after oira concludes its review and the rule will generally take effect either at that point or at some later date specified by the agency 34 for discussion of the differences between the transparency requirements under executive order 12291 and executive order 12866 see william d araiza judicial and

consistent with change or consistent without change see table 1 only small percentage of rules were withdrawn and even fewer were returned to the agencies the proportion of rules coded as changed has varied somewhat over time but the last several years of the clinton administration 1997 through 2000 were fairly similar to the most recent nontran sition years of the george w bush administration 2002 through 2005 the data indicate that there were relatively large number of rules that were withdrawn and returned in 2001 compared to other years the withdrawn rules reflect actions taken at the start of the george w bush administration pursuant to memorandum issued by assistant to the president and chief of st aff andrew h card which generally directed cabinet departments and independent agencies to 1 not send proposed or final rules to the office of the federal register 2 withdraw from the office rules that had not yet been published in the federal register and 3 postpone for 60 days

depends on the type of draft rule submitted for example if the draft rule contains collection of information covered by the pra the desk officer would also review it for compliance with that act if the draft rule is economically significant eg has an annual impact on the economy of at least 100 million the executive order requires agencies to prepare an economic analysis describing among other things the alternatives that the agency considered and the costs and benefits of those alternatives 37 for those economically significant rules oira desk officers are to review the economic analyses using the offices guidance on how to prepare regulatory analyses under the executive order38 an attachment to september 20 2001 memorandum to the presidents management council described the general principles and procedures that oira reportedly uses in the implementation of executive order 1286639 for example the attachment indicated that the office would where 37 section 3f of the executive

order 13175 on consultation and coordination with indian and tribal governments 4 consult with the small business administration sba and the sba chief counsel for advocacy and 5 ensure that agencies evaluate the possible impact of the draft rule on the programs of other federal agencies there is usually some type of communication during the review process often via email or telephone between the oira desk officer and the rulemaking agency regarding specific issues in the draft rule briefings and meetings are sometimes held between oira and the agency during the review process with oira branch chiefs the deputy administrator or the administrator involved in some of these meetings according to oira representatives the desk officers always consult with the resource management officers on the budget side of omb as part of their reviews and reviews of draft rules are not completed until those resource management officers sign off if the draft rule is economically significant the desk officer would also consult with government economist to help review the required economic analysis for other rules the desk officer might consult with other oira staff on issues involving statistics and surveys information technology and systems or privacy issues in certain cases oira may circulate draft rule to other parts of the executive office of the president eg the office of science and technology policy or the council on environmental quality or other agencies eg the departments of energy the interior or transportation for certain environmental protection agency rules executive order 12866 requires oira to complete its regulatory reviews within certain time frames1 within 10 working days of submission for any preliminary actions prior to notice of proposed rulemaking eg notice of inquiry or an advance notice of proposed rulemaking or 2 within 90 calendar days of submission for all other regulatory actions or 45 days if oira had previously reviewed the material in some instances however agency officials said oira will ask the rulemaking agency to withdraw the rule and resubmit it restarting the review period the executive order does not permit oira to approve or disapprove draft rule it is up to the agency to decide whether to proceed with publication of rule after it had been returned or to accept oiras suggested changes oira representatives said it is often an iterative process in which the agencies and oira negotiate issues and clarify terms nevertheless agencies very rarely publish rules that oira returns or ignore substantive oira suggestions in some instances agency officials will formally or info rmally appeal oira determinations to the white house g17g11g20g3g514g156g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g149g561g20g142g159g146g142g160g156g561 figure 2 also shows that for some rules there is an additional phase of informal review before the rule is officially submitted to oira in its december 2001 report on the costs and benefits of federal

there may be strong institutional momentum behind the proposal and as result the agency may be reluctant to address certain issues that oira analysts might raise therefore oira indicated there is value in promoting role for oiras analytic perspective earlier in the process before the agency becomes too entrenched oira went on to state the following common yet informal practice is for agencies to share preliminary drafts of rules andor analyses with oira desk officers prior to formal decision making at the agency this practice is useful for agencies since they have the opportunity to educate oira desk officers in more patient way before the formal 90day review clock at omb begins to tick the practice is also useful for oira analysts because they have the opportunity to flag serious problems early enough to facilitate correction before the agencys position is irreversible oira cannot informally review each of the hundreds of significant proposed and final rules that are submitted to the office each year informal reviews are most common when there is statutory or legal deadline for rule or when the rule is extremely large and requires discussion with not only omb but also other federal agencies the environmental protection agency epa and the departments of agriculture health and human services and transportation often issue those types of rules and therefore are more likely to have their rules reviewed informally before formal submission oira has informally reviewed agencies draft rules since its review function was established in 1981 but informal reviews reportedly became more common when executive order 12866 was adopted in 1993 and oiras reviews were focused on significant rules there have been some indications though that oira has increased its use of informal reviews even further in recent years for example in its march 2002 draft report to congress on the costs and benefits of federal regulation oira said agencies are beginning to invite oira staff into earlier phases of regulatory development in order to prevent returns late in the rulemaking process it is at these early stages where oiras analytic approach can most improve on the quality of regulatory analyses and the substance of rules separately in 2002 the oira administrator said an increasing number of agencies are becoming more receptive to early discussions with omb at least on highly significant rulemakings 41 the administrator also indicated that agencies receptivity to informal reviews may be enhanced by the possibility of returned rule for example in early 2002 he said that oira was trying to create an incentive for agencies to come to us when they know they have something that in the final analysis is going to be someth ing were going to be looking at carefully and i think that agencies that wait until the last minute and then come to uswell in sense theyre rolling the dice 42

advent of executive order 12988 concluded that oiras reviews resulted in the reje ction of some regulations that would have been economically inefficient but did not appear to have improved the costeffectiveness eg costs perlife saved of many of the rules43 other studies have used oiras database showing the number of rules that were coded as consistent with change and consistent without change in an attempt to determine the significance of oiras effects on agencies rules and whether those effects have changed over time 44 as mentioned previously however the consistent with change code includes changes made at the initiation of the agencies as well as changes suggested by oira also the code does not differentiate between minor editorial changes and changes that radically alter the effect of the rule returns and withdrawals in oiras database also need careful interpretation return may be for purely administrative reasons not for substantive oira objections conversely withdrawal of rule by an agency may have been initiated by oira in order to use these data effectively researchers should examine the associated documentation in the agencies and oiras rulemaking

significantly changed rules were from epas office of air and radiation or its office of water for example at oiras recommendation epa removed manganese from list of hazardous wastes deleted certain types of engines from coverage of rule setting emissions standards and delayed the compliance dates for two other types of emissions of the remaining 54 changed rules the most significant changes made at oiras suggestion involved adding explanatory language to the preambles of the rules and asking for co mment on particular provisions in 20 of the 54 rules oira suggested only minor editorial changes eg correcting spelling errors or citations or made suggestions at all of the nine rules that had been returned to the agencies by oira two were returned because they had been improperly submitted not because of substantive defect oira returned the remaining seven rules because of concerns about the agencies regulatory analyses or perceived lack of coordination between rulemaking agencies for example oira returned one epa rule because the agency did not provide quantitative analysis of costs and benefits and returned nhtsa rule because oira did not believe that the agency had demonstrated that it had selected the best available alternative five of the seven rules returned for substantive reasons had been submitted by the faa of the five rules that were withdrawn gao determined that only one had been withdrawn at oiras suggestion the other four rules were withdrawn solely at the agencies initiative or as result of mutual decision by the agencies and oira if anything gaos analysis understates the influence that oira has on agencies rules because its findings were often limited to the documentation that was available if oira suggested change to rule before it was formally submitte d to oira eg during informal review gaos analysis would not reflect those changes in fact the rule might not have even been in the universe of rules that gao examined ie those coded as changed returned or withdrawn during oiras formal review other forms of oira influence may be even more indirect and harder to document for example some agencies have indicated that they do not even propose certain regulatory provisions because they believe that oira would find them objectionable

directly contacted oira either before or during its review process regarding 11 of the 25 rules that oira significantly affected46 eight of those 11 cases involved epa rules and the nature of the contacts ranged from meetings with oira representatives to letters sent to oira in 7 of the 11 cases gao concluded that what oira ultimately recommended to the rulemaking agencies was similar to what these regulated parties recommended to oirain some cases using similar language to that used by the regulated entities for example during oiras review of an epa rule on identification and listing of hazardous waste industry representatives met with and sent letters to oira opposing the listing of manganese as hazardous waste constituent the industry representatives had made essentially the same argument to epa during the public comment phase but epa did not agree the main focus of oiras comments to epa at the conclusion of its review was that final action on listing manganese as hazardous contaminant should be deferred notwithstanding the congruence between the comments of the regulated entities and oiras comments gao said it was impossible to determine the extent to which this or other suggestions made by the regulated entities might have influenced oiras actions if at all

executive order 12866 was issued in 199347 there have however been several subtle yet notable changes in oira policies and practices in recent yearsparticularly after dr john d graham became oira administrator in july 2001 in october 2002 administrator graham said the changes we are making at omb in pursuit of smarter regulation are not headline grabbers farreaching legislative initiatives rhetoricladen executive orders and campaigns of regulatory relief yet we are making some changes that we believe will have longlasting impact on the regulatory state 48

criticized for acting as regulatory gatekeeper actively overseeing and recommending changes to agencies rules during the clinton administration however the opposit concerns were expressed number of observers criticized oira for not overseeing the actions of the rulemaking agencies more aggressively in september 1996 the thenadministrator of oira testified that we have consciously changed the way we relate to the agencies and described oiras relationship with 46 environmental and public interest groups also contacted oira regarding three of the rules 47 there has been only one amendment to

also said she agreed with an article that said oira functioned during that pe riod more as counselor during the review process than as an enforcer of the executive order50 oira during the george w bush administration has returned to the role it had during the reagan administration even describing itself in an annual report as the gatekeeper for new rulemakings51 oira administrator graham said one of the offices functions is to protect people from poorly designed rules and said oira review is way to combat the tunnel vision that plagues the thinking of singlemission regulators he has also compared oiras review of agencies rules to ombs role in reviewing agencies budget requests this return to the gatekeeper perspective of oiras role has implications for an array of oiras functions and

previously in table 1 during the clinton administration oira only rarely returned rules to the agencies for reconsideration specifically according to oiras database of the more than 4000 rules that oira reviewed from 1994 through 2000 oira returned only seven rules to the agenciesthree in 1995 and four in 1997 oira administrators during that period said they viewed the use of return letters as evidence of the failure of the collaborative review process since oira and the agencies were part of the same presidential administration in contrast oira administrator graham referred to return letters as the offices ultimate weapon and viewed them as way to make clea r that the office is serious about the review process in the first eight months after he took office in july 2001 oira returned 21 draft rules to the agencies for reconsideration dot had the most rules returned during 2001 and 2002 eight followed by the social security administration five and the department of veterans affairs four 52 the letters commonly indicated that oira returned the rules because of concerns about the agencies analyses eg whether the agencies had considered all reasonable alternatives or had selected the alternative that would yield the greatest net benefits subsequently however the pace of oiras return letters slowed although the average number of rules that oira reviewed each month stayed about the same in the period from march 2002 until january 2008 oira returned total of seven draft rules to the agenciesa dramatic decline from the 21 returns during administrator grahams first eight months in office 53 oira officials attributed the decline in return letters to the improved quality of agencies regulatory submissions after the initial flurry of returns 49 us congress

force in the rulemaking process commenting on draft proposed and final rules that are generated by the agencies although oira occasionally suggested regulatory topics to the agencies during previous administrations the practice was relatively uncommon and the discussions were not made public in contrast oira administrator graham was more publicly proactive sending several agencies prompt letters and posting them on the oira website suggesting that they develop regulations in particular area or encouraging the agencies ongoing efforts 54 for example one such letter encouraged nhtsa to give greater priority to modifying its frontal occupant protection standard and another letter suggested that osha make the promotion of automatic external heart defibrillators higher priority other prompt letters recommended that the agencies better focus certain research or programs between september 2001 and december 20 03 oira sent total of 13 prompt letters to regulatory agencies and several of the agencies took action in response to the letters since then however the number of prompt letters diminished substantially only two prompt letters were issued in 2004 none in 2005 one in 2006 and none in 2007 g11g151g140g155g142g138g156g142g141g561g7g150g153g145g138g156g146g156g561g152g151g561g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g3g151g138g149g162g156g146g156g561 although oira has always encouraged agencies to provide welldeveloped economic analyses for their draft rules administrator graham expressed greater interest in this issue than his predecessors also according to agency officials there has been perceptible stepping up the bar in the amount of support required for their rules with oira reportedly more often looking for regulatory benefits to be quantified and costbenefit analysis for every regulatory option that the agency considered not just the option selected in september 2003 oira published revised guidelines for economic analysis under the executive orderupdating best practices guidance issued in january 1996 55 the new guidelines were generally similar to the earlier guidance but differed in several key areaseg encouraging agencies to 1 perform both costeffectiveness and costbenefit analyses in support of their major rules56 2 use multiple discount rates when the benefits and costs of rules are expected to occur in different time periods57 and 3 use formal probability analysis of benefits and costs when rule is expected to have more than 1 billion impact on the economy unless the effects of the rule are clear although oira has said that regulations based on economic analysis are more likely to be better than those that are not it has also signaled that these analyses are sometimes difficult or 54 copies of these prompt letters are available on ombs website at httpwwwwhitehousegovombinforeg prompt_letterhtml 55 as noted earlier in this report this guidance omb circ ular a4 is available at httpwwwwhitehousegovomb circularsa004a4pdf 56 costbenefit analysis involves the syst ematic identification of all costs and benefits associated with forthcoming regulation costeffectiveness analysis seeks to determine how given goal can be achieved at the least cost in contrast to costbenefit analysis the concern in costeffectiveness analys is is not with weighing the merits of the goal but with identifying and analyzing the costs of alternatives to reach that goal eg dollars per life saved 57 discounting can have significant effect on the present value of future health benefits for example in february 2003 speech the oira administrator noted that the present value of 1000 lives saved 50 years in the future is only 34 lives in present value when evaluated at 7 discount rate

administrator graham said homeland security regulations account for about half of our majorrule costs in 2004 but we do not yet have feasible way to fully quantify benefits58 he also said that costbenefit analysis may not be appropriate for homeland security rules and that more practical soft test was being used for them59 some have questioned why assessments of homeland security rules should be treated differently than health safety and environmental rules60 g11g151g140g155g142g138g156g142g141g561g22g155g138g151g156g153g138g155g142g151g140g162g561 as noted previously many of the longstanding concerns about oiras role in the rulemaking process have centered on the perceived lack of transparency of its reviews executive order 12866 attempted to address some of those concerns requiring among other things that agencies disclose after the publication of rule the changes made to the rule during oiras review and the changes made at the suggestion or recommendation of oira the executive order requires oira to maintain publicly available log disclosing the status of all regulatory actions under review and the names and dates of those involved in substantive oral communications eg meetings telephone calls between oira staff and parties outside of the executive branch these requirements notwithstanding concerns about the lack of transparency continued for example even after issuance of the executive order oira disclosed contacts with outside parties only if they occurred during the offices formal review pe riod not if they occurred during its informal reviews in october 2001 the oira administrator published memorandum to oira staff on the offices website that extended the executive orders disclosure requirements in several areas for example the memorandum said that oira would disclose substantive meetings and other contacts with outside parties about rule under review even if oira was only informally reviewing the rule oira also said it would disclose substantive telephone calls with outside parties that were initiated by the administrator not just calls initiated by outside parties oira has also posted on its website lists of regulations currently under review 61 reviews concluded in the previous 30 days62 and its contacts with outside parties63 although these changes have improved the transparency of oiras reviews as discussed later in this report the effects of oiras reviews particularly informal reviews are not always apparent 58 john graham the smartregulation agenda progress and challenges speech before the

members by 1997 oiras fte allocation had declined to 47a nearly 50 reduction although executive order 12866 issued in late 1993 permitted oira to focus its resources on significant rules this decline in oira staffing also occurred during period in which regulatory agencies staffing and budgetary levels were increasing and oira was given number of new statutory responsibilities specifically as discussed later in this report oira was expected to perform various duties under the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 the small business regulatory enforcement fairness act of 1996 and the regulatory righttoknow act of 2001 starting in 2001 oiras staffing authorization began to increase by 2002 it stood at 55 ftes between 2001 and 2003 oira hired five new staff members in such fields as epidemiology risk assessment engineering and health economics oira indicated that these new hires reflected the increasing importance of sciencebased regulation in federal agencies and would enable

government65 the most important changes made to executive order 12866 by executive order 13422 fall into five general categories 1 requirement that ag encies identify in writing the specific market failure or problem that warrants new regulation 2 requirement that each agency head designate presidential appointee within the agency as regulatory policy officer who can control upcoming rulemaking activity in that agency 3 requirement that agencies provide their best estimates of the cumulative regulatory costs and benefits of rules they expect to publish in the coming year 4 an expansion of

executive order 13422 may become clear only through their implementation the changes made by this executive order represent clear expansion of presidential authority over rulemaking agencies in that regard executive order 13422 can be viewed as part of broader statement of presidential authority presented throughout the bush administration

its multiple responsibilities under the paperwork reduction act paperwork review information resources management statistical policy and coordination records management privacy and security and information technology congress has assigned oira number of other specific functions related to the rulemaking and regulatory process for example the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 2 usc 15321538 generally requires agencies to prepare written statements describing the effects of their rules that are subject to the acts requirements the act requires the director of omb to collect those written statements and provide them to the congressional budget office to establish pilot programs to test innovative regulatory approaches and to prepare an annual report on the implementation of the act the omb director has delegated these responsibilities to oira 67 the small business regulatory enforcement fairness act of 1996 sbrefa 5 usc 601 note required epa and osha to convene advocacy review panels before publishing proposed rules expected to have significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities68 the act specifically requires the review panel to include fulltime employees from oira as well as other agencies sbrefa also contains provisions commonly referred to as the congressional review act which among other things requires agencies to delay the effective date of major rules and requires gao to submit report on those rules within 15 days of their issuance sbrefa defines major rule as one that the oira administrator concludes has resulted or is likely to result in among other things 100 million annual effect on the economy 69 section 515 of the treasury and general government appropriations act for fiscal year 2001 44 usc 3504 d1 and 3516 generally known as the data quality act or the information quality act directed omb to take several actions all of which were delegated to oira specifically the act required omb to issue governmentwide guidelines that provide policy and procedural guidance to federal agencies for ensuring and maximizing the quality objectivity utility and integrity of information including statistical information 67

guidelines in final form on february 22 200270 the act also required agencies to develop their own guidelines which were reviewed by omb and to report to omb on the number and nature of complaints received and how such complaints were handled by the agency section 624 of the treasury and general government appropriations act 2001 31 usc 1105 note sometimes known as the regulatory righttoknow act requires omb to prepare and submit with the budget an annual accounting statement and associated report containing an estimate of the costs and benefits including quantifiable and nonquantifiable effects of federal rules and paperwork to the extent feasible 1 in the aggregate 2 by agency and agency program and 3 by major rule the accounting statement is also required to contain an analysis of impacts of federal regulation on state local and tribal governments small businesses wages and economic growth similar oneyear requirements were in previous appropriations acts the same legislation requires omb to include recommendations for reform in its costbenefit reports rather than rely on its own expertise oira decided to solicit suggestions from the public for example in march 2002 oira asked the public for recommendations to eliminate or modify existing rules as well as to expand or extend existing programs in response oira received more than 300 suggestions which oira turned over to the appropriate agencies for prioritization in february 2004 oira asked the public for suggested reforms of rules affecting the manufacturing sector oira said it was focusing on manufacturing because of the relatively large impact that regulations have on that sector 71 the small business paperwork relief act of 2002 pl 107198 requires omb to annually publish in the federal register and on the internet list of compliance assistance resources available to small businesses the act also requires omb to convene and chair task force to study the feasibility of streamlining paperwork requirements on small businesses the task force was required to file an initial report by the end of june 2003 and is required to file second report by the end of june 2004 the egovernment act of 2002 pl 107347 requires the oira administrator to work with the administrator of the office of electronic government to establish the strategic direction of the governmentwide egovernment program 70 office of management and budget guidelines for ensuri ng and maximizing the quality objectivity utility and integrity of information disseminated by federal agencies notice republication 67 federal register 8451 feb 22 2002 71 similar requirement for recommendations for reform was included in section 628a3 of the fy2000 treasury and general government appropriations act oira received 71 suggestions from the public in response to its call for suggestions on specific regulations that could be rescinded or changed that would increase net benefits to the public most of which came from the mercatus center at george mason university oira reviewed these suggestions and identified 23 as high priority for review eight of the 23 high priority recommendations involved epa rules and five involved rules from the department of labor although business groups generally applauded this effort environmentalists and public interest groups characterized it as the development of hit list of rules that the bush administration wanted to eliminate

active in the administrations erulemaking initiative in the treasury and general government appropriations act 2002 pl 10767 congress stated that about 63 million of ombs 707 million appropriation was for oira but stipulated that nearly 16 million of that amount should not be obligated until omb submits report to the committees on appropriations that provides an assessment of the total costs and benefits of implementing executive order 13166 72 the conference report for ombs appropriation for fy2004 to accompany hr 2673 directed oira to submit report to the house and senate committees on appropriations by june 1 2004 on whether agencies have been properly responsive to public requests for correction of information pursuant to the data quality act73 congress also sometimes limits oiras actions through riders on ombs appropriation for example since 1983 language has been included in ombs appropriation stating that none of the funds appropriated to omb could be used for the purpose of reviewing any agricultural marketing orders issued by the department of agriculture marketing orders which cover dozens of commodities from lemons to milk basically keep prices up by regulating supplies and had been targeted for elimination or amendment by pr esident reagans task force on regulatory relief in the early 1980s in response members of congress have inserted this restriction in each subsequent appropriation bill asserting that the department of agriculture not omb has statutory authority in this area in other cases oira has taken on additional responsibilities sometimes basing its actions on previous statutory or executive order authorities for example in december 2004 oira published final bulletin establishing government wide guidance aimed at enhancing the practice of peer review of government science documents 74 the bulletin applied to all influential scientific information and highly influential scientific assessments the final version of the bulletin gave agencies significantly greater discretion to decide when information required peer review than the september 2003 proposed bulletin but oira retained significant authority in certain areas eg when information is highly influential and requires more stringent peer review in november 2005 omb published proposed bulletin good guidance practices saying that it was concerned that agency guidance documents may not receive the benefit of careful consideration accorded under the procedures for regulatory development and review 75 omb did not cite any specific statutes or executive orders as authorizing the issuance of the bulletin but did indicate that it 72 executive order 13166 improving access to services for persons with limited english proficiency 65 federal register 50121 aug 16

and for overseeing and coordinating the administrations regulatory policy the bulletin would require agencies to develop written procedures for the approval of significant guidance documents and to publish economically significant documents in the federal register and invite comments in january 2006 oira published proposed bulletin on agency risk assessment practices for public comment and peer review by the national academy of sciences76 the legal authorities cited for the bulletin included the information quality act and ombs general authorities to oversee the quality of agency analyses information and regulatory actions the bulletin described series of general risk assessment and reporting standards and also laid out set of special standards for influential risk assessments it requires agencies to certify that each covered risk assessment has complied with the bulletins requirements but allows agency heads to waiver or defer some or all of its requirements

g20g142g159g146g142g160g561 for more than 25 years oira has played central role in the federal rulemaking process although some argued early in oiras history that the offices regulatory review role was unconstitutional few observers continue to hold that view court has directly addressed the constitutionality of the oira regulatory review process but in 1981 the year that oira was created the dc circuit said the following the court recognizes the basic need of the president and his white house staff to monitor the consistency of agency regulations with administration policy he and his advisors surely must be briefed fully and frequently about rules in the making and their contributions to policymaking considered the executive power under our constitution after all is not sharedit rests exclusively with the president 77 oira is located within the executive office of the president and is the presidents direct representative in the governmentwide rulemaking process as executive order 12866 states oira is the repository of expertise on regulatory issues within the executive branch and is uniquely positioned both within omb with its budgetary influence and within the federal rulemaking process reviewing and commenting on rules just before they are published in the federal register to enable it to exert maximum influence variations in how oira operatesas gatekeeper or counselorare largely function of the wishes of the president that the office serves for example in june 2001 article in harvard law review elena kagan posited that while it is generally acknowledged that president reagan used oiras review function as tool to control the policy and political agenda in an antiregulatory manner president clinton did much the same thing to accomplish proregulatory objectives 78 76 to view copy of this bulletin see httpwwwwhitehousegovombinforeg proposed_risk_assessment_bulletin_010906pdf 77 sierra club v costle 657 f2d 298 dc cir 1981 78 elana kagan

asserting personal ownership over range of agency actions thereby making them presidential in nature she also characterized this emergence of enhanced methods of presidential control over the regulatory statewhat she termed the presidentialization of administrationas the most important development in the last two decades in administrative process other observers however view oira like other executive branch agencies as having more of shared allegiance between the president and the congress they point out that oira was created by congress and has been given number of statutory responsibilities through the pra and other laws nevertheless even supporters of strong legislative perspective recognize that oira is part of the executive office of the president and that congress gave oira its responsibilities because of its strategic position within that office79 with both statutory and executive order responsibilities oira embodies broader tension between congress and the president for control of administrative agencies although major differences of opinion exist among observers of the federal rulemaking process regarding the appropriateness of oiras regulatory review role the broad reach and influence of the offices is undebatable rulemaking agencies formally challenge oiras returns and suggestions for change only rarely and sometimes refrain from even submitting draft rules for review if they believe they will be opposed by oira regulated entities also recognize oiras influence and seem to view the office as court of second resort if they are unable to influence regulatory agencies to their position directly g18g152g156g156g146g139g149g142g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g159g142g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 congress also recognizes the importance that oira plays in the rulemaking process and usually holds several hearings each year examining oiras implementation of its responsibilities pursuant to various statutes and executive orders proposals for changes to oiras authority and responsibilities have focused on such issues as 1 providing statutory underpinning for regulatory reviews 2 increasing or decreasing the offices funding and staffing 3 including independent agencies rules under the offices regulatory review function and 4 improving the transparency of oiras regulatory review processes

enacted legislation expanding oiras statutory responsibilities and has considered but not enacted legislation that would provide statutory basis for oiras regulatory review function for example in the 106th congress section 632 of s 746 the regulatory improvement act of 1999 would have required the president via omb and oira to establish process for the review and coordination of federal agency regulatory actions the proposed legislation also would have placed in statute many of the transparency requirements in executive order 12866 79 for example david h rosenbloom in building legislativecentered public administration tuscaloosa the university of alabama press 2001 states that where coordinated governmentwide clearance is required to achieve congress policy objectives there may be few or alternatives to paperwork and regulatory review within omb

oira as part of broader omb changes for example during the 107th congress proposed legislation was introduced hr 616 that would have established an office of management within the executive office of the president and redesignated omb as the office of the federal budget as part of that process oira and other offices within omb would have been abolished and their functions and authorities transferred to the new office of management neither of these bills was enacted g8g158g151g141g146g151g144g561g138g151g141g561g21g157g138g143g143g146g151g144g561 oira does not have specific line item in the budget so its funding is part of ombs appropriation similarly oiras staffing levels are allocated from ombs totals although oira staffing has increased in recent years as of may 2004 oira had fewer staff than it had when its regulatory review function was first established in 1981 currently about 30 oira desk officers and branch chiefs review about 3000 agency information collection requests each year and between 500 and 700 significant rules each year at various times in its history certain members of congress have attempted to reduce funding for oira in order to signal congressional displeasure with the offices actions 80 other observers however believe that oiras funding should be increased not reduced arguing that relatively small amount of additional resources for oira could yield substantial benefits81 at other times proposed legislation has been in troduced designating how oira staff should be used for example in the 108th congress provision in hr 2432 as originally introduced would have required the omb director to assign at nimum the equivalent of at least 2 full time staffers to review the federal information collection burden on the public imposed by the internal revenue service the internal revenue service accounts for more than 80 of the estimated paperwork burden but oira indicated that it devoted less than one fte to reviewing the agencys paperwork requests because much of the burden is mandated by statute the bush administration objected to this specific direction of oira staff so the sponsors of the bill agreed to delete this requirement before it was approved by the house of representatives in may 2004

helps to administer include rules issued by independent regulatory agencies eg the pra the regulatory flexibility act the congressional review act and the data quality act the executive orders that have established regulatory review within oira have explicitly excluded rules issued by those agencies82 some observers have suggested that this limitation be lifted ar guing that independent regulatory agencies issue regulations that have significant impact on the economy about 230 billion per year according 80 for example as noted previously in ombs appropriatio n for 2002 congress stipulated that nearly 16 million should not be obligated until omb submitted report assessing the total costs and benefits of implementing executive order 13166 also in the conference report for ombs fy2004 appropriation under the heading office of information and regulatory affairs the conferees directed that 1 million be withheld from obligation until resolution of existing programmatic concerns by house conferees are addressed and the house and senate committee on appropriations approve of such obligations 81 see for example robert w hahn and robert litan why congress should increase funding for omb review of regulations aeibrookings joint center for regulatory studies policy matter 0333 oct 2003 82 for purposes of regulatory review both executive order 12291 and executive order 12866

information on regulatory costs and benefits83 those opposed to this expansion in oiras duties point out that independent regulatory agencies were established to be relatively independent of the president and inclusion of their rules under oiras would be counter to this purpose in response proponents argue that independent regulatory agencies rules are alre ady reviewed for purposes such as paperwork clearance and ensuring that data quality requirements are met so examining the substance of the rules is just an extension of those reviews g22g155g138g151g156g153g138g155g142g151g140g162g561g152g143g561g20g142g159g146g142g160g156g561 one consistent area of concern to some observers has been the lack of transparency of the oira review process to the public notwithstanding recent improvements they argue that it is difficult for the public to know with any degree of cer tainty what changes oira has suggested to agencies draft rules what contacts oira has made with regulated entities and other outside parties regarding those rules or whether documents were exchanged between oira and the agencies in its september 2003 report gao said that the documentation that agencies are required to provide showing the changes made at oiras suggestion or recommendation were not always available and when done were not always clear or consistent gao also said that the transparency requirements incumbent on oira were not always clear and recommended several improvements for example although oira indicated that it can have its greatest impact on agencies rules during informal reviews before review packages are formally submitted oira indicated that agencies only had to disclose the changes made at oiras suggestion during formal review some of which were as short as one day gao recommended that oira define this requirement in the executive order to include informal reviews just as it did with regard to the requirements involving the offices communications with outside parties as noted previously the consistent with change code in oiras database does not differentiate between oira or agencyinitiated changes or changes that were major or minor in nature gao recommended that the database be changed to more clearly indicate which rules were substantively changed at oiras suggestion gao also recommended refinements to the executive orders requirements applicable to oira eg more clearly indicating on its website the regulatory actions being discussed at meetings with outside parties and the affiliations of the participants and the requirements applicable to the agencies eg defining the types of substantive changes that agencies should disclose in commenting on gaos report the administrator of oira said that the office planned to review its implementation of the executive orders transparency requirements and would work to improve the clarity of its meeting log the administrator did not however believe that changes made during informal oira reviews should be disclosedeven though he said that oira can have its greatest influence during informal reviews disclosure of these informal review changes 83 see for example the center for regulatory effectiveness blueprint for omb review of independent agency regulations mar 2002 the previously mentioned bill s 746 that proposed to establish in law presidential review of rules would have included rules issued by independent regulatory agencies

june 27 2007 during house floor consideration of hr 2829 the financial services and general government fsgg appropriations act 2008 which funds omb among other agencies representative brad miller and representative linda sanchez offered general provision amendment stating that none of the funds made available by this act may be used to implement executive order 13422 the amendment was agreed to as section 901 of hr 2829 as passed by the house in the wake of this action on july 12 2007 the director of omb sent letter to the chairmen and ranking members of the house and senate appropriations committees stating that if the president were presented with bill that contained restriction on the implementation of executive order 13422 the presidents senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill the director urged the rejection of any provis ion that would interfere in any way with the implementation of the executive order because it involves matter that directly affects the operation of omb and involves the presidents authority to manage the executive branch as reported by the senate subcommittee on financial services the fsgg appropriations bill contained provision stating that funds in th measure could be used to implement either executive order 13422 or an omb bulletin on guidance documents however one of the managers package amendments to the legislation that was adopted when the bill was reported by the full senate appropriations committee on july 12 2007 deleted this provision from the legislation the fsgg appropriations bill was later folded into the consolidated appropriations act for fy2008 hr 2764 and president bush signed the bill into law on december 26 2007 pl 110161 the legislation did not contain any language regarding executive order 13422 it is possible that some members of congress may again try to limit the implementation of the executive order in funding legislation for fy2009
