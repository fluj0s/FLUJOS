leader an overview introduction the minority leader of the modern hous is the head of the loyal opposition the partys nominee for speaker at the start of new congress the minority leader traditionally hands the gavel to the speakerelect who is nearly always elected on straight partyline vote the speakership election spotlights the main problem that confronts the minority leader the subordi nate status of his or her party in an institution noted for majority rule the house said democratic leader at time when his party was in the majority ope rates under the principle that determined majority should be allowed to work its w ill while protecting the rights of the minority to be heard1 minority party lawmakers are certain to be heard but whether they will be heeded is sometimes another matter thus the uppermost goal of any minority leader is to recapture majority control of the house the minority leader is elected every two years by secret ballot of his or her party caucus or conference these party leader s are typically experienced lawmakers when they win election to this position when nancy pelosi dca became minority leader in the 108th congress she had served in the house nearly 20 years and had served as minority whip in the 107th congress when her predecessor richard gephardt dmo became minority leader in the 104th house he had been in the house for almost 20 years had served as ch airman of the democratic caucus for four years had been 1988 presidential candida and had been majority leader from june 1989 until republicans captured contro l of the house in the november 1994 elections gephardts predecessor in th minority leadership position was robert michel ril who became gop leader in 1981 after spending 24 years in the house michels predecessor republican john rhodes of arizona was elected minority leader in 1973 after 20 years of house serv ice representative gephardt served as minority leader through the 107th congress the roles and responsibilities of the minor ity leader are not welldefined to large extent the functions of the minority leader are defined by tradition and custom minority leader from 1931 to 1939 representative

have been added to the job these duties involve an array of institutiona l and party functions before examining the institutional and party assignments of the minority leader it is worth highlighting the historical origin of this position origin of the minority leaders post to large extent the minority leaders position is 20th century innovation prior to this time congressional parties were often relatively disorganized so it was not always evident who functioned as th opposition floor leader decades went by before anything like our modern twopart congressional system emerged on capitol hill with official titles for those who were its official leaders however from the beginning days of congress various house members intermittently assumed the role of opposition leader some scholars suggest that re presentative james madison of virginia informally functioned as the first minority leader because in the first congress he led the opposition to treasur secretary alexa nder hamiltons fiscal policies3 during this early period it was more usual that neither major party grouping federalists and republicans had an offici leader in 1813 for instance scholar recounts that the federalist minority of 36 members needed committee of 13 to represent party comprising distinct minority and to coordinate the actions of men who were already partisans in the same cause4 in 1828 foreign observer of the house offered this perspective on the absence of formal party leadership on capitol hill i found there were absolutely persons hol ding the stations of what are called in england leaders on either side of the house it is true that certain members do take charge of administra tion questions and certain others of opposition questions but all this so obviously without concert among themselves actual or tacit that nothing can be conceived less systematic or more completely desultory disjointed5 internal party disunity compounded the di fficulty of identifying lawmakers who might have informally functi oned as minority leader for instance seven of the fourteen speakership elections from 1834 th rough 1859 had at least twenty differenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30666crs3 6

speakership it is not at all clear that one of the defeated lawmakers then assumed the mantle of minority leader the mocratic minority from 1861 to 1875 was so completely disorganized that they did not nominate candidate for speaker in two of these seven congresses and nominated man more than once in the other five the defeated candidates were not auto matically looked to for leadership7 in the judgment of political scientis t since 1883 the candidate for speaker nominated by the minority party has clearly been the minority leader8 however this assertion is subject to disput on december 3 1883 the house elected democrat john g carlisle of kentuc ky as speaker republicans placed in nomination for the speakership j warren keifer of ohio who was speaker the previous congress9 clearly keifer was not the republicans minority leader he was discredited leader in part because as speaker he arbitrarily handed out choice jobs to close relatives all at handsome salaries10 keifer received the empty honor of the minority nomination but with it came sting for while this naturally involves the floor leadership he was desert ed by his partisan associates and his career as national figure terminated ingloriously11 representative thomas reed rme who later became speaker assumed the facto role of minority floor leader in keifers stead although keifer wa s the minoritys candidate for speaker reed became its acknowledged leader and ever afte r so long as he served in the house remained the most conspic uous member of his party12 another scholar contends that the minor ity leader position emerged even before 1883 on the democratic side there we re serious caucus fights for the minority speakership nomination in 1871 and 1873 i ndicating that the nomination carried with it some vestige of leadership13 further when republicans were in the minority the party nominated for speaker series of prominent lawmakers including exspeaker james blaine of maine in 1875 former appropriations chairman james garfield of ohio in 1876 1877 and 1879 and exspeaker keifer in 1883 it is hard to believe that house partisans would place man in the speakership when

this was not the case according to some observers with respect to exspeaker keifer in brief there is disagreement among historical analysts as to the exact time period when the minority leadership emerged officially as party position nonetheless it seems safe to conclude that the position emerged during the latter part of the 19th century period of strong party organization and professional politicians this era was marked by strong partisan attachments resilient patronagebased party organizations andhigh levels of party voting in congress15 plainly these were conditions conducive to the establishment of more highly differentiated house leadership structure16 see appendix for listing of house minority leaders 1899 2001 two other points of historical interest merit brief mention first until the 61st congress 19091910 it was the custom to have the minority leader also serve as the ranking minority member on the two most powerful committees rules and ways and means17 today the minority leader longer serves on these committees however he or she appoints the minor ity members of the rules committee and influences the assignment of partisan colleagues to the ways and means committee second democrats have alwa ys elevated their minority floor leader to the speakership upon reclaiming majority status republicans have not always followed this leadership succession pattern in 1919 for instance republicans bypassed james r mann ril who had been minority leader for eight years and elected frederick gillett rma to be speaker mann had angered many republicans by objecting to their private bills on the floor plus he was protégé of autocratic speaker joseph cannon ril 19031911 and many members suspected that he would try to recentralize power in his hands if elected speaker18 institutional functions the style and role of any minority leader is influenced by variety of elements including personality and contextual factors such as the size and cohesion of the minority party whether his or her party controls the white house the general political climate in the house and the controversy that is sometimes associated with the legislative agenda despite the variability of these factors there are number of institutional obligations associated with th is position many of these assignments orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30666crs5 roles are spelled out in the house rule book others have devolved upon the position in other ways to be sure the minority l eader is provided with extra staff resources beyond those accorded him or her as re presentative to assist in carrying out diverse leadership functions worth emphasis is that there are limits on the institutional role of the minority leader because the majority party exercises disproportionate influence over the age nda partisan ratios on committees staff resources administrative ope rations and the daytoday schedule and management of floor activities under the rules of the house the minority leader has certain roles and responsibilities they include the following drug testing under rule i clause 9 the s peaker in consultation with the minority leader shall develop through an appropriate entity of the house system for drug testing in the house inspector general rule ii clause 6 states that the inspector general shall be appointed for congress by the speak er the majority leader and the minority leader acting jointly this rule further states that the minority leader and other specified house leaders shall be notified of any financial irregu larity involving the house and receive audit reports of the inspector general questions of privilege under rule ix clause 2 resolution offered as question of privilege by the majority l eader or the minority leader shall have

to the house the oversight plans of the standing committees along with any recommendations it or the house leaders ve proposed to ensure the effective coordination of committees oversight plans committee on standards of offi cial conduct investigative subcommittees rule x clause 5 stipulates at the beginning of congress the speaker or his designee and the minority leader or his designee each

subcommittees of that committee during that congress permanent select committee on intelligence the speaker and minority leader shall be ex officio members of the select committee but shall have vote

the rules committee may not except in certain specified circumstances issue rule that prevents the minority leader or designee from offering motion to recommit with instructions in addition the minority leader has number of other ins titutional functions for instance the minority leader is so metimes statutorily authorized to appoint individuals to certain federal entities he or she and the majority leader each name three members to serve as private calendar objectors he or she is consulted with respect to reconvening the house per the usual formulation of conditional concurrent adjournment resolutions he or she is traditional member of the house office building commission he or she is mber of the united states capitol preservation commission and he or she ma after consultation with the speaker convene an early organizational party caucu s or conference informally the minority leader maintains ties with ma jority party leaders to lear n about the schedule and other house matters and forges agreements or understandings with them insofar as feasible party functions the minority leader has number of fo rmal and informal party responsibilities formally the rules of each party specify certain roles and responsibilities for their leader for example under democratic rules for the 106th congress the minority leader may call meetings of the democratic caucus he or she is member of the democratic congressional campaign committee names the members of the democratic leadership council chairs the policy committee and heads the steering committee examples of other assignments are making recommendations to the speaker on all democratic members who shall serve as conferees and nominating party members to the committees on rules and house administration republican rules identify generally comparable functions for their top party leader informally the minority leader has wide range of party assignments lewis deschler the late house parliamentarian

is instrumental in guiding legislation favore d by his party through the house or in resisting those programs of the other part that are considered undesirable by his own party he is instrumental in devi sing and implementing his partys strategy on the floor with respect to promoting or opposing legislation he is kept constantly informed as to the status of legislative business and as to the sentiment of his party respecting particular legislation under consideration such information is derived in part from the floor leaders contacts with his partys members serving on house committees nd

several other party roles merit further mention because they influence significantly the leaders overarching objective retake majority control of the house i want to get my members elected and win more seats said minority leader richard gephardt dmo thats what m partisan colleagues want to do and thats what they want to do20 five activities illustrate how minority leaders seek to accomplish this primary goal provide campaign assistance minority leaders are typically energetic and aggressive campaigners for partisan incumben ts and challengers there is hardly any major aspect of campaigning that does not engage their attention for example they assist in recruiting qualified candidates they establish leadership pacs to raise and distribute funds to house candidates of thei r party they try to persuade partisan colleagues not to retire or run for other ffices so as to hold down the number of open seats the party would need to defend they coordinate their campaign activities with congressional and national party campaign committees they encourage outside groups to back their candidates they trav around the country to speak on behalf of party candidates and they encourage incumbent colleagues to make significant financial contributions to the partys cam paign committee the amount of time that minority leader gephardt is putting in to help the dccc democratic congressional campaign committee is unhear d of noted democratic lobbyist dccc chairman has ever had that kind of support21 devise minority party strategies the minority leader in consultation with other party colleagues has range of strategic options that he or she can employ to advance minority party objectives the options selected depend on wide range of circumstances such as the visibility or significance of the issue and the degree of cohesion within the majority party for instance majority party riven by internal dissension as occurred during the early 1900s when progressive and regular republicans were at loggerheads may provide the minority leader with greater opportunities to achieve his or her priorities than if the ma jority party exhibited high degrees of party cohesion among the vari able strategies available to the minority party which can vary from bill to bill and be used in combination or at different stages of the lawmaking process are the following cooperation the minority party supports nd cooperates with the majority party in building winning coalitions on the floor inconsequential opposition the minority party offers opposition but it is of marginal significance typically because the minority is so smallhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30666crs8 22 these strategic options have been modified to degree and come from jones the minority party in congress p

1999 p 1withdrawal the minority party chooses not to take position on an issue perhaps because of intraparty divisions innovation the minority party develops alte rnatives and agendas of its own and attempts to construct winning coalitions on their behalf partisan opposition the minority party offers strong opposition to majority party initiatives but does not counter w ith policy alternatives of their own constructive opposition the minority party opposes initiatives of the majority party and offers its own proposals as substitutes participation the minority party is in the position of having to consider the views and proposals of their president and to assess their majority building role with respect to his priorities22 look at one minority leadership strategy partisan opposition may suggest why it might be employed in specific circumstances the purposes of obstruction are several such as frustrating the majority partys ability to govern or attracting press and media attention to th alleged ineffectiveness of the majority party we know how to delay remarked minority leader gephardt23 dilatory motions to adjourn appeals of the presid ing officers ruling or numerous requests for roll call votes are standard timeconsuming parliamentary tactics by stalling action on the majority partys agenda the minority leader may be able to launch campaign against donothing congress and convince enough voters to put his party back in charge of the house to be sure the minority leader recognizes that going negative carries risks and may not be winning strategy if his party fails to offer policy alternatives that appeal to broad segments of the general public promote and publicize the partys agenda an important aim of the minority leader is to develop an electora lly attractive agenda of ideas and proposals that unites his or her own house members and that energizes and appeals to core electoral supporters as well as independent s and swing voters despite the minority leaders restricted ability to set the h ouses agenda there are still opportunities for him to raise minority priorities for example the minority leader may employ or threaten to use discharge petitions to try and bring minority priorities to the floor24 if he or she is able to attract the re quired 218 signatures on discharge petition by attracting majority part supporters he or she can force minority in itiatives to the floor over the opposition of the majority lead ership as gop minority leader oncehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30666crs9 25 irwin arieff inside congress congressional

maryland littlefield adams 1994 p 15said the challenges he confronted are to keep our people together and to look for votes on the other side25 minority leaders may engage in numerous activities to publicize their partys priorities and to criticize the oppositions for instance to keep their party colleagues on message they insure that partisan colleagues are sent packets of suggested press releases or talking points for constituent meetings in their districts they help to organize town meetings in members districts around the country to publicize the partys agenda or specific priority such as health care or education they sponsor party retreats to discuss issues and assess the partys public image they create theme teams to craft party messages that might be raised during the oneminute morning hour or special order period in the house they conduct surveys of party colleagues to discern their policy preferences they establish websites that highlight and distribute party images and i ssues to users and they organize task forces or issue teams to formulate party programs and to deve lop strategies for communicating these programs to the public house minority leaders also hold joint ne ws conferences and consult with their counterparts in the senate and with the president if their party controls the white house the overall objectives are to deve lop coordinated communications strategy to share ideas and information and to present united front on issues minority leaders also make floor speeches and close debate on major issues before the house they deliver addresses in diverse forums across the country and they write books or articles that highlight minority party goals and achievements they must also be prepared to debate on the floor ad lib notes on moments notice remarked minority leader michel26 in brief minority leaders ar key strategists in developing and promoting the partys agenda and in outlining ways to neutralize the oppositions arguments and proposals confer with the white house if his or her party controls the white house the minority leader confers regularly with the president and his aides about issues before congress the administrations agenda and political events generally strategically the role of the minority leader will vary depending on whether the president is of the same party or the othe r party in general minority leaders will often work to advance the goals and as pirations of their partys president in congress when robert michel ril was minority leader 19811995 he typically functioned as the point man for republican presidents27 president ronald reagans 1981 policy successes in the demo cratic controlled h ouse was due in small measure to minority leader michels effectiveness in wooing socalled

formulating alternatives to executive branch initiatives and in acting as nationa l spokesperson for his or her party as minority leader during president lyndon johnsons democra tic administration my responsibility has been to propose repub lican alternatives said minority leader gerald ford rmi30 greatly outnumbered in the house minority leader ford devised political strategy that allowed re publicans to offer their alternatives in manner that provided them political protection as ford explained we used technique of laying our program out in general debate he said when we got to the amendment phase we would offer our program as substitute for the johnson proposal if we lost in the committee of the whole then we would usually offer it as motion to recommit and get vote on that and if we lost on the motion to recommit our republican members had choice they could vote against the johnson prog ram and say we did our best to come up with better alternative or they could vote for it and make the same argument usually we lost but when youre only 140 out of 435 you dont expect to win many31 ford also teamed with senate minority leader everett mckinley dirksen ril to act as national

communication i believe leadership is bottom up not top down i think you have to build polic and strategy and vision from the bottom up and involve people in figuring out what that is33 gephardt added that inclu sion and empowerment of the people on the line have to be done to get the best performance from the minority party34 other techniques for fostering party harmony include the ppointment of task forces composed of partisan colleagues with conflicting views to reach consensus on issues the creation of new leadership positions as way to r each out and involve greater diversity of partisans in the leadership structure and daily meetings in the leaders office or at breakfast lunch or dinner to lay out floor strategy or political objectives for the minority party concluding observations given the concentration of agenda control and other institutional resources in the majority leadership the minority leader has his work cut out for him in promoting and publicizing his or her partys priorities serving the interests of his rankandfile members managing intraparty conflict and forging party unity the ultimate goal of the minority leader is to lead his or her party to majority control yet there is set formula on how this is to be done if the history of elections is any guide it seems apparent that the congressional reco rd of the minority party is only one of many factors that may result in majority status most of the other factors cannot be controlled by the minor ity party and its leaders 35httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30666crs12 appendix house minority leaders 18992006
