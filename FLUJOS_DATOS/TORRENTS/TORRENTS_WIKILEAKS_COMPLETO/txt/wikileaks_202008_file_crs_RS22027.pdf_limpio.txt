and 33 million as yet unallocated ccounting for the availability of us and other donor food aid contributions wfp had estimated prior to the tsunami disaster global shortfall of 13 billion in emergency food needs what should be the us share historically the united states has been the worlds largest provider of food aid both em ergency and nonemergency there is established rule as to what proportion of f ood aid needs should be provided by the united states yet there is presumption that especi ally in the case of emergencies the united states will make substantial and most likely the largest contribution there are some historical indicators of th relative importance of us food aid contributions8 in the 1990s the united states provided just over 55 of total world food aid the us contribution to all wfp activities both em ergency and nonemergency during the 1990s averaged 465 under the food aid conven tion fac an international agreement now expired that constituted framework for cooperation on food aid among major donor countries the united states had pledged to meet 51 of the total pledge of 49 million metric tons the fac pledge did not represent actual food aid shipments but was rather minimum commitment the european union eu is the next largest contributor of food aid globally providing 28 of ll food aid during the 1990s 31 of total contributions to the wfp nd 27 of commitments under the fac in terms of contributions to the wfp for recent food emergencies during 2003 and 2004 the united states provided 64 of tota l emergency food aid to ethiopia 28 of total emergency food aid to th democratic republic of kor ea and thus far has pledged about onequarter of the emergency food aid called for by wfp for western sudan darfur and eastern chad in the indian ocean tsunami disaster the eu has provided 39 of the total wfp appeal while the unite d states has thus far contributed 13 funding issues congress and the administration are likely to be confronted with the challenge of funding additional food ai d along with other relief and development assistance for the indian ocean disaster early in the109th congress9 in the short term the administration can reallocate nonemergency f ood aid to emergency relief in addition the 2002 farm bill authorization for pl 480 food aid allows for some transfer of food aid from pl 480 title i concessional sales to title ii in orde r to provide food aid to indian ocean countries as well as to displaced pe rsons and refugees in darfur sudan and elsewhere additional funds will be need ed the

and 656 million for tsunami relief so of which can be used for pl 480 title ii food aid concerns about meeting food aid emergencie s could result in an examination of the role of the emerson trust of

metric tons of wheat and around 89 million in cash in the conference report accompanying fy2005 agriculture appropriations congress admonished the ad ministration not to use nonemergency food aid funds for emergency purposes and indicated that the em erson trust should be relied upon to meet unanticipated emergency n eeds p 667 hrept 108792 pl 108477 without replenishment of the commodities in
