be crucial factor in preventing terrorist attacks concerns have been expressed that single agency or office in the federal government prior to september 11 2001 was in position to connect the dots between diffuse bits of information that might have provided clues to the planned attacks testimony before the two intelligence co mmittees joint inquiry on the september 11 attacks indicated that significant information in the possession of intelligence and law enforcement agencies was not fully shared w ith other agencies and that intelligence on potential terrorist threats against the united states was not fully exploited for many years the sharing of intelligence and law enforcement information was circumscribed by administrative policies and statutory prohibitions beginning in

report rl31377 the usa patriot act legal analysis by charles doyle and crs report rl30465 the foreign intelligence surveillance act an overview of the statutory framework by elizabeth bazan 3 some writers distinguish between informati on and intelligence the former being unanalyzed information the latter being the re sult of analysis in practice however the terms are often used interchangeably and the distinction will not be observed in this report early 1990s however much effort has gone into improving inte ragency coordination1 after the september 11 attacks number of statutory obstacles were addressed by the usapatriot act of 2001 and other legislation2 nevertheless there had been one place where the analytical effort is centered the department of homeland security dhs was designed to remedy that perceived deficiency as is the terrorist threat integration center announced by the president in hi s january 2003 state of the union address background the homeland security act pl 107296 signed on november 25 2002 established within dhs directorate for information analysis and infrastructure protection iaip headed by an under secretary for information analysis and infrastructure protection appointed by the pr esident by and with the advice and consent of the senate with an assistant secretary of information analysis appointed by the president the legislation especially the in formation analysis section seeks to promote close ties between intelligence analysts and t hose responsible for ssessing vulnerabilities of key us infrastructure the bill envisi ons an intelligence entity focused on receiving and analyzing information3 from other government agencies and using it to provide warning of terrorist attacks on the homeland to other federal agencies and to state and local officials and for addressing vulnerabilities that terrorists could exploit dhs is not intended to duplicate the collection effort of intelligence agencies it will not have its own agents satellites or signals intercept sites major intelligence agencies are not transferred to the dhs although some dhs elements including customs and the coast guard will continue to collect information that is crucial to analyzing terrorist threats the legislation establishing dhs envisione d an information analysis element with the responsibility for acquiring and reviewin g information from the agencies of the intelligence community from law enforcement agencies state and local government agencies and unclassified publicly ava ilable information known as open source information or osint from books periodicals pamphlets th internet media etc the legislation is explicit that except as otherwise directed by the president the secretary of dhs shall have such access as the secret

coordination with ot her federal agencies dhs is responsible for ensuring that any material receive d is protected from unauthorized disclosure and ndled and used only for the pe rformance of official duties this provision addresses concern that sensitive personal information made available to dhs analysts could be misused as is the case for other federal agencies that handle classified materials intelligence information is to be transmitted retained and disseminated in accordance with policies blished under the authority of the director of central intelligence dci to protect intelligence sources and methods and similar authorities of the attorney general concerning sensitive law enforcement information5 concerns about dhs intelligence despite enactment of the homeland security act it is clear that significant concerns persisted within the executive branch about the new departments ability to analyze intelligence and law enforcement informa tion media accounts suggest that these concerns center on dhs status as new nd untested agency and the potential risks involved in forwarding raw intellig ence to the dhs intelligence component6 another concern is that new entity rather than longestablished intelligence and law enforcement agencies would be relied on to produce allsource intelligence relating to the most serious threats facing the countryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21283crs4 7 defined by 50 usc 401a4 8 28 usc 533 provides information collecting aut hority to the justice department and the fbi 9 50 usc 4033c2dhs role in the intelligence community the us intelligence community consists of the central intelligence agency cia and some 14 other agencies7 it provides information in various forms to the white house and other federal agencies as well as to congress in addition law enforcement agencies such as the federal bureau of investigation fbi also collect information for use in the federal government8 within the intelligence community priorities for collection and to some extent for analysis are established by the dci9 based in practice on interagenc discussions being at the table when priorities are discussed it is widely believed helps ensure equitable allocations of limited collection resources the homeland security act makes the dhs information analysis element member of the intelligence community thus giving dhs formal role when intelligence collection and analysis priorities are being addressed dhs officials have indicated that the new department is actively participatin g in the process of setting priorities the question of raw intelligence there has been discussion in the media whether dhs will have access to raw inte lligence or only to finished analytical products but these reports may reflect uncer tainty regarding the definition of raw intelligence satellite photogra ph standing by itself might be considered raw data but it would be useless unless something were known bout where and when it was taken thus satellite imagery supplie d to dhs would under almost any circumstances have to include some analysis the same would appl to signals intercepts reports from human agents present special challenges some ssessment of the reliability of the source would have to be provided but info rmation that would identify specific individual is normally retained within very small circle of intelligence officials so as to reduce the risk of unauthorized disclosure and harm to the source the issue of the extent and nature of information forwarded to dhs has proved to be difficult reviewing copies of summary reports prepared by existing agencies is seen by some observers as inadequate for the task of putting together meaningful picture of terrorist capabilities nd intentions and providing timely warning on the other hand there is need to ensure that dhs would not be inundated with vast quantities of data and that highly sensitive information is not given wider dissemination than absolutely necessary analytical quality the key test for homeland security will of course be the quality of the analytical product whether terrorist groups can be identified and timely warning given of plans for attacks on the us critical need exists for trained personnel the types of information that have to be analyzed come from disparate sources and require variety of anal ytical skills that are not in plentiful supply academic institutions prepare significant numbers of linguists and area specialists but training in the inner workings of clandestine terrorist entities is less often undertaken analysts with law enforcement backgrounds may not be attuned to the foreign environments from whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21283crs5 10 testimony of bill parrish acting

the establishment of new terrorist threat integration center ttic that would merge and analyze all threat informati on in single location under the direction of the dci according to administration spokesmen ttic will eventually encompass cias counterterrorist center ctc and th fbis counterterrorism division along with elements of other ag encies including dod and dhs ttics stated

of the select committee on homeland security has welcomed the establishment of ttic while noting that the establishment of the center in way reduces the statutory obligations of the department of homeland security to build its own analytic capability13 making the dci responsible for tti c will facilitate its ability to use highly sensitive classified information and ttic can expand upon the relati onships that have evolved in the ctc that was established in cias operations directorate in the mid1980s according to testimony by administration officials to the senate government affairs committee on february 26 2003 ttic will in effect function as an information an alysis center for dhs and dhs will require smalle r number of analysts with less extensive responsibilities subsequent administration testimony indicates that dhs will receive much of the same intelligence data from other agencies and will unde rtake analysis key distinction is that dhs is not responsible for

the homeland security act that could affect the analytical efforts of dhs17 section 359 of the intelligence authorization act for fy2004 pl 108177 requires that the pres ident report on the operations of iaip and ttic by may 1 2004 the report which is to be unclassified with the option of classified annex asks for delineation of the responsibilities of iaip and ttic and an assessment of whether areas of overlap if any represent an inefficient utilization of resources the president is asked to ex plain the basis for the establishment and operation of the center ttic as joint ve nture of participating agencies rather than as an element of the director ate iaip the report is also to assess the practical impact if any of the operations of the cent er ttic on individual liberties and privacy conclusion legislation creating homeland security department recognized the crucial importance of intelligence it proposed an an alytical office within dhs that would draw upon the information gathering resources of othe r government agencies and of the private sector it envisioned the dhs information analysis entity working closely with other dhs offices other federal agencies state and local officials and the private sector to devise strategies to protect us vulnerabilities and to provide warning of specific attacks the administration appears to prefer modification to the approach originally envisioned in the legislation that created dhs ttic under the direction of the dci will provide the integrative analytical effort that the drafters of homeland security legislation and others in congress have fe lt to be essential in light of breakdowns in communication that occurred prior to september 11 2001 wh ether ttic is consistent with the intent of congress in passing the homeland security act and whether it is ultimately the best place for the integrative effort is current matter of discussion in congress regardless of where the integrative effort is ultimately located the task w ill remain f undamentally the same pulling together vast amounts of data from wide variety of sources concerning terrorist groups analyzing them and reporting threat warnings in time to prevent attacks is and will remain daunting challenge
