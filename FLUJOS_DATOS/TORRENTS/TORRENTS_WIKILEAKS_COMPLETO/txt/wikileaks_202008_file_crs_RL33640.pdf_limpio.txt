contained many types of delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons the longer range systems wh ich included longrange missiles based on us territory longrange missiles based on submarines and heavy bombers that could threaten soviet targets from their bases in the united states are known as strategic nuclear delivery vehicles at the end of the cold war in 1991 the united states deployed more than 10000 warheads on these delivery vehicles that number has declined to less than 6000 warheads today and is slated under the 2002 moscow treaty to decline to 2200 warheads by the year 2012 at the present time the us landbased ballistic missile force icbms consists of 450 minuteman iii icbms each deployed with between one and three warheads for total of 1200 warheads the air force recently deactivated all 50 of the 10warhead peacekeeper icbms it plans to eventually deploy peacekeeper warheads on some of the minuteman icbms it has also deactivated 50 minuteman iii missiles the air force is also modernizing the minuteman missiles replacing and upgrading their rocket motors guidance systems and other components the air force had expected to begin replacing the minuteman missiles around 2018 but has decided instead to continue to modernize and maintain the existing missiles the us ballistic missile submarine fleet currently consists of 14 trident submarines each carries 24 trident ii d5 missiles the navy has converted 4 of the original 18 trident submarines to carry nonnuclear cruise missiles the remaining submarines currently carry around 2000 warheads in total number that will likely decline as the united states implements the moscow treaty the navy has shifted the basing of the submarines so that nine are deployed in the pacific ocean and five are in the atlantic to better cover targets in and around asia it also has undertaken efforts to extend the life of the missiles and warheads so that they and the submarines can remain in the fleet past 2020 the us fleet of heavy bombers currently includes 20 b2 bombers and 94 b52 bombers the b1 bomber longer is equipped for nuclear missions the 2006 qdr recommended that the air force reduce the b52 fleet to 56 aircraft congress rejected that recommendation but will allow the fleet to decline to 76 aircraft the air force has also begun to retire the nucleararmed cruise missiles carried by b52 bombers leaving only about half the b52 fleet equipped to carry nuclear weapons congress has reviewed the bush administrations pl ans for us strategic nuclear forces during the annual authorization and appropriations process it has reviewed number of questions about the future size of that force for example some have questioned why the united states must retain 2200 strategic nuclear warheads congress may also question the administrations plans for reductions in the minuteman force and b52 fleet this report will be updated as needed

cold war the us nuclear arsenal contained many types of delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons including shortrange missiles and artillery for use on the battlefield medium range missiles and aircraft that could strike targets beyond the theater of battle short and mediumrange systems based on surface ships longrange missiles based on us territory and submarines and heavy bombers that could threaten soviet targets from their bases in the united states the short and mediumrange systems ar considered nonstrategic nuclear weapons and have been referred to as battlefield tactical and theater nuclear weapons 1 the longrange missiles and heavy bombers are known as strategic nuclear delivery vehicles in 1990 as the cold war was drawing to close and the soviet union was entering its final year the united states had more than 12000 nuclear warheads deployed on 1875 strategic nuclear delivery vehicles 2 as of july 1 2008 according to the counting rules in the strategic arms reduction treaty start the united states had reduced to 5951 nuclear warheads on 1214 strategic nuclear delivery vehicles3 according to the state department the united states had reduced its number of operationally deployed warheads number that excludes many warheads that count under start to 2871 by the end of december 20074 under the terms of the 2002 strategic offensive reduction treaty known as the moscow treaty between the united states and russia this number is to decline to more than 2200 operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads by the end of 20125 although these numbers do not count the same catego ries of nuclear weapons they indicate that the number of deployed warheads on us strategic nuclear forces will decline significantly in the two decades following the end of the cold war yet nuclear weapons continue to play key role in us national security strategy and the united states does not at this time plan to either eliminate its nuclear weapons or abandon the strategy of nuclear deterrence that has served as core concept in us national security strategy for more than 50 years 6 during the 2008 election campaign then candidate obama stated that he supported the goal of working to eliminate all 1 for detailed review of us nonstrategic nuclear weapons see crs report rl32572 nonstrategic nuclear weapons by amy f woolf 2 natural resources defense council table of us

nuclear delivery vehicles 3 russia by the same accounting had 4138 warheads on 839 delivery vehicles see us department of state bureau of verification compliance and inspection fact sheet start aggregate numbers of strategic offensive weapons april 1 2007 washington dc 4 the state department did not provide an unclassified estimate for russias current force of operationally deployed warheads see us department of state bureau of verification compliance and inspection 2008 annual report on implementation of the moscow treaty may 13 2008 p 2 5 the start treaty counts more than just operationally deployed warheads as its data base includes warheads that would count on retired missiles until the launchers for those missiles are destroyed the united states has maintained some icbm and slbm launchers after retiring the missiles so the warheads attributed to these launchers still count 6 the bush administration emphasized this point in early 2002 when presenting the results of the 2001 nuclear posture review npr douglas feith the undersecretary of defense for policy stated that nuclear weapons continue to be essential to our security and that of our friends and allies see

unilaterally and that as long as nuclear weapons exist i will retain strong safe secure and reliable nuclear deterrent 7 the bush administration after completing the 2002 nuclear posture review npr indicated that the united states would reduce its forces to 2200 operationally deployed warheads the number and concept codified in the moscow treaty but it did not identify the specific combination of delivery vehicles or warhead loadings that the united states would maintain to reach the specified number subsequent pentagon studies including the strategic capabilities assessment in 2005 and the 2006 quadrennial defe nse review qdr offered further guidance on strategic nuclear force structure as the united states reduces its deployed forces to meet the mandates of the moscow treaty it is likely also to pursue programs that will allow it to modernize and adjust its strategic forces so that they remain capable in the years that follow number of factors could influence decisions about these programs including budget political and strategic considerations along with standard capabilities assessments this report reviews the ongoing programs that will affect the expected size and shape of the us strategic nuclear force structure it begins with an overview of this force structure during the cold war and summarizes the reductions and changes that have occurred since 1991 it then offers details about each category of delivery vehiclelandbased intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms submarine launched ballistic missiles slbms and heavy bombersfocusing on their current deployments and ongoing and planned modernization programs the report concludes with discussion of issues related to decisions about the future size and shape of the us strategic nuclear force

united states has maintained triad of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles8 the united states first developed these three types of nuclear delivery vehicles in large part because each of the military services wanted to play role in the us nuclear arsenal however during the 1960s and 1970s analysts developed more reasoned rationale for the nuclear triad they argued that these different basing modes had complementary strengths and weaknesses they would enhance deterrence and discourage soviet first strike because they complicated soviet attack planning and ensured the survivability of significant portion of the us force in the event of soviet first strike 9 the different characteristics might also strengthen 7 arms control today 2008 presidential qa democratic candidate barack obama arms control today september 24 20008 8 when announcing the results of the nuclear posture review in 2002 the bush administration identified new triad of weapons systems and capabilities this conceptual framework differs from the old triad in that it outlines how broad set of capabilities that contribute to us security as opposed to the old triad which described mix of specific weapons systems in the new triad nuclear weapons and precisionguided conventional weapons combine as offensive strike forces missile defenses represent the second leg of the triad and responsive infrastructure serves the third leg for more details see crs report rl31623 us nuclear weapons changes in policy and force structure by amy f woolf 9 us department of defense annual report to congress fiscal year 1989 by frank

eventually had the accuracy and prompt responsiveness needed to attack hardened targets such as soviet command posts and icbm silos slbms had the survivability needed to complicate soviet efforts to launch disarming first strike and to retaliate if such an attack were attempted10 and heavy bombers could be dispersed quickly and launched to enhance their survivability and they could be recalled to their bases if crisis did not escalate into conflict according to unclassified estimates the numbe r of delivery vehicles icbms slbms and nuclearcapable bombers in the us force stru cture grew steadily through the mid1960s with the greatest number of delivery vehicles 2268 deployed in 196711 the number then held relatively steady through 1990 at between 1 875 and 2200 icbms slbms and heavy bombers the number of warheads carried on these delivery vehicles increased sharply through 1975 then after brief pause again rose sharply in the early 1980s peaking at around 13600 warheads in 1987 figure 1 displays the increases in delivery vehicles and warheads between 1960 when the united states first began to deploy icbms and 1990 the year before the united states and soviet union signed the

the peacekeeper mx icbm which carried 10 warheads on each missile in 1990 before it concluded the start treaty the united states deployed total of around 12304 warheads on its icbms slbms and heavy bombers the icbm force consisted of singlewarhead minuteman ii missiles 3warhead minuteman iii missiles and 10warhead peacekeeper mx missiles for total force of 2450 warheads on 1000 missiles the submarine force included poseidon submarines with poseidon c3 and trident i c4 missiles and the newer trident submarines with trident i and so trident ii d5 missiles the total force consisted of 5216 warheads on around 600 missiles 13 the bomber force centered on 94 b52h bombers and 96 b1 bombers along with many of the older b52g bombers and 2 of the brand new at the time b2 bombers this force of 260 bombers could carry over 4648 weapons

states reduced the numbers and types of weapons in its strategic nuclear arsenal both as part of its modernization process and in response to the limits in the 1991 start treaty the united states continued to maintain triad of strategic nuclear forces however with warheads deployed on icbms slbms and bombers according to the department of defense this mix of forces not only offered the united states range of capabilities and flexibility in nuclear planning and complicated an adversarys attack planning but also hedged against unexpected problems in any single delivery system this latter issue became more of concern in this time period as the united states retired many of the different types of warheads and missiles that it had deployed over the years reducing the redundancy in its force the 1991 start treaty limited the united states to maximum of 6000 total warheads and 4900 warheads on ballistic missiles deployed on up to 1600 strategic offensive delivery vehicles however the treaty did not count the actual number of warheads deployed on each type of ballistic missile or bomber instead it used counting rules to determine how many warheads would count against the treatys limits for i cbms and slbms this number usually equaled the actual number of warheads deployed on the missi bombers however used different system bombers that were not equipped to carry airlaunched cruise missiles the b1 and b2 bombers counted as one warhead bombers equipped to carry airlaunched cruise missiles b52 bombers could carry 20 missiles but would only count as 10 warheads against the treaty limits these rules have led to differing estimates of then numbers of warheads on us strategic nuclear forces during the 1990s some estimates count only those warheads that count against the treaty while others count all the warheads that could be carried by the deployed delivery systems 13 the older poseidon submarines were in the process of being retired and the number of missiles and

natural resources defense council the united states reduced its nuclear weapons from 9300 warheads on 1239 delivery vehicles in 1991 to 6196 warheads on 1064 delivery vehicles when it completed the implementation of start in 2001 by 2008 the united states had reduced its forces to approximately 3500 warheads on around 900 delivery vehicles these numbers appear in figure 2 during the 1990s the united states continued to add to its trident fleet reaching total of 18 submarines it retired all of its remaining poseidon submarines and all of the singlewarhead minuteman ii missiles it continued to deploy b2 bombers reaching total of 21 and removed some of the older b52g bombers from the nuclear fleet consequently in 2001 its warheads were deployed on 18 trident submarines with 24 missiles on each submarine and 6 or 8 warheads on each missile 500 minuteman iii icbms with one or 3 warheads on each missile 50 peacekeeper mx missiles with 10 warheads on each missile 94 b52h bombers with up to 20 cruise missiles on each bomber and 21 b2 bombers with up to 16 bombs on each aircraft the united states and russia signed second start treaty in early 1993 under this treaty the united states would have had to reduce its strategic offensive nuclear weapons to between 3000 and 3500 accountable warheads in 1994 the department of defense decided that to meet this limit it would deploy force of 500 minuteman iii icbms with one warh ead on each missile 14 trident submarines with 24 missiles on each submarine and 5 warheads on each missile 76 b52 bombers and 21 b2 bombers the air force would eliminate 50 peacekeeper icbms and reorient the b1 bombers to nonnuclear missions the navy would retire 4 trident submarines it later decided to convert these submarines to carry conventional weapons this treaty never entered into force and congress prevented the clinton administration from reducing us forces unilaterally to start ii limits nevertheless the navy and air force continued to plan for the forces described above and eventually implemented those changes table 1 displays the forces the united states had deployed in 2001 after completing the start i reductions it also includes those

reduce its strategic nuclear forces to 17002200 operationally deployed warheads over the next decade14 this goal was codified in the 2002 moscow treaty according to the administration operationally deployed warheads are those deployed on missiles and stored near bombers on daytoday basis they are the warheads that would be available immediately or in matter of days to meet immediate and unexpected contingencies15 the administration also indicated that the united states would retain triad of icbms slbms and heavy bombers for the foreseeable future it did not however offer rationale for this traditiona l triad although the points raised in the past about the differing and complementary capabilities of the systems probably still pertain admiral james ellis the former commander of the us strategic command stra tcom highlighted this when he noted in 2005 interview that the icbm force provides responsiveness the slbm force provides survivability and bombers provide flexibility and recall capability16 the bush administration did not specify how it would reduce the us arsenal from around 6000 warheads to the lower level of 2200 operationally deployed warheads although it did identify some force structure changes that would account for part of the reductions specifically after 14 president bush announced the us intention to reduce its forces on november 13 2001 during summit with russias president vladimir putin the united states and russia codified these reductions in treaty signed in may 2002 see crs report rl31448 nuclear arms control the strategic offensive

eliminate the 50 peacekeeper icbms reducing by 500 the total number of operationally deployed icbm warheads it would also continue with plans to remove 4 trident subm arines from service and convert those ships to carry nonnuclear guided missiles these submarines would have counted as 476 warheads under the start treatys rules these changes reduced us forces to around 5000 warheads on 950 delivery vehicles in 2006 this reduction appears in figure 2 the bush administration also noted that two of the trident submarines remaining in th fleet would be in overhaul at any given time the warheads that could be carried on those s ubmarines would not count against the moscow treaty limits because they would not be operationally deployed this would further reduce the us deployed force by 200400 warheads the bush administration through the 2005 strategic capabilities assessment and 2006 quadrennial defense review announced additional changes in us icbms slbms and bomber forces these include the elimination of 50 minuteman iii miss iles and several hundred airlaunched cruise missiles these are discussed in more detail below it is not clear whether these changes would reduce the number of operationally deployed warheads enough to meet the treaty limit of 2200 warheads the outcome depends on how many warheads are carried by each of the remaining trident and minuteman missiles and how many bomber weapons remain in the us arsenal the united states could reach the treaty limits by reducing the number of delivery vehicles by reducing the number of warheads carr ied on each delivery vehicle or by altering the way it counts the warheads on its delivery vehicles unlike start the moscow treaty does not contain definitions or counting rules that help determine the number of treatyaccountable warheads it also does not contain any monitoring provisions that would assist the nations in verifying compliance with the treaty further neither side has to declare how many warheads are deployed on any particular type of delivery vehicle theoretically each missile could carry different number of warheads without either side having to reveal the individual loadings or even the load ings attributed to any given portion of the force each simply has to declare the total number of warheads that it has designated as operationally deployed and that it therefore counts under the treaty limits table 2 identifies an illustrative force structure that the united states might deploy under the moscow treaty and compares it with us operational strategic nuclear forces in 2008 this structure is consistent with the statements and adjustments the administration has made to date but does not postulate any further reductions in the number of delivery vehicles the table also displays range for the number of warheads that could be carried by each leg of the triad even though as was just noted this estimate remains highly speculative 17 beginning in fy1996 and continuing through the end of the clinton administration congress had prohibited the use of any dod funds for the elimination of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles below start i levels until start ii entered into force see for example the fy1998 defense authorization act pl 10585 sec 1302 congress lifted this restriction in the fy2002 defense authorization act pl 107107 sec 1031

1993 start ii treaty would have banned multiple warhead icbms so the united states would have had to eliminate these missiles while implementing the treaty therefore the pentagon began planning for their elimination and the air force added funds to its budget for this purpose in 1994 however beginning in fy1998 congress prohibited the clinton administration from spending any money on the deactivation or retirement of these missiles until start ii entered into force the bush administration requested 14 million in fy2002 to begin the missiles retirement congress lifted the restriction and authorized the funding the air force began to deactivate the missiles in october 2002 and completed the process having removed all the missiles from their silos in september 2005 the mk21 reentry vehicles and w87 warheads from these missiles have been placed in storage as is noted below the air force plans to redeploy so of these warheads and reentry vehicles on minuteman iii missiles under the safety enhanced reentry vehicle serv program under the terms of start the united states would have had to eliminate the peacekeeper missile silos to remove the warheads on the missiles from

each base houses 150 missiles g15g146g156g156g146g149g142g561g18g149g138g151g156g561 in the 2006 quadrennial defense review qdr the pentagon indicated that it planned to reduce the number of deployed minuteman iii ba llistic missiles from 500 to 450 beginning in fiscal year 200718 the qdr did not indicate which base was likely to lose squadron of missiles although in testimony before the senate armed services committee general james cartwright the commander of us strategic command stra tcom indicated that the missiles would likely come from malmstrom becaus that would leave each base with an equal number of 150 icbms19 the air force deactivated the missiles in malmstroms 564th missile squadron which is known as the odd squad20 this designation reflects that these missiles were built and installed by general electric while all other minuteman missiles were built by boeing and that these missiles use different communications and launch control system than all the other minuteman missiles according to air force space command the drawdown began on july 1 2007 all of the reentry vehicles were removed from the missiles in early 2008 reports indicate that the missiles were all removed from their silos by the end of july 2008 and the squadron was deactivated by the end of august 21 in testimony before the senate armed services committee general cartwright stated that the air force had decided to retire these missiles so that they could serve as test assets for the remaining force he noted that the air force had to keep robust test program all the way through the life of the program22 with the current available assets the test program would begin to run short around 2017 or 2018 the added test assets would support the program through 2025 or longer this time line however raises questions about why the air force has pressed to begin retiring the missiles in fy2007 10 years before it runs out of test assets some have speculated that the elimination of the 50 missiles is intended to reduce the long term operations and maintenance costs for the fleet particularly since the 564 th squadron uses different ground control technologies and training systems than the remainder of the fleet this option is not likely however to produce budgetary savings in the nearterm as the added cost of deactivating the missiles could exceed the reductions in operations and maintenance expenses 23 in addition to use these missiles as test 18 us department of defense report of the 2006 quadrennial defense review washington february 2006 p 50 19 us senate committee on

programs described below this would further limit the budgetary savings at the same time after removing the missiles the air force will retain the silos at malmstrom and will not destroy or eliminate them retiring these missiles might also allow the air force to reduce the number of officers needed to operate the minuteman fleet and to transfer these officers to different positions although again the numbers are likely to be small nevertheless by retiring these missiles both stratcom and the air force can participate in the ongoing effort to transform the pentagon in response to post cold war threats these missiles may still have role to play in us national security strategy but they may not be needed in the numbers that were required when the united states faced the soviet threat congress questioned the administrations rationale for this plan to retire 50 minuteman missiles in the fy2007 defense authorization act hr 5122 sec 139 congress stated that dod could not spend any money to begin the withdrawal of these missiles from the active force until the secretary of defense submitted report that addressed number of issues including 1 detailed justification for the proposal to reduce the force from 500 to 450 missiles 2 detailed analysis of the strategic ramifications of continui ng to equip portion of the force with multiple independent warheads rather than single warheads 3 an assessment of the test assets and spares required to maintain force of 500 missiles and force of 450 missiles through 2030 4 an assessment of whether halting upgrades to the miss iles withdrawn from the deployed force would compromise their ability to serve as test assets and 5 description of the plan for extending the life of the minuteman iii missile force be yond fy2030 the secretary of defense subm itted this report to congress in late march 2007 in testimony before the senate armed services committee subcommittee on strategic forces on march 28 2007 general cartwright noted that

warren afb 25 reducing the minuteman iii force to 1200 total warheads in the process the air force also removed and destroyed the bulkhead the platform on the reentry vehicle so that in accordance with start rules these missiles can longer carry 3 warheads under start ii the united states would have had to download all the minuteman iii missiles to one warhead each although the bush administration initially endorsed the plan to download all minuteman icbms this plan has apparently changed in an interview with air force magazine in october 2003 general robert smolen indicated that the air force would maintain the ability to deploy these 500 missiles with up to 800 warheads 26 although some analysts interpreted this statement to mean that the minuteman icbms would carry 800

intent to maintain the ability to reload warheads and reconstitute the force if circumstances changed27 the npr had indicated that the united states would maintain the flexibility to do this however in testimony before the senate armed services committee general cartwright also indicated that some minuteman missiles might carry more than one warhead specifically when discussing the reduction from 500 to 450 missiles he said this is not reduction in the number of warheads deployed they will just merely be redistributed on the missiles 28 major general deppe confirmed that the air force would retain some minuteman iii missiles with more than one warhead when he noted in speech in midapril 2007 that the remaining 450 minuteman iii missiles could be deployed with one two or three warheads29 in addition as is noted below the navy may remove nearly 100 nuclear warheads from its trident missiles if it deploys some of these missiles with conventional warheads these warheads could be distributed to other trident missiles or the air force might add an equivalent number of warheads to its minuteman missiles consequently it seems possible that as the united states adjusts its forces in the coming years it could reduce its minuteman force to 450 missiles deploy 500600 warheads on those missiles and retain the ability to deploy up to 800 warheads on minuteman missiles under certain circumstances several factors are likely to affect the decision on the final number of warheads carried on minuteman missiles first as was noted above 150 minuteman missiles have been downloaded to single warhead under start rules and therefore can longer carry additional warheads that leaves at most 300 missiles that could carry 2 or 3 warheads second the air force is planning to deploy its minuteman missiles with the mk21 reentry vehicles removed from peacekeeper icbms under the serv program some of the modified missiles will carry single w87 warhead but the air force has not indicated how many missiles will be limited to this single warhead configuration 30 as result only portion of the minuteman fleet will still be able to carry more than one warhead finally the united states has committed to retain more than 2200 operationally deployed warheads on its strategic forces increases in the number of minuteman warheads above the 500600 expected on the downloaded force would necessitate reductions in either bomber weapons or trident warheads g15g146g151g158g157g142g150g138g151g561g15g152g141g142g155g151g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g156g561

modify the software change the mounting on the missile an d change the support equipment according to air force space command the serv program conducted three flight tests in 2005 and cancelled fourth test because the first three were so successful37 the air force installed 20 of the kits for the new reentry vehicles on the minuteman missiles at fe warren air force base in 2006 the process began at malmstrom in july 2007 and at minot in july 2008 as of early august 2007 47 missiles had been modified the air force plans to continue to purchase additional modification kits through 2009 and to

with the intent to begin deploying new missile in 2018 it reportedly produced mission needs statement at that time and then began an analysis of alternatives aoa in 200438 in june 2006 lt general frank klotz indicated th at after completing the aoa space command had decided to recommend an evolutionary approach to the replacement of the minuteman iii capability39 which would continue to modernize the components of the existing missiles rather than begin from scratch to develop and produce new missiles he indicated that this recommendation had not yet been approved and was still working its way through the pentagon however he indicated that space command supported this approach because it would be less costly than designing new system from scratch with this plan in place the air force now plans to maintain the minuteman fleet through 2025 or beyond this approach could ensure the longterm future of the icbm fleet more expensive new program could face costcutting pressures in bo th the pentagon and congress in addition budget limits could lead to pressures to reduce the number of missiles leading to further contraction of the icbm fleet on the other hand some might argue that new icbm program would demonstrate stronger longterm commitment by the air force to its icbm fleet it might appear easier to withdraw funding and support from the icbm fleet if the air force decides to modernize maintain and extend the existing missiles rather than to pursue new and possibly more capable technologies

deployment of 18 trident ballistic missile submarines ssbns each of these submarines was equipped to carry 24 trident missiles and each missile could carry up to 8 warheads either w76 warheads or the larger w88 warheads on the trident ii missile the navy initially deployed 8 of these submarines at bangor washington and all 8 were equipped with the older trident i missile it then deployed 10 submarines all equipped with the trident ii missile at kings bay georgia during the 1994 nuclear posture review the clinton administrati on decided that the united states would reduce the size of its trident fleet to 14 submarines and that four of the older submarines would be backfit to carry the trident ii missile the bush administrations 2001 nuclear posture review endorsed the plan to backfit 4 of the trident submarines so that all would carry trident ii missiles it also indicated that instead of retiring the remaining 4 submarines the navy would convert them to carry conventional weapons and designated them guided missile submarines ssgns consequently the us ballistic missile submarine ssbn force currently consists of 14 trident submarines with 7 based at bangor washington 5 based at

trident submarines so that they could carry the newer trident ii d5 missile this process would not only allow the navy to replace the aging c4 missiles it would also equip the fleet with missile that has improved accuracy and larger payload with its greater range it would allow the submarines to operate in larger area and cover greater range of targets these characteristics were valued when the system was designed and the united states sought to enhance its ability to deter the soviet union the bush administration believes that the range payload and flexibility of the trident submarines and d5 missiles remain relevant in an era when the united states may seek to deter or defeat wider range of adversaries four of the eight trident submarines based in bangor washington uss alaska uss nevada uss henry m jackson and uss alabama are part of the backfit program the alaska and nevada both began the process in 2001 the alaska completed its backfit and rejoined the fleet in march 2002 and the nevada did the same in august 2002 during the process the submarines underwent preplanned engineered refueling overhaul which accomplishes number of maintenance objectives including refueling of the reactor repairing and upgrading some equipment replacing obsolete equipments repairing or upgrading the ballistic missile systems and other minor alterations 44 the submarines also are fit with the trident ii missiles and the operating systems that are unique to these missiles according to the navy both of these efforts came in ahead of schedule and under budget the henry m jackson and alabama are scheduled to compete their engineering overhaul and backfit in fy2006 and to reenter the fleet in 2007 and 2008 the last of the trident i c4 missiles was removed from the fleet in october 2004 when the uss alabama offloaded its missiles and began the overhaul and backfit process all the trident submarines currently in the us fleet now carry the trident ii missile45

submarines at each of the two trident bases the navy would have transferred 3 submarines from kings bay to bangor after 4 of the submarines from bangor were removed from the ballistic missile fleet for balance of 7 submarines at each base however these plans changed after the bush administrations nuclear posture review the navy has transferred 5 submarines to bangor balancing the fleet by basing 9 submarines at bangor and 5 submarines at kings bay because two submarines would be in overhaul at any given time this basing plan means that 7 submarines would be operational at bangor and 5 would be operational at kings bay according to unclassified reports the navy began moving trident submarines from kings bay to bangor in 2002 and transferred the fifth submarine in september 2005 46 this

security environment with fewer targets within range of submarines operating in the atlantic and greater number of targets within range of submarines operating in the pacific in particular the shift allows the united states to improve its coverage of targets in china and north korea47 further as the united states modifies its nuclear targeting objectives and particularly if it deploys conventional warheads on trident submarines it could alter the patrol routes for the submarines operating in both oceans so that greater number of emerging targets would be within range of the submarines in short amount of time g25g138g155g145g142g138g141g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 the trident i c4 and trident ii d5 missiles can be equipped to carry up to 8 warheads each under the terms of the start treaty the united states can remove warheads from trident missiles and reduce the number listed in the data base process known as downloading to comply with the treatys limit of 6000 warheads the united states took advantage of this provision as it reduced its forces under start reducing to 6 warheads per missile on the 8 trident submarines based at bangor washington 48 the navy may also have begun to reduce the number of warheads on the other trident submarines as this will be necessary to allow the united states to reduce its forces to the 2200 deployed warheads permitted under the moscow treaty the united states does not have to reach this limit until 2012 but according to some reports would rather reduce its forces gradually than adjust them suddenly in the last few years before the treatys deadline 49 as it reduces to the level in the moscow treaty however the united states will not have to indicate how many warheads are deployed on each missile it will simply have to declare total number of operationally deployed warheads on all of its strategic nuclear delivery vehicles to meet the limit however it is likely to deploy an average of 4 warheads on each trident ii missile g15g152g141g142g155g151g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g561g18g149g138g151g156g561g138g151g141g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g156g561 the navy initially planned to keep trident subm arines in service for 30 years but has now extended that time period to 42 years this extension reflects the judgment that ballistic missiles submarines would have operated with less manding missions than attack submarines and could therefore be expected to have much longer operating life than the expected 30 year life of attack submarines therefore since 1998 the navy has assumed that each trident submarine would have an expected operating lifetime of at least 42 years with two 20year operating cycles separated by twoyear refueling overhaul50 the navy has also pursued number of programs to ensure that it has enough missiles to support this extended life for the submarines continued januaryfebruary 2006 47 ibid 48 even though 4 of these submarines are being converted to ssgns they

plan to deploy all 14 trident submarines with d5 missiles the navy extended trident production through 2013 and now expects to purchase 561 trident missiles at rate of 1224 missiles per year51 the navy expects to maintain fleet of 12 operational trident submarines with 24 missiles on each submarine but it would need more than the 288 missiles that would fill these submarines around 50 of the missiles would be available for use by great britain in its trident submarines the remainder would support the missiles test program throughout the life of the trident system the navy requested 220 million towards the purchase of trident missiles in fy2007 2115 million in fy2008 and 1863 million in fy2009

that they will remain capable and reliable throughout the 45year life of the trident submarines the navy requested nearly 700 million to support this program in fy2007 4577 million in fy2008 and 4874 million in fy2009 according to the navy this funding will sustain efforts to redesign the guidance system and missile electronics to extend the life of the missiles52 the navy expects the refurbished

with the mk4w76 warhead which according to unclassified estimates has yield of 100 kilotons53 it is nearing the end of its service life and is currently undergoing life extension program that is designed to enhance its capabilities according to some reports the navy had initially planned to apply this program to around 25 of the w76 warheads but has increased that plan to cover more than 60 of the stockpile several questions have come up during the life extension program for example some weapons experts have questioned whether the warheads design is reliable enough to ensure that the warheads will explode at its intended yield 54 in addition in june 2006 an inspector generals report from the department of energy questioned the management practices at the national nuclear security administration nnsa which is responsible for the life extension program arguing that management problems had led to delays and created cost overruns in the program this has raised questions about whether nnsa will be able to meet the september 2007 delivery date for the warhead 55 further nnsa has noted that it plans to eventually phase out the life extension program and use the new reliable replacement warhead program to develop 51 robert s norris and hans m kristensen us nu clear forces 2006 bulletin of the atomic scientists januaryfebruary 2006 52 us department of defense department of

the 2006 quadrennial defense review the pentagon called for the deployment of conventional warheads on portion of its trident slbms 57 according to dods plan the navy would deploy two trident missiles on each subm arine with conventional warheads and deploy 4 warheads deployed on each of these missiles for total force of 96 conventional warheads this would provide the united states with the capability to launch conventional warheads against targets around the world in less than an hour capability that does not now exist unless us forces are forwardbased in the region where the targets

bombers in 2001 it has sought to retire 30 of the aircraft leaving force of 62 bombers but has met resistance from congress the b1 served exclusively as nuclear delivery vehicle through 1991 carrying shortrange attack missiles and gravity bombs because these bombers were not equipped to carry nucleararmed airlaunched cruise missiles each counts as single delivery vehicle and single warhead under start in 1993 the air force began to convert the b1 bombers to carry conventional weapons this process was completed in 1997 and the b1 bomber is longer equipped to carry nuclear weapons although it still counts against the start limits neither the bomber nor its weapons count against the limits in the moscow treaty the bomber has contributed to us conventional operations in afghanistan and iraq

occasions in the last 1015 years for example when the united states identified the force structure that it would deploy under the start treaty it indicated that it would only seek to retain 76 b52 bombers congress however rejected the clinton administrations proposal and the united states retained the full fleet of 94 aircraft the 2006 quadrennial defense review called for significant change to the b52 fleet reducing it from 94 to 56 aircraft the budget request for fy2007 indicated that the air force planned to retire 18 bombers in fy2007 and 20 in fy2008 at the same time the qdr called for continuing improvements to the b1 b2 and b52 bombers conventional capabilities using the f unds that were saved by the retirement of the 38 aircraft the air force has argued that it can reduce the number of deployed bombers without reducing the overall capabilities of the bomber fleet because these new weapons have raised the efficiency of the bomber platform at hearings before the senate armed services committee general james cartwright the commander of stratcom noted that the next generation weapons that were fielding these airlaunched cruise missiles the joint direct attack munitions et cetera are much more efficient than they were in the past 62 general cartwright also indicated that in spite of the reduced size of the fleet the air force would continue to deploy b52 bombers at two bases during the fy2007 budget cycle congress rejected the pentagons proposals for at least part of the b52 fleet the house in its version of the fy2007 defense authorization bill prohibited the air force from retiring any of the b52 aircraft and mandated that it maintain at least 44 combat coded aircraft until the air force began to replace the b52 with new bomber of equal or greater capability it stated as part of its rationale for this rejection that it appeared the reduction was based on the reduced need for nuclearcapable bombers and did not take into consideration growing need for longrange conventional strike capabilities 63 the senate agreed to permit the air force to retire 18 b52 aircraft but stated that it expected further reduction in the size of the force noting that further reductions might prevent our ability to strike the required conventional target set during times of war64 the conference committee hr 5122 sec 131 combined these two provisions allowing the retirement of more than 18 aircraft after the submission of report and mandating that the air force retain at least 44 combat coded aircraft these restrictions are to remain in place until 2018 or until new longrange strike aircraft with equal or greater capability than the b52h model aircraft attained initial operational capability if that occurred first congre ss also stated that funds could be spent to retire any b52 aircraft until the secretary of the air force submitted report to congress that described the air force plan for the modernization of the b52 b1 and b2 bomber fleets how many bombers would be assigned two nuclear and conventional missions if the united states had to execute two overlapping swift defeat campai gns justification of the cost and projected savings of any reductions to the b52h bomber aircraft fleet the life expectancy of each bomber aircraft to remain in the bomber force structure and the capabilities of the bomber force structure that would be

would be ready in the fall of 2007 further in testimony before the armed services committee the air force indicated that it still plans to reduce the b52 fleet to 56 aircraft with 32 combat coded aircraft included in the fleet but in recognition of the congressional mandate it is seeking way to maintain 44 combat coded aircraft the minimum set by congress within the sm aller fleet of 56 aircraft it has also stated that it plans to store the 20 aircraft it wanted to retire in fy2008 on ramps at barksdale air force base the aircraft will be kept in serviceable condition but will not receive any capabilities upgrades 65 congress once again rejected this proposal in the fy2008 defense authorization bill hr 1585 sec 137 congress mandated that the air force maintain fleet of 74 b52 bombers with less than 63 in the primary aircraft inventory and 11 backup aircraft two additional aircraft would be designated as attrition reserve the conference committee indicated that the members agreed that fleet of fewer than 76 aircraft would be insufficient to meet longrange strike requirements in early may 2007 the air force indicated that it had decided that the next generation bomber would be manned and subsonic although it woul d incorporate some stealth characteristics 66 it has decided that it will not pursue supersonic capabilities or an unmanned option to contain costs and maintain the capabilities of the future aircraft the growing interest in longrange strike capabilities and the continuing addition of precision conventional weapons to these aircraft demonstrates that the pentagon and stra tcom view the us bomber fleet as essential to us conventional weapons capabilities further the need for longrange strike capabilities rather than an inte rest in maintaining the nuclear role for bombers appears to be driving decisions about the size and structure of the bomber fleet there are some indications that during the discussions on the qdr some in the pentagon argued that the all the b52 bombers should be removed from the nuclear mission both the house and the senate in their response to the administrations request also focused on the ability of the air force to meet its conventional weapons needs with smaller bomber fleet on the other hand several recent studies have noted that lack of attention paid in the air force and more broadly in dod to the bombers nuclear mission seems to be one of the factors that led to the episode in august 2007 when b52 bombers flew from minot to barksdale with six cruise missiles that carried live nuclear warheads 67 the air force is considering number of organizational and procedural changes to increase its focus on the nuclear mission and reinvigorate its nuclear enterprise for example it plans to standup b52 bomber squadron that will focus specifically on the nuclear mission68 while all the b52 bomber crews and aircraft will retain their nuclear roles single squadron located at minot will participate in greater number of nuclear exercises and training missions the aircraft in the squadron will rotate from other missions but will remain designated as the nuclear squadron for full year the air force hopes this construct will improve not only the operational proficiency of the crews but also their morale and their confidence in the value of the nuclear mission 65 us congress senate armed services committee

carry both the airlaunched cruise missile alcm and advanced cruise missile acm the acm reportedly has modified design with lower radar crosssection making it more stealthy than the alcm according to air force figures the united states has 1142 alcms and 460 acms69 although these weapons represent majority of the weapons that us bombers could carry on nuclear missions the department of defense recently decided to retire these missiles in his statement to the senate armed services committees subcommittee on strategic forces major general roger burg indicated that this study had concluded and the secretary of defense had directed that the air force retire all the advanced cruise missiles although some could be converted to carry conventional warheads and reduce the alcm fleet to 528 cruise missiles the excess alcms will also be eliminated and the remaining missiles would be consolidated at minot air force base with all the alcms consolidated at minot air force base the bombers at barksdale may longer be included in the nuclear mission both the alcm and acm were set to undergo lifeextension programs so that they could remain in service through 2030 70 both cruise missiles also carry the w80 warhead which was scheduled to for lifeextension program howe ver the department of defense has longer plans to support the w80 refurbishment program71 these program changes taken together raise serious questions about the future of nucleararmed cruise missiles and nuclearcapable bombers in the us strategic force this reduction in the alcm fleet and elimination of the acm fleet will help the united states meet its obligation under the moscow treaty to reduce to 2200 operationally deployed nuclear warheads by the end of 2012 under the start ii treaty the united states would have had to count the total number of nuclear weapons the b2 and b52 bombers were equipped to carry under its allocation of permitted warheads these warheads would have counted even if the bombers were equipped to perform conventional missions unless the bombers were altered so that they could longer carry nuclear weapon s under the moscow trea ty however the united states will only count as operationally deployed those nuclear weapons stored at bomber bases excluding small number of spare warheads it does not intend to alter any bombers so that they cannot carry nuclear weapons consequently the number of bomber weapons could decrease in the future even without changes to the numbers of deployed bombers as the united states retires weapons or removes them from storage areas

long periods72 the start of the study on new bomber known as an analysis of alternatives aoa had been delayed by dispute over whether the study should stand alone or be merged with another aoa on prompt global strike pgs while future bomber could be part of the pgs mission other systems such as hypersonic technologies and missiles would also be part of the effort to strike anywhere around the world at long range general cartwright the former head of stra tcom reportedly supported plan to merge the two efforts so that the considerations of capabilities for new bomber would be measured along side other systems both to balance the force and avoid redundancy across the force 73 on the other hand the former air force chief of staff general t michael moseley reportedly preferred to keep the two studies separate he argued that bomber with longrange strike capabilities must have persistent survivable and penetrating capabilities while platform with pgs capabilities could be standoff weapon that is very very fast 74 this position reportedly prevailed with the air force deciding in may 2006 to keep the two studies separate75 this dispute reveals wideranging differences within the air force and pentagon about the goals for and capabilities that should be sought in new bomber program76 the dispute focuses however on conventional capabilities it seems to be almost foregone conclusion that nuclear capabilities or the need for bomber leg of the nuclear triad will not drive the discussion or analysis g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561 this

to assure allies and friends of the us commitment to their security to dissuade potential adversaries from challenging the united states with nuclear weapons or other asymmetrical threats to deter adversaries by promising an unacceptable amount of damage in response to an adversarys attack and to defeat enemies by holding at risk those targets that could not be destroyed with other types of weapons78 further says dod the united states will develop and ma intain the capabilities it needs to counter the capabilities of wider range of adversaries under wider range of circumstances it has designated these circumstances as immediate contingencies potential contingencies and unexpected contingencies79 the 2001 nuclear posture review determined that the united states would need to maintain between 1700 and 2200 operationally deployed nuclear warheads to achieve the goals outlined above the bush administration also indicated that the united states would maintain in storage many of the warheads removed from deployed forces and would maintain the capability to restore some of these warheads to the deployed forces to meet unexpected contingencies this option could increase the size of the us deployed force to more than 3000 warheads the administration has indicated that all four of the objectives noted above contribute to the decision on us force size in contrast with the past when deterrence and defeat of russia dominated force size decisions 80 some analysts have questioned why the united states must maintain such large force of nuclear weapons if it is not planning to use its forces against russian threat they have questioned whether the united states would attack with ch large number of weapons if its own national survival were not at risk and they note that only russia currently has the capability to threaten us national survival they assert that the united states could likely meet any other potential contingency with far smaller force of nuclear weapons therefore some have asked why in the absence of threat from russia must the united states maintain force of 2200 nuclear warheads some have concluded instead that the united states could maintain its security with force of between 500 and 1000 warheads 81 the bush administration disputes this view noting that the united states has other potential adversaries and even if these nations do not possess thousands of nuclear warheads some may expand their nuclear forces or chemical and biological capabilities in the future and it has asserted that the need to assure allies and dissuade potential adversaries could require force of significant size regardless of the number of potential targets nation might possess 78 us department of defense special briefing on the nuclear posture

when the bush administration announced the results of the nuclear posture review it indicated that the united states would retain triad of icbms slbms and heavy bombers for the foreseeable future but it did not offer rationale for the retention of this traditional triad the absence of rationale makes it difficult to predict possible future trends for any of the three legs of the triad as was noted above most discussions about the bomber force focus on how many bombers and what types of bomber weapons the united states needs to bolster its conventional longrange strike capability there is little if any discussion about the role that bombers may play in either nuclear deterrence or if deterrence fails in the launch of us nuclear weapons it is not surprising that some in the air force and pentagon have questioned the continuing need for nuclearcapable bombers it is similarly hard to predict the future size of the icbm force in the absence of any statements about the unique or complementary role that icbms may play in the us nuclear deterrent posture in the future in the past analysts have argued that singlewarhead icbms bolster crisis stability and discourage efforts by an adversary to launch disarming first strike because the cost of the strike as measured by the number of attacking warheads would exceed the benefits as measured by the number of warheads destroyed this when combined with the high accuracy and prompt responsiveness of icbm warheads argued for substantial fleet of 500 or more icbm launchers but one does not hear similar arguments in current discussions if the goal is simply to retain 500 or fewer warheads based on land then force of 150200 minuteman missiles could be sufficient the trident fleet seems less vulnerable to the absence of rationale for triad of strategic delivery vehicles it is currently carries more than half of the us deployed nuclear warheads and this percentage will likely hold steady or even increase as the united states continues to reduce its forces to the levels mandated by the moscow treaty with its ability to remain invulnerable to detection and attack and with the increasing accuracy and reliability of its missiles and warheads the trident fleet will continue to represent the backbone of the us nuclear force further in the absence of arguments about the need for complementary capabilities and redundancy it is possible to imagine that in the future the trident fleet could represent almost the totality of the us nuclear force several officials in the bush administration have acknowledged that as the united states reduces its forces to the levels mandated by the moscow treaty the trident fleet will carry greater portion of deployed warheads 82 further the united states does not at this time plan to alter the basic structure of its trident fleet it will continue to deploy its submarines at two bases with portion of the fleet deployed in the atlantic ocean and portion deployed in the pacific ocean however if the united states reduces the size of its nuclear arsenal below the limits in the moscow treaty as many analysts have suggested that it do the united states may find it difficult to retain its triad of nuclear delivery vehicles most of the analysts who propose deep reductions to perhaps 1000 nuclear warheads readily acknowledge this and support changes in the us force structure some argue that the united states should retain only the warheads on its 82 see for example carlos munoz as stockpile shrinks nuclear force to focus more on slbms inside the pentagon

conventional missions and perhaps eliminate its landbased icbms however the united states might also have to reduce the size of its trident fleet from the current 14 submarines to perhaps 8 or 10 submarines if it reduced to 1000 warheads and with so few submarines the united states might have to eliminate one of its submarine bases leaving it with submarines based only in the atlantic or only in the pacific ocean this change may not be consistent with current submarine operations and employment plans the president and the us military may want to consider the implications of these basing operational and policy changes before deciding whether or not to reduce to 1000 warheads as opposed to choosing the warhead number first then deciding later how to base and operate the remaining nuclear forces g21g138g143g142g157g162g496g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g496g561g138g151g141g561g15g138g151g138g144g142g150g142g151g157g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 as was noted above in late august 2007 b52 bomber based in minot north dakota took off on flight to barksdale air force base in louisiana the bomber carried 12 airlaunched cruise missiles that were slated for retirement at barksdale as result of series of errors and missteps in the process of removing the missiles from storage and loading them on the bombers six of the missiles carried live nuclear warheads instead of the dummy warheads that were installed on missiles heading for retirement this episode led to series of studies and reviews by the air force that identified the source of the episode and identified number of steps the air force should take to improve its handling of nuclear weapons 83 further in early june 2008 secretary of defense robert gates requested the resignations of the secretary of the air force michael wynne and the chief of staff of the air force general michael mosely from their positions at least in part due to concerns about that shortcomings in the air forces handling of nuclear weapons resulted from an erosion of performance standards within the involved commands and lack of effective air force leadership oversight 84 secretary gates appointed task force lead by former secretary of defense and energy james schlesinger to provide independent advice on the organizati onal procedural and policy improvements necessary to ensure that the highest levels of accountability and control are maintained in the departments stewardship of nuclear weapons delivery vehicles sensitive components and basing procedures 85 several of the studies that reviewed this event have concluded that the air force leadership has lost its focus on the nuclear mission as the air force has diverted resources to more pressing missions related to the ongoing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan as result the nuclear enterprise has been allowed to atrophy with evident declines in morale cohesion and capability86 these reports suggest that the united states restore its focus on the nuclear mission 83 see for example the defense science board permanent task force on nuclear weapons surety report on the unauthorized movement of nuclear weapons february 2008 84 nuclear lapses

manpower and training programs for crews that maintain and service nuclear weapons and operate nuclearcapable bombers the studies have identified number of organizational changes to achieve these goals the air force plans to create new global strike command that would be responsible for both the icbm force and the nuclearcapable bombers and new headquarters office in the air force that would monitor and manage the resources and policies dedicated to the nuclear mission others however take away different lesson so have suggested that the evident weaknesses in the air forces procedures
