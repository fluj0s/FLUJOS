from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to andrew manning amanningueaacuk subject re fwd co2 data date tue oct 6 083804 2009 andrew getting bit fed up with these baseless allegations you could point out several things to martin 1 projections arent made with observed data instrumental or paleo they are made with climate models 2 the initial seed for all these allegations is made on climate audit here they are quite clever and dont go over the top they leave it to others like the national review the american thinker to make the ridiculous ones here is what stephen mcintyre says on climate audit while there is much to criticise in the handling of this data by the authors and the journals the results do not in any way show that agw is fraud nor that this particular study was fraud mcintyre has interest in publishing his results in the peerreview literature ipcc wont be able to assess any of it unless he does you dad and susan solomon have had runs in with him and others 3 you might like to send him this pdf and its figure 2 three different groups get much the same result here are the two web pages we have put up so far keith is working on the tree one and put much more later in the week 1httpwwwcruueaacukcrudataavailability so other groups around the world have also entered into agreements i know this doesnt make it right but it is the way of the world with both instrumental and paleo data i frequently try and get data from other people without success sometimes from people who send the pdf of their paper then tell they cant send the series in their plots 2httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffayamal2000 it is the right wing web sites doing all this presumably in the build up to copenhagen at 0013 06102009 andrew manning wrote hi phil is this another witch hunt like mann et how should i respond to the below im in the process of trying to persuade siemens corp company with half million employees in 190 countries to donate little cash to do some co2 measurments here in the uk looking promising so the last thing i need is news articles calling into question again observed temperature increases i thought wed moved the debate beyond this but seems that these sceptics are real diehards kind regards andrew date mon 5 oct 2009 155038 0100 subject co2 data from martin lutyens martinlutyensgooglemailcom to andrew manning amanningueaacuk dear andrew i just came across an article in the week called the case of the vanishing data it writes in rather wry and sceptical way about your uea colleagues phil jones and tom wigley saying that only their homogenised or adjusted historical data is available and the original raw data has gone missing apparently some other environmental gurus now want to look at the original data and were fobbed off according to the article the adjusted data forms the basis for much of the climate change debate and because others now want to look at the source data it is at the centre of an academic spat that could have major implications for the climate change debate the author of the original article is patrick michaels in the national review who may just be stirring it the article concludes in short the data invoked to verify the most significant forecasts about the worlds future have simply vanished could you comment on this please as someone eg siemens corp may pick this up and i think we should all be forearmed by knowing what really happened and what to say if asked many thanks martin martin lutyens 44 0 207 938 2387 44 0 796 646 2661 prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk references 1 httpwwwcruueaacukcrudataavailability 2 httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffayamal2000
