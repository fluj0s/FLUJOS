johnson specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industries divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34468the us trade situation for fruit and vegetable products summary over the last decade there has been growing us trade deficit in fresh and processed fruits and vegetables although us fruit and vegetable exports totaled nearly 9 billion in 2007 us imports of fru its and vegetables were more than 16 billion resulting in gap between imports nd exports of more than 7 billion this trade deficit has widened over time despite the fact that us fruit and vegetable exports have continued to rise each year because growth in imports has greatly outpaced export growth as result the united states has gone from being net exporter of fresh and processe d fruits and vegetables in the early 1970s to being net importer of fruits and vegetables today number of factors are shaping cu rrent competitive market conditions worldwide and global trade in fruits and ve getables in particular which explain in part the rising fruit and vegetabl trade deficit these include relatively open domestic import regime and lower average import tariffs in the united states with products from most leading suppliers entering the us duty free or at preferential duty rates increased competition from lowcost or governmentsubsidized production continued nontariff trade barriers to us exports in some countries such as import and inspection requirements technical product standards and sanitary and phytosanitary sps requirements opportunities for counterseasonal s upplies driven in part by increased domestic and yearround mand for fruits and vegetables and other market factors such as exchange rate fluctuations andstructural changes in the us food industry as well as increased us overseas investment and divers ification in market sourcing by us companies this situation has contributed to mands by the us produce sector that congress consider additional support for domestic fruit and vegetable growers in the pending omnibus farm bill especially give n the longstanding support provided to the main program commodities such as grai ns oilseeds cotton sugar and milk historically fruit

worldwide and may be contributing to tr ends in us fruit and vegetable trade relatively open us import regime and lower average import tariffs in the united states with products from most leading

exports in some countries including restrictive import and inspec tion requirements technical product standards and sanitary and phytosanitary sps requirements opportun ities for counterseasonal supplies driven in part by increased domestic and yearround demand for fruits and vegetables and other market factors such as exchange rate fluctuations and structural changes in the us food industry as well as increased us overseas investment and divers ification in market sourcing by us companies domestic import regime lower tariffs on us fruit and vegetable imports combined with relatively higher tariffs on us exports into othe r countries in part may explain why us export growth has not kept pace with import growth the us department of agriculture usda reports that the global average tariff for fruits and vegetables is more than 50 of the import value4 in the united states however about 60 of us tariffs on fruits and vegetables are ss than 5 this compares to japan and the european union eu where more than 60 of import tariffs range from 5 25 additionally nearly 20 of tariffs exceed 25 import tariffs in some developing countries are often higher with more than 80 of tariffs ranging from more than 25 to over 1005 countries with relatively high tariffs on fruit and vegetable imports include china eg ypt india korea and thailand most of the leading import suppliers of

and may be contributing to rapid import growth in some cases dutyfree or reduced tariffs provide an added advantage to supplying countries who may already benefit from lowercost fruit and vegetable production compared to that in the united states many of the countries that have entered into trade preference programs with the united states supply products such as banana s and other tropical fruits that are grown in limited supplies in the united states many also provide fruits and vegetables counterseasonally offseason to production in the united states however there is concern that an increasing share of imports are now directly competing with domestically produced commodities throughout the year significant gains in trade between the united states canada and mexico have followed the adoption of the north american free trade agreement nafta under nafta additional market access was created for tomatoes and peppers as tariffs were phased out or covered under seasonal tariffrate quota since the adoption of nafta in 1994 the volume of us imports of tomatoes and certain other vegetables from mexico have more than doubled imports from mexico of fresh peppers including bell peppe rs more than tripled8 imports from canada also increased significantly but from smalle r base during this same period us shipments of fresh tomatoes have declined to these tw countries while shipments of other types of vegetables have mostly increased but from smaller base rising consumer demand has also influenced im ports given the yearround availability of wider diversity of consumer choices

further claim that with each fta the us produce sectors have been negatively impacted through higher imports lower prices and growing trade deficit global competition among the us leading fruit and vege table import suppliers china and most european countries do not benefit from preferential import tr eatment under current us trade laws however fruit and ve getable imports from these countries are growing partly because of their lower cost s of producing packing andor processing fruits and vegetables compared to producers in the united states among many developing countries lower costs are ge nerally associated with lower overall production and input costs pa rticularly for labor among eu countries lower costs largely are function of farm subsidies and payments along with other forms of government support for fruit and vegeta ble production as part of the common agricultural policy in china average farmlevel costs are low because the majority of farm production is laborintensive on smallscale lowtec hnology operations using little or mechanized inputs labor is abundant and costs are low marketing costs for produce also are low given only basic p acking and packaging techniques and lack of uniform product sizes and grading standa rds at modernized facilities certain capital and production technology costs are higher but perunit labor costs and overall input costs still remain much lower than in the united states given such differences available cost data show that average perunit production costs in china for tomatoes peppers and citrus are rou ghly onetenth that in the united states11 by comparison us production costs are relatively high and have been increasing due to generally rising costs fo r energy and other farm inputs but also because of what some

rates of workers compensation and unemployment insurance13 immigration issues are also key concern which may be contribu ting to growing perception of shortage of available farm workers in some produc tion areas especially for harvesting tree fruits and specialty row crops14 farm costs in the eu also are relativ ely high however fruit and vegetable producers in most european countries di rectly benefit from support programs that effectively offset their production costs and allow them to become competitive on world markets the eus fruit and vegetabl subsidies vary by commodity but often include direct farm payments compensati on for further processing cofinancing of operational funds for producer organizations export subsidies promotional aid and other types of suppor t and financial aid15 commodities that benefit under such programs include tomatoes cauliflowers cucumbers artichokes olives peaches pears plums apples citrus grapes nd figs among others the total value of support

is considered to be production distorting by the wto nd is subject to reduction commitments comparable expenditures for the us fruit and vegetable sectors were negligible in the united states fruit

window for some imports has narrowed as result imports of some fruits and ve getables are directly competing with us production these in clude fresh tomatoes peppers potatoes onions cucumbers melon citrus grapes apples and other tree fruits imports of processed fruit and vegetable products such as fruit juices and various processed fruits and vegetables directly compete with us processed products yearround imports of counterseasonal fruits and ve getables are generally considered to have positive impact on us consumer demand by ensuring yearround supply and by introducing new products nd varieties which often stimulate add itional demand other perceived market bene fits include lowering costs given wider supply network improving eating qua lity assuring food safety conducting promotions and reducing product losses for example imports of fresh tomatoes may have contributed to increased overall demand by providing for the introduction of new domestic varieties including hothousegrown tomatoes that are valued by consumers for their taste perceived higher nd consistent quality and wider yearround availability similarly imports of peppers cucumbers and sweet onions have contributed to increased demand throug h the introduction of new colors mini varieties and other high lyregarded product qualities31 this expansion in consumer choice has contributed to overall higher demand for fruits and vegetables between 1980 and 2005 per capita consumption of all fresh and processed fruits and ve getables increased from roughly 600 pounds to about 700 pounds per person32 gains in consumption in turn necessitate the need for year round supplies resulting in higher count ercyclical import demand during the period from 1980 to 2005 imports as sh are of total domestic consumption increased from about 24 to nearly 39 for all fresh fruits and from about 9 to 14 for all fresh vegetables table 3 these averages mask even greater import gains for some commodities imports of grapes asparagus and garlic for example accounted for roughly 10 of consumpti on in 1980 and altogether now account for at least 50 there also is concern that the availability of imports may be lowering prices for fruits and vegetables because of increasin g overall supplies however between 1980 and 2005 prices paid for fresh fruits and ve getables remained strong and in many cases about doubled for all fruits and ve getables including processed products33 although price changes may vary for indi vidual commodities prices have shown increases over the period

shifts in global agricultural trade are exchange rate fluctuations and structural changes in the us food industry including increased us ove rseas investment and diversification in market sourcing by us companies generally as the dollar depreciates ag ainst foreign currencies us exports become more competitive and relatively less expensive than commodities produced domestically in the importing country indi cating subsequent increase in price competitiveness for us exports or rela tive increase in import prices conversely as the us exchange rate appreciates str onger dollar us exports may become less competitive or relatively more costly34 information from usdas agricultural exchange rate data set indicates that as the us dollar has steadily depreciated each year since 2002 us agricultural products including fruit and vegetable exports have likely become more price competitive however the extent to which this will actually result in reduced prices on impor ted products in foreign country will ultimately depend on how much an exporter or importer is willing to pass on tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34468crs15 35 usda annual commodity trade weighted exchange rates apr 2008

chinas fixed exchange rate may also affect its export potential by influencing relative price differences between countries further appreciation of the chinese exchange rate is expected to make imports more affordable which could raise us agricultural exports36 other factors reportedly influencing produce trade are evolving business practices in how produce is marketed nd sold usda study highlights some of these factors for the produce industry37 they include increased consolidation and concentration in the retail and shipping s ectors and the emergence of new industry trade practices including increased use of feebased services additional packaging and certification requirements increased use of contract and marketing agreements with buyers and development of emerging technologies and imp roved transportation the extent to which these factors may be influencing the individual produce sectors varies by commodity and also by marketin g channel eg retail versus food service sectors structural changes in the us food industry are further influenced by other economic and market changes that are occurring including increased diversification in supply sourcing and increased foreign investment and global integration by us agribusiness firms growing share of us fruit and vegeta ble trade both imports and exports is carried out by us and foreign multinational companies or enterprises these companies may produce the products they trad while some may only further process products and some companies only trade th products of other firms among the reasons why companies choose to extend th eir businesses globally are to build global supply base to ensure continued yearround supplie s to meet demand but also to source lowercost production in countri with relativel lower input and technology costs particularly for labor these trends may have been facilitated by the crossnational economic and financial integration that has followed bilateral and multilateral agreements among countries38 the increasing importance of multinational companies and their role in international trade complicates an analysis of global trade statistics this includes cases where us
