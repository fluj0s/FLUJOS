reversed its position in part on the basis of the number of states that had banned execution of the mentally retarded after the courts initial decision in thompson v oklahoma 487 us 815 1988 the court concluded that the eighth amendment barred the execution of juvenile who had not reached the age of 16 in the first stanford case the court refused to raise the bar to 18 the dissenters felt that the

those who were 16 or 17 at the time of their crimes stanford was 17 when he killed gas s tation attendant in 1981 justice stevens writing for the dissenters made it clear in th is case that an internal debate is underway that could lead the court somedaybut not nowto reexamine the constitutionality of executing individuals who committed their crimes when they were juveniles justice stevens cited the state response to the courts decision in stanford v kentucky as evidence of the same kind of trend that changed the outlook on executing the retarded4 therefore with regards to the execution of juveniles we will have to wait to see if therewill be increased pressure on state legislatures to increase the execution ages to help produce the kind of trend the court might credit when it does take up the issue millerel v cockrell5in 1986 thomas millerel an africanamerican male was convicted of murder and sentenced to death b texas jury during the jury selection at trial the prosecutors struck ten of the elev prospective africanamerican jurors from the jurypool6africanamericans and caucasians were questioned differentlyabout their views on the death penalty7most africanamericans heard detailed account of what would happen to millerel when he was executed and then they were asked whether they could vote to execute someone8only 6 of the potential caucasian jurors heard the same information9the petitioner also presented eviden ce of pattern of racebased jury selection methods used by the dallas county d istrict attorneys office including an office manual advising prosecutors to remove minority jurors10the trial judge rejected millerels equal protection challenge he was found guilty and sentenced to death while petitioners appeal was pending the court established in batson v kentucky11that it is unconstitutional to strike jurors solely on the basis of race and put greater burden on the state to show that it was not engaging in such behavior by establishing threeparthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21572crs3 12the threepart process for evaluating claims that prosecutor used peremptory challenges in violation of the equal protection clause are defendant must make prima facie showing that peremptory challenge has been exercised on the basis of race b if that showing has been made the prosecution must offer raceneutral basis for striking the juror in question and c in light of the parties submissions the trial c ourt must determine whether the defendant has shown purposeful discri mination 476 us at 968 13before prisoner seeking post conviction relief

s ct at 1046process for evaluating equal protection claims such as the petitioners12on remand the trial court concluded that the petitioner failed to satisfy step one of batson because the evidence did not raise an inference of racial motivation in the states use of peremptory challenges the texas court of criminal appeals also determined that the state would have prevailed on steps two and three because the prosecutors had offered credible race neutral explanations for the africanamerican s excluded ie their reluctance to assess or reservations concerning imposition of the death penalty to the extent that the petitioner could not prove purposeful discrimination after the petitioners direct appeal and state habeas corpus petitions were denied he filed federal habeas corpus petition under 28 usc 2254 raising batson claim and other issues the federal district court denied relief and the fifth circuit court of appeals refused to issue certificate of appealability coa13the fifth circuit noted that coa will issue only if the applicant h as made substantial showing of the denial of constitutional right14moreover it reasoned that 28 u sc 2254d2 required it to presume statecourt findings correct unless it determined that the findings would result in decision which was unreasonable i n light of clear and convincing evidence the supreme court held that the fifth circuit should have issued coa to review the district courts denial of habeas corpus relief to the petitione r because it applied more than the threshold standard required all the petition needed to show to satisfy 28 usc 2253c was that his claim would b found debatable or wrong among jurists of reason15 in finding by the fifth circuit that millerel had failed to establish that the state court resolution of his claim was both unreas onable and contrary to clearly established federal law the fifth circuit had improperly addressed the merits of the petitioners claim rather than limiting its inquiry to whether the merits of his claim were debatable by reasonable jurists justice kennedy delivered the opinion of the court in which chief justice rehnquist and justices stevens oconnor sca lia souter ginsburg and breyer joined justice scalia filed concu rring opinion in which he reviewed the arguments on behalf of the state that made the issue of whether reasonable jurists might debate the merits of

murder for killing restaurant manager whom he and an accomplice were trying to rob at the sentencing phase of his trial pennsylvania i ntroduced as an aggravating factor the fact that he killed while perpetrating felony as mitigating factors17sattazahn presented his lack of significant history of prior convictions and his young age at the time of the crime after 3½ hours of deliberation the jury deadlocked nine were against execution and three were in favor the judge dismissed the jury and sentenced sattazahn to life in prison without parole as pennsylvania law re quires judge to do whenever death penalty jury is deadlocked sattazahn appealed hi s first degree murder conviction however before the appeal was decided sattahazn pled guilty to five different counts of burglary one count of robbery and one count of third d egree murder which cannot be punished by execution subsequently sattazahn won his appeal based upon faulty jury instruction there was retrial and satta zahn was convicted and again the state sought the death penalty this time the state added an additional aggravating factor at the sentencing hearing that sattazahn had sign ificant history of felony convictions and the jury sentenced him to death the petitioner rgued that he should not have faced the death penalty in his second trial because the trial judge had sentenced him to life in prison following his first trial in 54 decision the supreme court upheld the death sentence justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court with respect to parts i ii iv and v in which chief justice rehnquist and justices oconnor ke nnedy and thomas joined and an opinion with respect to part iii in which chief justice re hnquist and justice thomas joined justice oconnor filed an opinion concurri ng in part and concurring in the judgment justice ginsburg filed dissenting opinion in which justices stevens souter and breyer joined the supreme court said in line of cases commencing with bullington v missouri 18 the touchstone for doublejeopardy prot ection in capitalsentencing proceedings is whether there has been an acquittal19the petitioner here cannot establish that the jury or the court acquitted him during his first capitalsentencing proceeding20the court ruled that pennsylvanias system of re quiring default life sentence is not the same for purposes of double jeopardy as an outright acquittal of the charges21when as in this case the jury deadlocks in the penalty phase of capital trial it does not decide that the prosecution has failed to prove its case for the death penalty rather the jury makes decision at all22wrote justice oconnor in an opinion concurring with the majorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21572crs5 23idat 744 24idat 747 25idat74748 26idat 748 27123 s ct 2527 2003 28537 us 1027 2002in the dissent justice ginsburg said the issue was genuinely debatable but that double jeopardy should preve nt sattazahns death sente nce in the second trial23she said i recognize that this is novel and close stion sattazahn was not acquitted of the death penalty but his case was fully tried and the court on its own motion entered final judgmenta life sentenceterminating the trial proceedings24she also said the courts decision confronts defendants with peril ous choice if defendant sentenced to life after jury deadlock chooses to appeal her underlying conviction she faces the possibility of death if she is successful on app eal but convicted on retrial if on the other hand the defendant loses her appeal or choos to forgo an appeal the final judgment for life stands25in the end she said defendant in sattazahns positio n must relinquish either her right to file potentially meritorious appeal or her stategranted entitlement to avoid the death penalty26 wiggins v smith27in 1989 petitioner wiggins was convicted of capital murder by maryland judge and subsequently elected to be sentenced by jury his public defenders moved to bifurcate the sentenci ng stating that they planned to prove that wiggins did not kill the victim by his own nd and then if necessary to present mitigation case the court denied the motion at sentencing one of the defense attorneys told the jury in her opening statement tha t they would hear among other things about wiggins difficult life but this evidence was never introduced before closing arguments and outside the presence of the jury the defe nse attorney made tentative overture to the court to preserve the bifurcation issue for appeal detailing the mitigation case they as defense counselors would have presented t he lawyers for wiggins never mentioned his life history or family background the jury sentenced wiggins to death and the maryland court of appeals affirmed rep resented by new counsel wiggins sought postconviction relief arguing that his trial counsel had re ndered ineffective assistance by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidenc of his dysfunction background which included sever physical and sexual abuse he suffere d at the hands of his mother and while under the care of series of foster parents the trial court denied the petition and the state court of appeals affirmed concluding that trial counsel had made reasoned choice to proceed with what they considered their best defense subsequently the federal district court granted wiggins relief on his federal habeas petition holding that the maryland courts rejection of his ineffective assistan ce claim involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law in reve rsing the fourth circuit found trial counsels strategic decision to focus on wiggins direct responsibility to be reasonable the supreme court granted certiorari28and reversed the fourth circuit court of appealshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21572crs6 29466 us 668 1984 30123 s ct at 2535 31id 32id 33the original lawyers concentrated on trying to raise doubts about their clients guilt although they had some information about wiggins early life they did not order the usual detailed background investigation that could be used to win sympathy from jury if jurors knew the ghastly details they might well have chosen life sentence for wiggens the supreme court majority stated 34this is marked contrast to the courts treatment of woodford v visciotti 537 us 19 2002 where the lower courts had conceded visciotti s ineffectiveness of counsel claim but found prejudice because of the relative strength of the aggravating factors in the case 35strickland v washington 466 us 668 1984the court said the legal principal has b een established that governs claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in strickland v washington29and in 72 decision held that counsel did not conduct reasonable inves tigation and reversed the death sentence of wiggins an ineffective assistance claim has two components petitioner must show that counsels performance was deficie nt and that the deficiency prejudiced the defense30to establish deficient performance petitioner must demonstrate that counsels representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness31the court has declined to articulate specific g uidelines for appropria attorney conduct but instead emphasized that the proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under preva iling professional norms32counsel decision not to expand their investigation beyond presentence investigation report and baltimore city department of social services records fell short of the professional standards prevailing in maryland in 198933standard practice in maryland capital cases at that time included the preparation of social history report although there were state funds to retain forensic social worker counsel chose not to commission report moreover the court concluded that wiggins had been prejudiced by the failure to fully investigate his social history given the relative weakness of the aggravating evidence offered by the prosecution wiggins was therefore entitled to new sentencing hearing34 justice sandra day oconnors opinion was joined by chief justice william rehnquist and justices john paul stevens an thony kennedy david souter ruth bader ginsburg and stephen breyer justice antonin scalia with whom justice clarence thomas joined dissented in the past the court has stressed the importance of effective legal representation but has provided leeway for lawyers to conduct trials as they deemed appropriate35the decisions in wiggins however could send strong signal to lower courts reminding them of the need for more vigilant defenses in deathpenalty cases
