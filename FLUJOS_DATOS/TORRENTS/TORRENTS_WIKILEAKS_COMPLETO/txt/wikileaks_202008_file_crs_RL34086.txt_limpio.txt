affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division bruce vaughn specialist in asian affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division the southwest pacific us interests and chinas growing influence summary this report focuses on the 14 sovereign nations of the southwest pacific or pacific islands region and the major external powers the united states australia new zealand france japan and china it provides an explanation of the regions main geographical political and economic characteristics and discusses united states interests in the pacific and the increased influence of china which has become growing force in the region the report describes policy options as considered at the pacific islands conference of leaders held in washington dc in march 2007 although small in total population approximately 8 million and relatively low in economic development the southwest pacific is strategically important the united states plays an overarching security role in the region but it is not the only provider of security nor the principal source of foreign aid it has relied upon australia and new zealand to help promote development and maintain political stability in the region key components of us engagement in the pacific include its territories guam the northern mariana islands and american samoa the freely associated states marshall islands micronesia and palau military bases on guam and kwajalein atoll marshall islands and relatively limited aid and economic programs some experts argue that us involvement in the southwest pacific has waned since the end of the cold war leaving power vacuum and that the united states should pay greater attention to the region and its problems they contend that in some pacific island countries weak political and legal institutions corruption civil unrest and economic scarcity could lead to the creation of failed states or allow for foreign terrorist activity within their borders according to some observers unconditional and unregulated foreign aid and business investment from china and taiwan which may be attractive to some pacific island states may exacerbate underlying political social and economic tensions in the region while chinas influence is largely limited to diplomatic and economic soft power many analysts disagree about the prcs longterm intentions in 2007 the bush administration pledged to reengage with the region and declared 2007 the year of the pacific among the main topics aims and initiatives under discussion at the pacific islands conference of leaders were expanding us public diplomacy efforts and foreign aid activities strengthening uspacific trade and preferential trade programs for pacific island countries addressing global warming and other environmental concerns in the region and enhancing

overview the united states plays an overarching security role in the southwest pacific but it is not the only provider of security nor the principal source of foreign aid and has relied upon australia and new zealand to help promote development and maintain political stability in the region some observers have characterized the us role in the pacific as one of benign neglect others have described it as transient responding to changes in the global security environment from the cold war to the war on terrorism rather than the longterm development needs of the region key areas of us engagement in the pacific include its territories guam the northern mariana islands and american samoa the freely associated states marshall islands micronesia and palau military bases on guam and kwajalein atoll marshall islands and relatively limited aid and economic programs the united states has security political economic and environmental interests in the pacific including providing security for and promoting economic development in the freely associated states and us territories maintaining its military bases and installations preventing transnational crime and the harboring of terrorist cells and working with australia and new zealand to meet common regional goals the pacific islands can be divided into four spheres of influence american australian new zealander and french the american sphere extends through parts of micronesia which includes us territories and the freely associated states fas as well as polynesia including hawaii and american samoa australias regional interests focus on the islands south of the equator including the relatively large melanesian nations of papua new guinea png and the solomon islands as well as vanuatu new zealand has longstanding ties with the territory of tokelau former colony samoa also known as western samoa and two selfgoverning but freely associated states the cook islands and niue new zealand also has large native polynesian population of maoris as well as large numbers of other more recently arrived pacific islanders france continues to administer french polynesia and new caledonia australia japan new zealand the united kingdom and the united states are the major providers of development assistance1 in the past several years china has asserted increasing soft power in the region primarily diplomatic and economic influence2 other than australia and new zealand the only 1 most us assistance to the region is not development aid but rather economic grants provided to the freely associated states pursuant to the compacts of free association 2 see scott whitney us pays little attention to asia less to the pacific pacific islands report july 2 2003 for further information see henry s albinski external continued crs2 regional states with defense forces are papua new guinea tonga and fiji the united states is obligated by treaty agreement to defend the freely associated states several other states rely upon australia and new zealand for their external security key policy concerns since world war ii the united states has sought to prevent any potential adversary from gaining strategic posture in the south pacific that could be used to challenge the united states in pursuit of this goal the united states has administered territories and entered into compacts of free association in the micronesian area of the pacific and maintained military bases on guam and kwajalein atoll since the end of the cold war the united states security political and economic engagement in the micronesian area has remained strong however compared to australian and new zealand policymakers us officials have expressed less direct concern about issues affecting other areas in the region as well as the southwest pacific as whole usaid withdrew its mission in the pacific in the mid1990s the us government has both tacitly and openly supported australias growing leadership role in the region the bush administration may have signaled move toward greater or renewed involvement when it declared 2007 the year of the pacific some experts suggest that the united states should pay greater attention to or more directly engage the southwest pacific in some pacific island countries weak political and legal institutions corruption civil unrest and economic scarcity could lead to failed states andor become springboards for terrorism3 australias decision to lead regional peacekeeping mission to the solomon islands in 2003 to help quell ethnic strife reportedly was part of larger effort to prevent transnational crime and terrorism from taking root in the region in 2004 report by an australian public policy institution warned that papua new guinea was headed for possible social and economic collapse and that the countrys weak government border controls and policing had allowed transnational criminal groups to enter the country the study called for australia and other countries to increase foreign aid to papua new guinea4 some analysts argue that addressing these issues would not only help promote political stability and economic development but also enhance us security interests and counter possible adverse effects of chinas growing influence in the region according to some observers unconditional and unregulated foreign aid and business investment from china and taiwan provided without goals related to democracy sustainable development fair working conditions and the environment may exacerbate underlying political economic and social problems in the region 2

about 8 of the land is arable the area has population of nearly 8 million among the 14 independent states see appendix the total gdp of these islands in purchasing power parity terms is approximately 24 billion in 2006 about the same as panama with the exception of fiji which has significant ethnic indian minority the pacific island nations are populated predominantly with indigenous peoples polynesians melanesians and micronesians these three groups differ historically by geography language culture and physical characteristics polynesia is located roughly in the southeastern part of the region while melanesia lies in the southwest closer to australia micronesia straddles the north the pacific island nations pins were among the last to regain independence following world war ii countries that remain as territories include guam the mariana islands and american samoa united states new caledonia and french polynesia france tokelau new zealand and easter island chile the 14 sovereign states of the region are formal democracies mostly parliamentary with loosely organized political parties and some incorporation of traditional tribal practices since gaining independence

guinea and the solomon islands have limited natural and human resources upon which to launch sustained development many small pacific island nations are hindered by weak resource and skilled labor bases lack of economies of scale primitive infrastructure poor government services and remoteness from international markets some are threatened by rising sea levels as well the asian development bank

governments and multilateral institutions help the atoll nations to establish trust funds as principal sources of government revenue us security interests in the pacific the freely associated states fas together with guam and the northern mariana islands have been regarded as security border of the united states the defense of which is considered to be key to maintaining vital sea lanes in addition to being home to the reagan ballistic missile defense test site at kwajalein atoll in the marshall islands the fas are located strategically between hawaii and guam according to some military experts the fas provide vast buffer zone for guam which serves as the forward military bridgehead from which to launch us operations along the asiapacific security arc stretching from south korea and japan through thailand and the philippines to australia the us military is building up forces on guam to help maintain deterrence and respond to possible security threats in the pacific10 during the cold war the fas helped the united states to bolster its security posture in the pacific particularly in the 1980s as the status of us bases in the philippines came into doubt and as the soviet union took steps to increase its presence in the region during this time palau was considered as possible alternative base location to the philippines with the end of the cold war us attention to the pacific region including foreign aid and public diplomacy has waned however us economic and security commitments to the fas have been maintained through the compact of free association11 9 palau and

attack or threat of attack the united states may block fas government policies that it deems inconsistent with its duty to defend the fas the socalled defense veto the united states also has the prerogative to reject the strategic use of or military access to the fas by third countries the so called right of strategic denial the united states invoked this provision in 2001 when it rejected the marshall islands decision to allow three taiwan naval cadet training vessels to stop in the rmi citing sensitivities in the uschina relationship16 similar taiwan friendship fleet visited palau in 2005 without us objections in addition to grant and trust fund assistance the united states may make strategic decisions related to the fas pursuant to the compact of free association the united

military facilities in the fas the united states has military presence only in the marshall islands through the military use and operating rights agreement muora with the rmi the united states operates military facilities on kwajalein atoll the united states regularly conducts missile defense tests and space surveillance activities from the kwajalein missiles range or the reagan missile test site kwajalein also serves as an intercontinental ballistic missile icbm test target some experts consider the site to be of critical importance in the bush administrations missile defense program17 marshall islands changed circumstances petition in september 2000 the republic of the marshall islands government submitted to the united states congress changed circumstances petition related to us nuclear testing on the marshall islands atolls of bikini and enewetak during the 1940s and 1950s the petition requests additional compensation for personal injuries and property damages and restoration costs medical care programs health services infrastructure and training and radiological monitoring according to various estimates between 1954 and 2004 the united states spent over 500 million on nuclear test compensation and related assistance in the marshall islands including compact funding of 150 million as part of full and final settlement of legal claims against the us government the petition bases its claims for compensation upon changed circumstances pursuant to section 177 of the compact the petition argues that new and additional information since the enactment of the compact such as wider extent of radioactive fallout than previously known or disclosed and more recent radiation protection standards constitute changed circumstances that would justify additional compensation 16 other taiwan ship visits to the marshall islands had been approved in the past 17 under the compact as amended pl 108188 us base rights are to continue to 2066 with the us option to extend the arrangement for another 20 years to 2086 the united states pays use fees to the rmi of 15 million per year through 2013 rising to 18 million annually from 2014 through 2023 the united states can terminate its use of the site after 2023 crs8 in november 2004 the us department of state released report evaluating the legal and scientific basis of the petition the report

cit crs10 some sources estimate that china has become the third largest provider of foreign assistance in the region24 however experts generally do not include aid from china in rankings of major aid donors because it differs fundamentally in purpose and character and lacks transparency assistance programs from major donors such as australia and new zealand reportedly aim to achieve sustainable development in pacific island countries through promoting effective and accountable government and broadbased private sector growth25 by contrast aid from china often grows out of highlevel meetings with pacific island leaders and consists mostly but not entirely of loans infrastructure and large construction projects eg roads government buildings sports venues in capital cities that directly benefit the governments in power rather than local communities furthermore the chinese government does not release foreign aid data see chinas growing influence below table 2 foreign aid to the
