for ozone and particulates summary on july 18 1997 the environmental prot ection agency promulgated revisions of the national ambient air quality standards for groundlevel ozone and particulates epas action has elevated awareness of possible relationships between agriculture and air quality in the agricultural community many in agriculture including the department of agricultures agricultural air quality task force have questioned the scientific basis for the new standards the issues raised also have been aired at congressional oversight hearin gs this report summarizes these issues in assessing the potential impact of the new standards on agriculture it is important to note that epa has promulga ted new or revised standards for three different pollutants 1 ozone 2 the re latively coarse particulate matter already regulated pm10 and 3 new category fine particulates pm25 the potential costs and impacts of each of these standards is different agricultural production is adversely aff ected by ozone in the atmosphere so agriculture should benefit from strengthen ing of the ozone sta ndard epa estimates these benefits at 1 billion annually the agricultural community agrees that lowering ozone concentrations will improve yields while not necessarily agreeing with the epa estimate the vast majority of the emissions that form ozone nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds or iginate in urban and industrial areas agricultural sources of these emissions would not likely be directly targeted by measures implementing the new rule althoug h regulation of fuels and motor vehicles might have indirect impacts on the agricultural sector the second standard being revised that for pm10 category that includes fugitive dust from construction or tilling the soil is effectively relaxed under epas proposal the net effect would be that 31 of the 41 counties currently designated nonattainment many of them ru ral would be reclassified to attainment this would benefit agriculture by eliminating the need for additional controls in those areas the third standard for pm25 has been the focus of agricultures concerns epa states that fine particulates include five categories of pollutants two of which can come from agricultural sources epa denies any intention to regulate agricultural sources of these emissions which are not wellcharacterized and in the agencys view are less significant than emissions from power plants and transportation but agricultural interests have not been satisfi ed by epas response and in any event regulatory decisions will be made by the states not epa legislation has been introduced in bot h the house and senate hr 1984 s 1084 to block implementation of the new standards ma rkup of these bills has not been scheduled on march 4

particulates revisions of the ozone and particulate standards on july 18 1997 the environmental prot ection agency promulgated revisions of the national ambient air quality st andards naaqs for groundlevel ozone and particulates the revisions are the result of statutory requirement in section 109 the clean air act requires that epa c onduct thorough review of the naaqs at five year intervals and mak such revisions as may be appropriate in the case of particulates the standard had been mo st recently reviewed in 1987 the american lung association sued epa over its failure to act within the required time period in consent agreement epa has agreed to promulgate standards by july 19 1997 the ozone standard was not subject to the court deadline but was the focus of an earlier suit which epa settled by reaffi rming existing standards in february 1993 and promising to expedite its next review the agency subsequently placed its review and promulgation of ne w standards for ozone on the same schedule as that for particulates on the grounds that the two standards would requi re controlling many of the same sources of emissions the new ozone standard is 008 ppm averaged over an 8hour period as opposed to 012 ppm averaged over onehour period the particulate standard was changed in several ways the previous standard for particles smaller than 10 microns pm10 was relaxed as result of new aver aging methods and additional allowed exceedances but finer particles less than 25 microns in diameter referred to as pm25 are to be separately regulated for the first time in setting and revising the national ambient air quality standards the clean air act directs the epa administrator to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety this language has been interpreted both by the agency and by the courts as requiring standards based on review of the health impacts without consideration of the costs technological feasibility or other nonhealth criteria1 in developing these specific pr oposals the agency reviewed more than 270 studies of health effects over 3year pe riod before proposing standards2 the net impact of both the ozone and pm25 standards will be increased stringency analyses by interested parties as well as epa indicate that many areashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97670crs2 3due to lack of monitoring data for the spec ified pollutant the estimate is necessarily only rough approximation see http1346710412na aqspropmlisthtm for list of the counties 4for list of counties see http1346710412naaqsp roo3listhtmconsidered to be in compliance with the previous naaqs will not meet the new standards under the pm25 standard epa estimated th at about 170 us counties would not meet the standard versus 41 under the old pm10 requirement3 for ozone the number of counties out of attainment under the propos ed standard was estimated to nearly triple from 106 to about 2804 such an increase in the number of nonattainment areas and new methods of measuring air quality could have broad implications for epa the states and affected industries including agriculture but the effects would not be immediate number of steps will be necessary before the new standards can be imple mented in general epa concludes that it will be 58 years before any regulatory decisions affecting industry or other economic sect ors are implemented by the states based on the revised ozone standard and 1012 ears before regulations are promulgated by states implementing the pm25 standard lawsuits challe nging the standards or the measures adopted for implement ation could cause further lay during the interim new scientific reviews can be anticipated the 58 year delay for implementing c ontrols under the ozone standard results from the steps mandated by law for imple mentation of new standard under section 107 of the clean air act governors must submit list of areas not attaining national ambient air quality standard w ithin one year of its promulgation epa reviews the information submitted and fficially designates nonattainment areas within 2 years of promulgating the standard at the time of designation epa is require d by section 172a of the act to set date by which each area shall achieve attainment the date may be 5 years or 10 years following the date on which an area is officially designated the 10year date may also be extended for two additiona l oneyear periods thus areas newly designated as nonattainment under the ozone standard will have 714 years after promulgation of the ozone standard ie july 2004 july 2011 to attain it actual control measures to be implemented in the states are decided by the individual states using guidance provide d by epa following the official designation of nonattain ment areas july 1999 states are given 3 years to develop state implementation plan sip identifying the control measures that will be adopted to bring the areas into attainme nt following submission of these plans epa has 6 months to determine whethe r the submission is complete and an additional 12 months to approve conditiona lly approve par tially approve or disapprove states plan thus if all deadlines are met it would be january 2004 6 ½ years following promulgation of ne w standard before there is an approved implementation plan outlining the measures state will take to attain the standard the pm25 standard will take 5 years longer to implement than the ozone standard for two reasons first there is at present monitoring network in placehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97670crs3 to determine which areas ar nonattainment establishing this network is expected to take at least 2 years second attain ment determinations are based on the results of 3 years of monitoring thus 5 years need to be added to the front of the process described for ozone before governors w ill submit lists of nona ttainment areas to epa and the state implementation planning process for pm25 begins barring delays nonattainment areas would be designated by july 2004 with attainment deadlines in 20092016 the statutory deadlin for sips identifying specific control measures would be january 2009 if the earlie r deadlines outlined here are met these dates will be modified if an am endment to the surface transportation bill s 1173 approved by the senate in march 1998 is enacted the amendment samdt 1687 sponsored by senator inhof would give governors until july 1999 to submit designations of ozone nonattainment areas with final designation by the epa administrator in july 2000 this would add one year to the ozone implementation sche dule outlined above regarding pm25 the legislation sets december 31 1999 as the deadline for epa to establish monitoring network requires governors to submit lists of nonattainment areas one year after the recei pt of three years of monitoring data presumably december 31 2004 and sets december 31 2005 deadline for epa to designate nonattainment ar eas under this timetable the statutory deadline for sips outlining control measures would be june 30 2010 with attainment deadlines stretching to the end of 2017 this paper looks at the question of agricultural impacts from more stringent ozone and fine particle standards subcommittee of usdas agricultural air quality task force created by the 1996 farm bill drafted comments on the proposed rules during its initial meetin g in march 1997 excerpts from these comments were widely circulated in the fa rm press and in other places among other things the task force questioned the lack of information on incremental benefits and costs associated with attaining the propos ed standard called for improved monitoring capability for pm25 requested more complete ssessment of precursors to both ozone and pm25 suggested that epa look at key di fferences between rural areas and urban areas where much of the data have been collected asked epa to consider the special needs of smaller and less successful farmers and recommended that the epa analysis be based on fuller understanding of soil erosion problems and solutions agricultures views on possible effects have been discussed at several hearings the house agriculture committees subcommittee on forestry resource conservation and research held hearin gs on april 23 and september 16 1997 the senate agriculture committee held hearin g july 22 1997 in addition at an april 29 1997 hearing held by the senate co mmittee on environment and public works subcommittee on clean air wetlands private property and nuclear waste three panelists addressed agricultural topics agri cultural topics were also discussed at july 24 1997 environment committee hearing the comments offered at these hearings comments by usdas agricultural air quality task force and information concerning agriculture provide d in epas analysis of the proposals were the major sources of information used in preparing this report we begin however with some background concerning the depar tment of agriculture and its experience with air quality issueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97670crs4 5pl 104127 enacted april 4 1996 prior to the creation of this task force there was official interagency mechanism within usda to coordinate air quality topics 6the goal of the mou signed in february 1998 is to provide t houghtful process for involving the agriculture community and the environmental regulation community relative to agriculture air quality 7the minutes of the meeting are posted on the internet at httpwwwnhqnrcsusdagovair quality and the us partment of agriculture air quality emerged only r ecently as priority environmental topic in agricultural policy and at usda for example 1989 national assessment of resource conditions and concerns on the c ountrys privatelyowned lands published by usda included lengthy and detailed discussions of soil and water quality but only brief treatment of three air quality issues atmospheric deposition more commonly called acid rain ozone and wind er osion the focus of the acid rain and ozone discussions was on what is known bout relationships be tween each topic and agriculture and centered on research th wind erosion discussion explained why air pollution was one of the resulting problems since then the importance of relationships between air quality and agriculture has received increased recognition this recognition culminated in enactment of provisions in section 391 of the 1996 fede ral agriculture improvement and reform act better known as the 1996 farm bill re quiring usda to creat an agricultural air quality task force5 one finding in the statute states that studies alleging that agriculture is source of particulates ve been based on erroneous data and that usda should lead efforts to determine accurate measures of agricu ltures role in air pollution and in the development of cost effective approaches to reduce pollution the task force is an advisor to the secretary and focuses on research with emphasis on data quality and interagency coordi nation members of the task force selected in january 1997 are experts who represent usda industry and basic and applied science the law specifies that the chief of the natural resources conservation service serves as its chair at its first meeting in early march 1997 the task force deci ded to pursue developing memorandum of understanding with epa6 topics the task force is addressing include greenhouse gas emissions and climate ch ange volatile organic compounds and ammonia associated with livestock waste and odor and visibility questions that arise where agriculture is near re sidential and other land uses7 for example subcommittee of the task force will make recommendations to the whole group on prescribed burning to assist epa as it velops policy proposals on the topic the task force met three times during its first year the ozone and particulate issues the issues raised by revision of the ozone and particulate standards can be grouped in at least three categories the adequacy of the science underpinning the standards questions regarding implementati on and regulatory impacts including thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97670crs5 8house committee on agriculture news release april 23 1997 9closure letter from dr george t wolff chairman clean air scientific advisory committee to epa administrator ca rol browner november 30 1995 p 1costs and benefits of the proposals only the last of these has any unique agricultural component nevertheless because of epa s mandate under the clean air act the costs and benefits to agriculture or any ot her sector of the economy did not play central role in shaping the proposals scientific underpinnings questions concerning th scientific underpinnings of epas proposal have assu med predominant role in the debate epa estimates that fine particles cause 40000 deaths per year and that the proposed standard will reduce this mortality by 15000 lives annua lly the ozone standards projected effects are less dramatic epa estimates that implement ation of the ozone proposal would reduce the risk of significant decr ease in childrens lung functions by 15 million to 2 million incidences per year reduce the risk of moderate to severe respiratory symptoms in children by 200000 to 400000 incidences per year and prevent 1600 hospital admissions and 5000 em ergency room visits annually the standards will have many dditional effects both positive and negative but under the clean air act and its interpretation by the courts epa is prohibited from considering effects other than public health in the setting of air quality standards thus much of the debate has focused on the quality of the scientific data epa used to reach its conclusions representa tive larry combest chair of the house agriculture committees subcommittee on fo restry resource conservation and research which held hearing on the st andards april 23 1997 reflected the views of many in congress and in the agricultural community in stating the science employed in developing this rule is not up to par and im concerned that farmers could bear the brunt of bad policy based on equally bad science according to much of the testimony we heard today it appears the epas proposed standards do not reflect the science that is available8 while witnesses at this hearing incl uding scientific witnesses offered information to support this conclusion pr oponents of the standards have disagreed in other forums dr morton lippmann of new york universitys nelson institute of environmental medicine member of ev ery scientific pane l that has conducted epa reviews of the ozone and particul ate naaqs since 1980 concludes that there has never been proposed standard better supported by the scie nce he and others note that the particulate panel of the clean air scientific advisory committee casac agreed by vote of 192 that fine particles should be regulated and that separate casac panel that reviewed th ozone documents reached consensus that although our understanding of the health eff ects of ozone is far from complete the document epas staff paper outlining potential primary standards provides an adequate scientific basis for making regu latory decisions concerning primary ozone standard9 there is however consensus among both proponents and opponents that there is need for additional research which mig ht lead epa to further revision of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97670crs6 standards especially regardin g fine particles there is virtually monitoring data for pm25 little is known about the biological mechanisms that lead from inhalation of pm25 to disease or death and there is controversy concerning whether pm25 broad category that includes many diffe rent types of par ticles or some specific particle type within the broad category is the appropriate pollutant to regulate ultimately the issue of the adequacy of the science base for epas proposed standards could affect agriculture in two ways first there is the question of whether epa has the scientific data to assess correctly the effects of the pollutants if the standards are too stringent unnecessary costs of control will be incurred possibly affecting agriculture adversely convers ely if the standards are insufficiently stringent unnecessary harm from air po llution may result which for ozone could include adverse effects on agricultural productivity second there is the question of whet her further research would implicate agriculture as source of air pollutants subject to regulation for example as discussed below whether agricultural s ources of ammonia contribute to adverse effects attributed to pm25 and might be subject to regulation the requirement of the clean air ac t that epa regularly review the naaqs makes it clear that epa must make decision on the science base available what is at issue is the level at which the st andards should be set given the available science implementation issues number of issues have been raised concerning the consistency of the proposed standards with current provi sions of the clean air act and the pace at which air quality impr ovements would occur under the proposed standards the clean air act as written specifica lly references the existing 1hour 012 ppm ozone standard s ection 181 and the pm10 standard section 188 in categorizing nonattainment areas areas with ozone readings of 0121 to 0138 are defined as marginal and given 3year deadline to reach attainment 0138 to 0160 as moderate with 6year deadline 0160 to 0180 as serious with 9year deadline etc section 182 spells out requirements for each of the five ozone noncompliance categories and secti on 185 contains specific enforcement requirements for the two worst categories severe and extreme if they fail to attain the standard within the deadlines similarl section 189 spells out requirements for the pm10 noncompliance areas when the ozone standard changed fro m 012 ppm to 008 ppm the statutory definition of the 5 nonattainment categorie s became an anomaly requiring measured progress toward standard that longer exists even though virtually all parties concede that the ozone control measures required under the law are the same types of controls one would use to meet the new standard since epa is proposing to retain the existing pm10 standard the question of references in the caa specifically to pm10 as the pm standard poses less of problem nevertheless the measures ou tlined in sections 188190 do not address compliance with the pm25 standardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97670crs7 10bills seeking delay of the standards include hr 1984 klink and s 1084 inhofe senator inhofes amendment samdt 1687 although substantially different from s 1084 is considered substitute for the bill in discussing the amendment during senate debate march 4 senator inhofe announced that if the amendment were enacted he did not intend to bring up any other legislation or amendments affecting the naaqsepa has set forth an implementation plan for dealing with the transition to new ozone and pm standards but the implement ation plan itself raises questions the issue is not whether epa can implement new ozone and pm standards the act provides epa general authorities to implement air quality standards the issue is whether epa can disregard specific statutory requirements relating to the existing standards as implied by the implementation plan related set of questions concerns wh at all acknowledge is likely to be lengthy process for implementing the new standards as noted earlier after promulgation of the standards it is 5 8 years before any regulatory decisions affecting industry or other economic sectors are required to be implemented by the states based on the revised ozone standa rd and 1012 years before any regulations are likely to be promulgated implementing the pm25 standard lawsuits challenging the standards may cause further delay with regard to fine particulates the lengthy schedule for implementation leads some to conclude that conduc ting further research to obt ain greater certainty before regulating would have little impact on public health par ticularly as several existing clean air programs such as title iv concerning acid precipitation will reduce pm25 in the interim the same set of facts prompts others to suggest that the standardneeded to be promulgated as soon as possi ble to shorten what is certain to be lengthy implementation process there is general agreement that epa will still have time to revisit the pm 25 standard in 5 years as re quired by the act before any measures are taken to control emissions proponents of acting now argue that th standards can be revised based on additional research but that without co mmitment to move forward with regulations there will be little impetus to conduct the additional research proponents of delay on the other hand argue that huge expend itures of limited resources will be set in motion by the setting of standard and th at there should be greater certainty about the scientific underpinnings befo re those resources are committed10 regulatory impacts specific to agriculture even if there were controversies over the science or implementation issues there would still be questions about how these proposals would impact the economics of agriculture and other economic sectors farmers are less able than many othe r businesses to pass increased costs along to those who purchas their products because prices are set in commodity markets in which individual produ cers have negligible influence that inability combined with concern about the potential consequences of these changes has galvanized the farm comm unity critics of the proposals raise the specter of especially severe effects on small farmers with limited incomes affected farmers of any size might have any number of controls placed on their actions according to these critics from mandating till days to requiring that the ground

polluti on five counties in maine continuedmoistened before it is worked these concerns in some part reflect situation of uncertainty as epa has not stated what guidance it might develop affecting agricultural activities for states to meet the new standards most of the concerns about costs expre ssed by agricultural stakeholders reflect potential costs based on assumptions bout the implementation of the proposed standards the uncertainties in the science underlying the standards as previously noted and the uncertainties about how the standards would be implemented since this is future phase in the process give considerable range to such assumptions about potential costs however it is possible to identify factors concerning each proposed standard that place certain bounda ries on potential costs and indicate with some specificity which decisions are key to those costs th boundaries indicate that to the extent that agricultural stak eholders are concerned about the costs of epas proposals their focus should be on the pm25 standard but that key decisions that could affect those costs will not be made for 10 or more years ozone issues ozone received relatively little attention at any of the agriculture committee or subcommittee hearings agriculture recognizes that it is adversely affected by ozone tes timony from the national audubon society estimated that ozone can be responsible for up to 10 loss in crop production because the proposed standard would lowe r ozone concentrations in agricultural areas of the south midwest and north east epa has estimated 1 billion annual savings for agriculture based on incr eased crop yields from this proposal agricultural interests challenge the magnitude of these projected savings part of this challenge is based on concern that ozone measurements are generally taken in urban ar eas and agricultural repres entatives believe that ozone levels are much lower in rural areas if they are lower the crop losses and the crop benefits are both likely to be less than the estimates above if ozone is not as significant problem in rural areas these critics argue that agriculture should not be required to address it as the health benefits would be limited some of the characteristics of ozone pollution in rural areas were identified in recent policy forum11 the authors concluded that with new regulations in place large areas of the eastern united states would be in nona ttainment and require regional control strategies with potentially significant costs the role agriculture might play is unclear proponents of epas proposal respond in two ways first unlike other pollutants for which there are national ambient air quality standards ozone is not emitted directly into the atmosphere but forms downwind when sunlight and heat catalyze chemical reaction between nitrogen oxides nox and volatile organic compounds vocs once formed ozone can be transported long distances from urban to rural areas thus rural areas ar as likely as urban ones to experience high ozone levels provided that they are downw ind of the sources of ozone precursors12httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97670crs9 continued

to generate the nitrogen oxides and vola tile organic compounds that cause ozone to form in the atmosphere as result they argue agriculture is unlikely to be target of regulation under the ozone proposal in short they contend agriculture should benefit from these changes the actual measures to be taken to reach attainment would be determined by states through what are called state implementation plans all states model air quality based on current emissions and ambient air quality data and implement emission control measures sufficient for the models to demonstrate attainment as epa notes there are thousands of sources of these gases ozone precursors some of the more common sources are gasoline vapors chemical solvents combustion products of various fuels and cons umer products these products can be frequently found in large industrial facilities gas stations and small businesses such as bakeries and auto body repair shops13 by sector the major sources of nox and vocs include transportation electric utilities petroleum refining and marketing chemical manufacturing paints and architectural coatings the impacts on agri culture from regulating these sources are most likely to be indirect primarily the re sult of engine modifications that could be required of the manufacturers of farm equi pment or fuel modifications that might increase the cost of gasoline or diesel fuel pm10 issues the proposed changes in the pa rticulate standards affect both pm10 for which the standards would be less stringent and pm25 for which there would be separate standards for the first time the numeric standard for pm10 would remain the same but epa would use di fferent method of cal culating attainment that allows additional days bove the standard the net eff ect would be that 31 of the 41 counties currently design ated nonattainment many of them rural would be reclassified to attainment14 agriculture is major source of pm10 accounting for about 17 of emissions

percentage of emissions in specific regions despite being major source of pm10 agricultural activities have not generally been regulated under the current standard nevertheless the weakening of the pm10 standard could lower potential costs and re gulatory requirements for agriculture in cases where it is major source of emi ssions in current pm nonattainment areas pm25 issues data are inconclusive concerning agricultures role as source of fine particles pm25 in large measure this is because in the absence of regulation there existed fewer than 50 pm25 monitors in the entire country thus most of epas data on the prevalence and sources of pm25 are estimates subject to potentially large revisions in formulating its estimates of areas likely to exceed the proposed pm25 standard epa relied in part on estimated relationships between pm10 and pm25 and in part on monitoring data from representative sites in different regions of the country as noted agricultural activities are major sources of pm10 which is essentially dust raised from unpaved road s construction and tilling and particles generated in other mechan ical processes but pm25 is thought to represent different class of particles more the products of evaporati on and combustion for which agriculture is less likely source than th result of mechanical processes such as tilling epas regulatory impact analysis for the

these pollutants as estimated by epa are summarized in table 1 as shown emissions of so2 and nox are by far the largest so2 emissions totaled 291 million tons in 1990 of whic h coalfired utilities accounted for more than half nox emissions totaled 256 million tons with fuel combustion and vehicles accounting for nearly all of the total agricultural activities including farm machinery operating in connection with producing crops accounted for less than 01 of each of these pollutants acco rding to epas estimates similarly agriculture accounted for only 200 tons ss than 01 of the total soa emissions of 221000 tons agricultural activities do appear to be major sources of the other two categories according to epa livestock feed lots are the largest source of anthropogenic ammonia emissions 77 percen t followed by crop production 8 percent but the agency went on to note that biogenic emissions of ammonia decomposition of plants and animals forest fires and human breath and perspirati on also contribute to ammonia emissions as result the agency concluded ammonia emissions are not considered for control in this anal ysis given that ammonia sources are not thoroughly

of other fugitive dust or 05 of the total emissions that become pm25 includes agricultural burning and prescribed burning for forest and range management httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97670crs12 17in june 16 briefing for staff of the house agriculture committee epa presented data comparing the composition of pm10 and pm 25 for three areas in washington dc typical of an eastern city soil represents 31 of pm10 but only 5 of pm25 in phoenix arizona representative of an arid western city surr ounded by desert and agriculture soil represents 66 of pm10 but only 16 of pm25 in the san joaquin valley of california heavily agricultural area soil is 53 of pm10 but only 7 of pm25 the agency also identified sources of soil in the air concluding th at in both washington and phoenix roads and construction sites were the overwhelming sour ces not agriculture see us epa office of air quality planning and standards emissi ons monitoring and analysis division pm25 composition and sources june 16 1997 18letter from epa administrator carol browner to secretary of agriculture dan glickman june 5 1997the remaining category fugitive dust is also source of concern to farm organizations epa concludes that agricultural activities account for 837700 tons of fugitive dust 12 of total emissions and that production of livestock accounts for an additional 3 fugitive dust in tota l is relatively small component of the pm25 problem and epa argues that one of the major effects of switching from focus on pm10 to pm25 is to lessen the need to control dust which in the agencys view is not as significant pollutant as emissions from power plants and transportation sources17 but agricultural interests have not been completely satisfied by epas response regarding ammonia or fugitive dust and both sides note that in any event regulatory decisions will be made by the states not epa finally there are specialized agricultural practices that might be locally important to pm25 attainment one of these is agricultural burning epa identified agricultural burning as part of category that also included prescribed burning for forest and range management together these activities are estimated to generate 379100 tons of pm25 annually about 5 of the direct pm25 emissions or 05 of emissions including precursors prescrib ed burning is unlike other sources of pm25 because it is not continuous activity ra ther it is planned and conducted during confined periods of time it is unclear from the data whether prescribed burns are common in areas that might be designated nonattainment and the regulatory impact analysis did not address whether measures controlling agricultural burning might be necessary nevertheless the planned and limited nature of the activity leave open the possibility that management strategies may be able to accommodate burning within the proposed standard position the epa admin istrator articulated in letter to the secretary of agriculture june 518 in addition as promulgated the 24hour pm25 standard relaxed the pr oposed standard from 50 gm3 to 65 gm3 this change is expected to create additional flexibility for episodic sources of fine particles such as prescribed burning of agricultural fields or range land concerns about the quality of the underlyi ng scientific res earch on particulate matter are related to the potential agricultural impacts of the standards as noted previously at the core of the science issue is the question of whether more research would help to better define either the problem or the so lution or conversely whether the health threat is such that action is warranted now before better information becomes available but many other questions have been raised examples of the many questions that were raised in hearings were the potential errors in calculating the statistical association between particulate matter and health effects the inabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97670crs13 19article attached to the testimony submitted by mr bob vice representing the california and american farm bureau federationto make precise estimates using the agriculture tillage emissions test basing estimates of the amount of pa rticulates put into the tmosphere by tillage on limited bench research with little or apparent field testing and the inability to distinguish the source of the particulates generated by alternative tillage methods one witness pointed to research conclusion that larg portion of the very fi ne particulate matter in the eastern united states originates not in this country but from north africa and 1996 paper by air quality scientists at the university of california at davis exploring this dimension of the problem was submitted for the record19 many of the agricultural changes of the past decade are likely to reduce the volume of airborne particulate matter th role of the conser vation reserve program crp enacted in 1985 was cited seve ral times by witne sses representing agricultural interests the crp has re tired up to 364 million acres about one tenth of the nations cropland under 10 year cont racts it was given credit for reducing particulate matter by planting cover crops usually perennial grasses on land that had been cultivated to produce annual crops air quality benefits may be cited as part of the justification for reauthorizing and ex tending the program before it expires in 2002 but this land is only retired for 10 years and should the program end or the land be returned to production it is likel to become larger source of pm another basic change in agriculture has been the widespread adoption of conservation tillage techni ques now practiced on bout 100 million acres annually these techniques leave plan t residue from the preceding years crop on the ground to reduce erosion and retain soil moisture the soil is disturbed less and the farmer may pass over it less frequently in farm machinery thus generating less particulate matter there was less talk by w itnesses at these hearings about how farming might change as result of the requirement to control pm examples that were identified but not discussed extensively included sw eeping machines for harvesting spraying the soil before working it and using be st management practi ces erosion control practices that also provide envir onmental benefits for discing aspects of agricultures concerns will be addressed if an amendment to the surface transportation bill s 1173 adopted in the senate by voice vote is enacted the amendment samdt 1687 sponsored by senator inhofe sets aspects of epas implementation plan in law providi ng until december 31 2005 to designate pm25 nonattainment areas and requiri ng report to congress w ithin 2 years of enactment regarding the ability of the agencys samp ling and analysis methods to differentiate types of pm25 particles the latter provisi on according to senator inhofe was added to accommodate the agricultural community the administration has agreed to this amendment in the immediate aftermath of passage there has been little public reaction to the amendment by agri cultural groups or in the farm press httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97670crs14 concluding observations testimony from agricultural interests s focused on questions about data and analysis including the assessment and characterization of problems and the impacts of taking action based on these questions these interests have sought delay before epa acts so that any action will be based on better information and result in responses by individual farm operators that more precisely resolve problems addressed in the regulatory regime in seeking delay many comments were offered about the degree to which current farm prac tices could be threatened as result of these new regulations the accuracy of thes predictions can not be verified for the most part but they have ge nerated attention and headlines especially in the farm press at the heart of this issue are question and clash of perspectives the question is how much does agriculture contribute to the problems that these regulations will address and how much can it contribute to the solutions this question has several co mponents including the divers ity of natural conditions and agricultural practices the quality and age of the available information the replication of actual and current agricultural practices in the data and analysis and whether all agriculture should be treated the same in all airsheds one witness commented that agriculture is not like the large stationary sources that epa traditionally regulates and the structure of the environmental regulatory regime is far more difficult to apply to many smaller sources than to few large ones the difference of perspectives reflects the different milieus in which the two agencies operate some examples help to characterize this clash first epa science centers on human health effects while usda science centers on effects on agriculture at times scientists with such different foci reportedly encounter difficulty when trying to communicate with each other implementing the memorandum of understanding between the two agencies may help ameliorate these kinds of problems second epas statutory mandates are gmented by media air quality is addressed by separate entity in epa from water and land issues in agriculture the media are considered together in efforts to help farmers conser ve and enhance their resources this segmentation has been an effective approach for many problems but it may limit both an understanding of the problems agriculture might face and the range of possible solutions third the epa regulatory environment is based on setting national standards that are applied by state agencies in ll airsheds epa does not have program delivery system at the local level usda by contrast works almost exclusively at the local level through direct contact with individual landowners this approach is based on voluntary par ticipation and local flexibility and solutions one source of the strenuous objections from agriculture ma be concern over the epa regulatory approach as much as the different views on the seriousness of the problem especially agricultures role in part this cern may reflect misunderstanding of epas regulatory approach which does allow states and local air quality control regions substantial flexibility in designing control strategies or the time frame within which regulations will be implemented which is likely to be prolonged nevertheless thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97670crs15 different backgrounds or world views th at epa and agriculture bring to the discussion are major source of potential misunderstandings fourth epa views soil as potential sour ce of pollutants and is concerned with particle sizes and the ways that soil is transported by air in the case of pm agriculture views soil as basic and va lued component for commodity production both epa and agriculture see major benefits in keeping soil in place on the farm agriculture measures erosion using tolera nce rate that is based on the gross volume of soil that can be lost while maintain ing the longterm production capability epa is concerned with particle size that is transported by the processes of erosion agriculture believes that appropriate so il conservation measures properly designed and implemented should go long way to solving its definition of the problem that is loss of an asset while the epa is basically concerned with solving the particulate matter problem while both strive to keep as much soil in place as possible the different objectives and possible so lutions make common ground on the most appropriate erosion control meas ures more difficult to find june 5 1997 letter from carol browner to dan glickman stated that epa did not plan to focus on agricultural sources as it implemented the proposed standards the letter states that agriculture would benefit from the change in the ozone standard by reducing crop damage regarding the pm proposal epa states that it plans to issue guidance to states that would direct their control strategies away from farming and tilling activities the letter also states that burning is recognized agricultural practice and that strategies that can accommodate burning will be sought the hearings before congressional committees reflect call to congress by agricultural interests and others who might be adversely affected to hear their concerns and explore these issues and to consider acting on their behalf they also represented an attempt to influe nce epas decisionmaking process continued congressional oversight of these issues is certain epa will need continuing flow of resources to review monitoring data submitted by the states categorize areas as nonattainment review new state implementation plans and promulgate regulations affecting specifi c sources of pollution the conferees on epas fy 1997 appropriation ex pressed their concerns bout the new pm standard even before its proposal the appropriations committees will continue to monitor these regulations more broadly some have suggested freestanding legislation such as hr 1984 s 1084 to impose mora torium on implementation of the new standards while enactment of such legislation appears less likely as time goes on the senates adoption of samdt 1687 to the surface transportation b ill in early march indicates continued search for legislative language that can reassure affected interests and narrow agency discretion
