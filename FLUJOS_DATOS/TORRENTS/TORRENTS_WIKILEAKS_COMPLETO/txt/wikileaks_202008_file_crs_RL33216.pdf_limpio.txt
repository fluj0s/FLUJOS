issues in the 109th congress introduction the first section of title 38 of the united states code defines veteran as person who has been discharged under c onditions other than dishonorable from active military naval or air service federal policy toward veterans recognizes the importance of their service to the nation and the effect that service may have on their subsequent civilian lives this policy dates back to the first pensions granted by the continental congress to soldiers disabled by their service in the revolutionary war and to the dependents of those who were killed some benefits require service during period of war members of reserve units or the national guard can gain eligibility for some veterans benefits by virtue of being called to active duty by the federal government although military retirees are veterans their retir ement benefits are paid by the department of defense dod benefits ad ministered by the department of veterans affairs va di rectly or in conjunction w ith other federal agencies include the following among other things programs that provide compensation for disabilities sustained or worsened as result of active duty military service pensions for war veterans with low incomes who are either 1permanently and totally disabled or 2 over the age of 65 cash payments for certain categorie s of dependents ndor survivors free medical care for conditions sustained during military service and medical care for other conditi ons much of which is provided free to lowincome veterans education training re habilitation and job placement

vetpop2004 version 10 office of the actuary office of policy us department of veterans affairs december 2004 are based on model that uses detailed data on veterans from the decennial census through april 2000 actual dod separations including reserve and national guard forces with federal activation through september 2003 and projected dod separations including an estimate for an increased level of reserve separations through september 2009 at this time the model output does not distinguish among cohorts of veterans by time of entry into and departure from the military nor whether they were reserve or national guard members activated for duty in iraq or afghanistan nor does the model incorporate any particular assumptions about the longterm effects of th war in iraq and afghanistan on the size or composition of the veteran population save for the assumption that the gulf war would end on sept 30 2006 which is done to allocate veterans to period of service it should also be noted that many reserve and national guard members activated for duty in iraq or afghanistan were veterans at the time of activation that is they were discharged from active duty military service before joining the reserve or national guardthe veteran and benefit populations the va is the major source for informa tion on the total veteran population and beneficiaries of veterans benefits estimates of
