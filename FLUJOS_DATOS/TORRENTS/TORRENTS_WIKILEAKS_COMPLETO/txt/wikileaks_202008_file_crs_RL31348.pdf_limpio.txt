not brokerage firms and provide similar stock research and analysis some analysts work specifically for institutional investors like mutual and pension funds and are known as buyside analysts originally only limited number of people had access to sellside recommendations and analysis however by the 1990s the large growth in the number of small stock investors and the emergence of the internet and financially oriented television boosted interest in sellside analysts recommendations many sellside analysts recommendati ons to buy sell or hold particular stocks have become part of the

entire partnership edifice can co crashing down with the fall of the underlying stock that props up the system and the growing use of the stock market as place for companies to raise capital means high stock price can be the difference between failure and success hence companies have an incentive to use aggressive but unde r the rules acceptable accounting to boost their reported earnings and

scattered and unconnected analysis was emerging that portrayed key aspects of enrons financial structure in either very cautionary or outright negative terms based on publicly available documents like enrons 10k filings and repor ts from industry trade journals the analyses uncovered number of areas of concern including that enron 1 had great deal of legal insider selling by its officers and directors possible indicator that they were pessimistic about its future 2 had percentage return on capital that was low for contract trading house suggesting that enron would probably need ever increasing amounts of capital to sustain returns insuffi cient to produce any real profit growth 3 had diverted considerable debt off its books 4 had partnerships whose general managers were enron

investor aler t were addressing widelyheld concerns that over time that the readiness of many analysts employed by brokerage firms have seen their ability to provide objective analysis has been

show several pr evious quarters of profits between 1995 and 2001 much shorter pe riod of time ipo proceeds totaled 304 billion firms conducting ipos became domin ated by internetrelated firms many of whom had never reported single quarter of profits in the wake of the dotcom meltdown that commenced in mid2001 both the number of ipos and ipo proceeds have fallen precipitously in 1999 wall street raised 63 b illion in ipos but by 2001 and 2002 this had fallen to 34 and 23 billion respectively historically the securities firms that underwrite ipos underprice the ipo shares relative to their market prices once tradin g in them begins on the secondary markets this means that underwriters corporate in siders and the institu tional investors with the greatest access to companys ipo may benefit from the often substantial rise in share price that frequently occurs in hot ipos first day of trading known as the pop between 1980 and 1989 the average retu rn on an ipo at the close of the first day of trading was 74 between 1990 and 1994 this had grown to 112 between 1995 and 1998 with the significant em ergence of internetrelated ipos the average return climbed to 181 from 1999 to 2000 the average ipo returned an unprecedented 65 at the close of the first day of trading as suggested above the r ecent period of internet dominated ipos was very lucrative one for both the holders of ipo shares and the securities firms that underwrote them the lucrative nature of the business for major securities firms was reflected in the very competitive ipo underw riting business tw manifestations of that competitiveness were the firms use of ipo allocation strategies known as spinning and laddering spinning takes place when securities firms provides select executives with shares of potentially hot ipos to encourage their companys use of the firms investment banking services or as reward for having done so laddering is practice in which institutional investors agree to buy shares of postipo stock thus supporting the aftermarket in the stock in exchange for the securities firm giving them access to potentially hot future ipos increases in client firms aftermarket trading boosts its securities firms re venues from trading commissions involved in underwriting under current federal secu rities law proof of quid pro quo arrangement is necessary to establish that an ipo

such fund would make the company vulnerable to deluge of lawsuits the office also initially pressed for merrill to sever the links between its anal ysts and its investment bank analysts would be

investment bankers from having control over analyst compensation chairman baker has said that the secapproved sro rules are stronger and more comprehensive than the terms of the merrill settlement58 middle of the road view is that the settlement failed to go all the way in recasting the analysts into completely independent and objective researchers but that it represented reasonable compromise59 generally speaking criticism of the settlement has taken two basic forms 1 it will not significantly address conflict of intere st issues and 2 it represents flawed approach to remedying wall street research due to the fact that it creates dangerous precedent under which states may begin to supercede the traditional and many regard as more appropriate federal role in this area criticism of the settlement due to perceptions that analyst conflicts of interest problems will still remain number of observers including some former analysts and lawyers for investors have said that analyst conflict of interest pressures will still prevail at merrill the settlement notwithstanding merrills analysts will still be allowed to accompany and assist the firms investment bankers as they sell underwriting services to cor porations and market the stocks and bonds that they underwrite to ins titutional investors some so note that the settlements wording says that merrills analysts may be compensated for working on stock sales or mergers to the extent that such participation is intended to benefit investor clients there are some observers who are concerned that there are number of investment banking activities that could be interpreted as benefitting investor clients critics of the settlement have also say th at merrills analysts will still be able to derive at least part of their comp ensation from pools of the firms investment banking revenues preserving some of the conflict of interest dynamics there are supplemental concerns that pressure will re main on its analysts to provide favorable stock ratings to merrills significant investment banking clients due to concerns that they could lose their jobs if they do otherwise number of observers have asked why mr spitzers did not persist in his earlier insistence that merrill spin off its re search arm his response is that it was never his intent to destroy the firm there are also reports that merrill was able

tentatively praisi ng its putative benefits wh ile others have questioned whether it represents sign ificant development for example one observer called the settlement insubstantial noting that it essentially mirrored the earlier secappr oved nyse and nasd analyst reforms and that its 14 billion in required payments was walking around money for the banks given their hundreds of billions of dollars in cumulative net worth questions have also been raised about the required i ndependent research and whether investment bankers may be inclined to select research firms that tend to issue buy and strong buy not sell recommendations 82 less harsh but still somewhat skeptical view is that the the devil is in the details and that there may be need for settlement language that bans the independent research firms from attempting to capture other types of contracts with the large securities firms by distorting their analysis to curry favor with them83 but another observer commented that the 14 billion in payments was not an insignificant amount and they probably approached reasonable limits on what the banks can pay this was comment some what echoed by the secs director of
