updated march 18 1998 james k jackson specialist in international trade and finance economics division congressional research service the library of congress abstract the united states is negotiating with ministers from the other developed economies on multilateral agreement on investment mai us negotiators are dissatisfied with the current draft of the agreement and oppose setting new deadlines for completing the long and divisive negotiations should the ministers resolve the myriad outstanding issues the measure will be forwarded to the senate for consideration as treaty this report will be updated as developments require multilateral agreement on investment implications for the united states summary ministers of the 29 members of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd have struggled since 1995 to negotiate multilateral agreement on investment mai negotiations on many aspects of final agreement have progressed rapidly but oecd members have been unable to resolve numerous thorny issues before the latest deadline set for the oecd ministerial meeting in april 1998 us negotiators have indicated that they will not sign the present agreement without significant changes and oppose establishing another deadline as whole the oecd favors eliminating most of the national rules governing inward and outward direct investment one notable exception would be exemptions for each country for industries or sectors that individual members deem to be of national security or of especial national importance the united states also favors the national or unbiased treatment of foreign direct investment at times however the us commitment to this standard has waned as other policy objectives have taken precedent presently the united states is leading the way for the other developed countries to adopt more open standard with an agreed upon and enforceable dispute settlement procedure the oecd ministers stated goal in adopting mai is to create strong and comprehensive legal framework on foreign direct investment among the participating countries this agreement is intended to be standalone agreement and to be accessible to any country developed or developing that is willing to abide by its precepts through the mai the oecd members also seek to reduce barriers and discriminatory treatment of foreign direct investment and to increase the legal security for investments and investors to give force to this agreement the mai will be legally binding and contain effective provisions for settling disputes despite overall progress on the agreement number of issues remain in particular negotiators have not agreed on how many and what type of exceptions nations will be allowed to take the united states also is taking issue with the european commission over its request for broad exception for regional economic integration organizations us negotiators believe this type of exception will allow the commission to exclude itself from parts of the agreement and to discriminate in favor of european union member states us negotiators also have to consider how the clinton administration will approach the issue of an mai with the congress the administration is concerned about the timing and approach of bringing the issue before congress so that the agreement does not interfere with such other trade issues as the debate over fasttrack negotiating authority at the least congress likely will be asked to approve the agreement as treaty it is not clear if any additional legislative action will be required contents overview 1 background

mexico new zealand the netherlands norway poland portugal spain sweden switzerland turkey continued crs2 agreement on investment mai negotiators are building on previous experience with overseas direct investment within the oecd in formulating new set of rules these rules in turn are intended to become the basis for freestanding international treaty open to all oecd members and all nonoecd countries negotiations on many aspects of final agreement have progressed rapidly the oecd members however could not finalize an agreement before the initial deadline set for the oecd ministerial meeting in may 1997 and agreed to extend the deadline for year us negotiators who pressed for an extension in the negotiations of one year past the original deadline to resolve number of outstanding issues now oppose establishing additional deadlines2 us officials have agreed to continue negotiations on the mai but are not willing to sign statement of political intent prior to the april 1998 meeting of oecd ministers they are leery of the large number of exceptions european members are requesting for industrial sectors within their economies move the us negotiators believe would render the agreement meaningless assuming an accord can be reached the clinton administration has indicated that it will forward the agreement to the senate as treaty background as whole the oecd favors eliminating most of the national rules governing inward and outward direct investment each country is allowed exemptions or reservations for industries or economic sectors deemed to be of national importance or for matters of national security the robust growth many developed economies experienced in overseas investment in the early 1990s however is spurring the oecd countries to remove broad range of national restrictions on direct investment and to develop an international agreement on investment rules as figure 1 shows foreign direct investment by the oecd countries more than quadrupled over the 19831994 period rising from 447 billion in 1983 to 21 trillion in 19943 this growth in foreign investment reflects the view of many firms that overseas investment is an essential component of their overall business strategy and is complement to their export efforts as one oecd official states although investments abroad by the largest firms are by means new phenomenon growing number of firms now view overseas expansion through direct investment as necessity with the aim often being to achieve more effective access in markets where the investor is presently under represented in many cases these investments have the effect of 1 continued united kingdom and united states 2 us pressing to delay conclusion of oecd investment pact to may 1998 inside us trade april 4 1997 3

japan is in the developed economies of the oecd direct investment in oecd countries accounts for over twothirds of japans 464 billion in investments threefourths of the united states 621 billion in investments and over 80 of the nearly 1 trillion in the ecs investments for detailed data see table a1 us and ec direct investment abroad is focused heavily on investments within the ec itself us investment in the ec amounted to 261 billion in 1994 about 42 of the total us direct investment abroad us investments in nonec developed countries account for 12 of us direct investment abroad more than twice the comparable shares for japan or the ec japanese and ec investments are heavily focused on north america especially on the united states japanese investors have placed 44 of their investments in north america while ec countries have placed over onefourth of their investments in north america investments in nonoecd countries follow vague pattern of specialization among the three major investors the united states the ec and japan as figure 3 4 witherell william h developing international rules for foreign investment oecds multilateral agreement on investment business economics january 1997 p 33 5 these data were prepared by the oecd prior to the shift by the european community to the european union and the subsequent increase in the number of member countries crs4 shows us investments are more heavily concentrated in latin america accounting for 60 of us investments in nonoecd countries the ec has higher concentration of investments in africa and central europe than either the united states or japan although sizeable portion of the ecs nonoecd investments are in latin america 46 and southeast asia 34 japanese investors have focused over 50 of their investments in southeast asia while the share of japanese investments in latin america rank third among the three investors japanese investors however have invested less than 1 of their nonoecd investments in central europe us overseas investment policy following the end of world war ii us firms invested abroad in record amounts the period prior to 1960 has been named by some observers as the american phase because american firms so dominated overseas investing during this period us investments during this phase were focused on largescale investments in petroleum and raw materials in latin america the middle east and canada by 1960 as the european economic community began to take shape us firms shifted their investment focus to europe to overcome the high and uniform tariff wall that was taking shape around western europe by the end of the decade many european firms had also expanded to become global firms and had joined the ranks of american multinational corporations mncs by the 1980s japanese and european firms and to lesser extent firms of other asian countries also became major international investors crs5 figure 2 us ec and japanese direct investment position abroad 1994

generally favored the national or unbiased treatment of foreign direct investment at times however us commitment to this policy has been overwhelmed by other issues or has been diluted by other sometimes conflicting policy objectives initially us government actions concerning foreign investment revolved around efforts to negotiate friendship commerce and navigation treaties with other governments one author argues that the united states did not have distinct comprehensive foreign investment policy but group of disparate policies us parent investment policy was so fragmented that it is more accurate to describe it as number of distinct policies which sometimes touched or became entangled but never quite meshed into single systematic and coherent policy these distinct policies include the following 1 balance of payments policy which entailed the discouragement of an outward flow of us capital 2 policy to the developing world which relied on private foreign investment as supplementary tool for development assistance but also provided guarantees protection and diplomatic assistance to the us investor should problems arise with the host government 3 third country policy crs7 which discouraged trade with communist countries by prohibiting exports from the subsidiaries of american mncs 4 tax policy on us mncs which sometimes served to encourage sometimes to discourage foreign investment and sometimes was neutral and 5 the extraterritorial application of domestic law like antitrust and securities disclosure and 6 the use of foreign investors as overt and covert instruments of american diplomacy6 in 1961 the governments of the oecd adopted code of liberalization of capital movements though not legally binding the code set rules for the flow of transnational investment and established mechanism for consultation when restrictions on capital movements were felt necessary by government during the same year president kennedy announced measures to stem the outflow of capital from the united states to check the growing us balance of payments deficit furthermore in 1963 president kennedy urged congress to pass the interest equalization tax iet on the purchase of foreign stock by us citizens as the us balance of payments condition worsened president johnson announced in 1965 voluntary foreign credit restraint program vfcr to curb bank lending and to urge businessmen to reduce their foreign investment7 in 1968 president johnson issued an executive order setting mandatory ceilings on foreign investment8 these measures proved to be ineffective and eventually were removed one factor that contributed to the demise of the controls on foreign investment was set of contradictory us policies one of these policies encouraged us firms to invest in developing countries for foreign policy reasons to assist us firms in this endeavor the us government established the overseas private investment corporation opic in 1969 the 105th congress considered proposal to eliminate opic9 existing arrangements governing foreign investment existing arrangements governing foreign investment include wide variety of instruments that differ in their legal character scope and subject matter10 the united nations reports that since the early 1980s growing number of countries have changed their policies on foreign direct investment by encouraging and

reauthorization and funding crs report 97132 by james k jackson 10 annual report 1996 world trade organization 1996 p 61 crs8 such investment11 this type of activity picked up speed in the 1990s as many nations altered their domestic laws that govern foreign investment and as nations increased their use of bilateral investment treaties nearly twothirds of the 1200 bilateral investment treaties that were concluded prior to july 1996 were concluded during the 1990s12 bilateral investment treaties bilateral investment treaties have emerged as the favored investment instrument because previous attempts at developing multilateral agreements have been so unsuccessful there are two main approaches used in admitting foreign investment under bilateral treaties the united states requires that nations apply most favored nation mfn or nondiscriminatory treatment and that countries also observe national treatment with respect to both the admission and the subsequent treatment of foreign direct investment exceptions are made for industries or areas reserved for national security or for other national objectives in contrast most other nations apply bilateral treaties that require nations to encourage and to admit into their territories investments by nationals and companies of the other party this commitment however is subject to any existing or future restrictions on the entry of foreign investment contained in domestic laws which historically have been applied to investments only after they have been admitted into country according to the world trade organization wto general standards of treatment of foreign investment commonly found in bilateral investment treaties include number of measures such measures generally require that investments be accorded fair and equitable treatment full protection and security and that nations refrain from interfering in ways that disrupt the normal management maintenance use or disposal of investments in addition most treaties accord the parties involved most favored nation and national treatment standards13 multilateral investment treaties at the multilateral or multination level there are at lest two major types of arrangements there are investment treaties that are part of broader arrangements that aim to integrate rules on foreign investment into framework of rules geared toward economic cooperation and integration such arrangements include the treaty establishing the european community and the north american free trade agreement in addition there are arrangements which cover only foreign investment of particular prominence among this second group is the oecd code of liberalization of capital movements and the code of liberalization of current invisible operations in addition the oecd has issued basic statement on foreign investment the declaration on international investment and multinational enterprises 11 world investment report 1994 transnational corporations employment and the workplace new york united nations 1994 p 277 12 annual report 1996 p 62 13 ibid pp 6263 crs9 the declaration on international investment and multinational enterprises the members of the oecd adopted this declaration on june 21 1976 and then updated it in 1979 1984 and 1991 the declaration is not legally binding treaty but it is general statement of policy regarding foreign investment member countries are expected to accord multinational enterprises national treatment and to assure that this treatment is followed at the subnational level the declaration makes note of the use of incentives or disincentives by governments and requires member countries to make such measures as transparent as possible so that their importance and purpose can be ascertained the oecd code of liberalization of capital movements this and the companion code on invisible operations are legally binding on oecd members although there is enforcement mechanism instead the code provides framework of notification examination and consultation this and the companion code on current invisible operations are meant to promote the removal of restrictions on capital movements including foreign investment and the repatriation of profits the oecd code of liberalization of current invisible operations the purpose of this code is to encourage nations to remove or to reduce restrictions on current payments and transfers of funds invisible is the general term the oecd applies to all financial exchanges in which merchandise is involved within this group there are current and capital operations consisting primarily of transaction between two parties and related transfer of money the codes obligations also extend to ensure that the underlying transactions themselves are not frustrated by legal or administrative regulations traderelated investment measures trims the uruguay round of trade negotiations did not include negotiations explicitly on foreign direct investment as result the trims agreement was more modest than the united states had hoped for the agreement did not add to any of the obligations then existing under the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt now the wto but clarified the obligations existing at the time the agreement provides procedure for more effective compliance with the national treatment obligations14 the world trade organization wto investment is one of number of thorny issues facing the wto as result of handful of countries members of the wto have been unable to agree on who would chair working group on investment or on what issues the group should consider15 14 world investment report 1994 p 280 15 wto haggling over plans on investment competition procurement inside us trade march 14 1997 p 17 crs10 the scope of the mai despite the rapid growth in foreign direct investment foreign investors still encounter barriers discriminatory treatment and legal and regulatory uncertainties16 spurred by these and other problems facing firms that attempt to invest abroad the oecd governments decided to begin negotiations among themselves on mai and to conclude the agreement by the time of the oecd ministerial meeting in may 1997 the goal of the negotiations is to create strong and comprehensive legal framework for foreign direct investment among the participating countries according to senior oecd official17 this means the mai will seek to reduce barriers and discriminatory treatment of foreign direct investment and to increase the legal security for investments and investors to give force to the agreement the mai will be legally binding and contain effective provisions for settling disputes the basic outlines of the mai include the following areas definitions and scope the aim of the mai negotiations is to develop comprehensive definition of direct investment for all countries that will cover all tangible and intangible assets but not include financial transactions that have connection to an investment investment protection the member countries of the oecd basically agree on such issues as general standard of treatment of foreign investment and investors compensation in the event of expropriation protection from strife and the free transfer of funds the treatment of investors and investments provisions are being drafted to cover both the entry of investments and the treatment of foreign enterprises after they are established in host countries these provisions are based on the concept of national or nondiscriminatory treatment also the provisions will assure most favored nation mfn treatment and transparency in national conduct toward foreign investment and investors exclusions for purposes of national security likely will be included several approaches concerning the environment are being discussed including provision which calls on governments not to lower environmental standards in an effort to attract foreign investment additional disciplines these provisions include wide range of investment areas such as key personnel provisions that would address the wish of international firms to be able to transfer freely or to hire personnel to perform vital functions in particular mai negotiators are considering rules that would assure firms the right of temporary entry stay and work for key personnel additional areas include the participation of foreigners in privatization programs performance requirements export requirements local sales content and production requirements 16 witherell william h developing international rules for foreign investment oecds multilateral agreement on investment business economics january 1997 p 39 17 ibid p 40 crs11 employment and investment requirements monopolies and state enterprises investment incentives18 and corporate practices dispute settlement the agreement will encourage consultation arrangements to encourage amicable solutions to investment disputes binding arbitration of disputes between states or between an investor and participating government will also be available to ensure that there is an effective recourse in the event of breach of an agreement19 the treatment of taxation oecd members apparently have been concerned that obligations placed on nations concerning national treatment nondiscrimination and most favored nation treatment under the mai could conflict with obligations nations have accepted in bilateral agreements on the avoidance of double taxation20 as result the members agreed not to adopt code of national treatment on taxation but instead to develop political commitment not to discriminate in taxation matters such commitment would not be subject to the mais dispute settlement mechanism21 unresolved issues number of issues still need to be resolved before any final agreement can be reached one of the thorniest issues is how many and what type of exceptions nations will be allowed to take every nation wants some industries or areas exempted from unfettered national control either because of national security concerns or because of specific domestic political issues too many exemptions however would render the mai useless and ineffective the united states also is taking issue with the european commission over its request for broad exception for regional economic integration organizations us negotiators believe this type of exception would allow the commission to derogate from the mai national treatment obligations and discriminate in favor of european union member states22 18 the number of countries offering foreign firms investment incentives has grown sharply over the last decade nevertheless few are willing to consider restrictions on such incentives beyond the limitations imposed by rules on nondiscrimination while the negotiators appear to favor the principle that rules on national treatment should apply to incentives it appears unlikely the negotiating group will reach consensus before the may 1997 deadline negotiators increasingly are supporting postponing any further consideration of incentives until after may 1997 ahnlid anders the multilateral agreement on investment special topics available at the

negotiators near accord on tax issues in oecd multinational investment agreement international trade reporter september 24 1997 p 1606 22 larson hints at possible delay inside us trade p 12 crs12 bribery the united states wants concrete commitments to criminalize overseas bribery in essence us negotiators are pressing other nations to adopt legislation similar to the us foreign corrupt practices act23 many oecd members have argued against criminalizing bribery until there is an international agreement on bribery us negotiators are concerned that developing such pact likely would take years to hammer out and still would not be effective until the members adopted national implementing legislation the united states also is pressing to have member countries eliminate the tax deductibility of bribes dispute settlement dispute settlement is another outstanding issue that still needs to be resolved oecd members have begun drawing up their own lists of those investment sectors and areas they want to be exempted from the mai while the united states considers these lists as first round offers in negotiable process some european members believe the lists represent their notification to the oecd of places where their domestic laws differ from the proposed mai and are not necessarily negotiable several of these members are waiting for more precise mai disciplines to be drafted before they will negotiate further on their own list of exceptions members also are split over how rulings on state to state disputes will be enforced while all members apparently want to have an enforcement mechanism in case mai signatory country does not comply with ruling they disagree over whether the mechanism should fall within or outside the scope of the overall agreement some members argue that countries that fail to comply with mai ruling should be denied access to future dispute settlement procedures while other members want the ability to retaliate outside the scope of the obligations covered by the agreement by employing such additional measures as trade sanctions24 one area where the negotiators have made progress is in investorstate disputes to satisfy japanese negotiators the members agreed to twostage process to review complaints so that frivolous complaints could be eliminated before full panel review of complaint members also agreed that the mai can enforce investorstate disputes by issuing declarations against signatory that does not comply with ruling and to award monetary compensation plus interest or inkind restitution members have the ability to nullify rulings that are deemed to be aberrant 23 pl 95213 december 19 1977 the act prohibits us persons or companies from bribing foreign government officials to win business the act also

split on enforcement inside us trade march 14 1997 p 13 crs13 us issues another issue under the rubric of enforcement that interests the united states is the way in which mai rulings will be applied to such subfederal entities as states and municipalities us negotiators have indicated that the united states will bind states to comply with mai rulings as long as the mai offers an acceptable level of liberalization or market access25 in its list of reservations for instance the united states has included state measures that would violate the mai implying its willingness to override those state measures to bring the states in accordance with the mai26 us negotiators however do not have unlimited authority to negotiate the mai moreover some groups and some members of congress have concerns over the impact an international investment agreement could have on the us economy and on us environmental and labor standards as reflection of these concerns part of the legislation to reauthorize fast track procedures27 for implementing trade agreements the senate finance committees proposed export expansion and reciprocal trade agreements act of 1997 specifies set of overall negotiating objectives for broad range of agreements including foreign investment the proposed legislation states that the principal us negotiating objective regarding foreign investment is to reduce or eliminate artificial or tradedistorting barriers to us investment to expand the principle of national treatment and to reduce unreasonable barriers to establishment furthermore the proposed legislation states that it is the objective of the united states to develop internationally agreed rules through the negotiation of investment agreements nevertheless the legislation also states that the negotiating objectives on foreign investment shall not be construed to authorize any modification of united states law during discussions in march 1997 us negotiators pressed for an extension in the negotiations of one year past the original deadline to resolve more of the outstanding issues because number of issues remain to be settled these issues include measures that can be taken against mai signatory country that does not comply with mai panel verdict how to distinguish between the european commission or member state should the subject of europerelated complaints arise and how to treat investment screening procedures which member governments have 25 ibid p 14 26 ibid p 14 27 fast track procedures are part of an understanding between the executive and legislative branches whereby the administration agrees to consult closely with congress during trade negotiations and congress agrees to definite yesorno vote without amendments for additional information see crs report 97876 fasttrack authority debate over the presidents proposal by george holliday and crs report 97885 fasttrack legislative procedures for trade agreements the great debate of 1991 by lenore sek crs14 in place and their relationship to an investors right to take government to dispute settlement prior to the establishment of an investment28 the us negotiators reportedly want to ensure that investors cannot challenge decisions by regulatory authorities clear majority of oecd members also favor excluding matters of taxation from the agreement except for provisions which bar expropriatory taxes and rules on transparency another outstanding issue is the number and types of exceptions members will be allowed to take from the mai disciplines29 us negotiators are pushing to allow only those exceptions which are based on specific government laws and regulations while european countries lean towards exceptions for entire sectors of their economies30 although the negotiations framing the terms of the mai have not yet been extensively scrutinized by the american public or by most of the members of congress the issue is attracting fair measure of supporters and critics for their part supporters argue that reducing foreign barriers to us direct investment aids us consumers and us workers by lowering the price of internationally traded goods and by raising the us standard of living most of these benefits arise from the greater efficiencies firms gain through more efficient allocation of capital throughout the world critics acknowledge the gains in efficiency which result from greater foreign investment but argue that these gains are achieved at high cost in particular they argue that foreign investment has contributed to the growth in disparities in wealth and income between the richest and poorest groups within the united states and between the richest and poorest nations furthermore these critics contend that foreign investment increases the mobility of transnational corporations which allows them to play countries and localities against each other bidding down wages and other labor standards in addition they argue that this global competition weakens environmental standards workplace safety rules and similar safeguards by adopting an mai these critics state governments would be restricted in their ability to shape domestic investment policies to promote social economic and environmental goals and would create whole set of rights for multinational firms that would require governments to defend even when those rights conflicted with the rights needs or interests of individual nations and their citizens31 implications for the united states there are benefits as well as costs for the united states in an international investment agreement on the positive side mutually agreed upon set of rules 28 us pressing to delay conclusion of oecd investment pact to may 1998 inside us trade april 4 1997 29 larson hints at possible delay in finalizing oecd investment pact inside us trade march 14 1997 p 12 30 us pressing to delay conclusion 31 for additional information see the following sites on the world wide web httpwwwcitizenorg and httpwwwrtknetpreamble crs15 would reduce some of the confusion and uncertainty us firms face as they invest overseas also as the worlds largest overseas investor the united states and us firms likely stands to gain the most such an agreement likely would help us firms that are investing in both developed and developing countries and would aid them in gaining access to export markets abroad while these actions are not likely to boost us employment they might help sustain or enhance us wages and incomes fewer restrictions on international direct investment could also add to us incomes by allowing for more efficient allocation of resources among nations on the negative side an international investment agreement ultimately could stalemate further progress towards reducing national restrictions and controls in essence mai may act to set status quo that becomes entrenched in practice and less subject to change than the present situation an agreement among the developed countries also could add to tensions between the developed and the developing economies such an agreement could alienate many of the developing countries who see an investment agreement as protective measure established by the richest economies the oecd members to preserve their economic status relative to the developing economies by limiting the amount of investment that flows to those economies us negotiators also have to consider how the clinton administration will approach the mai issue with the congress the administration has indicated that it will send the agreement to the senate for approval as treaty but growing dissatisfaction among us negotiators over the numbers and extent of exceptions the europeans and canadians are requesting coupled with public unease at home augurs poorly for consideration of the agreement during the present legislative session the administration would also be leery of broaching the issue with congress until other higher priority trade issues have been resolved congress may also consider the impact mai will have on state and local governments the other nations participating in the mai negotiations expect that the provisions of the agreement will apply not only at the us federal level but at the subfederal or state and local level as well at the very least this likely will require the cooperation of the nonfederal levels of government32 it also is unclear how many exceptions us negotiators will request for such state and local government programs as minority setaside programs and local economic development programs 32 similar issue was confronted when the united states and the european union reached bilateral agreement on public procurement which required the compliance of the state and local governments see cooney
