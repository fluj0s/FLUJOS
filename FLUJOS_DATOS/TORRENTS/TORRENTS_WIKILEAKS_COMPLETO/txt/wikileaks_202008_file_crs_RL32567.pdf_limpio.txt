gathering of military intelligence has always been top priority for belligerents and captured enemy soldiers could be exp ected to have at least some knowledge pertinent to military operations2 as consequence prisoners of war pows can expect to be questioned by their captors who can be expected to employ whatever means are available to them for extracting such information possibly due in part to the inherent interest of belligerents both in procuring intelligence information and in protecting their own information and sold iers ground rules developed for fair play in exploiting the

technique simultaneously and the courts and tribunals that have evaluated claims of prisone r abuse have generally ruled on the totality of treatment without speci fying whether certain conduct alone would also be impermissible not surprisingly governments may vi ew conduct differently depending on whether their soldiers are th prisoners or the interrogators and may be unwilling to characterize

victim could hear voices and marching feet then the noise of squad halting and lowering their rifles as if being formed to act as firing squad japanese officer then came up to the victim and said we are knights of the bushido of the order of the rising sun we do not execute at sundown we execute at sunrise the victim was then taken back to his cell nd informed that unless he talked before sunrise he would be executed36 more recent example of ntal torture as found by us court involved the treatment of american pows by iraqi agents during the 1991 gulf war iraqi agents caused the pows to experience severe mental anguish by falsely reporting that they had killed americans including pilots wingman other american pows and the president of the united states the pows suffered from knowing the agony that their families were enduring because the iraqi authorities refused to inform the fa milies that the pows were alive37 according to the icty the following tr eatment may amount to mental torture for instance the mental suffering caused to an individual who is forced to watch severe mistreatment inflicted on relative would rise to the level of gravity required under the crime of torture being forced to watch serious sexual attacks inflicted on female acquaintance was torture for the forced observer the presence of onlookers particularly family members also inflicts severe mental harm amounting to torture on the person being raped38 physical mental suffering not all physical or mental suffering amounts to torture while most people would likely accept that severe

humanesounding techniques applied at great length or in combination could cause physical and mental suffering that might be characterized as torture39 distinguishing between physical and mental forms of pressure may not be particularly helpful in determining whether torture has occurred40 physical abuse may cause mental suffering that outlasts the physical suffering nonviolent physical methods playing loud music especially over an extended period of time may cause physical as well as psychological suffering some victims may be more susceptible to certain types of pressure and therefore experience suffering that might not affect another permanent injury is not required41 according to the icty the severity of the pain or suffering is distinguishing characteristic of torture that sets it apart from similar offences precise threshold for determining what degree of suffering is sufficient to meet the definition of torture has not been delineated in assessing the seriousness of any mistreatment the trial chamber must first consider the objective severity of the harm inflicted subjective criteria such as the physical or mental effect of the treatment upon the particular victim and in some cases factors such as the victims age sex or state of health will also be relevant in assessing the gravity of the harm42 for interrogation purposes some experts take the position that the

protect against treatment that is cruel inhumane and degrading even if such treatme nt does not amount to torture coercion the geneva conventions do not define coercion their prohibition against coercion may vary somewhat pending on the status of the person undergoing interrogation in the case of pr otected civilians physical or moral coercion shall be exercised against them in particular to obtain information from them or from third parties45 prisoners of war on th other hand may be subjected to coercion of any kind nor can they be threatened insulted or exposed to unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment the conclusion might be drawn that some other kind of coercion neither moral nor physical may be permissible with respect to civilians but not for pows perhaps moral coercion is distinct from mental coercion however we have found refe rences purporting to describe techniques in this category common article 3 does not explicitly forbid coercion the essence of coercion is the compulsion of person by superior force often government to do or refrain from doing something involuntarily the intentional application of an unlawful force that robs person of free will is coercive however circumstances that cause pe rson to reevaluate course of action even if deception is instrumental may arguably be noncoerci ve pressure under the interpretation set forth in fm 3452 physical or mental torture and coercion revolve around the elimination of the sources free will46 these activities along with brainwashing are not authorized it explains but are not to be confused with the psychological techniques and ruses presented in the manual fm 3452 includes in the definition of mental coercion drugs that may induce lasting and permanent mental alteration and damage this

prisoner against any inquisitorial practice by his captors whic h would rob him of his free will on this basis it was held that the use of truth serum was outlawed by article 17 in addition its use contravenes article 18 whic h states in part prisoner of war may be subject to medical or scientific experiments of any kind which are not justified by the medical dental or hospital treatment of the prisoner concerned and carried out in his interest the opinion declared that the suggested use of chemical truth seru m during the questioning of prisoners of war would be in violation of the oblig ations of the united states under the geneva convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war from this opinion it seems clear that any attempt to extract information from an unwilling prisoner of war by the use of chemicals drugs physiologic or psychological devices which impair or deprive the prisoner of his free will without being in his interest such as bonafide medical treatment will be deemed violation of articles 13 and 17 of the convention the 1987 version of fm 3452 suggested that the use of any drugs for interrogation purposes amounted to mental co ercion fm

designed to influence his conduct is able to exercise choice nd complies willingly or has choice other than to comply asserting coercion by the enemy as defense to treason or aiding the enemy has not been fruitful courts have tended to apply the same test that would govern in other criminal cases58 in the postwwii treason prosecution of iva ikuko toguri daquino tokyo rose the court stated its belief that despite the hostilities there was occasion for departing from the ordinary rules applicable to the defense of duress and coercion we know of rule that would permit one who is under the protection of an enemy to claim immunity from prosecution for treason merely by setting up claim of ntal fear of possible future action on the part of the enemy we think that th citizen owing allegiance to the united states must manifest determination to resist commands and orders until such time as he is faced with the alternative of immediate injury or death were any other rule to be applied traitors in th enemy country would by that fact alone be shielded from any requirement of resistance the person claiming the defense of coercion and duress must be person whose resistance has brought him to the last ditch59 however the failure of an asserted coercion defense does not mean that the behavior giving rise to the claim is lawful acts intended to coerce need not succeed to meet

noncoercive is used to denote methods of interrogation that are not based upon the coercion of an unw illing subject through the employment of superior force originating outside himself however the noncoercive interrogation is not conducted without pressure on the contrary the goal is to generate maximum pressure or at least as much as is needed to induce compliance the difference is that th pressure is generated inside the interrogatee his resistance is sapped his urge to yield is fortified until in the end he defeats himself63 the manual describes the followi ng techniques for

approved techniques below do not breach the law106 most of the techniques do not appear to violate any provisions of the geneva conventions on their f ace but military experts do not always agree among themselves as to their propriety and boundaries the approach phase begins when the in terrogator first comes in contact with the source107 and continues until the prisoner begins answering questions pertinent to the objective of the interrogation108 the effort generally consists of the establishment of control over the source and the interrogation establishment of rapport between the interrogator and the sour ce and the manipulation of the sources emotions and weaknesses to gain his willing cooperation109 an interrogator may employ more than one technique simultane ously to elicit the desired information direct this approach involves the straig htforward questioning of the detainee without the interrogator adopting any of the tactics described below the interrogator simply asks the prisoner for the inform ation without concealing the interrogators purpose or using deception of any kind and is most effective when the prisoner is cooperative as long as there is explo itation

emotional love hate using the emotional approach an interrogator seeks to exploit the sources emotions in order to override his rationale for resisting according to fm 3452 love or fear for one person may be exploited or turned into hate for someone else126 for the emotional love approach the interrogator focuses on the sources anxiety brought on by his pr edicament the interrogator then makes use of the love the source feels toward his family homeland comrades etc to devise an effective incentive such as communication or promised reunification with the sources family quicker end to the war to save his comrades lives and so forth fm 3452 states that good interrogator will usually orchestrate some futility with an emotional love approach to hasten the sources reaching the breaking point this places burden on the source and may motivate him to seek relief through cooperation with the interrogator the emotional hate approach focuses on any genuine feelings of hatred or possibly desire for revenge the source may feel toward his countrys regime his immediate superiors officers in general his fellow soldiers or the like the interrogator might hint at an opportunity for revenge if the source cooperates and divulges certain information the manipulation of emotions as desc ribed does not seem to violate any prohibitions of the geneva conventions on its face the success of the technique relies on the arts of percep tion and persuasion which mo st commentators agree are not out of bounds however if the emo tional love method for example were to involve threats against the lives of family members for example its use could contravene the conventions prohibitions of threats httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32567crs29 127 id 128 id at 316 129 id fear up harsh mild according to fm 3452 the aim of the increased fear up harsh technique is to convince the s ource who appears to be hiding something that he does indeed have something to fear not necessarily from the interrogator and that he has option but to cooperate the interrogato r will behave in heavy overpowering manner using loud and th reatening voice and perhaps throwing objects around the room to heighten the sources implanted feelings of fear127 of the questioning methods approved by the manual this approach is said to have greatest potential to violate the law of war128 presumably because it could lead to threats or violence against the subject the mild version of the fear up approach seeks to exploit circumstances that point to the interrogatees involvement in some activity that could bring harsh punishment the interrogator does not rais his voice or behave in an overbearing manner instead he uses credible distor tion of the truth as subtle means to blackmail the subject into cooperating the interrogator persuades the subject that he has good cause for fear under the circumst ances but the interrogator might intimate that he might be willing to conceal or alte r the reported circumstances of the sources capture as long as the source cooperates reduced fear the decreased fear down approach is to be used primarily on source who is already in state of fear the technique involves calming the source and convincing him that he will be properly and hum anely treated or that he is safer in captivity than in combat for example129 using soothing tone of voice the interrogator attempts to create rapport w ith the source by engaging in small talk until the source is ready to answer more pressing questions it is difficult to conceive of an implementation of this approach that would cause violation of the conventions pride ego up down the pride and ego approach concentrates on tricking the source into revealing pertinent information through the use of flattery or abuse the pride and ego up variation is us ed on sources who feel inferior especially low ranking enlisted personnel or junior grade officers who might respond to the opportunity to demonstrate their intellect or importance the interrogator speaks as if he is very impressed with the accomplis hments of the subject engendering positive feelings on the sources part that he is finally getting the recognition he deserves the source may reveal pertinent information in order to solicit more laudatory comments from the interrogator the pride and ego down approach in contrast exploits sources sense of inferiority by attacking the sources sense of personal worth criticizing his loyalty intelligence abilities technical competence leadership qualities slovenly appearance or any other perceived weakne ss the interrogator uses sarcastic caustic tone of voice to express distaste or disgust if the tactic works the source will become defensive and try to prove the inte rrogator wrong in his attempt to

already in the sources mind to make him believe that it is useless to resist the interrogation efforts fm 3452 describe s multiple techniques for accomplishing the desired effect131 by making the situation appear hopeless the interrogator allows the source to rationalize his cooperation this approach as described appears to be permissible as guile but extreme treatment designed to induce feeling of overall futility could cause mental suffering severe nough to raise questions under the geneva conventions we know all the we know all approach involves making source believe that the interrogator already know s everything about the source132 the interrogator compiles all available data on the source and his unit the interrogator then asks questions to which he already has the answer when the source refuses to answer or provides an incomplete or fa lse response the interrogato r himself supplies the correct answer the interrogator tries to convince th source that all information is already known so he may as well coope rate when the source begins to give accurate and complete information the interrogator be gins interjecting questions for which he does not have the answers this appear s to be an unobjectionable tactic involving more wile than coercion and seems to be widely accepted as legitimate establish your identity in the establish your identity approach the interrogator insists that the source has been identified as an infamous criminal who is merely posing as someone else to avoid punishment133 the source may be tricked into giving detailed information on his it to establish or substantiate his true identity in order to refute the interrogators allegations the technique appears to involve trickery that might be acceptabl under the geneva conventions but could conceivably be applied in th reatening or coercive manner repetition the interrogator may repeat the same question many times in order to get hostile source to cooperate134 the source becomes bored with the procedure and may give more complete and candid answers simply in order to gain relief from the monotony135 taken to extremes for example during prolonged interrogations

confronts the source with th dossier exploiting the known facts about the source to convince him that resistance would be futile rapid fire fm 3452 describes the rapid fire approach as psychological ploy based upon the principles that everyone likes to be heard when he speaks and it is confusing to be interrupted in midsentence with an unrelated question136 one or two interrogators ask series of ques tions without allowing the source time to answer them completely before the next question is asked the source may become confused and contradict himself which th interrogator can exploit by confronting the source with the inconsistencies the source may reveal more than he intends in attempting to clarify his answers silence the silence approach involves an interrogator who says nothing to the source but looks him squarely in the ey preferably with slight smile on his face in an effort to make the subject nervous and force him to break eye contact first137 the source may begin to talk or ask stions to break the tension when the interrogator eventually begins to ask questions the subject may feel relieved and more willing to divulge information require cgs approval the methods

chief effect of arrest and detention and particularly of solitary confinement is to deprive the subject of many or most of the sights sounds tastes smells and tactile sensations to which he has grown accustomed155 artificially limiting the extent to which person is able to sense his environment has been found to induce stress and when taken to the extreme can cause hallucinations and delusions the apparent reason for these effects is th at person cut off from external stimuli turns his awareness inward upon himself nd then projects the contents of his own unconscious outwards so that he ndows his faceless environment with his own attributes fears and forgotten memo ries one expert notes it is obvious that inner factors in the mind tend to be projected outward that some of the minds activity which is usually realitybound now becomes free to turn to phantasy and ultimately to hallucination and delusion156 the cia theorized that the more completely the place of confin ement

considered inhumane and degrading removal of all comfort items including religious items t h i s technique is harsher version of the r emoval of incentives approach described above whether it violates the geneva c onventions depends on the nature of the items considered to fall under the comfort rubric the remova l of religious items could entail violation of gc art 27 pr oviding that protected persons are entitled to respect for their religious convictions and practices or gpw art 14 respect for the person of the prisoner of war forced grooming the dod working group described forced grooming as shaving of hair or beard accomplished without risking injury to the detainee it may be viewed as violation of the respect for the person under gpw art 14 or as violation of prisoners religious rights under gc art 27 by itsel f it would not seem to constitute an outrage on human dignity162 but could be seen as inhumane or degrading use of scenarios designed to convince the detainee that death or severely painful consequences are imminent this technique was listed as category iii technique that could only be used to interrogate the most uncooperative detainees at guantanamo with

determined they do not apply see id at encl1 166 see kubark manual supra note 62 at 92 while listing threats and fear among the coercive interrogation techniques the cia did not recommend threats of death the threat of death has often been found to be worse than useless it has the highest position in law as defense but in many interrogation situations it is highly ineffective threat many prisoners in fact have refused to yield in the face of such threats who have subsequently be broken by other procedures the principal reason is that the ultimate thre at is likely to induce sheer hopelessness if the interrogatee does not believe that it is trick he feels that he is as likely to be condemned after compliance as before the threat of death is also ineffective when used against hardheade d types who realize that silencing them forever would defeat the interrogators purpos if the threat is recognized as bluff it will not only fail but also pave th way to failure for later coercive ruses used by the interrogator internal citations omitteda feeling of suffocation164 there seems to be little doubt that such methods would violate the geneva conventions165 as constituting coercion threats and possibly mental torture166 as such these techniques are also likely to be considered inhumane by geneva c onvention standards
