mifepristone summary on september 28 2000 the food and drug administration fda approved the drug mifepristone also known as ru486 for the termination of early pregnancy in 1988 france became the first country to approve the drug china and the united kingdom approved ru486 in 1991 sweden in 1992 and the following countries in 1999 russia austria belgium denmark finland germany greece israel the netherlands spain and switzerland since 1988 more than 620000 european women have used the drug to terminate pregnancy ten million abortions are performed annually in china and about half are carried out with ru486 because ru486 is an abortion agent the process of moving it out of the lab and into mainstream medicine has been fraught with controversy since its discovery the prolife movement has been adamantly against the use of this drug for abortion in the united states the drugs long journey to fda approval began in 1983 when the agency agreed to clinical trials of ru486 sponsored by the population council after many difficulties in finding manufacturer and distributor for the drug final fda approval was granted and the first us orders for ru486 were shipped on november 20 2000 the drug will not be available to women by prescription in pharmacies instead women will receive it directly in physicians office each woman must be given medication guide which explains how to take the drug who should avoid taking it and what complications may occur patient agreement similar to an informed consent document in clinical trial must be signed in contrast with surgical abortion which is completed in minutes drug induced abortion is more time consuming and uncomfortable treatment with ru486 requires that the patient make three office visits over 2week period shortterm risks associated with the drug are limited about 1 of women require surgery to stop heavy bleeding and only 01 of women in clinical trials required blood transfusion to date there is little evidence of any long term health effects due to use of ru486 nevertheless legislation introduced in the 107th congress adds requirements for doctors dispensing ru486 which the sponsors state would provide additional protection for women taking the drug the bill stipulates that physicians prescribing the drug must meet the following requirements 1 qualified to handle complications resulting from an incomplete abortion or tubal pregnancy 2 trained to perform surgical abortions and met all applicable legal requirements to perform such abortions 3 certified for ultrasound dating of pregnancy and detecting tubal pregnancy 4 completed program regarding the prescribing of such drug that uses curriculum approved by the secretary of the department of health and human services hhs and 5 have admitting privileges at hospital located 1 hour or less away from the physicians medical office in the opinion of prochoice groups this legislation represents an unprecedented intrusion into the jurisdiction of fda and the practice of medicine they point out that fda reviewed all the scientific data reflecting the experiences of thousands of women and the agency rejected most of these requirements as medically

early pregnancy with ru486 mifepristone background the drug mifepristone commonly known as ru486 is medical or drug induced alternative to surgical abortion for use in early pregnancy it was discovered in 1980 by researchers at roussel uclaf pharmaceutical company jointly owned by the french government and the german company hoechst ag ru486 belongs to class of drugs known as antiprogestins these drugs can prevent or interrupt pregnancy by blocking the action of progesterone naturally occurring hormone progesterone allows for the implantation of the embryo and aids in maintaining pregnancy by inhibiting uterine contractions in early studies the efficacy of ru486 as an abortifacient ranged from 60 to 80 when used during the first 7 weeks of pregnancy1 such rate is too low to be clinically acceptable however interest in the drug was greatly increased by 1985 report which found that efficacy is raised to nearly 100 if administration of ru486 is followed few days later by second type of drug called prostaglandin which stimulates uterine contractions on september 23 1988 france became the first country to license ru486 in combination with prostaglandin for early abortion approval in china and the united kingdom occurred in 1991 in sweden in 1992 and in the following countries from 1999 austria belgium denmark finland georgia germany greece israel luxembourg the netherlands norway russia spain switzerland taiwan tunisia and ukraine2 according to fda since 1988 more than 620000 european women have used the drug combination to terminate pregnancy about 5 million abortions annually are carried out in china with ru4863 on september 28 2000 fda announced the approval of ru486 and the prostaglandin misoprostal for use in the united states as an abortifacient in pregnancies of 49 days or less the process of moving ru486 out of the lab and onto the market has been fraught with controversy in france roussel uclaf suspended distribution of ru486

the french minister of health claude evin ordered ru486 back on the market stating that from the moment governmental approval for the drug was granted ru486 became the moral property of women not just the property of the drug company4 at that time the french government owned 36 of roussels stock and therefore was able to exert some influence over company decisions also 1968 french law gave the health minister the authority to withdraw companys license to market drug and award the license to another firm if the company refused to make drug available in the united states the drugs long journey to fda approval began in 1983 when the agency agreed to clinical trials of ru486 conducted at the university of southern california usc under the auspices of the population council5 more than 300 women received the drug from 1984 until february 1990 when usc researchers exhausted their supply of the drug6 usc was unable to obtain more because in 1989 roussel had made policy decision not to provide ru486 for abortion research in the united states this decision resulted in the drug being used here only in very limited research settings that did not involve abortion through arrangements with roussel the roussel decision was influenced by and came shortly after the june 1989 fda announcement during the former bush administration which placed ru486 on the import alert list import alert 6647 automatic detention of abortifacient drugs prohibited the importation of ru486 into the united states for personal use7 the alert was imposed by fda because of concerns over the drugs possible health risks and use without physician supervision in general fda has the power to prevent the importation of unapproved drugs and has exercised its authority in discretionary manner in 1988 fda relaxed its rules on importing unapproved drugs for the personal use of those suffering from fatal illnesses like aids and cancer in july 1992 leona benten 29year old pregnant woman tried to challenge the import ban by bringing into the united states enough ru486 for her own use the drug was confiscated on july 1 1992 by us customs at new yorks jfk airport benten filed suit against the fda and the

sept 28 2000 the day ru486 received final approval from fda and the following paragraph was added to the end of import alert 6641 fda has determined that unapproved versions of mifepristone manufactured outside the us are being promoted in this country for use to end pregnancy due to the risks to the safety of the user in inadequately controlled settings mifepristone should be considered inappropriate for release under the personal import guidance districts encountering entries of mifepristone should determine whether the importer of record for the article being entered is danco

joy stevens full text of import alert 6641 can be found at wwwfdagovorafiarsora_import_ia6641htmlsifton concluded the decision to ban the drug was based not from any bona fide concern for the safety of users of the drug but on political considerations having place in fda decisions on health and safety8 the decision was stayed hours later by the us court of appeals for the second circuit the us supreme court agreed to consider an appeal filed by benten and her attorney but ultimately the confiscation was upheld by 72 decision on july 17 1992 the woman subsequently had surgical abortion on january 22 1993 2 days after taking office president clinton directed department of health and human services hhs secretary donna shalala to 1 rescind the personal use import ban barring sufficient evidence to warrant it and 2 assess initiatives for the promotion of testing licensing and manufacturing ru4869 in response to the presidents directive secretary shalala published in the federal register actions to be taken regarding the status of ru48610 the secretary directed fda to initiate an immediate and thorough review of the health and safety implications of the potential import of ru486 for personal use the findings of the review were to be reported to the secretary if there was not enough evidence to limit ru486 from qualifying as drug that could be imported for personal use the import alert would be rescinded11 the secretary also directed fda to assess promptly initiatives to promote the testing licensing and manufacturing of ru486 or other antiprogestins in the united states and report on options to the assistant secretary for health and the secretary of hhs the change in the administrations policy on ru486 generated an increased commercial interest in the drug

it would have preferred enlisting large pharmaceutical company for us production only smaller companies and nonprofit agencies came forward for consideration because of their relative immunity to

drugs production to the council which would conduct us clinical trial and find us manufacturer13 roussel agreed to supply ru486 for the clinical trials however the population council put its efforts on hold in the fall of 1993 because the two parties were unable to come to final agreement and sign contract14 in september 1993 the institute of medicine iom released its report clinical applications of mifepristone ru486 and other antiprogestins funded by the henry j kaiser family foundation because the drug had been tested extensively in europe the iom panel recommended immediate submission of previous clinical trial data directly to fda in lieu of us trials to determine whether they met us regulatory requirements15 the report also recommended aggressive pursuit of research on ru 486 in the treatment of variety of pregnancyrelated conditions and other hormone linked diseases such as endometriosis uterine fibroid tumors breast cancer and certain types of brain tumors16 however citizen petition filed by prolife group and signed by several members of congress called on the fda to strictly review any foreign data submitted for us approval of ru48617 following discussions between hhs the population council and roussel on may 16 1994 the clinton administration announced that the company would donate us patent rights for ru486 to the population council18 the company agreed to give up potential american profits from sales of the drug reportedly because of its stated reluctance to market ru486 in the highly charged us political climate surrounding the issue of abortion19 at

organizations such as the open society and the kaiser family foundation in order to conduct the trial and prepare the documentation necessary to receive fda approval22 new drug application nda was submitted to fda on march 18 1996 by the population council seeking approval for ru486 in combination with the prostaglandin misoprostol the nda was based on safety and efficacy data derived primarily from two french trials involving 2480 women and preliminary data from the us trial the nda was classified as priority by fda because ru486 was the first drug submitted to the agency for medical abortion23 fdas reproductive health drugs advisory committee evaluated ru486 and concluded on july 19 1996 in 6 to 0 vote with 2 abstentions that it is safe and effective as an abortifacient when used

another unrelated delay between the end of 1996 and early 1997 the population council was distracted by court case involving lawyerinvestor named joseph d pike on november 4 1996 the population council and aht filed complaint in new york superior court against mr pike lawyer selected by the population council in 1995 to raise funds needed to market manufacture and distribute ru486 media reported that the complaint charged pike with fraud for withholding information on his 1993 disbarment and may 1996 conviction both of which stemmed from 1985 real estate deal in north carolina the population council and aht sought to remove pike from control of the license to market ru486 and appoint courtordered receiver with authority to sell all stock owned by pike to acceptable third parties by 1996 pike was said to have raised more than 27 million for the ru486 project including 6 million of his own continuedsome predicted that ru486 would become generally available in the united states by mid199726 however the population council had number of difficulties in finding an appropriate manufacturer and distributor for the drug in part because of the reluctance of established pharmaceutical firms to enter into such controversial and potentially violent arena27 28 because of continued fear on the part of investors and manufacturers of being targeted by prolife groups the population council apparently found it necessary to set up elaborate consortiums and front groups to protect participants to the point of using cumbrous and ultimately unworkable arrangements29 hungarian company gedeon richter agreed to produce the drug for the population council in 1995 but backed out of the agreement in february 1997 the dispute ended in breach of contract lawsuit30 although fear of boycotts and violence may have deterred some manufacturers from becoming involved in manufacturing ru486 others speculate including some prolife groups that the companies also feared

warren buffet the buffet foundation and cofounder of hewlettpackard david packard the david and lucille packard foundation34 meanwhile the prospects for ru486 remaining an abortion option for women in europe also began to look uncertain on april 8 1997 the german company hoechst announced that it would cease production of ru48635 the decision was influenced by prolife group boycott of the companys new and potentially far more lucrative allergy drug allegra roussel now fully owned by hoechst was directed to transfer the patent rights and the remaining stockpile of ru486 to new company headed by roussels former chief executive dr edouard sakiz dr sakiz was also on the team of scientists that had originally developed the drug the new company exelgyn would continue to provide ru486 in europe however without manufacturing facility the stockpile was predicted to run out by the end of 1998 strict guidelines developed by roussel had effectively limited the drug to france the uk and sweden and legal requirements confined abortion services to residents of those three countries attempts to expand the drugs distribution to other countries had been hampered by roussels highly unusual demand that government must issue formal requestand secure means of distribution and quality followup care must be provided36 exelgyn planned to introduce ru486 in several more european countries and make it

were met 1 national registry of all physicians prescribing ru486 would be established by danco 2 all physicians on the registry would have admitting privileges at hospital within 1 hour of their offices 3 only physicians trained in providing surgical abortions would be allowed to prescribe ru486 4 physicians would have to be trained in using ru486 5 physicians would have to be trained in reading ultrasound scans and 6 follow up study of all women who have had medical abortions would be conducted by the population council39 spokesperson for the population council indicated that the fda proposal was more restricted than we had expected40 41 prolife groups believed that the agencys proposal was prudent and should be strengthened even further42 prochoice advocates were alarmed at the fda proposal particularly with the national registry which might cause physicians prescribing ru486 to become target for violence by groups opposed to abortion in washington post article gloria feldt president of the planned parenthood federation of america stated that the fda proposal would so violate physicians privacy and security concerns that ru 486 could be approved by the agency but never

according to blumenthal what they have recommended in terms of the kind of certification and licensing of providers before they can provide the drug is beyond what they do with any other drug it

trained in performing surgical abortion has been steadily declining46 many attribute the decline to terrorism from groups opposed to abortion prochoice advocates on the other hand agreed with fda that providers need specific training in how to administer the drug counsel patients on its use and provide surgical backup in case there are complications or the drug fails to work which happens in 5 of cases47 second approvable letter had been issued by fda to danco on february 18 2000 that addressed labeling manufacturing chemistry and distribution issues danco had responded to the second letter at the end of march 200048 because ru486 is class 2 submission requiring substantial review work according to guidelines in the prescription drug user fee act response must be made by fda within 6 months this requirement resulted in an agency action deadline of september 30 200049 fda approval of ru486 two days before its deadline see above on september 28 2000 fda announced the approval of ru486 in

miscalculates the length of womans pregnancy or fails to eliminate the possibility of tubal pregnancy53 according to cdc data 2 of pregnancies in the united states are ectopic54 however the reported rate of ectopic pregnancy among women who seek early abortion is much lower for unknown reasons55 the postmarketing studies mentioned in the june 2000 fda letter will be conducted by the population council these will include 1 comparison of patient outcomes among physicians who refer their patients needing surgical intervention to those who perform the procedure themselves 2 an audit of prescribers that will examine whether doctors and patients are signing the patient agreement form and filing it in the patients medical record as required and 3 system for surveillance reporting and tracking rare ongoing pregnancies after treatment with ru486 in the united states56 if significant degree of adverse events or problems are found in the postmarketing studies individual doctors could

pregnancy in most countries in sweden and the uk ru486 is given up to the 63rd day in combination with gemeprost prostaglandin in vaginal suppository form ru486 is less effective later in pregnancy because the placenta begins to produce progesterone in larger amounts by the 10th week of pregnancy and therefore antiprogestins like ru486 are unable to compete with the natural hormone in france

rockefeller foundation and the bangkokbased concept foundation in this effort to upgrade its factory69 in press release dated october 12 2000 nrlc legislative director douglas johnson expressed concern over the importation of ru486 from hua lian it is public health issue because china is major source of impure drugs and the fda cannot possibly monitor chinese factory effectively it is human rights issue because hua lian pharmaceutical is major component of the chinese governments population control program which relies heavily on compulsory abortion70 the nrlcs randall obannon believes the chinese manufacturer of ru486 is problematic for two reasons first the chinese developed their version of the abortion pill in the 1980s after copying the pill produced by the french whether this has the same chemical formula whether it has the same level of safety and effectiveness as the french pill whether it has the same risks and provokes the same side effects or worse is not clear second another huge challenge would be the ability of danco and fda to monitor the production process in distant totalitarian country with notorious human rights record particularly when it comes to statemandated abortions and sterilizations71 the house commerce committee raised questions about hua lian in letter to fda concerning the company previously being cited by federal regulato rs for

however other observers have concluded that the availability of medical abortion in france england and sweden has not increased the number of abortions overall in those countries87 according to prochoice advocates the impact of ru486 in the united states is expected to be the same as in europe and decline in abortions in the united states is expected to continue according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc the annual number of abortions in the united states has been falling for variety of reasons including the demographics of the us female population aging baby boomers the passage of abortion laws affecting adolescents requiring parental consent and increased use by adolescents of condoms and longacting hormonal contraceptives88 from 1990 the year in which the number of abortions was highest through 1995 the annual number of abortions in the united states decreased by 15 from 1995 to 1996 the number of abortions increased slightly by 09 and in 1997 the

weeks 55 were performed at 8 weeks or earlier92 with the increased use of athome pregnancy tests women are requesting abortion services as early as the fourth week some clinicians have been reluctant to perform surgical abortion before the eighth week because the size of the embryo is so small it could be missed during the abortion procedure which uses suction tube device to remove the embryo from the uterus it is standard procedure for the doctor to inspect the tissue removed during an abortion in order to confirm that the pregnancy has been terminated identification of the gestational sac which contains the embryo can be more difficult at the very early stages of pregnancy however combination of increased use by doctors of 1 medical abortion via ru486 and 2 newer surgical techniques used with ultrasound to confirm early pregnancy termination may shift the timing of when many abortions are performed to between the fourth and the seventh week of pregnancy prochoice groups hope that ru486 will improve access to abortion services by reversing the steady decline in the number of physicians and clinics offering such services according to research conducted by the alan guttmacher institute agi the number of abortion providers in the united states began to declined in the 1980s in its most recent survey agi found that between 1992 and 1996 the number of providers fell 1493 in 1996 86 of us counties lacked abortion services and 32 of women of reproductive age lived in counties with provider94 the institute found that many nonmetropolitan areas particularly lack such services 95 of such counties had abortion services and 87 of nonmetropolitan women lived in unserved counties95 members of the prochoice movement attribute the continued decline in abortion providers to ongoing harassment and violence from groups opposed to abortion prochoice leaders believe that if more physicians quietly began offering ru486 in their private offices this may reduce the potential for violence associated with abortion provision by greatly increasing the number of sites where such services are available and by making these sites more dispersed and less publicly identified with

the large majority of whom 98 do not perform abortions99 however of those interested in providing ru486 major deterrents would be the need for 1 additional malpractice insurance and 2 completion of

needed to check on the status of early pregnancy103 other potential constraints are the numerous state laws regulating doctors who perform abortions proponents of these state laws believe they provide useful protection for women undergoing abortion while opponents feel that many of the laws are thinly veiled attempt to restrict and discourage access to abortion these state laws cover such topics as reporting requirements informed consent and waiting periods drug dispensing authority parental notification or consent and examination and disposal of fetal tissue104 one legal analysis found that although some of these laws make little sense in the context of medical abortion most abortion restrictions are broadly written and could be interpreted by state officials as applying to medical abortion105 these same authors point out that because some state abortion laws impose an undue burden on access when applied to medical abortion they may be vulnerable to legal challenge some state legislatures are considering bills that would limit access to ru486106 european countries where ru486 is approved have shown pattern of gradual increase in use of the drug for early abortion in france

pregnant and wanted to terminate the pregnancy requested medical termination108 in sweden following approval of ru486 in 1992 educational courses for physicians on medical abortion were arranged around the country by the drug company and the swedish society of obstetrics and gynecology use of the medical method grew fairly slowly from 7 in 1993 to 32 in 1998 and more than 40 in 1999 several reasons may explain the slow increase the most important seems to be physician reluctance to use treatment associated with more pain and bleeding than vacuum

researchers here began searching for other substances to provide medical abortion paper published in 1991 on the use of methotrexate in treating ectopic pregnancies caused researchers to turn to this drug as possible alternative to ru486118 in 1993 investigators at university of california published preliminary study combining methotrexate with misoprostal for early abortion119 the method received attention in the press and in the medical community in 1994 when dr richard hausknecht120 gynecologist and longtime abortion rights activist with private practice in new york city announced that he

has also been investigated by itself as an abortion drug so far in clinical trials it too has been found to have unacceptably high rates of side effects misoprostol is relatively inexpensive and unlike other prostaglandins is stable at room temperature in countries where abortion is illegal such as brazil misoprostol often referred to as the star pill because of its shape has been used by poor women to initiate the abortion process126 the woman would then report to health clinic as if she were undergoing spontaneous abortion which required surgical attention misoprostol has number of other uses at various stages of pregnancy such as induction of labor and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage127 in fact misoprostol has been used so frequently and effectively that it has become the treatment of choice in the induction of labor and has been recognized as such by the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists128 misoprostol is one of the most important medications in obstetrical practice yet its use in pregnant women remains unapproved by the fda129 current product labeling includes warning that misoprostol is contraindicated during pregnancy because of its

tissues throughout the body it was only inadvertently discovered to have the antiprogesterone effects which make it useful as an abortion agent potential applications that take advantage of the drugs antiglucocorticoid effects include the treatment of glaucoma and cushings syndrome condition in which dangerously high levels of cortisol are produced by the body mifepristone has also been investigated as postcoital contraceptive or morning after pill in this case the drug would be used within few hours or days of intercourse in order to prevent pregnancy certainly before woman even knows if she is pregnant currently there are several highly effective postcoital contraceptives available on the market including highdose estrogen and estrogen progesterone combinations however these treatments are effective only before implantation occurs and therefore are most effective within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse in contrast mifepristone is effective regardless of implantation and can be administered up to 12 to 17 days after intercourse in repeated studies single 600 mg dose of mifepristone alone has been shown to be 94 to 100 effective for preventing pregnancy when administered almost anytime before the expected date of menses136 when compared with other postcoital contraceptives mifepristone was as effective and produced fewer side effects because of these findings mifepristone is also being investigated as monthly birth control treatment other potential uses of mifepristone include menstrual regulation and treatment for fibroid tumors condition that can cause pain and heavy bleeding that sometimes leads to hysterectomy it is also being investigated as treatment for endometriosishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30866crs23 137s 251hr 482 would impose restrictions on ru486 mifepristone already rejected as medically unnecessary by the fda national abortion federation fact sheet feb 2001a condition in which tissue resembling the uterine lining grows in other locations it is thought to be leading cause of female infertility small clinical trials of the drug have shown that mifepristone can reduce pain in women with endometriosis but it is unclear whether the amount of tissue outside the uterus actually decreases the drug that helps some women end unwanted pregnancies may eventually help others have children mifepristone has been shown to be effective for labor induction in postdate pregnancies finally mifepristone has been used to treat meningioma type of benign tumor that arises from the tissue covering the brain or spinal cord when the tumor cannot be surgically removed treatment with mifepristone has been tried because the tumors growth is often stimulated by progesterone and the drug blocks the action of this hormone for similar reasons mifepristone is being looked at as potential treatment for breast cancer and prostate cancer congressional actions the 107th congress will likely consider legislation on ru486 prior to the fda approval three times for fy1999 fy2000 fy2001 the house considered attaching an amendment to the agriculture appropriation bill that would prohibit any funds to be used by the fda for the testing development or approval including approval of production manufacturing or distribution of any drug for the chemical inducement of abortion the final version of the bill in all three cases however did not contain the amendment language the fda approved ru486 for termination of early pregnancy on september 28 2000 on february 6 2001 the ru486 patient health and safety act was introduced by representative david vitter in the house hr 482 and senator tim hutchinson in the senate s 251 the legislation would reinstate restrictions fda had listed in its june 2000 letter to the population council and danco the same bill language was introduced in the second session of the 106th congress by representative tom coburn hr 5385 and senator hutchinson s 3157 the bill stipulates that physicians prescribing the drug must meet the following requirements 1 qualified to handle complications resulting from an incomplete abortion or ectopic pregnancy 2 trained to perform surgical abortions and met all applicable legal requirements to perform such abortions 3 certified for ultrasound dating of pregnancy and detecting ectopic pregnancy 4 completed program regarding the prescribing of such drug that uses curriculum approved by the secretary of hhs and 5 have admitting privileges at hospital located 1 hour or less away from the physicians medical office in the opinion of the national abortion federation this legislation represents an unprecedented intrusion into the jurisdiction of fda and the practice of medicine137 they point out that fda reviewed all the scientific data reflecting the experiences of thousands of women and the agency rejected most of these requirements as medically unnecessaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30866crs24 apart from issues related to approval or conditions for use by physicians ru486 also raises issues related to federal funding for health programs that might provide access to the drug for women seeking an abortion the hyde amendment has attached to annual appropriation bills for many years prohibition on the use of federal funds for abortion except in the case of rape incest or if the life of the woman is in danger because ru486 is used in an abortion procedure its use under these federal health programs would also be prohibited and the same exceptions would apply women relying on such programs as medicaid community health centers and clinics funded by maternal and child health block grants will not have access to federal support for their use of ru486httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30866
