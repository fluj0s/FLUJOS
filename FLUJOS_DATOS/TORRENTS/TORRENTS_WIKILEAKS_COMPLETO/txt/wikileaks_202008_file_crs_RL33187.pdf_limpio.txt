onetheless some continuity in judicial approach both substantive nd procedural may arguably be discerned from review of several of his significant opinions affirmative action in hopp v pittsburgh 1 judge alito ruled for the court that there was sufficient evidence to support jury verdict in favor of nine white police officers who claimed that the city of pittsburgh discriminated against them when it based hiring decisions in part on oral examinations purportedly designed to minimize the adverse impact of written tests on minority applicants the city sought to hire experienced officers to replace large number of officers taking early retirement in order to curb potential disparate impact problems the city used combination of written and oral examinations instead of relying solely on the written test that had previously been used to select officers the white offi cers all of whom had prior experience with other police agencies sued for race discrimination under the civil rights act of 18662 after they performed well on the required written tests but were rejected because they failed the oral examination in upholding the verdict for the white officers judge alito pointed to evidence that the previous written examination was not culturally biased and had been good pr edictor of job performance that the city refused to explain why any of the plaintiffs failed the oral examination that the city set the failure rate on the oral examination so as to exclude more white candidates and that the city failed many whites who performed well on the written examination while rejecting very few poorly performing minority candidates previously the third circuit banc had examined the issue of raceconscious employment practices to achie ve teacher diversity in the public schools judge alito did not write the courts opinion in taxman v board of education3 nor did he file separate concurrence or di ssent but was instead appare ntly content to join the majority led by

claim holding that the school boards action was overly intrusive on the rights of nonminorities claim of violation of the equal protection clause was made as the statute of limitations for any alleged constitutional violation had expired the third circuit concluded that th racebased discharge and retention decisions resulted from the boards effort not to remedy past discrimination but to promote racial diversity it agreed that the boards nonremedial objective to maintain diverse faculty violated the raci discrimination ban in title vii of the 1964 civil rights act4 on the basis of supreme court precedent5 the circuit court reasoned to pass title vii muster an affirmative action plan 1 must have purposes that mirror those of the statute and 2 must not unnecessarily trammel the interests of nonminority workers6 finding congressional recognition of diversity as title vii objective re quiring accommodation the court was convinced that unless an ffirmative action plan has remedial purpose it cannot be said to mirror the purposes of the statut and therefore cannot satisfy the first prong of the weber test7 an appeal of the piscataway case was eventually dismissed by the us supreme court in 1997 without ruling by the justices on the merits8 and of course the thir d circuits decision preceded by several years the supreme courts 5 to 4 ruling in the michigan affirmative action case grutter v bollinger 9 where justice oconnor narrowly pproved the constitutionality of r ace based student admissions plan to achie ve diversity in higher education burden of proof issues directly implicated in several race and gender cases heard by the third circuit during judge alitos tenure is the burdenofproof framework developed by the supreme court for analysing title vii claims of disparate treatment or intentional employment discrimination10 under the socalled m cdonnell douglas formula once the employee or applicant establishe s prima facie case of discriminatory motivation by demonstrating that she is the member of protected class that she was qualified and applied but was nonetheless passed over for employment or promotion the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33187crs3 11 mcdonnell douglas 411 us at 802 12 supra n 10 13 509 us at 511 the complainant did not have to introduce further evidence to support finding of discrimination th factfinders disbelief of the reasons put forward by the employer may together with elements of the prima facie case suffice to show intentional discrimination id however th ultimate question is whether after all the evidence is in the complainant has proved her case by preponderance of the evidence 14 see kline v tennessee valley authority 128 f3d 377 34344

remains for the complainant to rebut this explanation as pretextual with ev idence either undermining its credibility or otherwise proving that discrimination more likely motivated the employers action what is more if she is to prevail the plaintiff employee has the ultimate burden of persuasion for proving by preponderan ce of the evidence that discrimination actually occurred certain ambiguities in the law however left lower courts uncertain whether the complainant could rely exclusively on pre text evidence to carry her ultimate burden or had to produce additiona l affirmative evidence of unlawful employer motive according to st marys honor society v hicks 12 when complainant demonstrates pretext the factfinder is allowed to infe r discrimination but it is not required to do so showing of pretext alone did not compel decision for the applicant or employee13 this socalled permissive pretext standard helped to settle circuit court split on the issue at that time14 nonetheless lower c ourts continued to differ as to the quantum and quality of proof nece ssary to preserve an employees disparate treatment claim from summary judgment motion or directed verdict for the employer the third circuit apparently permits survival of the action premised solely on rebuttal evidence attacking the reasonableness of the employers proffered explanation for its conduct justice litos views on the other hand seem more attuned to the stricter judicial standard adopted by other courts calling for further evidence of discrimination beyond proven pret ext to permit the action to go forward in post hicks decision sheridan v ei dupont nemours and co 15 the banc court applied pretext only rationale to the claim of sex discrimination against female head captain in dupont owned hotel who was passed over for promotion to higher management position writing for the majority judge sloviter reversed the district courts grant of j udgment as matter of law to the employer because hicks did not compel the presentation of additional evidence of the employers discriminatory motive which could be proven by discrediting the employers nondiscriminatory reasons judge alito filed the only dissenting opinion in sheridan primarily he disagreed with the majoritys premise that under hicks proof of the elements of prima facie case and proof of pretext will always survive defense motion for summary judgment or judgment as matter of law judge alito argued that the majoritys blanket rule wa s analytically unsound because proof that is sufficient

finding discriminatory motive in place of the blanket rule endor sed by the majority the dissent suggested different test that would avoid analytical difficulties that the majoritys test created16 under his test an employers nons uit motion is improper if rational trier of fact could find based on the reco rd that discriminati on on the ground alleged was the determinative cause of th challenged employment action17 applying this test judge alito agreed with the district judges analysis of the record and would have imposed on the plaintiff weightier burden with respect to proof of employer motivation than the sheridan majority in glass v philadelphia electric co18 the third circuit considered the effect of certain rulings by the district court which had excluded evidence of alleged race and age discrimination and retaliati on in several refusals to promote the complainant resulting in jury verdict for the employer throughout his 23 years of employment with the company glass received only one job evaluation that was less than fully satisfactory for the twoyear period of 198486 while admitting evidence of glass performance during that period the district court excluded his counterexplanation that raci harassment by coworke rs during that time had negative effect on his job performance accounting for those shortcomings in reversing and remanding for new tria l majority of the third circuit found that the district court abused its discre tion by repeatedly excluding evidence of harassment relating to key aspect of th case complainants evidence regarding explanation or justification for his poor performance evaluation one of several nondiscriminatory reasons asserted by the company for its action was relevant to the question of pretext and should have b een admitted to enable him to meet his burden of proving intentiona l discrimination judge alito dissented noting that the evidence of harassment has some but limited probative value the company had not relied heavily on the poor performance ratin g to explain its ac tion he f ound and glass had been able to bring out some evidence of his having been harassed moreover even if an abuse of discretion judge alito concluded that the ruling was harmless error thus he ruled against the employee in the case and would have denied his request for new trial judge alito also filed dissent from the majority opinion in bray v marriott hotel19 another failure to promote case in three years bray an africanamerican had worked her way up from room atte ndant to housingkeeping manager at the marriot hotels when the position of br ays immediate superv isor became vacant in 1993 she applied but lost out to another internal candidate white female who worked at larger marriot facility bray

fuentes v perskie under fuentes the employee had to cast substantia l doubt on the employers proffered legitimate nondiscriminator reason for the failure to prom ote in order to defeat pre trial dismissal20 to meet its burden marriott presented extensive evidence suggesting that the candidate selected had superior objective qualifications to bray the employee countered with evidence that marriot had to brays disadvantage failed to follow its own stated procedures for filling the position and that some of the objective quantifiable measures relied upon were faulty in material respects threejudge panel of the third circuit decided that the complainants rebuttal evidence raised sufficient doubts as to the employers failure to promote her and remanded for jury trial the issue was not merely whether marriott was seeking the best candidate but whether reasonable factfinder could conc lude that the black employee was not deemed best because of her race the majority explained thus the jury had to decide whether alleged disc repancies in the prom otion procedures and evaluation of the black candidates qualifica tions were the product of racial bias dissenting judge alito argued that bray failed to point to evidence from which reasonable factfinder can disbelieve the employers articulated reasons that it was seeking the best qualifie d candidate or that the ca ndidate selected was better qualified than bray furthermore he argued evidence of unfairness in the selection process the employers failure to follo w its internal procedures not linked to discriminatory animus should not survive summary judgment so long as the employers proffered legitimate reason for the employment decision remains intact in another dissenting opinion zubi v att corp21 judge alito opted for broader interpretation of the 1866 civil rights act22 than the threejudge panel majority which found that plaintiffs ci vil action for wrongful termination due to race was barred by twoyear statute of limitations 1990 fe deral law provided that civil action arising under an act of congress enacted after the date of enactment of this section may not be commenced later than four years after the cause of action accrues23 section 1981 originated more than century earlier the panel opinion reasoned so following accepted procedure in the absence of more specific statute of limitations the court borrowed the shorter statute of limitations provided by the state in which the case was heard judge alitos dissent took different textual approach to the 1990 statute of limitations provision which focused on the meaning of act of congress in the statute judge alito noted that in 1991 congress amended 1981 to broaden thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33187crs6 24 civil rights act of 1991 pl 102166 101

of the c ontractual relationship24 as result of the 1991 act plaintiff may now sue under 1981 for di scriminatory termina tion of employment and that is precisely what zubi did he re thus in any realistic sense the 1991 amendment to the civil rights act created the cause of action for racially discriminatory termination of employment that zubi asserted25 because zubi asserted his claim less than four years after the termination occurred judge alito would have allowed the suit to go forward under the approach of the majority the dissent concluded most acts of congress that amend prio r acts of congress do not qualify as acts of congress under 1658 the fouryear st atute of limitations in footnote 5 however the majority says that not all enactments styled as amendments are real amendments and thus some amendments may count as acts of congress under 1658 the majority may regard this as the closest thing to bright line rule i do not26 harassment writing for the court in robinson v city of pittsburgh 27 judge alito explained the third circuits position as regards the required elements for proof of retaliation claims and quid pro quo xual harassment generally quid pro quo harassment refers to situations where an employer conditions its employment decisions affecting specific workers on those i ndividuals submission or re jection of unwanted sexual advances or other verbal or physical conduc t of sexual nature it differs from hostile environment harassment which usually describes serious and pervasive workplace abuse of physical or verbal nature that substantially interferes with an employees ability to perform her duties from legal defense standpoint however the distinction has been largely eroded by subsequent supr eme court decisions28 in 1994 female city police officer comp lained to her depa rtments assistant chief that she had been physically and verba lly abused over twoyear period by her immediate supervisor police lieutenant who made repeated unwanted sexual advances in retaliation robinson asserted the hara ssing supervisor unjustly reprimanded her in front of others and gave her bad reputation at work moreover she claimed that after rejec ting his advances her computer access was restricted her promotion to detectiv was blocked and she was forced by management to continue to work under the harasser the police departments office of professional st andards found probable cause to cred it her complaint but at trialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33187crs7 29 120 f3d at 1299 30 id 31 112 f3d 710 3d cir 1997the district court summarily dismissed part of her complaint against the city its police chief and assistant chief while th jury found for the city on the remainder the appeals court affirmed in part reversed in part and remanded judge alito ruled first that the oral reprimands and derogatory comments were insufficient to support retaliation claim in his opinion not everything that makes an employee unhappy qualifies as re taliation for otherwise minor and even trivial employment actions that an irritable chiponthes houlder employee did not like would form the basis of discrimination suit29 reprimands and comments did not constitute adverse employment action because they did not alter robinsons compensation terms conditions or privileges of em ployment deprive her of employment opportunities or adversely aff ect her status as an employ ee nor could retaliation claim be based on the other actions alleged since other than timing there was evidence of causal link to her filing an eeoc charge second the court rejected robinsons contention that her supervisors harsh reprimands in the presence of other employees amounted to hostile work nvironment and lacking evidence that citys police chief as its agent had actual knowledge of earlier incidents of offensive touching and other physical abus jury verdict absolving the city of respondeat superior liability was also affirmed there was however enough evidence to support jury finding that robinson was denied transfer for refusing th alleged perpetrators unwanted sexual advances in contrast to minor slights like negative comments receiving or being denied desired promotion is sufficiently serious and tangible to constitute change in the employees terms conditions or privileges of employment30 in particular judge alito pointed to evidence that the alleged harasser had made sure that robinson did not appear on the department s transfer lists despite his repeated assurances that he would recommend her thus the court found the evidence of quid pro quo harassment in robinsons promotion bl ocking claim at least sufficient to allow jury to decide the issue and rema nded for that purpose the rest of her complaint was dismissed in another opinion by judge alito the third circuit rejected per rule making it violation of title vii for the employer to return sexual harassment victim to job position requiring her contact with coworkers responsible for the earlier hostile work environment in konstantopoulos v westvaco corp 31 the only woman in traditionally allmale department who complained to her supervisors of repeated sexual comments obscene gestures and physical threats by two male co workers was transferred by supervis ors to another work group in the same department the company also warned the named harassers that any further complaints against them could lead to disciplinary action upon her return from seven months of medical l eave for severe workinduced stress the plaintiff was returned to the workgroup site of the earlie r harassment after further assurances by the supervisor who made freque nt monitoring visits the plaintiff resigned after onehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33187crs8 32 240 f3d 200 203 3d cir 2001 33 id at 209day alleging that her former harassers s quinted their eyes and shook their fists at her and that another co worker threw away her lunch the third circuit affirmed the distri ct courts finding that although the employee had been subjected to sexual harassment during her first period of employment the alleged incidents upon he r return from medical leave were not severe or pervasive enough to have created hostile work environment in reaching this decision judge alito reasoned that the nearly seven month hiatus between the earlier and later episodes was significant in that it provided an opportunity for the lingering effects of the prior incidents to dissipate in addition he explained that upon the employees return to work the empl oyer had provided procedures by which any improper conduct by the coworkers c ould have been remedied finally the court rejected the employees contention that her mere reassignment to the same work group as two of her previous hara ssers was enough to support the conclusion that she was subjected to continuing hostile work environment when she returned to work rather judge alito found that gi ven the totality of the circumstances the employee had failed to establish hostile work environment during the second period of her employment in 2001 judge alito wrote the unanimous decision for three judge court that struck down pennsylvania state colle ge area school distri cts antiharassment policy that policy prohibited any unwel come verbal or physical conduct which offends denigrates or belittles an individual based on race religion color national origin sexual orientation di sability or other personal char acteristics with the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating hostile or offensive environment 1983 suit was brought in saxe v state college area school district32 on behalf of students seeking to have the policy enjoined for vagueness and overbreadth specifically the students argued that the law prohibited them from voicing religiously based objections to homosexuality the district court upheld the policy and gr anted the districts motion to dismiss writing for the appellate panel judge alito focused on judicial development of private right of action for employees and students claiming abusive and discriminatory conduct that creates hos tile environment and rejected the lower courts sweeping statement that the first amendment has never protected harassment such categorical rule he wrote is without precedent in the decisions of the supreme court or this c ourt and it belies the very real tension between antiharassment laws and the constitutions guarantee of freedom of speech33 emphasizing constitutional distinction between protected expressive harassing speech and unprotected nonexpressi ve conduct the polic here was fatally overbroad for two reasons first it reached sexual orientation and other personal characteristics beyond the scope of exis ting law secondly while existing law required evidence that the complainants educational or job performance was affected the district policy merely punished speech that had the effect or mere purpose of harassing anotherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33187crs9 34 170 f3d 359 3d cir 1999 35 id at 365 36 id at 364 37 260 f3d 265 3r cir 2001religion in fraternal order of police v newark 34 the newark new jersey police department had adopted po licy prohibiting its officers from wearing beards while labeled zero tolerance policy by the chief of police exceptions were made for medical reasons and for undercover offi cers whose assignment s or duties permit departure from the requirements howeve r the department refused to grant an exemption to two muslim officers who were compelled by their religious beliefs to grow beards the third circuit held that the departments decisions to allow exemptions for medical but not religious reasons trigge red heightened scrutiny under the first amendment judge alitos opinion for th court tracked supreme court precedent regarding underinclusiveness as key factor in defining the applicability of general and nongeneral laws to re ligious entities the nobear d policy was underinclusive because beards grown for medical reasons less than religion undermined the departments interest in uniformity and public confidence in the police force thus the medical exemption raises concern because it indicates that the department has made value judgment that secular ie medical motivations for wearing beard are important enough to overcom its general interest in uniformity but that religious motivations are not35 this underinclusiveness was sufficiently suggestive of discriminatory intent so as to trigger neightened scrutiny under the constitution 36 that the exception for dical beards was adopted to address leg itimate governmental interest accommodating the medical needs of certain police officers was irrelevant to the courts analysis of the general applicability requirement thus while it was proper for the state to accommodate secular hardships judge alito found that religious hardships were entitled to qual consideration in abramson v william patterson college37 judge alito filed concurring opinion in the case of sabbathobservant orthodox jewish woman who complained of discrimination and harassment while tenuretrack associate professor as the consequence of her desire to have he r religious observance accommodated by her employer plaintiff scheduled her classes to minimize conflicts with jewish holidays but allegedly encountered hostility from the co llege dean and her departmental chair who ignored her requests by repeatedly scheduling meetings and conferences for friday nights and saturdays the dist rict court dismissed the plaintiffs t itle vii claims of religious harassmen t discrimination and retaliation finding that the college presented reasonable and nondiscriminatory explanations for decisions affecting abramsons employment on appeal the threejudge court rejected each of the colleges justifications for its treatment of abramson nd held that she was entitled to proceed with all of

putting sabbath observer to this cruel choice violated the civil rights act39 alj bias in the social secu rity administration ssa grant v shalala40 raised novel issue as to the proper role of federal district courts in reviewing class action claim of alleged racial and ethnic bias by an administrative law judge alj for denying social security disability benefits to black and hispanic applicants the plaintiff class alleged that the alj in question was biased against all disability claimants and was inclined in every disability case to deny benefits according to the class complaint the alj was alleged to have stated to colleagues that claimants living in hispanic black or poor white communities are only attempting to milk the system that they are perfectly able of going out and earning living that they preferred living on public monies that he had intention of paying them and that he did not care what the evidence showed41 the case was certified as class action for all claimants who had or would receive adverse decisions from this alj while the case was pending the health and human services secretary ordered an internal panel investigation which after detailed examination of 212 of the aljs cases concl uded that the charges of bias against the claimants were generally unfounded the grant plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief requiring rehearing of their claims and prohibiting the hhs secretary from assigning the challenged alj to social security hearings judge litos opinion for an appellate panel of the third circuit focused on whether the district court could make its own findings of fact regarding the aljs bias or was instead restricted to reviewing the factual findings of the hhs secretary the majority concluded that the action had to be dismissed and that permitting discovery was inappropriate because the courts lacked jurisdiction to make novo determination of the issues raised firs t entertaining suit would contravene the social security statute which limited judicial review of the ssas actions42 the fact finding role in social security cases is exclusively within the domain of the agency judge alito opined which remains available to

the administrative process every alj would work under the threat of being subjected to such trea tment if his or her pattern of decisions displeased any administrative litigant or gr oup with the resources to put together suit charging bias43 in addition judge alito believe d that the claimants interests were adequately served ce the investigative panel conve ned by the agency in this case had analyzed broad random sample of decisions and while it did not find any evidence of bias the panel criticized certain practices that it detected44 in dissent judge higgenbotham disagreed on both points finding that the constitutionally mandated independence of article iii judges was out of pl ace as applied by the majority to statutory aljs and that proce dural deficiencies with the internal panel process coupled with inherent conf lict of interest c oncerns made it inappropriate to leave determination of bias remedies to the agency jury exclusion during judge alitos tenure on the third circuit the court has reviewed several cases alleging discriminatory exclusi on of minority group members from criminal juries the supreme court in batson v kentucky 45 held that peremptory challenge based on jurors race violated the equal protection clause regardless of whether the criminal defendant could show history of exercising racially discriminatory strikes by the prosecutor batson established threepart test first the defendant must prove prima face case of discrimination by the prosecutor basically that he is member of the same racial group as pers ons peremptorily struck from the jury pool second the prosecutor must rebut this accusation with raceneutral reasons for striking the black jurors in question finally the trial c ourt must assess the legitimacy of the prosecutors reasons and determine based on the totality of evidence whether there has been unconstitutional use of peremptory strikes46 although single factor may be dispositiv prima facie case is frequently found where the litigant strikes all prospec tive jurors from given racial group47 the third circuit reviewed the application of batson to racial jury exclusion cases in riley v taylor48 riley was

shot the victim killing him at trial all prospective black jurors were eliminated by state peremptory challenges leaving an allwhite jury riley was convicted on intentional and felony murder charges he appealed his conviction and sentence on several grounds most notably that the prosecution had exercised its peremptory challenges in racially discriminatory manner49 according to the prosecutor one juror was struck because he hesitated when questioned about his ability to return death sentence another because of work conflicts and the third because she testified that she could not impose the death penalty all of rileys batson claims were denied after severa l state and federal court hearings on rehearing banc the third circuit reversed threejudge panel opinion by judge alito later withdrawn which refused the capital convictees batson claim50 the majority employed several techniques to determine the prosecutors raceneutral reasons for pretext including comparisons of stricken black jurors and seated white jurors referral to prosecutors briefs and review of trial transcripts another factor for its disagreement with the courts below was statistical analysis of patterns of jury exclusion which i ndicated that minority jurors had been eliminated from all four of the first degree murder trials in the county during the year of the trial moreover it appears that th state at its own request was granted four weeks to rebut these statistics but never produced any evidence it may be that such evidence standing alone would not be sufficient to show intentional discrimination in selection of juries it is however particularly troublesome because the state failed to provide rebuttal data when given the opportunity which it requested in that ci rcumstance an inference adverse to the state may be fairly drawn51 thus the majority refused to credit the lower courts denial of the defendants batson claim finding the prosecutors raceneutral reasons incredible contradicted and implausible based on ll the facts and circumstances52 this drew dissent from judge alito w ho was particularly troubled by what he viewed as the majoritys misleading and simplistic statistical approach that treated potential jurors as though they were merely black and white marbles in jar lacking other characteristics that might explain why apart from race prosecutors had excluded them the

race of jurors who were dismissed for cause or peremptorily challenged by the defense53 in reality judge alito concluded these individuals had many other characteristics and without taking those variables into acc ount it is simply not possible to determine whether the prosecutions strikes were based on race or something else54 providing an interesting counterpoint to riley v taylor is judge alitos 2005 opinion for the threejudge panel in brinson v vaughn 55 the selection of jury for the murder trial of brinson an africaname rican was completed tw days before the batson decision was announced according to defense attorneys the prosecutor in the case exercised fourteen peremptory challenges thirteen for blacks and he seldom if ever questioned blacks prior to exercising his peremptory challenges56 without denying these assertions the prosecutor countered that he did not remember the race of each juror who he had peremptorily challenged that he recalled striking both africanam ericans and whites that he had not used all of his allotted strikes and that thr ee africanamericans had been selected for the jury57 the defendant was found guilty of firs tdegree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment thereafter while habeas motions were pending post batson training video for philadelphia prosecutors was released to the public in which brinsons prosecutor advocated the use of peremptory strikes to eliminate black jurors nonetheless district court denied the defendants petitions for failure to establish prima facie case under batson judge alito rejected as contrary to batson all of the proffered explanations by state and federal cour ts below for denying habeas relief first he found that the prosecution decision to accept some black jurors did not justify its elimination of others also the lower courts erred in hol ding that because the perpetrator victim and witnesses were africanameri can brinson had not presented prima facie case instead judge alito found the batson standard satisfied when all relevant circumstances give rise to the necessary inference of purposeful discrimination58 here he emphasized the prosecutor did not deny that he had used 13 of 14 strikes against africanamericans nor did he deny that he used all but one of his strikes against africanamericans nor did he say that while unable to recall the exact figures he remembered that his pattern of strikes was not anything like that allegedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33187crs14 59 id at 234 60 id at 235 61 500 us 352 1991 62 19 f3d 857 3d cir 1994by the defense59 in the absence of any circumstance that might provide legitimate reason the stark pattern of strikes against blacks shown in this case required trial to proceed on the batson challenge even without the videotape thus judge alito concluded we hold that the state courts rejection of brinsons batson claim cannot be sustained and therefore reverse th order of the district court and remand on remand the commonwealth should be given the opportunity to provide legitimate reasons for any strikes against africanamericans if it is unable to provide such explanation brinson will be entitled to habeas relief if the commonwealth is able to provide nondiscri minatory reasons for the strikes then the district court will be required to make findings as to whether the strikes were based on race60 in 1991 hernandez v new york61 established that prosecutors peremptory challenges of spanishspeaking latino jurors based on doubts about the ability of such jurors to defer to the official translation of span ishlanguage testimony did not violate the equal protection clause si gnificantly the supreme court there found that the prosecutor did not rely on language ability without more but on the specific responses nd demeanor of the prospective juror during voir dire as in racial exclusion cases languagebased cla ssifications could be challenged if shown to be pretext or surroga for ethnicitybased disc rimination yet the court was satisfied by the prosecutors explanation in hernandez that language plus other qualifications unrelated to ethnicity motivated the peremptory strikes in pemberthy v beyer 62 judge alito disposed of the question reserved in hernandez by upholding the constitutionality of peremptory challenges based solely on foreign language ability in pemberthy and companion case the state of new jersey appealed issuance of two habeas corpus writs by federal district court state jury had convicted two defendants on conspiracy and drug di stribution charges based on taped phone conversations translated from spanish into english at trial during voir dire the prosecutor exercised peremptory challeng against five spanishspeaking jurors whose bilingual ability he believed made it less likely that they would follow the official court translations later comments by the prosecutor that spanishspeakers might have leg up on other jurors coupl ed with trial c ourt determination that spanish language ability was the defining characteristic of hispanic origin persuaded the district judge that the disputed challenges lacked credible race neutral justification or were ethnically motivated the convictions were setaside in his opinion for the third circuit judge alito reversed the decision below on the issue of racial motivation the app eals court rejected the district courts findings but nonetheless httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33187crs15 63 id at 872 64 id among factors noted in pemberthy for determining prosecutors motivation in striking jurors 1 any extrinsic evidence of motivation 2 whether the prosecutors strikes correlate better with language ability or with race and 3 how strong the challengers reasons are to fear that transla tion issues will present problem emphasized in the strongest terms that peremptory challengers decision that is actually motivated by racial or ethnic considerations continues to be subject to strict scrutiny even when the attorney asserts that he or she is categorizing juries by linguistic ability rather than race or ethnicity63 accordingly while equal protection did not bar peremptory stri kes based on language alone because languagespeaking ability is so closely correlated with ethnicity trial court must carefu lly assess the challeng ers actual motivation64 since only four of the five challenged jurors in pemberthy were latinos however judge alito did not equate their exclusion with ethnic discrimination moreover language issues inherent in the case made plausible prosecution concerns that all jurors deliberate on the same basis not dominated by the few who may have greater facility in spanish than the official translators thus the decision appears to carry hernandez step further in that language alone rather than language plus was deemed to be constitutionally justifiable basi s for peremptory strikes th at disproportionately affect latino jurors nonetheless language may not be treated as surrogate for race and judge alito added bilingual jurors may only be excused if spanish language testimony is central to the case
