rundell for reasons 14 b and d 1 u the embassy welcomes your visit to the kingdom of saudi arabia this message provides brief overview of key current issues in us saudi relations tailored to the particular issues that your saudi interlocutors will likely raise with you 2 c you will be arriving six days after an arab league summit in doha despite the saudis pulling out all the diplomatic stops to ensure the summit conveyed publicly sufficient degree of arab unity libyan leader muammar qadhafis eccentric outburst showed that deep fissures still exist this was the second such embarrassment in the past three months showing the arabs to be badly divided on regional security issues after public disagreements at the arab economic summit in kuwait in january us saudi relations on the mend 3 c as you will hear saudi foreign policy calculations are driven by deep fear and suspicion of expanding iranian influence while ussaudi relations have improved dramatically since their post911 nadir differences remain over us middle east policies the saudis have three principal issues areas of concern about us policies c as the author of the 2002 arab peace initiative king abdallah risked his personal prestige to advocate comprehensive middle east peace as the strategic option for the arabs only to be frustrated by what he saw as us reluctance to engage over the next seven years c similarly in the saudi view we ignored advice from the king and foreign minister against invading iraq in the words of saudi foreign minister prince saud alfaisal military intervention in iraq and afghanistan has tilted the regional balance of power towards iran c finally the us debate over whether and how to engage iran has fueled saudi fears that new us administration might strike grand bargain without first consultating arab countries bordering the persian gulf appointment of prince nayif 4 c saudi king abdallah issued royal decree appointing his halfbrother interior minister prince nayif bin abdalaziz as second deputy prime minister march 27 the position had been vacant since abdallah became king in 2005 though the previous two crown princes held nayifs new position prior to being formally tapped as heirs to the throne this appointment does not necessarily mean nayif is crown prince in waiting because king abdallah created committee the allegiance council to select the kings successor 5 s the king was likely driven by expediency crown prince sultan is for all intents and purposes incapacitated and the king needed to travel abroad someone had to be left in charge and nayif by virtue of his seniority among the sons of abdalaziz and his position as minister of interior was by tradition the leading candidate for the job assistant interior minister mohammed bin nayif mbn told the ambassador that his fathers appointment should not be seen in the light of succession but as an administrative necessity internal security 6 cnf with our assistance saudi arabia has largely defeated terrorism at home the saudis are now arguably our most important counterterrorist intelligence partner they established tighter controls on charities and the transporting of cash to disrupt terrorist finance we have signed an information sharing agreement with the kingdom and started to exchange airline passenger information and passenger name record apipnr data to help track terrorist suspects and facilitate legitimate travel we can say clearly that saudi arabia is now part of the solution not the problem 7 snf the saudi leadership remains greatly concerned about the vulnerability of its energy production facilities and has put mbn of the ministry of interior moi in charge of efforts to acquire the capability to defend this key infrastructure he is looking primarily to the us to build this capability through an initiative formalized in may 2008 when secretary rice and prince nayif signed tca creating the joint commission on critical infrastructure protection we have established an interagency dosdoddoe security advisory organization the office of program managementministry of interior opmmoi to implement this bilateral security agreement king abdullah has made the protection of saudi arabias critical infrastructure top security priority with mbn fully empowered to achieve this objective rehabilitation program 8 snf we estimate that at least 1500 former extremists have passed through the interior ministrys rehabilitation program for extremists 1200 through the prison rehab program and 300 through the care center including 119 guantanamo returnees with an overall recidivism rate of 810 percent despite the front page treatment of former guantanamo detainee saeed alshihris appearance in yemen the real story of the saudi rehabilitation program is one of success at least 90 percent of its graduates appear to have given up jihad and reintegrated into saudi society the recidivists are the exception not the rule the ministry takes dynamic approach to the rehab program and will look for ways to strengthen it by learning from these incidents of recidivism 9 snf we know less about recidivism among nonguantanamo detainees since they were arrested here for activities inside saudi arabia and as such their cases are an internal saudi matter however we believe small minority of these have reengaged in violent extremist activity and moi tells us former guantanamo detainees were harder to rehabilitate than this other category the peace process after gaza 10 c king abdullah stated the saudi position bluntly in the opening session of the january summit in kuwait israel should realize that the choice between peace and war will not be available indefinitely and the saudiauthored arab peace initiative currently on the table will not remain there forever however the saudis have made move to withdraw the plan yet saudi and arab public opinion have reacted strongly to the israeli offensive on gaza creating intense pressure on arab governments to act the saudis fear instability and increasing iranian influence could result and believe that there is limited window of opportunity for action iran 11 s iran remains the strategic threat at the forefront of saudi security concerns senior us officials visiting the kingdom recently have heard the king expound at length about the great danger that iran poses to the region in general the saudi leadership has begun to look at all regional security issues through the prism of their fears about growing iranian influence they see irans activities as dangerously provocative not only in iraq but also in lebanon bahrain yemen parts of africa and southeast asia king abdullah met with iranian foreign minister mottaki earlier this month and subsequently informed the nscs john brennan that he had had heated exchange with mottaki upbraiding him that persians have business meddling in arab affairs and threatening that he would give iran more than year to repair its relations in the region saudi intelligence chief prince muqrin told brennan the shia crescent has become full moon implying that the saudis are surrounded by iranian intrigues 12 s on iranian nuclear activities the saudi view is that nations have the right to peaceful nuclear program but that iran does not have the right to do what it is doing the saudis want to see peaceful solution to the iran nuclear problem but they also want reassurance that saudi interests will be factored into any deal struck with iran afghanistan 13 snf we have been encouraging the saudi government to be more active in support of the karzai government in particular by helping to train or to fund the training of afghan security forces saudi arabia has been helpful in providing assistance but we would like them to do more one area in which saudi diplomacy has been forward leaning is in offering to help mediate between the afghan government and the taliban pakistan 14 c the saudis are extremely concerned about pakistans political fragility and have worked hard through their embassy in islamabad to bring the pakistani factions together saudi relations with pakistan have been strained because the saudis dont trust zardari and see him and other leading pakistani politicians as corrupt zardari visited saudi arabia last november for talks with king abdullah on saudi support for the friends of pakistan initiative and oil subsidies the visit was an opportunity for zardari to persuade skeptical saudis that he can be trustworthy partner in managing one of saudi arabias most important regional relationships but his trip appears not to have resulted in new saudi assistance or other commitments the saudis say they have been holding back economic and political support pending evidence that the political situation in pakistan is stabilizing fraker
