develop bingo simulator that could represent class ii bingo games the simulator has number of parameters that enable the game to be customized the nigc also asked bmm to run number of simulations with nominated parameters which match various options under consideration these simulations have been run and this report is summary of the findings of the simulation the results are provided without comment note that appendix contains full description of the parameters and options used during the simulation runs and their outcomes 2 description of the simulator parameters the following table

milliseconds thus the time between games for all of the experiments in the above table is 1000 milliseconds or one second 2 where the minimum and maximum values are different random number is selected within their range inclusively 3 the number of players represents those to participate in each bingo game simulation the first pair of columns is two players in each game and the second pair six players in each game the third pair represents that random number of players between two and twelve will participate in each gametherefreshingchoiceintestlabs comparisonanalysisofvariousclassiiconfigurationoptions page2 simulationresults 3 wpmoctober262006 4 the fast start parameter is used to reflect that bingo game under the current classification standards may commence early if there are six or more players within the game otherwise the game would need to wait full two seconds to start the time to wait for all players in these experiments the fast start parameter was variable between 12 milliseconds and two seconds reflecting real life variability in players starting the next play 5 the duration is the time for which the experiment was run in the table above it was 720 minutes or 12 hours 6 the outputs of the simulation are the number of games played during the simulation run and the coin in obtained for that simulation 7 these two outputs are converted to rate per minute by dividing the result by the elapsed time we have chosen the games played as the most meaningful statistic in the comparisons made during this report thus the games per minute for the three experiments show game play rates of 523 572 and 553 respectively 8 the comparisons will vary between experiments but represent percentage of games played for one criteria versus games played for another criteria in the table above the comparisons show 946 higher game play rate for six players in game and 582 greater game play rate for variable 2 to 12 players in game 3 components 31 bingo game templates there are three bingo game templates described in detail in appendix the following is brief description of each of the three templates 1 compliant parameters that reflect the current state of the classification standards 2 consensus parameters that reflect games that were the subject of class ii classification opinions by the nigc general counsel 3 one touch the most commonly implemented parameters for current class ii equipment 32 experiments there were four experiments requested to be run which are described in appendix 1 comparison of the effect of the fast start option for compliant games ie game that would start faster if six or more players are rapidly playing in each game the rate or play for getting all players active in the compliant game was set randomly in the range of 12 to 2000 milliseconds where appropriate perhaps more closely resembling what might happen in real lifetherefreshingchoiceintestlabs comparisonanalysisofvariousclassiiconfigurationoptions page3 simulationresults 3 wpmoctober262006 2 comparison of the outcome games played of the compliant games versus the outcome of the consensus games the rate of play for getting all players active in consensus game was set uniformly as one second 3 comparison of the outcome games played of the compliant games versus the outcome of the one touch games the rate of play for getting all players active in game was also set randomly in the range of 12 to 2000 milliseconds where appropriate perhaps more closely resembling what might happen in real life 4 comparison of the compliant games versus both consensus games and one touch games in simulation of less and less play in the game within the casino this has been structured to represent range of times between games as means to broadly emulate the out of hours performance of typical casino 4 results the following is brief summary of the results of these experiments for which details are contained within the various tables within appendix 41 experiment 1 this experiment performed comparison of the performance effect of the fast start option for compliant games ie in situations when there are six or more players in game it may start immediately rather than wait the full two seconds the outcome of the comparisons from this experiment show 2046 higher game play rate for six players versus two players in game and 1625 greater game play rate for variable 2 to 12 players in game also versus two players in absolute terms for the 12 hours of the simulation experiment the results showed 3762 games played with two players per game 4118 games played with six players per game and 3981 games played with variable number of players per game ranging between 2 and 12 the reason that the variable 2 to 12 players is lower rate than the six players per game is because in circumstances where five or less players join in game there must be full two seconds wait for the game to start whereas with six fixed that component of the waiting can be dramatically reduced 42 experiment 2 this experiment performed comparison of the performance of the compliant games versus the performance of the consensus games the outcome of the comparison of the three runs based upon number of active players in game show percentage increase of about 75 60 and 65 in games played per minute for the consensus games when compared with the compliant games in absolute terms for the 12 hours of the simulation experiment the results showed 3762 versus 6583 games played with two players per game 4118 versus 6570 games played with six players per game and 3981 versus 6568 games played with variable number of players per game ranging between 2 and 12 with the former figure the compliant game results and the latter figure the consensus game results for each of the three comparisonstherefreshingchoiceintestlabs comparisonanalysisofvariousclassiiconfigurationoptions page4 simulationresults 3 wpmoctober262006 43 experiment 3 this experiment performed comparison of the performance of the compliant games versus the performance one touch games the outcome of the comparison of the three runs based upon number of active players in game show percentage increase of about 152 130 and 137 in games played per minute for the one touch games when compared with the compliant games in absolute terms for the 12 hours of the simulation experiment the results showed 3762 versus 9474 games played with two players per game 4118 versus 9457 games played with six players per game and 3981 versus 9452 games played with variable number of players per game ranging between 2 and 12 with the former figure the compliant game results and the latter figure the one touch game results for each of the three comparisons 44 experiment 4 this experiment performed comparison of the performance of the compliant games versus the performance of both the consensus and one touch games in simulation of less and less play in the game within the casino the outcome of this experiment is shown in table d in the appendix and shows diminishing effect of the rules and timing variations as the utilization diminishes ranging from 57 down to 57 for the consensus game versus the compliant game and 112 down to 92 for the one touch game versus the compliant game appendix also contains graphs which summarize the output 45 experiment 5 consensus versus one touch as an extra analysis we show in appendix the outcome of comparison of simulation runs for one consistent set of parameters of the consensus versus one touch game this shows an improvement of 425 for the latter over the former in absolute terms for the 12 hours of the simulation experiment the results showed 6583 versus 9374

one cent whichever is greater this can cause high degree of variability of player return depending upon the number of players in the game the following table shows these variations with the vertical column showing the number of players within game and the horizontal the effect of the game winning prize at various percentages the table assumes that there will be bets that are direct multiple of
