hungary and poland summary the 1998 senate debate on the accession to the north atlantic treaty by the czech republic hungary and poland was sp read across eight days from march 17 to april 30 enlargement of the north atlantic treaty organization nato was favored by the leadership of both parties and during the debate the resolution ofratification was widely expected to pass opponents of nato enlargement structured most of their arguments and am endments as expressions of concern about the future of the allian ce as it moves into the 21 st century the senate gave its advice and consent on april 30 voting 8019 in favor of ratification the central point of contention be tween supporters and opponents of nato enlargement was disagreement over if nd how nato should change its strategic concept to fit the postcold war worl d supporters of enlargement generally believed the alliance should continue its evolution into versatile defender of western interests opponents viewed such evolution as not conforming to the terms of the 1949 washington treaty the american share of enlargement costs concerned senators on both sides of the debate supporters tended to accept lower cost estimates and to declare thatenlargement was worthwhile expense opponents worried that the senate wassigning blank check which could spiral out of control and sought to lower theus share of the natos common costs fr om the current level of around 25 percent two issues with openended implications played key roles in the debate the first was russia opponents were concerne d that adding the three applicants would bolster extreme factions in russia and strain united statesrussia relations mostsupporters cited alliance efforts to engage russia and to aid its transition todemocracy they argued that russia would eventually see natos defensive nature the second issue was how enlargement would affect european stability and ussecurity supporters focused on the need to maintain us engagement in europe andits ability to meet new security threats opponents warned of russia becoming aregional destabilizer and argued that adding three countries to those the united states is committed to defend would further stretch what many considered an alreadyoverburdened military little debate took place about any moral responsibility the west might have concerning the past injustices done to th three applicants these issues however were clearly important to many enlargement supporters many viewed enlargementas the fulfillment of american promises during the cold war and way by which thewest could redeem itself for the abandonment of eastern europe in the wake of the second world war two conditions on ratification were also debated by the senate the first mandated three year pause before any future rounds of accession the second linkednato and european union membership the sponsors of the resolution ofratification argued that such conditions would limit natos

accession of the czech republic hungary and poland introduction on april 30 1998 the us senate by vote of 8019 gave its advice and consent to the accession of the czech re public hungary and poland to the north atlantic treaty the wideranging debate included consideration not only of thequalifications of the three candidates but perhaps more importantly of the qualityof the alliance itself senators discussed natos evolving mission cost andquestions of burdensharing relations with russia and other matters this reportsummarizes the main issues in the debate strategic concept the question of how if at all nato s hould adapt its mission to fit the security environment of the postcold war worl d sparked some of the senates most contentious debate from the outset of the debate enlargement was linked to thedevelopment of natos strategic concept and the degree to which it should focus on new missions beyond collective defense many supporters of enlargementbelieved broader mission profile would strengthen nato by ensuring its relevancein new european security structure others argued that the redefinition of thestrategic concept amounted to treaty cr eep that is it would create nato organization beyond the scope of the north atlantic treaty senators john ashcroft rmissouri john kyl rarizona nd jeff bingaman dnew mexico introduced amendments designed to give the senate voice concerning the alliances transition toward its new roles the future of the alliance supporters most senators who advocated adding the czech republic hungary and poland to the alliance also supported using nato to meet the newsecurity challenges that have emerged ce the end of the cold war senator john mccain rarizona entered into the congressional record cr statement by the new atlantic initiative an organization composed primarily of former government officials the statement declared that nato has rightfully closed the door on itssuccessful mission to prevent soviet domin ation of western europe but that its larger purpose of ensuring peace and freedom in europe and the atlantic regionendures it outlined new identity for nato as an alliance aiming to promote peace and stability in the atlantic region devoted to the spread and consolidation ofdemocratic ways in europe and capable of protecting western interests against suchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98669crs2 future threats as may emerge the statement tied this vision of the future to the legislation at hand pronouncing crucial to this process of adaptation is natos willingness to admit new members otherw ise it will remain relic of the cold war of diminishing relevance to the contemporary world cr 18 march 1998 s2200 senator john kerry dmassachuse tts said that nato has already begun kind of transition expanding its mission to include other tasks the alliance hesaid has an expanded vision of the range of potential rivalries within europe to global threats such as terrorism or nuclear proliferation but also greaterwillingness to undertake certain kinds of missi ons to cope with those threats cr 30 april 1998 s3848 supporters of enlargement and an expande d role for the alliance contended that the original text of the north atlantic treaty provided for the new missions beingproposed for nato these missions are often referred to as nonarticle 5missions because they would not be in response to direct attack on membersterritory which under article 5 of the wa shington treaty would be considered an attack against all members specifically they cited article 4 of the treaty which reads the parties will consult together whenever in the opinion of any of them the territorial integrity political independen ce or security of any of the parties is threatened senator william roth rdel aware spoke about the flexibility of the 1949 treaty some fifty years ago the drafters of the washington treaty included provisions not only to provide for th territorial defense of the north atlantic region but also for the possibility of common action to protectother interests of the north atlantic community it was the united states that insisted upon this provision article 4 of the charter and aconstruction of the charter that would permit actions beyond the narrow scope of territorial defense cr 30 april 1998 s3861 senator roth went on to cite memora ndum recounting press conference given by secretary of state dean acheson on ma rch 18 1949 asked if there was limiting clause the secretary stated that there was limiting clause asked if the treaty stipulated that if armed attack s hould originate outside of the area action might be taken the secretary replied in the negative cr 30 april 1998 s3862 yet while they argued that nonartic 5 missions are acceptable under the terms of the washington treaty proponents of enlargement reaffirmed the centrality of article 5 to the mission of the alliance senator roth said the resolution makes crystal clear that the senate firmly believe s that natos first priority must be the mission of collective defense cr 30 april 1998 s3861 he pointed out that section 3bi of the protocols on accession states that in order for nato to serve the security interests of the united stat the core purpose of nato must continue to be the collective defense of the territory of all nato members opponents senators against enlargi ng the alliance and broadening its operational purview argued that nato is st raying from its original mission and that the washington treaty is far more limited than supporters of enlargement claimhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98669crs3 senator ashcroft began by questioning natos transition from cold war institution to its current security role he said we have to ask ourselves at this juncture what is the purpose of the treaty is it appropriate or possible to change the treaty withoutamending the treaty just by beginning to lean everyone in one direction to turn the treaty to one side or another or begin to assert that there arenew things to be considered because the treaty is evolving i have to tellyou i dont believe in treaty evolution any more than i believe in theevolution of the constitution cr 27 april 1998 s3627 senator larry craig ridaho also expressed concern that the proposed evolution of natos mission would create an instituti on different from what the founders of the alliance envisioned it is my cern that the presiden ts vision of new nato will signal the end of nato as defe nsive alliance and be gin its role as regional peacekeeping organization cr 23 march 1998 s2446 senator warner said we are in danger of turning th is fine alliance into miniun cr 19 march 1998 s2275 senator daniel patric k moynihan dnew york entered into the congressional record an address he gave to meeting of the associated press in celebration of its 150 th anniversary his remarks surveyed the resolution of ratifications mention of article 4based missions section 3bii and asked does this not read suspiciously like license to get into fight just about anywherecr 27 april 1998 s3612 challenging the notion that article 4 of the north atlantic treaty allows the type of changes to natos mission being proposed senator ashcroft asked is this what was intended when this nato agr eement came into existence was it designed to have this kind of elasticity not according to the folks who presided in the us senate in 1949 when this great treaty organization was ratified he then quoted senator tom connally dtexas chairman of the senate committee on foreign relations in 1949 let us not forget that this treaty is limited in scope its main purpose is to maintain the peace and s ecurity of the north atlantic area we do not propose to stretch its terms to cover the entire globe cr 27 march 1998 s3628 senator ashcroft argued that article 4 of the north atlantic treaty wasdesigned to play supporting role to articles 5 and 6 the latter of which specifieswhat is to be considered an attack on member of the alliance limits nato toactions of collective defense the geographic scope of the article v commitment was defined explicitly in article vi to make sure there was not any confusion it said the unitedstates would defend the territory of nato members not the interests not the commercial transactions but the territory of the nato members undergirding natos collective defense mission was the purpose ofarticle iv article iv was not loophole for any milit ary operation the north atlantic council could dream up cr 27 april 1998 s3628 ashcroft amendment senator ashcroft introduced an amendment 2318 designed to prevent nato from taking on missions he believed would require amendment of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98669crs4 1the tally of votes can be found in the congressional record of 30 april 1998 p s3862 the text of the amendment can be found in appendix 2washington treaty he said his amendment would make sure that the senate will not be endorsing what i call treaty creep where we just allow creeping mission to get us to the place where we are longer able to sustain those things which oughtto be sustained cr 27 april 1998 s3629 the amendment stipulated that the united states would oppose all nato military operations unless the operation is intended for the purpose of collective selfdefense in responseto an armed attack on the territory of an alliance member or the operation is in response to threat to the territorial integrity politicalindependence or security of nato member senator ashcroft described the purpose of his amendment my amendment is tailored not to constrain natos effectiveness in the future nor is it intended to micromanage natos military planning fromthe senate floor the central portion of the amendment is taken directlyfrom the north atlantic treaty itself my amendment states that any military operation outside article v must be based on the principle ofcollective defense namely the territorial integrity political independenceor security of nato member cr 19 march 1998 s2284 the amendment faced strong opposition led by senator roth from supporters of nato enlargement senator roth ar gued against the amendment saying at its best this amendment is unnecessary to achieve the goals of its sponsors at its worst the amendment would undercut the alliances will and capability to defend thesecurity interests of the rth atlantic community of democracies the fact that nato acts only by consensus made the am endment unnecessary he said because the united states can never be forced to participate in nato operation he argued that the authors of the washington treat did envision nonarticle 5 missions and that the united states should not set the precedent of unilaterally reinterpreting thewashington treaty an action which he said runs counter to the spirit and traditions of the alliance and would encourage the other members of the alliance to do the same senator roth closed by asking in world of rogue states with biological chemical and nuclear weapons increasingly at their disposal why would we want to discard one of the best vehicles through which to prompt allied support for ussecurity interests cr 30 april 1998 s3861 in the closing hours of the debate on april 30 senator joseph biden d delaware made motion to table the ame ndment the roll call vote succeeded with 82 yeas and 18 nays and the amendment was tabled 1 kyl amendment on april 28th prior to the vote on the ashcroft amendment senator kyl introduced amendment 2310 which added to the resolution of ratification astatement of the senates understanding of us policy toward natos strategichttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98669crs5 2the tally of votes can be found in the congressional record of april 28 1998 p s3698 the text of the amendment can be found in appendix 2concept senator kyl argued that the nate should have voice in the revision of the strategic concept in my view the current resolution focuses too much on what nato should not be and should not do the resolution does not attempt to lay out comprehensive set of principles to guide development of the strategic concept and so this proposed amendment will establish the senatesvision of the future of nato and i hope help to lay the foundation for american positions on the strategic concept cr 28 april 1998 s3695 he went on to say our principal objective here is to ensure that nato remains an arm of us power and influence nato must remain the principal foundation for the security interests of its members this means nato must be prepared todefend against range of common th reats to our vital interests cr 28 april 1998 s3695 the amendment identified postco ld war concerns like weapons of mass destruction and access to natural resources as legitimate however the amendmenttempered its recognition of the threats of ethnic or religious rivalries and historicdisputes with statement that only threats of this type occurring in the north atlantic area should be within natos purview senator kyls amendment faced little opposition senators warner and moynihan asked for several points of clarifica tion but both eventually voted in favor of the amendment the senate approved the amendment by vote of 90 yeas to 9 nays 2 bingaman amendment senator bingamans amendment 2324 sought to set condition on future rounds of accession senator bingaman said that his amendment would withhold inviting additional countries other than poland hungary and the czech republic fornato membership until after nato has pproved revised strategic concept cr 27 april 1998 s3631 he sa id right now we in th senate are being called upon to sign up to policy of enlarging the alliance without clear coherent explanation of how expansion of nato will serve natos strategic interests i am concerned because nato itself does not seem to have an agreed upon strategicmilitary mission cr 27 april 1998 s3630s3631 with new strategic concept due to be approved at the 1999 washingt on summit the senator argued that his amendment was not likely to cause delay in future enlargement processes despite senator bingamans statement that he had great difficulty seeing why anyone would object to this senator biden asked his colleagues to reject theamendment cr 30 april 1998 s3854 senator biden argued that if implemented the amendment could be tool for those wishing to slow down or stop the process of enlargement by refusing to agree to new strategic concept any nato member could quietly stop enlargement the ame ndment senator biden said would providehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98669crs6 3the tally of votes can be found in the congressional record of april 30 1998 p s3863 the text of the amendment can be found in appendix 2a pocket veto for country opposed to enlargement but unwilling to make its case publicly senator bingamans amendment fa iled by vote of 23 yeas to 76 nays3 costs burdensharing senators on both sides of the debate were concerned with how much the enlargement of nato would cost the alliance generally and the united states inparticular estimates of the total cost of enlargement cited in the debate ranged from 15 billion to 125 billion the cost would be shared among the 19 members of an enlarged alliance senators who questione d the costs of the process focused on the potential for enlargement to become an openended financial commitment ingeneral supporters concentrated on the non monetary benefits of enlargement and expressed confidence in the lower cost estimates opponents critics of the figures given by the administration and by nato complained that accurate estimate of the cost involved in admitting the czech republic hungary and poland was available for them to examine the estimatesthat were available prepared by the u s government nato itself and several nongovernmental organizations all made ssumptions of force size and strategic posture that were highly debatable in the rapidly changing european securityenvironment senator tom harkin diowa said i have seen projections rangefrom 125 billion down to 15 billion when you have that wide variancesomething is very strange cr 17 march 1998 s2145 senator harkin went on to mention problem with current cost estimates another piece of the puzzle we are missing is how new members are to address their military shortfalls although the shortfalls were to be identified in december 1997 the countries force goals will not be set until this spring in other words we are without plan to address the forcegoals and the price tag associated with it i am very uncomfortable signingthe american taxpayers name to potentially ballooning blank checkcr 17 march 1998 s2145 senator larry craig ridaho expressed similar concerns all of this cost related information will be made av ailable to congress only after the senates advice and consent to expansion is final and irrevocable that means if the information is notsatisfactory to the senate we will have recourse cr 23 march 1998 s2446 historian john lewis gaddis in new york times opinion piece inserted into the congressional record identified another source of ambiguity what will expansion cost the administrations estimate sounds like bargain but theestimate assumes change in the current security environment has it occurred to the administration that the act of expanding nato especially if former sovietstates are included could itself alter the current security environment cr 28 april 1998 s3704httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98669crs7 4the tally of votes can be found in the congressional record of april 28 1998 p s3687 the text of the amendment can be found in appendix 3senator harkin was also vocal on the issue of burdensharing currently the united states pays approximately 25 pe rcent of natos common operational costs opponents of enlargement worried that the addition of the czech republic hungary and poland would create upward pressure on th us share of costs these fears were exacerbated by the recent trend among european countries toward reducingdefense spending and conflicting reports of whether or not the french had agreed to help pay the cost of enlargement nator harkin introduced an amendment 2312 stipulating that the united states w ould be limited to paying more than 25 percent of the expenditures involved in integrating the czech republic hungaryand poland into the alliance he stated what my amendment says is what is good for one side ought to be good for another if 25 percent is good for the commonbudgets it ought to be good for the national budgets the amendment was defeated by roll call vote of 76 nays to 24 yeas 4 senator ted stevens ralaska introdu ced two amendments designed to reduce the us share of the alliances common budget and to impose tighter congressional control over expenses incurred in the process of integrating the czech republichungary and poland into natos command structure senator stevens originallyintroduced both amendments n 2065 and 2066 on march 23 1998 cr s2437 s2438 and later said my original intent in proposing these amendments was tobring some greatly needed accountability to the critical issue of recognizing andclarifying all the costs to the united st ates to enlarge the nato alliance cr 30 april 1998 s3845 amendment 2065 stipul ated that none of the costs involved in admitting new members to the alliance c ould be paid by the united states unless congress specifically authorized the f unds amendment 2066 would have cut off all us funding to nato beyond the current fiscal year unless the secretariesof state and defense certified to the congress that the united states wouldcontribute more than 20 percent of the total common budget the effect of this second amendment would be an immediate 5 percent cut in the share of natoscommon budget paid by the united states both of senator stevens amendments were significantly modified through negotiation with the supporters of ratification inserted into amendment 2065was the language other than through the commonfunded budgets of nato which left intact the existing channels of authorization for common budget funding butasserted congressional control over any add itional assistance given to new alliance members the second amendment 2066 was broken into two parts over thecourse of the debate the first secti on of the revised amendment was nonbinding statement of the sense of the senate which declared that the president shouldevery year for five years beginning in fiscal year 1999 propose to nato one percent reduction in the share of the common budget paid by the united states thesecond section of the amendment carried the fo rce of law and stipulated that the total us commitment to the nato common budget in any fiscal year after october 1 1998 may not exceed the total of all such pa yments made in fiscal year 1998 unless specifically authorized by the congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98669crs8 5acceptance of amendment 2065 can be found in the congressional record of april 28 1998 p s3859 acceptance of amendment 2066 can be found in the record of the same day p s3847 the texts of both amendments can be found in appendix 3in their original forms both of sena tor stevens amendments were opposed by the sponsors of the resolution of ratifi cation upon further negotiation however both were accepted as friendly amendments and passed by voice votes senatorstevens voted in favor of the final text of the resolution of ratification 5 supporters many senators who advocated enlargement also expressed concern about the financial burden that w ould be borne by the united states they differed from their opponents however in that they were generally satisfied with the studies that produced lower cost estimates enlargement supporters also proposedthat the united states would reap moneysaving benefits from the stability theyexpected an enlarged alliance to create advocates balked at some of the estimates of the cost of enlargement senator biden called the highend figures bizarre cr 27 april 1998 s3638 the department of defense dod in february 1997 provided the congress with reportprojecting the cost of enlargement to be between 27 and 35 billion the dod study encompassed both costs to all 19 nationa l defense budgets as well as nato common budget funds nato itself studied the issu after the july 1997 invitations to join had been made to the czech republic hungary and poland natos december1997 figure which was restricted to increases in the common budget was approximately 15 billion this estimate subsequently was accepted by both thedod and the general accounting office gao senator carl levin dmichigan argued that the nato study should be accepted by the senate as reliable because itwas conducted with the knowledge of which countries had been invited earlierestimates had planned for the possible inclusion of fourth country and moreprecise information regarding the state of the polish hungarian and czech military establishments than had previously been available senator levin said thatoriginal estimate of the administration was way off and it was way high and the revised estimate done by nato after onsite visits and looking only at the directcosts resulting from the increase in the size of nato that assessment has been approved by the gao and by the dod cr 19 march 1998 s2254 other senators chose to focus on the nonmonetary benefits of nato enlargement senator barbara mikulski dmaryland spoke on this point opponents of enlargement point to the cost but what is the cost of not enlarging nato i believe the cost of not enlarging nato will be far higher what will be the cost to european security what will be the cost to the new democracies of eastern europe what would be thelongrange cost to america of failing to prepare nato for the 21 st century the cost would be instability in europe and the increased chance of being pulled into yet another conflic t the cost of preventive security is always less than the cost of war cr 18 march 1998 s2197httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98669crs9 senator max cleland dgeorgia concurred for long time i have asked myself the question can we afford it i now as k myself can we afford not to do it cr 29 april 1998 s3748 many supporters of accession also noted that while the dollarvalue of us contributions to the common budget might increase in an enlarged nato thepercentage contribution would decrease sli ghtly from the current level of around 25 percent nonetheless advocates of enla rgement fought to defeat senator harkins amendment requiring percentage spending cap senator biden argued that theamendment was hamstringing of our national defense budget unrelated tonato cr 28 april 1998 s3670 he claimed it would hinder us interests by prohibiting bilateral weapons sales or othe r defense assistance to the new alliance member countries unless the other nations of the alliance were willing to pay 75percent of the cost russia concerns key point in the senates debate was the issue of how russia would respond to having nato member state abutting its westernmost borderkaliningrad russias isolated piece of territory on the baltic sea given thehistory of the alliance as deterrent ag ainst soviet expansi onism during the cold war several senators worried that nat expansion would poison the usrussia relationship at time when the nurturing and engagement of the newly democratic regime in moscow are widely viewed as critical to its longevity opponents of enlargement argued that havi ng spent much of the past fifty years fighting the cold war in part to break through the iron curtain imposed on europe after world war ii nato should not take actions which might simply replace the old lines with new ones senator paul wellstone dminnesota said there ispeace between states in europe between nations in europe for the first time in centuries we do not have divided eu rope and i worry about nato expansion which could redivide europe and again poison relations with russia cr 19 march 1998 s2257 opponents said that the accession to the alliance of the czech republic hungary and poland three invitees in field of twelve hopefuls would create an us versus them atmosphere instead of fostering the idea of aunified europe the current danger to alliance members it was argued is not the threat of attack by the oncepowerful russian military but instead its continued deterioration as competent fighting force senator wellstone said the russian military hascollapsed the russian armys ability to quell tiny illequipped chechen forcesraises doubts about russias capability to threaten its former eastern bloc allies in the foreseeable future cr 19 march 1998 s2257 security measures designed for the proper storage of russias arse nal of weapons of mass destruction are breaking down increasing the likelihood of proliferation of such weapons among rogue states nato enlargement oppone nts argued makes russian cooperation on initiatives such as the nunnlugar program to safeguard nuclear weapons less likely and therefore exacerbates the threat of proliferationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98669crs10 lastly there was the contention that nato enlargement was simply the wrong way to treat the former soviet union in the wake of its defeat in the cold war theconcern was voiced that nato expansion would strengthen nationalistic and anti democratic forces in russia and that it would as former ambassador george fkennan stated in an oftencited new york times opinion piece impel russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking cr 19 march 1998 s2259 senator bob smith rnew hampshir said that enlargement is basically kicking the russians for reason history tells us that this is unwise cr 17 march 1998 s2108 senator pat roberts rkansas entered into the congressional record an opinion piece by histor ian john lewis gaddis that compared the current russian situation to that of postwar germany and argued that the west should notmake the same mistakes it made with the weimar republic after world war ialthough in the end he voted in favor of ratification senator roberts said that byenlarging nato we are poking the russian bear cr 28 april 1998 s3703 opponents of enlargement argued that west ern policy should strive to strengthen democratic forces in russia enlargemen t they argued will only bolster hardline nationalist and communist elements in the russian political arena and weakendemocratic forces by wounding national pride and creating sense of insecurityamong the russian public senator wellstone argued european security and stability is greatly dependent on russias successful transition to democracy th at i think is the central point democratic russia is unlikely to threat its neighbors i am worried i am terribly worried i think this is profound mistake i think this natoexpansion could threaten that democr acy in russia and i think if we do not have successful transition to democracy in russia that in turnthreatens european security and stability cr 19 march 1998 s2257 with the rise of such antidemocratic forces opponents argued will come increasing intransigence in the area of arms reduction the communistdominated russianduma has yet to follow the senate in ratifying the second strategic arms reductiontreaty start ii and kennan believed that it might make it much more difficult if not impossible to secure ratification of this treaty and others including thecomprehensive test ban treaty cr 19 march 1998 s2259 responses proponents of nato enlargement led by senators roth and biden countered each objection raised by the opposition with contrastinginterpretations of russian behavior in the face of accession by the czech republic hungary and poland responding specifically to the notion advanced chiefly by senator moynihan that tensions along the polandrussia border would be increased by polandsmembership in the alliance senator bi den noted that since natos inception in 1949 norway has bordered russias heavily fortified kola peninsula withoutincident in the same speech on april 30 senator biden reasserted the position that was central to the proponents stance on the issue of russia the alliance is defensive in nature and thus nato simply does not threaten russia never did never will cr 30 april 1998 s3870 he cited evidence that american troop levels as part of nato deployments have declined from peak of over 300000during the cold war to around 100000 today and that the trend is toward stillhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98669crs11 smaller numbers nato at the end of the cold war abandoned forwarddeployed stationary defenses for less obtrusive rapi d deployment forces senator biden further noted that the alliance publicly stated in december 1996 that it had intention plan and reason to ploy nuclear weapons on the territory of new members and in march 1997 it stated that there was need to deploy combat troops in thenew member countries cr 30 april 1998 s3870 senator roth characterized as d ead wrong the argument that nato enlargement punishes russia when it is w eak just as the versailles treaty punished defeated germany he cited the natorussia founding act signed on 27 may 1997 which provided the foundation for not only enhanced consultation but also unprecedented defense cooperation cr 17 march 1998 s2111 russian troops today serve with nato forces in bosnia and herzegovina and since 1991 the west has contributed nearly 100 billion to aid democratic and economic reforms inrussia senator biden noted us support for russian efforts to join theorganization for economic cooperation and development and the world tradeorganization and for the inclusion of russi in what has become the g8 conference of leading industrial nations advocates of enlargement argued that an expanded nato should not poison relations with russia senator biden expressed hope that over time moscow cancome to realize that enlargement of nato by moving the zone of stability eastwardto central europe will increase her own security not diminish it cr 18 march 1998 s21812 senator jesse helms rnorth carolina chairman of the foreign relations committee advanced another view of russian behavior as reason forenlargement saying some have said that nato expansion is unnecessarilyprovocative to russia if nything it will make it easier for us to maintain friendly relations with russia because an expa nded nato will shut off russias avenue to more destructive patterns of behavior cr 27 april 1998 s3604 conceding that differences exist with ru ssia over such issues as its failure to ratify start ii and its policies in the middle east proponents of ratificationinsisted that these disagreements were not caused by the prospect of nato enlargement senator biden offered an explanation of the dumas opposition tostart ii russian communists and ultranationalists were against ratifyingstart ii before nato enlargement was even gleam in the eyes of lech walesaand havel let alone us policy why were the russian communists and ultranationalists against it because american arms control negotiators did heckof job and russia knew it cr 27 april 1998 s3640 as evidence of russian cooperation with the west he cited the dumas ratification of the chemicalweapons convention and the conventional fo rces in europe treaty and president boris yeltsins pledge to ratify start ii senator biden also cited data from march 14 1998 gallup poll which showed the russian public to be in favor of allowing the three candidate states to join thealliance he said 53 percent say poland should be allowed to join nato 57 percent say the czech republic should be allowed to join nato 54 percent say hungary should be allowed to join nato and 25 percent had view on thematter cr 27 april 1998 s3639 senator biden argued that the polling data confirmed that most russians had accepted nato enlargement dont you kind ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98669crs12 find it fascinating that majority of the russian people say these countries should be able to join so lets give the russians little credit for being intelligentthinking people who are not captives of out dated ideological propaganda from the gallup poll i read you clearly they are not cr 27 april 1998 s3640 in response to the contention that enlargement will damage the prospects of democracys success in russia proponents argued that refusing to expand natowould in fact be more detrimental than enlargement might be because it would give hardline nationalists and communists victory over democrats who had tacitly accepted enlargement as reality senator ro th declared moscow will always have its own independent motivations unfortunately there are still those in moscow whoreject nato enlargement out of desire to preserve russias sphere of influence let us not give credibility to the likes of vladimir zhirinovsky by acceding to thesedemands there was further concern th at by changing course because of russian misgivings nato would effectively give veto to russia over what ostensibly are internal decisions several senators reacted strongly against giving russia undue influence including senator christopher b ond rmissouri who stated do not let the russians run our foreign policy cr 19 march 1998 s2259 nato enlargement was also put forth as hedge against the possibility that russia will be resurgent or that its experiment with democracy might fail at somepoint in the future senator gordon sm ith roregon said we cannot be certain what the european security environment will look like in three five or ten years butif we act now we will be better prepared for any outcome cr 19 march 1998 s2261 if russia does attempt to regain pa rts of its empire an enlarged nato will be ready according to senator roth the bottom line is that if russia cannot accept the legitimate right of its neighbors to choose their own defensive securityarrangements then natos role in central and eastern europe is even moreimportant cr 17 march 1998 s2111 european stability american security stability and security were frequently cited among the many reasons for natos creation in 1949 and its continued endurance today the preamble of the washington treaty states that members of the alliance seek to promote stabilityand wellbeing in the north atlantic area th ey are resolved to unite their efforts for collective defense and for the preservation of peace and security thus central to the senates debate on enlargement were questions of if and how stability andsecurity would be enhanced if the czech republic hungary and poland were to join the alliance the senate was divided supporters of the resolution of ratification felt that enlargement would create safe r and more stable europe while opponents of ratification believed the process would instead create dangerous instability in the european security environment supporters advocates of nato enlargement looked to the past performance of the alliance as an indicator of the stab environment they expected to exist in europe if the czech republic hungary and poland were to become members ofnato noting the relative tranquility and wellbeing of the north atlantic area since the creation of the alliance nator frank murkowski ralaska saidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98669crs13 enlargement ensures and enhances the prospects for peace prosperity and harmony throughout europe an expanded nato will make the world safer simply because we are expanding the area where wars will not happen i think this will bind these countries closer together and ensure stability throughout the continent cr 19 march 1998 s2250 senator richard lugar r indiana agreed what is at stake here and now is order and stability in europe as whole and that is why american interests are involved cr 27 march 1998 s3617 senator john kerry d massachusetts said that nato membership would heighten the sense of securitywithin those three countries not only through the extension of natos militaryguarantee but also through the psychological benefits of being member of the nato club and interactions within the allia nce will clearly help to strengthen the new democracies and their abilities to assimilate themselves into europe botheconomically and politically and obviously militarily within natos integratedforce structure cr 30 april 1998 s3848 many senators cited the historical ties between european stability and american security and promoted nato enlargement as way to maintain usengagement in europe senator william roth spoke about this link the vote before the senate is about americas role in europe and the ability of the transatlantic community to respond to challenges of thefuture both of which hinge on whether the united states wishes toremain european power and whether we desire unified democraticand larger europe to remain linked to america throughout its history europe has been landscape of many insecure small powers fewimperialistic great powers and too many conflicting nationalist policieseach creating friction with the other twice in this century thesedynamics pulled america into wars on the european continent and thepotential for them to create conflict in the future is all too real unless weseize opportunities like the one before us as czech republicpresident vaclav havel put it if th west does not stabilize the east the east will destabilize the west every time america has withdrawn its influence from europe trouble has fo llowed this we cannot afford cr 17 march 1998 s2111 senator joseph biden offered similar thoughts saying for political economic strategic and cultural reasons europe remain s an area of vital interest to the united states of america we are european power and for our own safetys sake in my view we must remain european power stability on that continent is fundamental to the wellbeing of our country cr 18 march 1998 s2176 senator dianne feinstein dcalifornia viewed us commitment to nato enlargement as asmall price to pay to avoid being drawn into another european war she said it hasoften been said that vigilance is the price of freedom nato remains form ofvigilance cr 19 march 1998 s2256 enlargement was linked to natos ongoing transition from purely collective defense alliance to one with broader age nda for action senator kerry said the three applicants membership will nhance stability in central europe and strengthen nato itself through the acquisition of additional forces and personnelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98669crs14 to cope with future threats and missions cr 30 april 1998 s3848 senator barbara mikulski dmaryland delineated some of these new threats we have civil wars we have hot spots caused by ethnic and regional tensions we have international crime drugs and terrorism and we havethe very real threat of the spread of weapons of mass destruction nato must meet the needs of these new threats and i believe it will do so bychanging and expanding europes new democracies will help us meetthese challenges these new democracies will contribute to americassecurity by making nato stronger they are adding troops andequipment they will provide add itional strategic depth to nato cr 18 march 1998 s2196 s2197 opponents the senators arguing against nato enlargement were joined by several of their colleagues who favored enlargement in general but expressedconcerns about enlargements affect on stability and security this group worriedthat admitting the czech republic hungary and poland to the alliance would createunnecessary instability in an already volatile eastern european curity environment several senators were concerned that enlargement would replace europes old iron curtain dividing line with new one further east senator patrick leahy d vermont asked would enlargement result in more united and secure europe more united probably yes but what if expansion does not extend to the republics of the former soviet union or even to certain other eastern european countries then we have simply created new di viding line between those inside nato and those that are excluded cr 30 april 1998 s3858 senator wellstone argued that rather than bringing the nations of europe closer together as many supportersclaimed it would nato expansion would re create dividing line in europe only further to the east than the original cold war dividing line and i do not consider thatto be progress for the world cr 19 march 1998 s2257 many of the concerns of senators opposed to enlargement focused on the wests relationship with russia these cerns are dealt with in detail in separate section of this report but some aspects of the debate may be mentioned here as well senator bob smith said i cannot imagine worse longterm strategy foreuropean security than jeopardizing united statesrussian relations cr 17 march 1998 s2108 the deteriorating state of the russian nuclear arsenal was at theforefront of several senators minds during the debate in his previously citedaddress to meeting of the associated press senator moynihan said allow to suggest that wandering in this void we ma stumble into the catastrophe of nuclear war with russia this would come bout not from russian strength but from russian weakness this is an idea we find difficult to absorb and understandably sobut we had better do russians have been trying to tell us this cr 27 april 1998 s3613 senator moynihan also entered into the record letter from former ambassador paul nitze the openended expansion being proposed for the alliance points toward increasing friction with postcommunist russia for years to come driving russia into corner play s into the arguments of those most hostile to forging productive relationship with the ited states and its allies it is not ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98669crs15 sound basis for future stability in europe particularly when current or projected threats warrant extending the alliance cr 27 april 1998 s3611 senator bingaman although supporter of the final resolution thought that other national security problems should have higher priority than natoenlargement the question of whether we admit poland hungary and the czech republic to nato needs to be judged in the overall context of oursecurity needs in this postcold war period new threats dominate ournational security agenda they are the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction terrorism and regional instability created by rogue states the specter of accidental nuclear launch and other high priority militarythreats those are the immediate s ecurity concerns we have it does not strike that enlarging nato is likel to help us meet those threats i am concerned that this nearsighted emphasis on nato enlargementmay increase rather than decrease our thr eat to security interest in europe at best nato enlargement is distraction in that it diverts our attentionfrom other higher priority concerns nd alternative solutions and at worst it could undermine our ability to addre ss these more immediate threats cr 27 april 1998 s3630 senator leahy ratification opponent c onceded that nato would probably not suffer it might even benefit from the proposed round of expansion he worriedhowever that the current round would create pressure for future enlargements the prospect of such pressure concerned him because he believed that adding all of the proposed twelve new participants to the alliances system of consensus amongmembers would make nato unwieldy even less decisive and weakened thereby reducing european stability cr 30 april 1998 s3858 moral responsibility historical injustices most of the debate in the senate focused on the strategic and policy implications of nato enlargement several senators advocating the accession ofthe czech republic hungary and poland suggested that the united states had aresponsibility as the principal defender of democracy in the world and as keyplayer in deciding the structure of the pos tworld war ii world to admit these three nations to the alliance several senato rs made specific references to the ties between the people of united states and the populations of the three candidate states opponents of nato enlargement generally chose to concentrate on some of the less emotional issues of accession instead of moral responsibility but some senators did express concern for the candidate nations that were left out of this round ofenlargement and for russia senator john warner said i do believe this replacessymbolically the iron curtain that was established in the late forties which facedwest with now an iron ring of na tions that face east to russia cr 19 march 1998 s2271 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98669crs16 moral responsibility having fashioned itself as bastion of freedom during the period of oppression of central and eastern europe by nazi and communistregimes some senators viewed enlargement as way in which the united statescould fulfill the rhetorical promises made to these oppressed countries senator carllevin argued that if the senate were to reject enlargement we will be effectivelydimming the flame of liberty that sustained these courageous peoples throughdecades of first nazi and then communist darkness cr 30 april 1998 s3814 senator john mccain said protecting freedom was the beacon of our policy ineurope during the cold war it would be an incomprehensible tragedy for us toabandon that stance now when the opportunitie s for freedom in central europe are greater than ever and the risks are far wer than at any time during the cold war cr 18 march 1998 s2199 senator gordon sm ith spoke of the american dream in america we often talk about the american dream but really it isnt americas dream it is human dream it is dream that all people aspireto it is just that we enjoy it in great abundance life liberty and thepursuit of happiness and we must c ontinue to defend it in the world for our sakes not just for theirs cr 19 march 1998 s2260 senator joseph lieberman dconnecticut vi ewed enlargement as an extension of the original purpose of the nato alliance which he described as military alliance in defense of principle he asked his fellow senators will we now turnour backs on the czech republic hungary and poland and the principle the ideathe value of freedom that motivated us throughout the cold war and motivates them today i hope not i do not think so i do not believe we will cr 27 april 1998 s3625 historical injustices the circumstances of the coerced inclusion of the czech republic hungary and poland in the comm unist bloc at the end of the second world war often was cited in the argumen ts made by proponents of accession the big three conference at yalta in 1945 was widely viewed as the moment at which central and eastern europe were lost to communist domination but perceptions of blame differed among senators some faulted soviet leader josef stalin while others said that these conquered nations were sold out by the west senator mccain espoused the first view let us be clear these countries were forced into communism against their will by an occupying power while theunited states and nato staunchly defende d freedom in the west we could do little in the east other than offer our moral s upport because the risk of nuclear war was too great cr 18 march 1998 s2198 senator sm ith of oregon said i suggest one of many reasons that we should expand nato is that we have moralobligation to live up to the terms that were made at yalta but went unfulfilled cr 19 march 1998 s2260 other senators chose to focus on the mistakes made by the west following world war ii senator helms spoke about what he perceived as the wests mistakesat yalta half of the 20 th century ago poland hungary and the czech republic were consigned to communist domination because of expedient and shorthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98669crs17 6the tally of votes can be found in the congressional record of april 30 1998 p s3844 the text of the amendment can be found in appendix 4sighted policies of the west in approving this resolution the senate has the opportunity to remedy this historical injustice of yalta by acceptingpoland hungary and the czech republic into nato we reconnect themto the democratic west union that was severed by first hitler thenstalin cr 17 march 1998 s2106s2107 senator barbara mikulski dmaryland mentioned her own polish heritage and said i know that the polish people did not c hoose to live behind the iron curtain they were forced there by the yalta agreement by potsdam and because they and thebaltic states and the other captive nations were sold out by the free world cr 18 march 1998 s2196 mandated pause senator john warner sponsored an amendment to the resolution of ratification 2322 which would have mandated three year pause to considering additionalstates for membership after the accession of the czech republic hungary andpoland to the alliance this amendment garnered more support than others proposedby opponents to nato enlargement but it wa s rejected by vote of 59 nays to 41 yeas 6 arguments in favor those senators in favor of mandating three year pause after the current round of enlargem ent centered their argument around some uncertainties involved in the current round of accession the cost of enlargement and the difficulty of integrating the new mbers militaries into the nato command structure the current state of natos st rategic concept and the pressure future presidents may face to enlarge the alliance further senator warner based much of his argument on the presupposition that the protocols of accession would at the end of the day be approved by the senate he proposed three year pause as period of time during which the costs and challengesof the first round of enlargement could be an alyzed he declared that he offered the amendment because we dont know what the costs are of this first round wedont know how quickly these three new nati ons can bring themselves up in terms of military interoperability with nato forces today and how long it will takethem to be positive full partner with nat and not what i would regard as user of nato security cr 19 march 1998 s2272 senator byron dorgan d north dakota concurred saying lets wait for three years before we admit anymore nations into nato lets pause and tr to understand what all of this will cost what exactly is the threat and what our response should be cr 30 april 1998 s3835 senator warner later went on to say i say to my colleagues think of theamerican taxpayer we do not have firm estimate of the costs and therefore in all probability there will be an expense to the american taxpayer associated withincluding these three countries cr 30 april 1998 s3844httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98669crs18 senator warner also noted that nato will not approve an updated strategic concept until the 1999 washington summit he and other senators critical of the timing of enlargement argued that natos guiding strategic document shouldlogically first be agreed upon with enlargement to follow senator warner said we are also asked to approve this measure without full knowledge as to the strategic concept of what nato is and is not going to do in the years to come we are operating under 1991 doctrine today ironically itis not until the summit at which these three nations will be admittedwhen nato will finalize the doctrine for the future i ask you is thatthe way to do business not in my judgment and that is why i say if three are reality then we shoul d stop and study reasonable period of time let another president let the american people have carefulexamination of what nato brings fort h year from today as to the new mission and adoption cr 30 april 1998 s3827s3828 senator warner believed that the current round of accession would create pressure for the united states and othe r nato governments to move quickly toward another period of enlargement he argued that by mandating three year pausebefore the next round of accession his amendment would alleviate this pressure andallow for careful analysis of issues of enlargement he said i think the next president should be given the opportunity to assess the merits and such disadvantages as may arise by virtue of the accession of three more nations before we leap forward under pressure which will be unrelenting that pressure will begin th day 1 year from now when these three nations will be accessed the march will begin to bring in othernations perhaps numbering as many as nine i say to my colleaguesshould not the next president be give n the opportunity to study the record make an assessment and then give his advice or her advice to thepeople of the united states cr 30 april 1998 s3827 arguments in opposition supporters of the accession of the czech republic hungary and poland most of whom opposed senator warners amendment argued that mandating three year pause was both unnecessary and impractical senator biden tried to reassure those nators advocating pause that the first round of enlargement would not instigate flood of new alliance members he declared there is urgency to move to the next round and offered his ownopinion that we should say that there w ill be second round until all these three nations are fully integrated into natos integrated command structure using parenting analogy to make his point senato r biden said lets not argue about what college our daughter is going to when she is only two years old cr 18 march 1998 s2186 senator john mccain argued that mandated pause was scarcelynecessary given there will be facto pa use as the alliance absorbs the first round of new members cr 18 march 1998 s2202 in response to senator warners contenti on that three year pause would shield future president from pressure for second round opponents of the amendmentcontended that the measure instead would tie our own hands and those of futurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98669crs19 president cr 18 march 1998 s2202 senator ch arles robb dvirginia argued that legislating required pause would lim it the options of future administrations critical national decisions based on carefully reasoned and supported judgements are subjugated to an artific ial time line that could actually end up proving harmful to our military interest s we need to be flexible rather than arbitrary about future entrants into nato if the first round goeswell the partnership for peace program will keep the door open for newmembers present and future security considerations will then dictate thepace and scope of enlargement cr 30 april 1998 s3837 senator roth declared that nato enlargement is driven by moral imperatives strategic selfinterest and objective criteria concerning military readiness andpolitical and economic reform he said any proposal to freeze enlargement subordinates these factors to an arbitrary timeline cr 30 april 1998 s3839 several senators stated that the amendm ent would contravene article 10 of the north atlantic treaty which states that membership is open to any othereuropean state in position to further the pr inciples of this treaty and to contribute to the security of the north atlantic ar ea thereby removing an incentive for other european nations to prepare for nato accession senator roth said that theamendment would send dangerous message to the reformist governments ofcentral europe they would suppose and not incorrectly that the united statesis slamming the door shut concerning their possible accession into the alliancecr 30 april 1998 s3839 senator spencer abraham rmichigan said that mandating three year pause would send exactly the wrong signal at this criticalpoint in history and will only lead to further feelings of abandonment and exclusion by nations wanting to join the west cr 30 april 1998 s3836 lastly opponents of the amendment worried that requiring pause before the next round of enlargement would further strain already tenuous relations with thenations of central and eastern europe nd strengthen nationalist forces in russia senator richard lugar rindiana praised natos opendoor entrance policy to retract the opendoor policy would risk undermining tremendous gains that have been made for peace throughout the region the result ofa closeddoor policy would be the cr eation of new dividing lines across europe those nations outside might become disillusioned and insecure and thus inclined to adopt the competitive and destabilizing securitypolicies of europes past cr 27 april 1998 s3618 senator roth expressed concerns about russia saying an arbitrary freeze on nato enlargement would harm russias hi storic reconciliation with nato and the united states freeze would appear to gi ve moscow veto over enlargement it certainly would be interpreted as vi ctory by those who still advocate russian sphere of influence cr 30 april 1998 s3839httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98669crs20 linking nato and european union membership opponents of enlargement argued during the senates debate that the czech republic hungary and poland should not be admitted to the alliance until theyhave secured membership in the european union eu this position was taken bysenators moynihan and warner who cosponsored an amendment to the protocolsof accession stipulating such natoeu link advocates of enlargement counteredthat making prior eu membership c ondition for nato membership was unwise given the differing missions of the two organi zations and the relevant interests of the united states arguments in favor senator moynihan the amendments lead sponsor argued that the risks of nato enlargement specifically involving russia outweigh the costs ambassador richard holbrooke said what because brussels wont expand the european union nato expansion must fill void is it fillinga void because they cannot agree on common agricultural policy ineurope so filling void to bring back the prospect of nuclear war is that worth it give them access to global market they have never beenallowed into give them common ag ricultural policy that will give their farmers living this is what th ey deserve poland has had enough in this 20 th century we do not want another period of hostilities that could lead not just to war but to annihilation cr 27 april 1998 s3616s3617 senator wellstone buttressed senator moynihans argument with the contention that many of the declared goals of nato expansion democracy stability openmarkets could be achieved by pressuring the european union to admit the newly democratic states of eastern europe he said the european union that is where we should be using our leverage as na tion expand the european union that is about markets that is about democracy cr 27 april 1998 s3616 senator warner focused on the costs invol ved in the integration into the nato command of the militaries of the czech republic hungary and poland he cited the wide divergence among the various estimates of these costs and argued that eumembership would be signal that the three countries economies are prepared tohandle the economic burdens of nato membership there is blank check involved in these votes today eu membership would be way to evaluate the economic ability of these three countriesto meet their financial obligations to nato should those financialobligations fall short guess who is going to pick it up the unitedstates of america in participation with nations and other countries byvirtue of the eu giving their imprimatur on these countries will be furtherassurance that they will have econom ic productivity and the like to generate the dollars to meet their requirements to pay the bill to upgradetheir militaries all of that is going to be very very hefty bill i would like

senators concentrated on the contrastingmissions of the two entities and on what t ype of voice the united states would have if link between nato and eu accession were to be established senator roth spoke about the proposed natoeu link he began by mentioning key difference between nato military alliance and the european union the eu is strictly politicaleconomic organization of which the unitedstates is not member and has say he agreed that eu enlargement is highlydesirable and noted that the resolution of ratification before the senate stated thatthe official policy of the united states is to encourage eu enlargement themoynihan amendment senator roth argued is inconsistent with the washingtontreaty article 10 of the treaty states th at membership in nato is open to any european state in position to further the pr inciples of this treaty and to contribute to the security of the north atlantic ar ea senator roth pointed out that five current natomember nations the unite d states canada iceland norway and turkey are not members of the eu are they any less effective members of the alliance because they are not part of the eu he asked the answer is unambiguously requiring eu memb ership of natocandidate countries would create an artificial second tier for noneu countries he argued norway has in fact chosen not to join the eu base d on an assessment of its own interests as could the czech republic hungary and pola nd even if they were to be invited according to senator roth requiring them to join would create an arbitrary standard that is not necessarily reflec tion of nato aspirants state of economic and political wellbeing cr 30 april 1998 s3825 several senators objected to the prospect of basing nato accession on membership in an organization of which th united states is not member senator biden called it sheer folly and asked why would we want to place such keyelement of our national security decisionmak ing in the hands of the european union an organization to which we do not belong cr 30 april 1998 s3825 senator gordon smith said the european uni on may be many things but it is certainly not substitute for us leadership in europe cr 30 april 1998 s3822 senator roth spoke on this issue as well by conditioning nato membership on attainment of eu membership this amendment would strip the allian ce of control over its own future specifically its decisions over future membership and transfer it over tothe european union the eu is not transatlantic organization it has effective security or defense capability or policy for that matter do wereally want the eu to have such significant influence over nato cr 30 april 1998 s3825 senator roth closed his remarks by summarizing the arguments of those opposed to the amendment in one
