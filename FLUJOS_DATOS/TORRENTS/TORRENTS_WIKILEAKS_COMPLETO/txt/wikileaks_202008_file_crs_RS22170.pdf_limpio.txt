feder legislative attorneys american law division summary this report discusses smith v city of jackson recent case in which the supreme court held that workers may sue em ployers under the age discrimination in employment act adea for workplace policies that have an adverse impact on older employees even if the discriminatory effects are not intentional in march 2005 the supreme court issued its decision in smith v city of jackson 1 case that involved questions about the scope of protection that older workers are entitled to under the age discrimination in employment act adea2 in 53 ruling the court held that the adea authorizes disparate impact claims which means that older workers may sue employers for policies that have discriminatory effect even if the employer did not intend to discriminate this report provides description of the smith case along with background information on the adea and discussion of the disparate impact and disparate treatment theories of liability under civil rights laws the adea and disparate impact claims enacted in 1967 the adea is designed to protect individuals who are age 40 or older from discrimination on the job finding that older employees are often at disadvantage in the workplace congress made it unlawful for employers to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation terms c onditions or privileges of employment because of such individuals age or to limit segregate or classify his employees in any way which would deprive

1977otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee because of such individuals age3 the statute however contains an exception under which employers are allowed to engage in action that would otherwise be unlawfu l where age is bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business or where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age4 the latter exception appears to reflect the belief that age unlike other classifications such as race or gender may be relevant to an individuals ability to perform certain jobs two basic methods have judi cially evolved for proving unlawful discrimination in employment disparate treatment and disparate impact in general disparate treatment involves intentionally discr iminating against an individua l for an impermissible reason such intentional discr imination is prohibited on the basis of race color sex religion or national origin under title vii of the civil rights act of 19645 on the basis of age under the adea or on the basis of disability under the americans with disabilities act6 furthermore disparate treatment claims re quire proof that the employer intended to discriminate against the complaining part when it took the challenged employment action intent the critical elem ent of disparate treatment claim may be shown directly eg by discriminatory statemen ts or behavior of supervis or towards subordinate or perhaps more likely by circumstantial evidence unlike disparate treatment disparate impact discrimination does not involve different treatment or an intent to discriminate rather disparate impact discrimination arises when neutral policy or practice s an adverse impact on protected group and that policy or practice is not job related or business nece ssity indeed disparate impact claims may be established w ithout proof of discriminatory intent relieving the victim of an often insurmountable burden the ultimate burden rests with the employer to prove business necessity for any such disparity disparate impact is not mentioned in the text or legislative history of the adea nor of title vii as originally enacted but is creature of judicial interpretation the concept first emerged from the supreme courts ruling in griggs v duke power co7 in griggs black workers argued that the employ ers use of high school diploma requirement and general intelligence tests for entry into laborer positions violated title vii because those requirements had an adve rse impact on blacks and were not reasonably related to successful job performance underlying griggs was the courts determination that criteria unrelated to job performance not be allowed to freeze the effects of past discrimination or act as builtin headwinds to

unrelated to job pe rformance or business necessity9 in dictum to the courts opinion in hazen paper co v biggins10 disparate treatment adea case justice oconnor wrot for unanimous court that congress passed the adea out of concern that older wo rkers were being depr ived of employment on the basis of inaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes11 hence she argued the adea does not apply in instances where the employment decision is wholly motivated by factors other than age even if the motivating factor is correlated with age12 in his concurring opinion justice kennedy cast furt her uncertainty on the application of the disparate impact theory to age discrimination cases by declaring that nothing in the courts opinion should be read as incorpor ating in the adea context the socalled disparate impact theory 13 the court expressly reserv ed judgment on the question of whether disparate impact theory of liability is available under the adea14 and it was that question that was later at issue in the smith case the supreme court decision in smith v city of jackson in the smith case the city of jackson mississippi approved plan to grant wage increases to all city employees the plan which was intended in part to attract and retain qualified employees was subsequently modified with respect to police officers and other public safety officers according to the city the amended plan was designed to raise the starting salaries of police officers up to the regional average under the new plan officers with less than five years of tenure received proportionally higher wage increases than officers with greater seniority since most officers over the age of 40 had greater than five years of tenure the raises they received were less generous than the raises received by their younger colleagues and these older officers sued under the adea claiming both that the city intentionally discriminated against them on the basis of age the disparate treatment claim and that they were adversely affected by the plan because of their agehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22170crs4 15 smith v city of jackson 125 s ct 1536 031160 2005 us lexis 2931 57 march 30 2005 16 id at 8 17 42 usc 2000e2 18

of appeals for the fifth circuit ruled against the employees the central issue in the supreme court appeal was whether the pay plan could be challenged due to its disparate impact ultimately the court held that the adea does authorize recovery in disparate impact cases but nevertheless ruled that petitioners have not set forth valid disparate impact claim with respect to their suit against the citys new salary plan16 although five justices agreed that the adea permits disparate impact claims they did so on different grounds plurality of four justices led by justice stevens based its decision on the text of the adea to reach its decision the plura lity turned to previous cases in which the court had interpreted statutory language in title vii that was virtually identical to the statutory language at issue in the adea the plurality noted that the language of title vii which makes it unlawful for an employer to limit segregate or classify his employees in any way which would depriv or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or ot herwise adversely affect hi s status as an employee because of such individuals race colo r religion sex or national origin17 is identical to the adea language except that the adea which was modeled after title vii substitutes the word age for the words race color religion sex or national origin18 according to the plurality when congress uses the same language in two statutes having similar purposes particularly when one is enacted shortly after the other it is appropriate to presume that congress intended that text to have the same meaning in both statutes19 the plurality thus turned to its decision in griggs 20 which recognized unintentional disparate impact discrimination as form of bias covered by title vii because both title vii and the adea target em ployment practices th at adversely affect an employees status based on race or age nd because title vii s been interpreted to authorize disparate impact claims the plurality concluded that the identical provisions in the adea also permit disparate impact claims21 notably the plurality focused on statutory text stating that an employer may not take employment actions that adversely affect an employees status because of such individuals age22 this provision was found to allow disparate impact claims and was not overridden as justice oconnor urged in her concurring opinion by the adeas exception for employer conduct based on reas onable factors other than age rfoa23 in justice oconnors view the rfoa provi sion expresses congress clear intentionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22170crs5 24 smith 2005 us lexis 2931 at 40 25 id at 2021 26 id at 27 27 see wards cove packing co v antonio 490 us 642 1989 civil rights act of 1991 as codified at

support in the rfoa for disparate impact recovery on the theory that the provision was largely redundant as applied to intentional age di scrimination which n ecessarily requires pr oof of agerelated motivation the plurality also noted that the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc which is responsible for administering the adea has long interpreted the statute to authorize recovery in disparate impact cases25 since courts generally defer to an agencys interpretation of the statutes it administers the eeocs regulations provided additional support for the courts conclusi on that the adea permits disparate impact claims justice scalia who concurred on the grounds that the eeocs interpretation was entitled to deference provided the fifth vote in support of the courts ruling that the adea permits disparate impact claims26 despite the fact that plurality of the court held in smith that the adea allowed for disparate impact claims the court unanimously ruled that the older workers in the case before them had failed to prove their claim significantly for employers the court found that this type of claim under the adea is narrower and thus easier to defend than it is under title vii under an earlier ruling that made it more difficult to use disparate impact which congress later changed for title vii but not for the adea older workers had to specifically identify the test requirement or practice that had the adverse impact27 in smith justice stevens noted the petitioners did little more than identify pay plan that was less generous to older workers than to younger workers the failure to isolate and identify specific aspects of the policy responsib for statistical disparities and the fact that the citys plan was based on reasonable factors other than age that is need to make junior positions more financially competitive with comparable positions in the marketplace proved fatal to the older officers claim the remaining three justices led by jus tice oconnor concurred with the judgment to deny relief to the older police officers as noted above however they disagreed with the courts reasoning and would have rule d instead that the adea did not authorize disparate impact claims specifically they argued that the adeas statutory text and legislative history demonstrat that congress did not intend to authorize recovery in disparate impact cases and that the differences between the adea and title vii especially the adeas rfoa provision should preclude the court from relying on its title vii cases to interpret the adea28httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22170crs6 29 business necessity is also an available defense under the adea but employers who are charged with age discrimination are more likely to rely on the rfoa defense since it is generally much easier for an employer to establish that workplace policy is reasonable as opposed to necessaryconclusion disparate treatment or intent may be difficult to establish in adea cases since overt animus based on age is not usua lly apparent rarely are em ployers so imprudent as to announce to employees that they are too old to be productive rather the issue typically arises when an employer relies on agecorre lative factors such as seniority pension eligibility and salary tied to longevity or medicare eligibility as the basis for decisions adversely affecting older workers disparate impact analysis permits the courts to examine the effects of policies and practices to determine whether they are illegally discriminatory in smith the court allowed older workers to file age discrimination claims against their employers on the basis of disparate impact which is generally easier to prove than discriminatory treatment as importantly however the decision provided employers with legal weapons to defend against such actions under smith if the adverse impact of the employers decision is attributable to reasonable nonage factor th ere is liability unlike title vii the adea permits employment decisions that w ould otherwise be prohibited where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age nor does the adea like title vii require employers to demonstrate business necessity29 thus even if the plaintiff demonstrates that particular employment policy or practice adversely affects older workers the employer as in smith may readily defend the action by showing that the practice is based on reasonable nonage factor so while the smith ruling may lead to an increase in age discrimination lawsuits the outl ook for success by older workers remains uncertain employers will likely be able to avoid liability and even trial through summary judgment provided only that the policies they adopt are founded on factors other than age and are not unreasonable
