levels of case lecture given on 13 june 1963 and what is this audience thirteenth of june oh unlucky for you unlucky for you the 13th pretty grim june 13th ad 13 saint hill special briefing course and you dont need any information you got all the information getting along very well getting along just swell just tied in knots you know which way youre going as long as you dont have to go in any direction time track is as straight as ball of yarn that cats been at got the cases on the scale absolutely peggedthere somewhere im being sarcastic now shouldnt be in one of these sarcastic moods actually weve got it licked weve got it licked we even have your case licked you know thats fantastic see but having it licked is problem in good rendition as far as technical is concerned and i ought to give you direct rundown right now of where we are at technically i think thatd be very good idea the operative processes are exactly six in number there are six types of processes thats the ruddy lot if there are any more kinds of processes i havent run into them in quarter of century of very hard inspection of it all and if there are any ive probably found them and thrown them in an ashcan as unworkable or unlearnable there have been all kinds of developments of various sorts i read one the other day from the california association of dianetic auditors that gave an auditing session and the way you audit someone and the auditor puts on the teakettle and says to the preclear so on well i personally wouldnt think that was very workable itthey evidently wander about and they dont talk about cases or anything nasty like that and thats an auditing session so there have been lots of developments of one kind or another you think im joking you know i really ought to dig out the paper and show it to you i read it and i said is this gag you know it wasnt any gag it was very serious now thehow far people can go to keep from confronting anything that resembles case or bank is how many developments there can be under the heading of mental activity or research and this is almost limitless almost limitless but in the years that have gone along there have been certain things that worked and certain things that didnt work and the direct processing of postulates is not included in this particular rundown but remember that you sometimes very spottily can produce some rather interesting results with old rising scale processing so there are lots of subdivisions of processes there are lots of processes that we have had but what its actually boiled down to for the working kit of an auditor and which gives the auditor direct and positive results and which gives an auditor an invaluable alignment is the scale of case levels which you received under programing there are eight levels there which i wont take up at the present moment but this six processes happens to cover those levels and theyre the only things i know of over long period of time which make dent in these levels and carry them forward to an upper level all of these processes are known their technology is known how you do them is known and so on so it actually doesnt pose very great problem but how well they are known and how reliably they are executed does pose problem now we will work up and developregs been going around today shoving pieces of paper and questions at people and were actually working up here how do you tell where the pc is in order to run what on him in other words we havedevelopingwere developing old dianometry now forward to point where you can get an immediate adjudication of what you ought to do with case by just giving the case series of tests now thats getting very fancy indeed now lackinglacking this data you still can simply go up or fall back to the pcs level you see just with hit ormiss process or error so long as you know case level and so long as you know the processes that measure them so exactly how we judge whether or not the case should have this process or not is only briefly part of this lecture the rundown of processes is very definite part of it now ill give you rundown of thisof this scale so that youll have it by numbers and youll be getting it in bulletin if you havent got it already but what you call level i is ot and thats time track nothing hes just got potential and action and doingness and capability and he isnt carrying mental record of any kind whatsoever and 2 has total time track with nothing aberrative on it which is highly theoretical state if anybody could maintain it or achieve it i would like to know about it but thats theoretical state you see frankly you will get in actual fact at level 2 parts of the time track missing and those parts that are there still under handling thats reallyits not an absolute level level is absolute on this whole thing because you can even raise level 1 now quite interesting yes you can raise the level of an ot guy hasnt got enough sense to stay out of theta traps you can say well its this way bud this is the way you handle theta trap and hell say all right thats good thats good idea get the idea all right he also doesnt know how to maintain game so that he actually will deteriorate himself down to level of where he can have game see he tries not to remain in state where he cant have any game or communication or association see so in absence of knowing how to put together game he also is remiss see so the only thing you reallythat youve got is just practice and education at level 1 thats your process but that isnt one of the processes which is measured up here two as i say well thats theoretically perfect time track and of course thats unobtainable that time track long before it becomes perfect will fold up but we still have theoretical level there and once moreonce more were already working on it to separate the time track from the person and get him over the idea of doing this and that all comes under the handling of engrams or facsimiles and youve got the process for that in just blocking out facsimiles see hell discover all if you just continue to run that process so thats covered with special process and now youve got 3 which is visible time track but quite aberrated lots of engrams on it and so forth in other words its not dub but he can see his time track when it is there to be seen and youve got that in engram running by chains and blocking that sort of thing out now that process engram running by chains is precise activity the only thing i would improve in it is spotting duration im having just little bit of trouble getting pcs to sit still long enough to get the duration of the incident spotted because the incident starts running off and ive been trying variousvarious places to try to get the duration of the incident ive tried to get it before i send him to the beginning of it and tried to get him at theonce ive run it through once and so forth and i dont know quite the perfect place to get that at this particular time rather than badger the pc whywith it and cause the pc to suppress the whole incident all the time id omit it rather than do that or maybe itll turn up as flash answer or maybe you send him through it once and say how long was it but that little point is the only point i know of that isnt settled in that rundown the rest of its working well extremely well all right thats level 3 and of course thats somebody who can see the time track as it is and who can run it and who can run engrams and then you have level 4 and your level 4 is for any reason whatsoever its just an occluded time track thats yourthe famous black five case its thealso the case with an invisible field its also the case with little wirkwuks and wukwuks now cases below this level on harmonic down at 7 and 8 also have invisible fields and black fields so you can be fooled at this just because somebodys got black field is reason he really is level 4 dont you see now its whether or not you can run an engram on this person and oddly enough you can do just that we had somebody here the other day hes been black five never seen picture never had sonicnever had visionever had anythingall gone missingwent threw him into the middle of the helatrobus implants the goal to forget hes run with full sonic visio and everything else see bang in other words there isthere is real level 4 see now what process do you have for this well actually just engram blocking out and 3n and they overlap at that point see you could run either on these now you can also run 3n on level 3 so now lets drop little bit lower here and lets get level 5 and dubin well now dubin is runningyou start running 3n on dubin case in one minute why theyreone minute why theyre rocket reading and the next minute theyre not and youre fumbling around and theyre getting restimulated and you cant keep your fingers on it and aaaaaaaahhthe next thing you know the case is all tying up in knots and you would be much better off to have done repetitive process in the first place now the repetitive processesarethe leading repetitive processes are three in number and you havent heard of one of them but just call them repetitive processes the one that you are using and is the best and most powerful of these is the threequestion process arc break straightwire given one question at time that as repetitive process iscarries all before it now theres two other repetitive processes though which are very interesting and one of those is duplication all by itself what would you be unwilling to duplicate and theres another one power of choice just per which also has considerable power in auditing when has your power of choice been overthrown interesting type process now thats whole basket load there now if you are going to dogoing to throw in rising scale processing it probably would belong there but in actual factin actual fact its level i process or most any process if it works and if it doesnt work and theres lot of stuff connected with it because what are you doing youre actually flipping the postulate out of the mass consistently with this thing and although you can achieve considerable changes in the pc by doing this you actually dont achieve case gain so lets take look at the difference between process that produces change in the pc or produces an effect on the pc and one which advances the case level see lets differentiate between these two things right here and now i know lot of processes which will produce change in the pc engram running is one of them itll produce change in the pc but will not upgrade the pcs case level now that sounds like an interesting thing well in actual fact what youre doing is using the power of the process to rather overwhelm the resistances of the pc and you can change the pc you can alter the pc around you can get rid of various things the pc doesnt want and that sort of thing but does the pc ever find out youve gotten rid of them now youve heard speak of this type of case in response before the old lady has arthritis and you run bunch of stuff on the old lady and she all of sudden doesnt have arthritis anymore and she doesnt mention this at all she just natters at you about her migraine headaches now you havent really produced change in this persons attitude toward life you havent improved this persons reality or confront you havent but youve changed the case and an auditor should realize that its within his power to do that and that only happens when you run process for higherlevel case on lowerlevel case you can change the case without improving the level of the case now you must know that that can happen in other words your object is to move person up this reality scale toward ot thats your object not just to make this person more comfortable or with less somatics or something so they hurt so what its the most weird thing in the world to have thei dont know idthere are some ladies present im sure some of these gentlemen have been ladies in the pastand i really cant call the name of this government department in printable english you see but it actually is assaulting us for doing something which ive been saying and weve been agreeing for very long time we shouldnt do which is treat people and heal people you know and make big thing out of sickness and health and all of this sort of thing and theyre all upset with us because we say were doing this but weve never said so for years ive been saying whatthe good of making somebodyyou know getting rid of somebodys wheeze whats wrong with him is him not his wheeze see ive been carrying on about this for some time and all of sudden theyre about to say whooa lets pull off this here ban because theyre getting in the road of the doctors and weve got to keep the doctors going otherwise we wont get our bribes im sorry ia little run away with myself there theyve got to live but we dont know why because frankly its pure idiocy to cure somebody of an illness this is idiocy they just go and get sick again you talk about thankless task its actually thankless endless does nothing for the society gains nothing for the individual or anything else to amount to anything this guys got an earache so you work like mad to get this guy to recover from this earache see and so you cure him from his earache well great day in the morning he has now not got an earache great how to raise society heroically onward and forward now if you cure his earache if youre foolish enough to cure his earache and work in justin direction but to cure his earache youre working exactly against his hidden standard and you arent really trying to remove the causes of having hidden standard so whats he going to do well next day hes got ulcers see well now if youre just looking for employment i mean if youve got medical school certificate or something and dont know what to do with it and you want to go on forever collecting thosei dont know it used to beit used to be two bucks and then it got to be five bucks and then the trade union got to work and it got to be ten bucks and five bucks extra for each shot you go in now you know that five bucks extra for each shot the nurse just sits there see and she writes down you see and shots shots shots pills pills pills shots pills pills pills two hundred and fiftyfive dollars yes thats the bill well if youre going toif this is commercial activity and solely and completely just to provide work for the works progress fellows so they can lean on their shovels yes by all means by all means overwhelm the pc with an upperlevel process and cure his earache but dont expect him or anybody else ever to thank you and you see your object is to advance the pc up this scale now therefore this puts severe limit on the number of processes that you can run on anybody see this tells you that you had better process the pc at his level on the reality scale with the process that belongs there and if you are not doing so you will know it at once because the pc is not making any signal progress as person now that progress is very steep today that progress used to be barely detectable from week to week see well its not now thatits steep grade and you dont see that steep grade happening you know at once what youre doing yes the pc is making gain now fortunately for us that gain is expressed by your tone arm youre not getting tone arm motion on the pc the usual thing that is wrong is is youre running pc at one level of the scale at higher level for the process thats it and youll notice youll be tricked by seeing that the pc gets well and does various other things but theyre not upgrading as pc see their general attitude toward existence and their communication level and that sort of thing this isnt improving see what the difference is here it takes thatit takes that knowledge right there to know how to apply the processes i am giving you all right now lets take this level 5 which is your dubin level he really never gets picture of anything that is really there the picture is always picture of picture well all right now that casethat case starts to get very very very critically run on your well engrams so they make copy of the time track as fast as you run it off dont you see this is like running on treadmill constantly because youre never erasing anything that is on the case youre only erasing copies of what is on the case and it wont give you any tone arm action but youre liable to do some interesting things by accident accidentally clip somatic out or something like that and that leaves you your repetitive processes and these repetitive processes are just tailormade for that case now oddly enough the repetitive processes also overlap into level 4 just above it so your processes then that are indicated for that particular case and so forth are very simple youve got your arc process or any other of these repetitive processes that are laid down theyre all the same band and youve got your level 5 and your level 4 all right thats fine now your arc process also handles level 3 cases that have been monkeyed up in auditing these repetitive processes you see cases that have been butchered up in auditing cases that are having bad run of it or cases which have turned on sudden chronic somatic of some kind or another that nobody can quite explain and were not getting to easily by the techniques we are using well you canthe guys case level isnt down chronically but has done skid and so we can build it back up with the repetitive processes which we have so theyre good it doesnt mean that because somebody is runwe have trouble with thisbecause somebody is run on repetitive process that hes automatically dubin case see thatll get around and so forth and it is not true now lets go one level down from that lets go to level 6 god help us all and that level is the dubin of dubin and theres nothing distinguishes this case from the dubin case except the degree of franticness which the case goes into and the amount of delusion which can turn on you see thats just more anaten so youre running long way away now what characterizes this case is the terrible automaticity of the bank this case has got fluttery bank you can never get that time track to stay still now this is not very numerous type of case but youll run into enough of them and theyll just drive you around the bend nothing bites to amount to anything because theyve got time track that is in constant motion that time trackflutter flutter flutter you try to say have you had breakfast and they get their last ten breakfasts only they arent their last ten breakfasts theyre copies of copies of their last ten breakfasts and duh they cant stay still the time track doesnt stay still they longer have the power of remaining motionless thats one thing that characterizes this case and if you called it not the dubin of dubin which is going but the case of the automatically moving time track theor thegrouped automatic time track or something like that youd probably have better diagnosis of the symptoms now theyeah you try to put themtry to put them in yesterday and they go into yesterday the day before next week you say all right whats happening here all right did you ever fall out of baby carriage this is an actual experience i had with one well yes trying to run straightwire on this person this is straightwire i mean just direct straightwire see did you ever fall out of baby carriage yesyes im sure i must have and all right you can recall that case instantly has ten fallings out of baby carriages at ten different times maybe to ten different babies try to run that case through any lineal line of engram like say now pick up the moment you walked in the door and they instantly pick up the last two or three months worth of doors and then few past life doors thrown in they give you copy of those things and so forth and they walk to plethora of chairs actually theyd have to come up through blackness before they actually saw their own time track but that automaticity of track is something that you sooner or later will run into dont let it break your heart you cant even run arc straightwire on the person actually see you cant ask them to recall anything now the probability is that arc break straightwire would function on this case one way or the other and cure him of an illness and all that sort of thing well you could be fooled what actually is this case doing this case is into an instability of bank an instability of beingness terror which amounts to constant motion expressed in the time track and so forth now that constant motion may express itself in other ways physically youits got goal you know they cant sit down in the chair i mean they cant live there they live in five different hotels in two weeks you see i mean its terrible itjust this awful urge to get out to not be there various other expressions and manifestations occur at this case level but the only way ive made it case level is not because it is terribly numerous but because its utterly baffling when you finally hit it you say recall breakfast and the person cant remember breakfast well thats all right but on higherlevel case you could keep plugging at them and they would finally remember breakfast see not on this case man if you push him at all theyve got all the breakfasts that anybody ate in london see theyve got everything i meanbrrrrbrawwbzzzzz it looks like fifteen or twenty different projectors shining on the same screen that case is nervous and that is cch case that is cch case remember that some processes of repetitive nature can reach down into this case and so forth but hes actually repetitive process tootoo far forward or too far from now theres something else that works on this case that would be quite interesting to you and that is see checking works on this case prepchecking to lesser degree works on the case but sec checking does general ow works like ball on that case every time they answer the question they get rrrrrrrr of pictures and so forth and they gradually will come out of it under general ow and you get beautiful tone arm motion with such case with general ow thats another type of process of course general ow is an excuse for prepchecking dont consider it repetitive process its just aits shotgun method of sec checking somebody now the overts you get off these people the overts you get off of them may be very feathery overts they give you on silver platterthey give you on silver platter the fact that they murdered their husband or something this doesnt mean anything this is nothing but you can find an overt you can find an overt and their level of overt is liable to be very feathery but it means great deal when you get it off they remember thinking hostile thought about their mother and gee it produces quite change on the case sec checking does work at this level you have to sweat like mad over it but they will sec check they ordinarily are sitting in guilt complex anyhow ow works and therefore you could say the only repetitive process which is at all successful on this particular case level is ow but that is sec check process and the cchs work on this case so that combination of those twoprobably get you there now youre getting down into easy stuff getting down into the easier stuff and you get your next level of case which is they can confront their own evaluations you would just be amazed how much interest and absorption and so forth they would get in mildly run cchs the mildly run cchs you know they do the process three times and its flat you see and you just coax them along with the cchs and youd be surprised man they can talk for hours about that book you know i mean theysomebody held up that book and they didnt really know whether or not it was they just go on with terrific absorption on the thing that doesnt mean that people who get absorbed in the cchs are all at this level of case but it does mean that this case can get interested in this because that stuff is awful dangerous see and the fact they can come that close to confronting something in present timeyouve passed you seeat the bottom rung of level 6 you have passed out of the case level that can run the bank they can longer run the bank the bank is not there to be run its unhandleable so youve got youryouve got your cchs there and you run down to your unawareness you dont have the cchs complete at level 8 you have only reach and withdraw now oddly enough the cchs reach and withdraw and so forth will also produce action on case levels above this theyll produce levels of action up to 6 or theyll produce levels of action up to level 5 all of these things but what im talking about is the narrow shot this would be about the only thing that can produce reaction on these lower levels quite interesting for instance you can run some cchslet give you difference of case levels you can run some cchs on level 3 and boy theyre just about as flat you see theyre just about as flat as an unrepaired road and they just got chuckholes all over them you know the guy never did really flatten give that hand he still had some cognitions on it and he was still comm lagging on the wall and he was still this and that and you drop him you see it never halts the progress of this case you could even go that far on level 5 and although it would be little more critical never to have flattened the cchs you see it still wouldnt destroy the case or the ability to run on repetitive processes but you leave the cchs unflat on level 7 and you have just parked them there to the end of time thats the only thing that can be flattened on them now level 8 as i say reach and withdraw is simply specialized mechanismany specialized mechanism if you want this case saywhatlets go into significance we say to this level 8 we say if we can say anything to them we say ifis it all right if i audit you and theyll say always yes because theyre usually very mannerly but boy thats as far as it went thats social conversation see now you say all right touch my right knee touch my left knee touch my right shoulder touch my left shoulder all right touch the end of my nose and they all of sudden draw back from you you know huaah huaah what are you doing who are you all they would say you see is it all right if i audit you oh yes youre sure theres nothing you dislike about dont dislike anything about you you go on like this for hours see produce reaction on this case at all see but just few touches there this is an emeter all right reach it withdraw from it they do this quite complacently all of sudden they begin to regard it with great caution and they begin to regard it with considerable hostility and they run the whole emotional tone scale on reaching and withdrawing from the back of an emeter now that case youll also find in coma in hospital and you take their hand and touch the sheet and take their hand and touch the blanket and take their hand and touch the sheet give them the commands each time and acknowledging and so forth they come out of their coma you can take some bird down here who has been concussed in an automobile accident for quite while and hes been intounconscious for eighteen days or something like that hell eventually pass in his checks you go in and you start that process of just touch and untouch reach and withdraw and if you keep this up its soits long and its arduous and so forth and remember that the same laws apply with the cchs the person gets the process flat they start to feeling theyve been punished if they continue to run the process so you have to take their other hand and flatten that dont you see and that case will come up to point where they can communicate with you and its quite spooky at firstyour hand something like thishave to be very careful what you promise them or say to them because theyre in quite an hypnotic state but you say all right now theyre dead out see they havent expressed anything to anybody for long time and you say all right now for yes squeeze my hand once and for squeeze it twice and put their hand around your fingers and ask them are you getting good treatment or do you feel all right or something like that and youll be startled youll get squeeze see they havent expressed themselves to anybody for days weeks maybe theyyou put them into rather easy communication and then they can go on to this signal theyll start coming out of thatthat by the way is just twoway comm it doesnt particularly do them any good except it puts them into communication with their environment to that degree you can go on running reach and withdraw and get some twoway comm this way with them next thing you know they come out of it well you say well thats very spectacular thats case in hospital and anybody can recognize case in hospital can you recognize somebody that you can never get out of boiloff i mean this case just boils off thats all see theyre quite rare in scientology but theyre not rare around in the world and if you sat them down and asked them question they would go into boiloff well youyou pull your missed withholds and theyll come out of it and you ask them another question and they go into boiloff and you pull your missed withholds and they come out of it and so forth and actually the process is working but the case is not coming up scale that case will only come up scale on reach and withdraw that case is just as much anaten sitting in that auditing chair as the guy in coma in hospital and you recognize some of these things about cases and you wont overestimate case in spite of the cases pride or something and get yourself hatful of loses well now this gives you rundown of the number of processes which we have with one exception and thats route i for level 1 and youve got old route i with some ramifications of one type or another and thats level 1 and that gives you six classes or types of processes which are valid over all these years ill run them off rapidly now for you they are therunning them from the bottom uplets run them from the bottom upis your reach and withdraw is your lowest level cch is your next level sec checking is your next level repetitive processes is your next level meaning arc break and all that your next level up from that is 3nimplants next level up from thats engram runningby chains and your next level up from thats route 1 and that gives you your sixsix types of process which are capable of improving case level now please understand that youre looking for something very special when youre looking for something that improves persons case level please understand that improves case level has nothing to do with healing has nothing to do with an assist has nothing to do with any of these other things now almost any case reactsalmost any case reacts to almost any of those processes quite remarkable but you can get reaction from case so therefore whether or not the case simply does the process or appears to do the process has nothing whatsoever to do with whether that case will advance the case level youre trying to promote this case from higher number to lower number on this caselevel scale thats what youre trying to do and if youreif youre using scientology for some other purpose such as get rid of peoples bunions oror something like that recognize at once that almost any usage of it follows throughwell what is an assist but reach and withdraw see thats underthats the class of it reach and withdraw you could take the guy out to where he fell off the roof and make him reach and withdraw from the point where he landed and hell get over having fallen off the roof i dont care what his case level is dont you see you can take almost anybody and increase their perception and so forth by running some cchs you can do things for almost anybody make them feel better and so forth by running some sec checking on them almost anybody will respond to arc break straightwire or these repetitive processes we are using and you could do something with engram running on almost anybody pretty close now what do you mean then by what process applies to whom see its that process which raises the persons level on this caselevel scale thats the process that is suited for that pc monitored and moderated by one thingone thing only fastest economy of time enters into this what would raise his case level fastest youve gotyouve got several choices and you might be able to get level 3 case with just sporadic track but actual track you might be able to get him an awful long ways with arc break straightwire see you might get him an awful long ways with that process at what speed see thats your difference well what are you doing running level 3 on arc break straightwire well its always good thing to clean up auditing thats about all youd use it for dont you see and thatd be bad economy of time now lets takelets take 3nthe usages of 3n you run too many implants you run dozen fifteen gpms without ever going on the earlier track or picking up any more basic or fundamental material and youre actually wasting time from that point thereon but finding earlier material before youve run some gpms youre actually wasting time see theres two ways of looking at this thing its all right to go hell and back on the backtrack but remember why is this guys time so loused up you can follow out an awful lot of implants and you can plot out lot of implants and its very very nice to find the basic implants yes but lets run some gpms and then lets find the basic implants and lets get these basics out of the road and then lets finish up running the helatrobus implants because thats where his time got loused up and thats where his tracks wrapped around the corner or that type of implant because let tell you something the implants from fortythree trillion years ago or from that period of time area start to speed up in number as we approach on into present time and we take the last billion years and boy were getting one about every seventy years or less theres gates of mars and so forth implants you want implants if youre just looking for numbers of implants dontdont go early see stick up around present time lets take the last few thousand years lets get industrious because of course everybodys gone practically potty on the subject of implants see and theres implants implants implants of all shapes sizes and general descriptions itll louse up the time track and give you multiple pictures and do this and do that and the whole darwinian theory is taken out of one single implant its fantastic so theres lots of implants now the earliest attainable implant from most casesarea that is aberrative and furnishes the fundamentals for later is the helatrobus area now there are few implants of the helatrobus type of implant that go back as far as three hundred and five trillion in fact i know of some that dont look too different but arent very complete that go back seven hundred trillion theyre very scrappy theyre very minor but nevertheless they form fundamentalthey form basic but the only really thorough workmanlike job that was ever done on the implant line was the helatrobus implants now its all right to strip implant engrams out its all right to kick everything out the window its all right to run those chains its all right to straighten them up when you come back up youll find the helatrobus implants will run very easily if you dont get those out of the road whats going to happen to all those implants between then and present time well youve got to get the pc in such shape as that this stuff just starts to blow by sight and if you dont get the pc into that kind of condition again his case level wont improve now case level improves to the degree that charge is removed and if you are running pc on process zed and the tone arm just sits there gorgeouslynice stable case seetone arm sits at 45 the blowdownscase really blows down case goes down to 4495 you can sit there and watch the needle it occasionally twitches once in session it drops down to 375 for moment and goes back up again pc laughed or had coughing fit are you improving case level oh pc is running pc can be even fairly cheerful about things but are you improving case level well case level becomes case level by the degree of encysted and unreleased charge that is the index of what makes that scale it isnt because somebody is grasshopperpower thetan and somebody else is juggernautpower thetan we dont care about that whats the juggernaut power thetan doing being aberrated you could say that its relative charge the tolerance of the case to tolerate charge you see this but you still get the same factor its charge what makes case then occur at these levels its charge we can say relative charge how much charge can this case stand hes gotten more charge than he can stand and thats not very much charge and joe over here hes got lot more charge but theybut joe might or might not beand we just dont care about these other random factors you just say its just that much charge and it puts him into these manifestations which you find on this realitythis caselevel scale from 1 to 8 and as they go down that scale you get different case manifestations and thats all the auditor is interested in hes getting these case manifestations now unless those case manifestations change you are not relieving charge and if youre going to change them youve got to relieve charge its as ordinary and simple as that in other words in order toin order to empty condenser youve got to ground it well without grounding the condenser maybe you could stir this charge around and maybe everybody got very interested in this charge being stirred around but did it ever discharge and your index of whether or not cases discharge is the amount of tone arm action which the case gets and its that elementary you can run helatrobus implants on somebody whos giving you an inch rr every time they say one of the things they get an inch rr and its nice curledend accelerated beginning curledend rr its the neatest prettiest textbook rr you ever wanted to see its just one inch long and there it is and every time they say what and there it is and the tone arm sits here abeautifully at 35 and it even blows down occasionally to 349995 pcs very interested in all this youre getting the word down see pc can run the implant obviously and pcs very interested in all this so what the economy of auditing time is not there there is economy of auditing time because auditing is being done if that tone arm isnt swishing and swopping and now and then you dont see this you dont see this youguys goingruhrrrprrprrprrprrprrprrprrprrprrprrp going higher going higher going higher on that tone arm tone arm higher higher easing up easing upupfive items later still easing up youve gotten an rr all right but its sure easing up oh you say theres something wrong here theres nothing wrong case that doesnt move the tone arm while running bank what are you running bank for and you finally get up here to 425 and all of sudden theyyoull see thistheyll say waterbly inaccurately fdaable and theyandpssww pssww psswpsswwpsswwpsswpsswpssw psww psww pssww pssww down its goingdown its going you see that needle blowing downblowing down seen blowdown didnt even have to go all the way back to 30 or anything like that it went pssww pssww pssww thats charge going thats leaving man thats never going to come back another thing you get these fuzzytailed rrs dialwide fuzzytailed rr thats discharge it doesnt come back at beautiful rr at all it starts out like mad thing and turns into fall disintegrating rr and youll see that and youll also see that tone arm start working when youre getting disintegrating rrs like that see all right thatsyoure running the helatrobus implant and youre getting that kind of thing see well youre blowing charge what more do you want all right pc sayspcs running implants very successfully pcs running implanttwo implants three implants thats fine thats fine the pc says i think theres an earlier implant all right the rule is you cant stop the pc from running the earlier implant you know i think ive been on pole trap before and so forth ah go run it down perfectly all right go ahead run down his basic go on run it back as far as he can go perfectly all right block it out watch that tone arm youre not getting any tone arm action whats this well youre running engrams on somebody who shouldnt be running engrams theyre not betheyre not getting there they could run the helatrobus implants and get release charge but they cant block out engrams and release charge now how do you break this news to the pc well thats your problem youre the auditor the pcs auditor you dont expect to audit your pc dont you yeah thats hell of problem pc wants to go back early and back early and back early id say id be perfectly happy to take the pc back early and take the pc back early and pick up various things and so forth but i would say i would run them minimally through things and as far as trying to find the basic is concerned you better have very specific thing that youre looking for or youll just go back onto the endless grind and watch this running engrams when youre not getting tone arm actions and blowdowns man watch it because all youre doing is stirring up the bankstirring up the bankstirring up the bank pcs going to get unhappier and unhappier with you how do you break this to the pc im afraid you have to have hearttoheart talk with the pc say now look well go back now and were going to run some more implants where we were getting tone arm action and were going to finish off some of those so that we can get this earlier material blown out and discharged how about that well pc will be very agreeable to do so you havent told him you must never go on the backtrack again because you dont have tone arm action on the backtrack i dont think this would be diplomatic i dont think this would be well received in fact i dare say the pc would arc break all over the ceiling now you depart from the helatrobus implants onto the backtrack you know youre blocking out engrams youre finding earlier implants so forth youre getting big blowy tone arm action youre getting tone arm action of one kind or another as you do this youre seeing these things every once in while go psswww and that sort of thing eh go ahead youll actually take so much charge off the backtrack that the helatrobus implants will start blowing out up to front see but the helatrobus implantsand none of these modern implants will blow out unless youre blowing charge off another thing youre going to run some arc break straightwire on pc and youre going to run this on the pc thats dandy youre going to run this tone arm action we assume youve already tried 3n couldnt find the goal tone arm action well give it chance tone arm action has to run in on case sometimes takes couple of sessions to run some tone arm into the case on arc break straightwire remember that you sometimes will sit there with great disappointment seeing tone arm action on arc break straightwire at the first run on pc youd think should have it then all of sudden wonderful news the tone arm action starts moving in on the case and you run the tone arm action into it and you run the tone arm action back out of it again but lets say you got tone arm action even after good test of this pcs happy with the process you understand apparently changing the pc and giving him somatics or something but youre not getting any tone arm action on this thing well you can drop back cant you you can drop back to sec checking cchs that sort of thing because sure as the devil youre going to find enough engrams relating to scientology to find case gain on the pc its that kind of thing thats holding up the parade if they are that bad off you can always go on down scale and run reach and withdraw on something well lets not say that youve been so stupid as to make an adjudication of starting out to run engrams on somebody who did nothing but sleep in the auditing chair now its better to start low and run high that is to say to underestimate the pcs ability than overestimate it always better because you start pc going on running engrams and then drop them back into running helatrobus ris and then drop them back into running arc break straightwire and then drop them back to sec checking and then drop them back to the cchs and then sort of start them in on reach and withdraw i think along that line they would have had few loses i think their confidence their confidence would have been interrupted so its always better to start them low and push them higher now if you can get tone arm action on the helatrobus implants boy you better run some implants now the pc says im going early by all means by all means hes spotted something early by all means let him go early and you get tone arm actions blocking out engrams earlier then you sure better acquaint the pc with this fact now theres six types of processes and their uses on various cases has to do with programing the variable that youre confronting here is the ability of the case thats the variable from the auditors viewpoint ability of case to rise up the scale thats that ability not necessarily just the ability to run the process so you have got to estimate that one and that to you is variable well when i tell you that the person has to blow charge on any process he runs has to feel better on any process he runs of course the lower the process the slower hell blow chargeyou recognize that too it will help you great deal and until we produce machine which you insert the pcs thetan in press three buttons and it says four four four four you see why until we do that youll make errors with this you will make errors with this inevitably you will make errors so dont try to be perfect just try to be effective okay now wheneverwhenever your case is being run in the direction of up the case will forgive almost anything you have done anyhow so dont even worry about the consequences of it your job is to remove charge which immediately raises the pcs level on that scale you can do that and if you arent doing that youre just turning in lot of noauditing and lot of hard work which all amounts to nothing and that is the way to produce fast results on case now theres many case will contest with you particularly level 5 cases level 6 cases will go into violent rows with the auditor on the subject of being underrun quite interesting we just had one leave the hall moment ago on thebecause he realized he was being underrun by his own estimation let tell you this they get into violent upsets on this because the lower the case the more they estimate their ability they take social pride its not as though theyre there to be audited at all itthey apparently have an entirely different mission which is to show off to the auditor there seems to be something social about what person is audited on which is quite interesting and that is status statusseeking has come to auditing now lets let tone arm action come to auditing and i think well all have won in the long run thank you very much
