letters thomas h johnson naval postgraduate school california abstract the taliban has recently reemerged on the afghan scene with vengeance five years after being defeated in afghanistan by us coalition the resurgent taliban backed by alqaeda are mounting an increasingly virulent insurgency especially in the east and south near the afghanistanpakistan borderthe taliban now represents signiﬁcant challenge to the survival of presidenthamid karzais government this article assesses the narrative strategy the taliban has employed to garner support with the afghan people speciﬁcally this paper assesses the narratives of taliban shabnamah commonly referred to as night letters in an effort unravel what the taliban represents introduction the last two years have witnessed some of the ﬁercest and most sustained ﬁghting in afghanistan since the taliban regime was toppled in november 2001 some analysts are now contending that the conﬂictsituation in afghanistan is stalemate between taliban insurgentforces and the united states and their nato allies 1there is doubt the taliban has staged signiﬁcant resurgence and is now major threatto any semblance of stable and democratic afghanistan leo dochertyaidedecamp to the commander of the british task force in southernafghanistan recently resigned his position describing the failed campaign against the taliban as textbook case of how to screw up counterinsurgency having big old ﬁght is pointless and just making things worse 2 the reemergence of the taliban can be attributed to three major factors3ﬁrst the lack of statebuilding and the inability of the afghan government to establish signiﬁcant presence throughout the countrysecond the failure to secure and stabilise the rural areas of the country issn

reconstruction can proceed and third the lack of any signiﬁcant material improvement in the lives of most pashtuns inthe south and east of the country since the demise of the taliban regimethese three factors have all had signiﬁcant impact on the failure of thekarzai regime to engender support and have contributed to making the taliban viable alternative to what is perceived as failed kabul regime while the lack of afghan statebuilding and reconstruction and the failure of kabul to reconcile with the rural pashtun peoples of the southand east of the country have all been critical factors in the reemergenceof the taliban these factors alone do not explain how the taliban havebeen able to capture the imagination of large swaths of pashtun areaswith resonating message of violent extremism how has the taliban been able to reemerge when only few years ago it seemed destined for the trash bin of history the purpose of this paper is to make sense of taliban culture or world view and its implications for the insurgency that is grippingafghanistan the research reported here focuses on the narrativestrategy the taliban has employed to garner support with the afghanpeople speciﬁcally this paper assesses the narratives of talibanshabnamah commonly referred to as night letters in an effort to unravel what the taliban represents 4as will be demonstrated below night letters have played critical role in the information campaignemployed by the taliban in an effort to establish popular base for itsinsurgency against the karzai regime in kabul taliban narrative analysis night letters have been traditional and common instrument of afghan religious ﬁgures jihadists and rebels to encourage people especially butnot exclusively rural populations to oppose both state authority andregulations dupree in his seminal work on afghanistan suggests thatsuch framing instruments often in the form of folklore performed variety of signiﬁcant functions to include social control where individuals are told by illustration what they should or should not doand what rewards or penalties they will incur for those not followingthese directives 5taliban shabnamah serve the same purpose nuances of taliban culture and narratives franz boas an earlytwentiethcentury german cultural anthropologist suggested that culture is the system of shared beliefs values customsbehaviours and artefacts that the members of society use to cope withtheir world and with one another and that are transmitted from318 thomas h johnsondownloaded by open university library at 0853 16 july 2008 generation to generation through learning6this deﬁnition highlights several important concepts that will be central for our assessmentof the taliban first culture is something that is shared between selfidentiﬁed group of people such as the taliban second culture has apsychological component as well as material manifestations such as produced artefacts and third culture is essentially adaptive and is transmitted through some process to others this operationalisation suggests the importance of artefacts that are used to transmittaliban world views or to borrow edwardss terminology theunderlying structure of the talibans moral systems as portrayedby narratives 7 narrative often represents story and reﬂects foundational beliefs that articulate groups views towards the world as turner notes story is basic principle of mind most of our experience our knowledge and our thinking are organised as stories8there is ample evidence that such artefacts have an effect on our capacity torecall events motivate action modulate our emotional reactions toevents cue certain heuristics and biases structure our problemsolving capabilities and ultimately inﬂuence our very identity 9the framing of narratives will have critical importance as to how talibanmessages resonate to greater or lesser degrees with target audiences10 traditionally storytelling and narratives especially oral history and shabnamah have been extremely important to the peoples of afghanistan as well as to the tribes in the afghanistanpakistan borderarea unique and pervasive themes are found throughout afghan poetryand literature that resonate with afghans in many respects afghanistans literature arts and music have been critical dynamics for afghanperseverance and adaptation narratives also serve an important role inafghan social mobilisation be it peaceful or violent this has been especially true when tribal collective actions have intersected with political opportunities 11during the british colonialism period for example anticolonial literature encouraged rebellion against thebritish and their patrons night letters and oral narratives were important instruments used by themujahedeen against their soviet occupiers12resistance literature called for total opposition against the soviets and their puppet afghanleaders and support for the jihad to establish an islamic order while variety of means were used to deliver such messages to the afghan public particularly powerful media especially in the rural areas werepoems and music below is an example of widely circulated pashtun folk poem that was used to transmit narrative characterising sovietinstalled babrakkarmal as traitorthe taliban insurgency and night letters 319downloaded by open university library at 0853 16 july 2008 babrak of lenin you do not care for the religion and the faith you may face your doom andmay you receive calamity of traitoro of lenin 13 narratives were also used by the mujahedeen against king zahir shah and the royal family as illustrated by popular mujahedeen folk song presented below this narrative contrasts the sacriﬁces made by the antisoviet mujahedeen with the exiled life of the afghan king and how he had forsaken his legacy and ultimate rewards you have none of your family ﬁghting in afghanistan only the brave are here you are enjoying life in italywind of the morning go tell zahir shah there is halwa sweetmeat for you in afghanistan the graves of your ancestors are herebut there will be grave for you in afghanistan 14 night letters were particularly useful mujahedeen inﬂuence and intimidation technique in nelofer paziras biographical story calleda bed of red flowers she describes night letters used to coordinate shop closings or other activities designed to create solidarity among the antisoviet afghan population one activity coordinated by the nocturnal campaign was concert of allahu akbars god is great shouted from the rooftops of village houses this created levee masse effect towards the soviet invaders and reminded the secular communists of the unifying power of islam the next day we are tired but as if concealing our nights secret from the light of day we dont talk about allahu akbars until uncle wahid arrives with the news in silent rejection all kabul shopkeepers decided to keep their stores closedyesterday february 22 1980 they designated the night as the time to voice that days protest an anonymous nightly letter had been spread all over kabul asking people to cry allahu akbar after dark says uncle wahid for the following two days kabul shops remain shut and for the third night in row we are standingon the roof joining in this religious symphony until dawn we chant god is great we are all so caught up in this rotation of rhythm and order that one complains about the lack of sleep this is our welcome afghanstyle to the soviet invasion 15 taliban night letters the taliban has adopted shabnamah as welltested costeffective method of instruction and intimidation the taliban regularly posts suchletters or leaﬂets during the night warning of the wrath villages willface if they cooperate with us forces the christian invaders or the320 thomas h johnsondownloaded by open university library at 0853 16 july 2008 karzai regime us puppet16the taliban relies on the educated populace to transmit the shabnamah to illiterate villagers often these letters are pasted to the walls of mosques and government buildings andpromise death to anyone who deﬁes their threats or instructions theyare typically aimed at symbols of authority and supporters of the karzai government and often read as the following once this government falls we will be in power we will have your documents your re sumes your names and your addresses we will come and punish you the taliban has thus far been true to its word in sowing doubt and fear among afghans 17as reported by time magazine night letters left across southern afghanistan the talibans stronghold have slowed government services and brought reconstruction projects to haltin qandahar province many police ofﬁcers have quit and after letters appearedthreatening employees two medical clinics were shut down in the past two months insurgents have burned down 11 schools in the region some of the attacks were presaged by night letters warning parents to keep their children home 18 the taliban night letters represent strategic and effective instrument crafting poetic diatribes which appeal to the moralreasoning of afghan villagers while many of the night letters representovert intimidation they also present important insights into who andwhat the taliban represents the quality and use of these letters have impressed professional us information and psychological operations pysop ofﬁcers who consider them eloquent and impressive andsubsequently more effective than the vast majority of us informationoperation artefacts 19 figure 1 presents taliban night letter20distributed in kandahar in 2003 entitled message to the mujahed afghan nation and is goodexample of the talibans literal eloquence and poetic approach topersuasion that originated in historical intercultural communications found throughout afghanistan and iran 21this shabnamah references afghanistans grand history and the threat that americans and theircronies pose to historically great islamic afghan governmentthe proclamation is addressed to the mujahed people of afghanistanintimating the notion that the country itself is engaged in jihad or lawful war against inﬁdels and an apostate government the labelmujahed as used in this narrative does not apply solely to the talibanbut rather to the afghan population as whole the message suggests thatallafghans have role in this campaign against common enemy of islam and afghans have an obligation to join the ﬁght against theinﬁdels the posting is wellprepared narrative reﬂecting on the illustrious history of rule of three

would establish the durrani afghan empire in kandahar in 1747 he isconsidered by many as the father of modern afghanistan whileghilzai members of the taliban have long disdained the durranisahmad shah is revered by all afghans sykes in his history of afghanistan calls ahmad shah monarch whose high descent and warlike qualities made him peculiarly acceptable to his aristocratic and virile chiefs as well as to his warlike subjects in general in short hepossessed all the qualities that enabled him successfully to found thekingdom of afghanistan 22 the second ancestor and hero referenced is sultan mahmud ghaznawi young turkic nonafghan king who ascended the thronearound the year 1000 and embarked on ghaznavid empirebuilding thatrepresented one of the great renaissances of the early islamic period 23 mahmud was considered great general who conducted at least 17successful campaigns against india according to dupree he addednorthwest india and the punjab to his empire and enriched his treasuryby looting wealthy hindu temples probably more importantmahmuds mullahs converted many hindus to islam 24 historians such as caroe trace the origin of the ghilzai nation to the turkish tribes of the ghaznavid empire25hence the reference to mahmud could be alluding to the glorious genealogy of the ghilzai very important taliban dynamic the taliban primarily consists of rural pashtuns from the ghilzai nation26with some support from the kakar tribe of the ghurghusht nation27the ghilzai who are descendants of the great nomad clans powindah of sulaiman khel and the aka khel are the largest afghan tribal confederation and include the tribes of sulaiman khel ali khelaka khel taraki nasirs tokhis hotaks and khototi28 much of the original taliban leadership including mullah mohammed omar comes from the hotak ghilzai tribe that held power in afghanistan in the eighteenth century and for time evenpossessed the throne of isfahan persia the hotaki ghilzais under mirwais ghilzai achieved

2008 from safavid control in 1709 in 1722 the hotaki served as the leading tribe in the invasion of persia and destruction of the persian empire29 the importance remembrance and implications of such proud historyin tribal afghanistan are dynamics that stupefy many western analysts the ghilzai regime was ended by nadir shah in 1737 after the assassination of nadir shah in 1747 the ﬁrst modern government was established in kandahar by the afghans as they elected ahmed shahdurrani as their ruler the ghilzai have traditionally held stronganimosity towards the durrani pashtuns who took power from theghilzai and have held it almost continuously for the last 300 years 30 the durranis have provided allof afghanistans modern kings fact not lost on the ghilzai only three times have the ghilzai seized nationalpower in 1721 when mir wais took the throne in 1978 after coup against mohammed daoud by marxist military ofﬁcers who immediately handed over power to the marxist peoples democraticparty of afghanistan leader nur mohammed taraki 31and again in 1996 when mullah omar came to power since the demise of mir waisghilzai and his empire the ghilzai have hated the durranis their archrivals and the tribe of hamid karzai the divisions between durrani and ghilzai afghans have been at the root of centuries of conﬂict and intrigue in afghanistan such issues were intimately involved in the demographics of peshawar politics during the antisoviet jihad 32in fact case can be made that the politics of the afghan war were virtual ghilzai affair khalqs ghilzaileaders haﬁzullah amin and muhammad taraki began the processwith the 1978 coup the afghan military forces were dominated bykhalqi ofﬁcers many of whom were ghilzai babrak karmal withdurrani connections was replaced by najibullah one of the fewparchamis with ghilzai roots except for babrak karmal the great durranipashtun confederation had little representation on either side of the conﬂict khalqi members of peoples democratic party ofafghanistan pdpa were committed to break the established traditionof durrani rule 33some spoke of the marxist usurpation and the war as ghilzai revenge against durrani dominance on the resistance side assuggested above nearly all of the key mujahedeen parties were led by or had strong ties to the ghilzai ethnic rivalry perhaps more than islamicideology was even responsible for the refusal of the peshawar parties to accept zahir shah into mujahedeen politics 34 the taliban insurgency of today is just the most recent manifestation of ghilzaidurrani rivalry with the majority of the durranissupporting the hamed karzai regime and the majority of the ghilzaissupporting the taliban 35 the ﬁnal ancestor and hero reference in the night letter of figure 1 is to shahab aldin ghuri of the ghurid dynasty who ruled from 1173324 thomas h johnsondownloaded by open university library at 0853 16 july 2008 to 1206 and controlled the entire eastern caliphate encompassing much of afghanistan eastern iran and modern pakistan36his numerous invasions of india and his powerful rule helped construct widespreadand longlasting historical memory framed by heroism and sacriﬁcethrough generations of oral transmission although ghaznawi and ghuri were not afghan by birth history granted them an afghan pedigree and the two kings are still honoured as heroes hence thetaliban night letter uses the collective historical memory of afghanshanded down through generations to frame the intellectual argumentagainst popular support of the karzai regime and american forces theshabnamah narrative gloriﬁes those who have fought and converted inﬁdels to the righteous path the goal of the taliban this shabnamah represents clear challenge to the karzai regime and its expatriate members and proffers that it is pity that today some americantrained servants have destroyed the honoured history of afghanistan the letter also follows the timehonoured afghan practiceof attacking foreign inﬂuence xenophobic message that hashistorically resonated with the afghan people which the karzaigovernment and the americans represent in the eyes of the taliban clear distinction is made between muslims and nonmuslims as the taliban appeals to true islamic believers and decries the false propaganda of nonmuslim enemies the letter appeals to the populations gratitude and appreciation for the martyrs of the sovietoccupation and the talibans battles during operation enduringfreedom even citing casualty statistics the letter states that thetaliban is against killing common citizens but at times it cannot beavoided on the other hand the shabnamah argues that supporters of the karzai regime and the americans are not afghans and open targets it is interesting to note that this night letter made its appearance during the height of the demobilisation disarmament and reorganisation ddr campaign aimed at ridding the country of weapons and toconvince reluctant and recalcitrant regional and warlord militiamembers to support the karzai regime the letter states that nonmuslims want to kill and pit afghan against afghan and burn their afghan arms and ammunitions the author of the letter obviouslybelieves that disarmament is ludicrous while afghanistans enemies arekilling afghans during the 1990s there were more personal weapons in afghanistan than in india and pakistan combined by some estimates more such weapons had been shipped into afghanistan during theprevious decade than to any other country in the world 37afghans and especially the pashtuns revel in gun culture one of the ﬁrst sounds anafghan male infant hears after he is born immediately after praise toallah is the ﬁring of guns celebrating his birth an appeal against theddr campaign is not only clear indication that the taliban tracksthe taliban insurgency and night letters 325downloaded by open university library at 0853 16 july 2008 aspects of the bonn process especially those that have the potential to impact their insurgent actions it is also more importantly recognitionthat the taliban understands that taking away pashtuns gun isequivalent to taking away his manhood while the taliban undoubtedlydoes not want afghans especially its supporters to give up their weapons and become helpless the narrative is appealing to deeper characteristic that resonates with nearly every pashtun indeed guns areintimately related to the pashtun tribal code of pashtunwali and as result most pashtun males become acquainted with weapons in their early childhood and develop keen sense of marksmanship 38 the pashtuns afﬁnity for weapons has traditionally plagued everystates attempt to enforce its own rule of law over the top of pashtunwali the document does not communicate any direct threat against the us military but it does insinuate that americans destroyed mosques and madrasahs in order to reeducate afghan children about christianity such narrative is presented to create mistrust and apprehension amongthe afghan population afghanistan is 99 per cent muslim and religionis and always has been central characteristic of the afghan people the letter warnsthatthe enemieswanttomake afghanistan ashelpless as palestine an emphasis on the plight of the palestinians has been acentral focal and rallying point for islamists for decades in the past islamic struggles outside afghanistan have not been an explicit mantra of the afghan resistance the mujahedeen for example had more immediate and limited goal of liberating afghanistan from the sovietsand ﬁghting the puppet government they installed in kabul they had nointention or desire to turn their country into theatre or camp fromwhich to wage global jihad against either other muslim governmentsor western states 39it is interesting that the taliban which in the past has never represented transnational jihadist organisation would focus on more global struggles even indirectly in their shabnamah s the letter concludes with poem that is aimed at invoking respect and striking chord in the receivers historical memory through repetitionpoetry provides way to remember facts or messages and enhances thedelivery method with emotion anchored in cultural traditions it is likelythis proclamation was read aloud by an educated village elder toilliterate members of the local populace emphasising the poem at theend of the letter possibly even reading it twice to allow the audience to experience the power of the poem figure 2 presents shabnamah that is an example of warning letter targeted at the populace of the kandahar province towns of marufand arghistan 40unlike the night letter examined above this letter appears quickly constructed and warns the afghan population againstsupporting the americans326 thomas h johnsondownloaded by open university library at 0853 16 july 2008 the letter was written in pashto and warns the residents of maruf and arghistan against cooperating with the americans it explicitlysuggests that the taliban will kill all those who cooperate with theamericans once the americans leave the point is emphasised byasserting that the americans will not always be there to protect those who chose to cooperate moreover the letter states that the taliban knows the names and location of collaborators and compares thesepresentday collaborators with those who were loyal to the russiansduring the antisoviet jihad such message is typical of messages delivered by taliban mullahs speaking to rural village elders they are fond of saying that theamericans have the wristwatches but we have the time the simplemessage they deliver in person or by night letter such as the one presented in figure 2 is one of intimidation the americans may stay for ﬁve years they may stay for ten but eventually they will leave andwhen they do we will come back to this village and kill every family that figure 2 taliban night letter warning letter to the people of maruf and arghistan two towns within kandahar province translation we inform those people of maroof district that serve americans day and night and showthe places of the mujahedeen to them or those who

university library at 0853 16 july 2008 has collaborated with the americans or the karzai government such message is devastatingly effective in these areas where transgenerationalfeuds and revenge are fabric of the society it is also an effectivemessage to keep ngos and reconstruction activities out of areascontrolled by the taliban if one assumes that the centre of gravity for both the insurgency and counterinsurgency is popular support and that for the karzaigovernment to succeed it must deliver reconstruction infrastructureand services to the hinterlands areas that have thus far received virtuallynothing then the talibans strategy has proven very effective the threefundamental problems in afghanistan that have allowed the talibansreemergence are the inability of the national government since 2001 to establish apolitically signiﬁcant presence throughout the country the failure of the international community to create secure ruralenvironment in the south conducive to development and reconstruc tion and the virtually complete lack of meaningful improvement in the lives of the great majority of the people in the southern half of the country41 the insurgency and counterinsurgency presently engulﬁng afghanistanwill not be won kinetically ultimately the winners will be those thathave the support of the population this support will not be realised bythe karzai government if it does not deliver better life and stability to the countryside as well as to the urban areas the hinterlands of the east and south remain impoverished wastelands with few schools and roadsand little prospect of better life for the vast majority of the populousa poll conducted in 2005 showed that six out of ten afghans still haveno electricity and only three per cent have it consistently 42the taliban is well aware of this and will continue to put up obstacles to inhibitkabul or the international community to better the lives of the averageafghan villager whole districts in provinces such helmand oruzgan zabol paktika ghazni wardak and logar are essentially war zones with virtually chance of rehabilitating fractured infrastructuresa prerequisite for the counterinsurgency figure 3 presents recent taliban night letter from the wardak province and authored by the mujahedeen of the islamic emirate ofafghanistan this shabnamah is signiﬁcantly different from the other night letters examined here this narrative uses language that mimicsthat regularly used by transnational jihadist organisations and intimates that the ultimate goal of the afghan insurgency has global dimension this message is in stark contrast with the shabnamah presented in figure 1 written in 2004 the signiﬁcant differences in these two letters328 thomas h johnsondownloaded

merciful and most compassionate statement pious afghans brave and courageous people accept our greetingsdear muslim and devout brother as you all know some countries in the islamicworld and speciﬁcally our dear countryafghanistan are spending day and night under the grip of the crusaders in the last few years during this time the cruel crusaders army and their domestic servants have committed grave atrocities barbarity andsavagery against our innocent brothers and sisters their cruelties have not ceased you have watched and heard of their ongoing savagery in afghanistan and iraq the two best examples that have been exposed by the international media therefore theafghan muslim mujahadeen have initiated their sacred jihad to gain the independent of our beloved country from the crusader powers the jihad will continue until the end until defeat of the crusaders army and till the establishment of pure islamicstate inshallah therefore the afghan muslim mujahedeen state the following related guidelines to ensure obtaining our goals and ask earnestly all afghans to respect them seriously 1 all those who work and are at the service of the crusader army cooperate military or logistically with them and carry oil food and similar things for them are warnedstrongly to stop cooperating with them promptly otherwise they will face seriousconsequences 2 all those who do business with the crusaders are asked to avoid doing business with them so as not to suffer during the exalted strike of the mujahedeen on the crusaders 3 we seriously ask all persons not to expose the holy names of the mujahedeen to the crusaders armyand to their afghan slaves during the exalted strike of mujahedeen on them and likewise we ask those afghans who spy for americans and for their afghan slaves to stop doing this evil act otherwise they will be punished at the hands of the holy mujahedeen according to shariah 4 we ask all muslims to cooperate wholeheartedly with their mujahedeen brothers and to join their ranks and to support jihads so as to perform their religious duty properly 5 we ask all those who spread false allegation against mujahedeen to stop their evil

16 july 2008 suggest that the afghan insurgency might very well be morphing into campaign with more transnational concerns one theme of the letter is do not associate or help the karzai regime and coalition forces or you will be judged as one of them one wholends hand to inﬁdels to transgress against muslims is one of them this message of intimidation as we have seen before is clearly cornerstone of taliban night letter narratives this letter like many other taliban shabnamah has considerably more islamic references than the narratives assessed above or belowjuergensmeyer suggests that religious tropes are more likely to play anarrative role if the confrontation between two groups can becharacterised as cosmic struggle or battle this is most likely in thefollowing circumstances if the struggle is perceived as defense of basic identity and dignity if losing the struggle would be unthinkable if the struggle is blocked and cannot be won in real time or in real terms43 the ﬁrst two circumstances are valid for the taliban the taliban views this insurgency as evidenced in its shabnamah as struggle over basic questions of identity and culture it must be won losing is not an optionthe third circumstance was probably also valid until mid2004 sincehowever the emboldened insurgency has shown real signs of success theshabnamah invokes the name of allah via standard greeting and begins by rallying the population against the crusaders and their domestic servants the use of the term crusaders is signiﬁcant thisterminology is used by osama bin laden when he refers to the conﬂict inafghanistan as battle between crusader army and islam 44the use of this terminology suggests that the united states and its allies arewaging crusade against islam and this aggression is not an isolatedconﬂict but rather the latest episode in long chain of conﬂicts thathave been targeted at muslims while there is evidence suggesting that this letter was written by alqaeda or an afghanarab the language used is very similar to the regular terminology used by alqaedait proclaims clash of civilisations the declaration accuses the crusaders and their domestic servants of unceasing

future implications and conclusions analysts and observers have recently argued that the taliban are now drawing increasing support from the afghan population 59while it is impossible to evaluate speciﬁcally how the talibans night lettercampaign has contributed to this support taliban narratives haveclearly resonated where their messages have not resonated with thepopulace the taliban has compensated by waging an effectiveintimidation campaign the talibans narrative themes can be summarised as an appeal to past afghan struggles against foreign invaders thetaliban regularly play on how foreign powers have been historicallydefeated by the peoples of afghanistan the battle between the taliban and the karzai puppet regime andits foreign coalition represents cosmic conﬂict between the righteous and the inﬁdel afghans have collective religious responsibility to ﬁght the apostates and invaders the talibans enemies represent crusaders who are promotingchristianity and attempting to destroy islam the power of martyrdom brave afghans will sacriﬁce themselves tosave afghanistan the ﬁght against their enemies involves saving honour supporting the enemy is prohibited the penalty for ignoring the warnings is usually death the network of afghan ethnic and political afﬁliations and loyalties is complex and continuously changing it is difﬁcult if not impossible tocapture local and provincial alliances and refer to them as deﬁnitivelasting relationships this factor works against us strategists who ﬁnd iteasier to plan an operation targeting ﬁxed population with clearlydelineated alliances rather than shifting loyalties and politicisation resulting from personal or tribal feuds operation enduring freedom was particular challenge to us information operation message strategists inthat it was vital to have an intimate grasp of ethnic and local relationshipson the ground the vast majority of these analysts were virtually cluelessin their understanding of the talibans

night letters 339downloaded by open university library at 0853 16 july 2008 by special operations forces sof in the areas afghan geography created impassable barriers for tactical psyop which made radio or leaﬂetcampaigns the only hope for getting messages to the rural population butour messages have not resonated and the taliban has clearly taken animmeasurable lead in the information war night letters such as those analysed here have become central component of its strategy 60 the level of us cultural intelligence prior to and even during the initial campaign fell short of adequate and could not compete with the talibaninformation campaign which made use of its indigenous grasp of localprovincial and national themes to render its message more powerfulamong its audience some of the us narratives have been downright sillyand an embarrassment understanding the taliban and its tribal roots more precisely could enable better calibration of information and psychological operations more nuanced understanding of the battleﬁeld and the human terrainby us and nato forces and would suggest realignment ofreconstruction priorities based on historical models to isolate themovement and prevent its further mobilisation assessing their nightletters is one small way to do this much of the area of taliban operations and control is ungoverned spaces at least from western perspective where tribal independence from the state is highly cherished these areas are primarily inhabited by segmentary societies such as the ghilzai lindholms characterisation ofsegmentary societies 61supports the notion that tribal organisational and normative factors which the taliban is quite familiar with impede theestablishment of state authority segmentary societies differ from otherforms of society in that they only tend to unite when they feel they arelosing inﬂuence over their own way of life the taliban was brilliant inexploiting such sentiments during its initial rise to power in 199496 when afghans were extremely warweary and seeking to extend control over their lives that was lost over two decades of war as well as duringthe archaic and ineffectual mujahedeen rule after the fall of najibullah the taliban under its ghilzai leadership offered stability and the afghanpeople welcomed it with open arms at least until they recognised whatthe taliban ultimately represented the taliban through its present night letter campaigns is mimicking its successful strategy of 199496 but with series of modiﬁcations the narratives of the night letters represent the preservation of traditional pashtun values and society at the expense of modernitynight letters used in urban areas by the taliban not assessed by theanalysis presented here directly confront some of the ills of modernitysuch as alcohol pornography and prostitution that are now very visiblein urban areas such as kabul and which the average pashtun abhors 62 expect to see more such letters targeting urban areas and more340 thomas h johnsondownloaded by open university library at 0853 16 july 2008 sophisticated campaign against modernity as the taliban insurgency pushes north phenomenon that we started to witness in 2006 the taliban as well as the ghilzai society have deep interests in preserving traditional social structures and organisations and preventingsocial change maintaining the social status quo is an explicit goal of segmentary society63these root goals and world views are clearly evidenced in taliban shabnamah s and they severely hamper kabuls ability to offer social or economic progress as an incentive to acceptingstate authority moreover through its intimidation campaign thetaliban has been able to scare off those few ngos and humanitarianorganisations that could deliver on karzais wishes this is proving to bea brilliant strategy to defy kabul and the counterinsurgency this hasclearly presented dilemma for the karzai government as well as us and coalition counterinsurgency strategies ghilzai pashtuns highly value and have grown accustomed to their independence they have preserved their way of life for centuries despitethe efforts of some very powerful forces to alter it though there havebeen times when parts of this tribal society have experienced shortdurations of subjugation by alien forces they were permitted to conducttheir lives in accordance with pashtunwali even today the federally administrated tribal areas fatas of pakistan which are predomi nantly inhabited by the pashtun are exempt from pakistani law independence is the historical norm for the ghilzai and the taliban nightletters dwell on this fact the desire for continued independence is onetheme of the shabnamah s assessed here the risk of losing tribal independence to inﬁdels and puppets of the west outweighs thepossibility of improving tribal social welfare or increasing economicopportunities that would probably be gained by accepting stateauthority any concession in tribal independence should exceed any compensation offered in return for submission to state authority kabul as well as the us and its coalition partners have failed
