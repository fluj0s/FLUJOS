111th congress as the single larg est financial contributor to the system the us government has an interest in ensuring the united nations operates as efficiently and effectively as possible congress has the responsibility to appropriate us funds to the ited nations and can impose conditions on payments on several occasions congress s sought to link us funding of the united nations to specifi c reform benchmarks in recent years there has been growing concern among some in the international community that the united nations has become ineffective and unwieldy in the face of increasing global challenges and respons ibilities in response to these concerns thenun secretarygeneral kofi annan nd some member states proposed series of management pr ogrammatic and structural reforms to improve the organization many of these reforms are in various stages of implementation while others are still being considered by memb er states secretar ygeneral ban kimoon who assumed the position of secretaryge neral in january 2007 has stated that he will continue to support reform efforts this report focuses on current reform efforts and priorities from the perspective of several key act ors including the us gove rnment the secretary general selected groups of member states nongovernmental organizations ngos and crosssection of groups tasked with ddressing reform it also examines congressional actions related to reform as well as future policy considerations background reform trends since the establishment of the united na tions in 1945 member states and past secretariesgeneral have repeatedly attempted to reform the organization these reform efforts tend to be cyclical with member states considering waves of new reform proposals every five to ten years the reform attempts can be initiated by member state groups of member states ndor the current secretarygeneral they generally focus on three areas of concern 1 perceived inefficiencies and lack of accountability in the secretariat 2 duplication and redundancy of mandates missions andor pr ograms and 3 evidence of fraud waste abuse andor mismanagement of

in response to the proposals in boutrous ghalis reports the general assembly created five openended working groups to consider reforms in specific areas including peace development the security

growing membership1 in the 1970s as the economic and political gap be tween developed and devel oping countries grew more pronounced the general asse mbly requested the secret arygeneral to appoint group of experts to recommend structural ch anges that would help the united nations address problems of intern ational economic cooperation2 the most recent wave of reform may be driven by co mbination of budgetary and financial issues controversy over mismanagement of the iraq oilforfood program perceived ineffectiveness of human rights mechanisms and recent allegations of sexual abuse committed by sta ff and peacekeepers among other things reform efforts 1980s and early 1990s reform initiatives in the 1980s and early 1990s focused primarily on financial and structural issues in

budgetary discipline nd full financial implications37 the general assembly supported bans propos in principle in late june 2007 the assembly approved the restructuring establishing th department of field support with new undersecretarygeneral to head the department38 significant point of contention among some member states during nego tiations was the level of autonomy the secretarygeneral would have to organize the secretariat visávis the assemblys authority to determine the budget and how it should be spent thus in its initial framework resolution the general assembly required the

to build broad consensus for security council enhancement congress and reform generally congress supports the united na tions and its mission it authorizes and appropriates us funds to the organization each year and often utilizes mechanisms to further us foreign policy objectives41 congress can also be critical of the united nations however especially when some members believe that the organization may not be running as effectively as it coul d be when this happens congress may use wide range of legislative tools to influence and direct us policy at the united nations such efforts may include considering sense of the congress resolutions holding hearings to investigate programs or oversee administration policies and determining us nominees fo r posts placing financial conditionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33848crs10 42 for more detailed examination of us funding of the united nations see crs report rl33611 united nations system f unding congressional issues by

107228 section 402 for more information on peacekeeping funding see crs report rl33700 united nations peacekeeping issues for congress by marjorie ann browne or limits on us funding to the united nations is another common congressional policy approach to reform us funding as tool for reform overview and options in the past congress has used its authority to limit us funds to the united nations as mechanism for influencing policy42 in some cases congress withheld proportiona share of funding for programs and policies of which it did not approve since 1980 it has withheld funds from regular budget programs including the special unit on palestinian rights for projects involving the palestine libera tion organization and the preparatory commission for the law of the sea the overall impact of withholding pr oportionate share of assessed payments depends on the origin of the programs funding if pr ogram is funded by the regular budget and the united states wit hholds proportionate share of its normal contributions the cost of the program will most likely be covered by surplus regular budget funds some programs ar funded from several budgets that may include the regular budget specialized agency budgets and separate conference and administrative budgets because of this it may be more difficult for us proportionate withholdings to have si gnificant impact because the programs funding comes from several sources in ch cases us withholding would have little or impact on the progra ms operation or funding leve ls if the united states withholds funds from program funded prima rily by member state contributions however the impact of us withdrawal could be greater currently the only proportionate us withholding from the u n regular budget is for some activities and programs related to the palestine liberation organization or entities associated with it43 additionally the bush administration announced in april 2008 that it would withhold portion of its contri butions to the 2008 regular budget equivalent to the us share of the human rights council budget44 in addition to withholding proportionate share of us funding congress may consider enacting legislation decreasing or increasing us assessment levels or linking payment of us arrears to polic ies it favors in october 1993 for example congress directed that the us payments of peacekeeping assessments be capped at 25 lower than the assessment level set by the united nations45 congress also used this strategy to further its reform policies enacted legislation such as thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33848crs11 46 additionally some observers contend that if the united states were to delay or stop payment of its arrears it may risk losing its vote in the general assembly generally undesirable outcome for many members of c ongress and the administration in 1999 for example the united states came very close to losing its general assembly vote under article 19 of the charter member state with arrears equaling or exceeding the member statess assessments for the two preceding years will have vote in the general assembly 47 the right approach to achieving reform better world campaign fact sheet available at httpwwwbetterworldcampaignorghelmsbiden agreement linked us assessment levels and the payment of us arrears to reform benchmarks see appendi x for more information on legislation arguments for and against link ing us funding to reform opponents of linking us funding to pr ogress on reform are concerned that doing so may weaken us influence at the united nations thereby undercutting its ability to conduct diplomacy and make foreign policy decisions46 some argue that withholding us assessed payments to th united nations infringes on us treaty obligations and alie nates other member states opponents also note that withholding us funds could have an impact on diplomatic relati ons outside of the system additionally some contend th at reform legislation proposals may be unrealistic because the scope and depth of reforms required by the legislation cannot be adequately achieve d in the proposed time frames47 supporters of linking us funding to specific reforms argue that the united states should use its position as the largest financial contributor to push for the implementation of policies that lead to comprehensive reform they note that despite diplomatic and political pre ssures from many countries the united nations has been slow to implement substantive reform dvocates also argue that some previously implemented reforms such as the new human rights council have proved to be ineffective they believe that tying u s funding to reform may motivate countries to find common ground on divisive issues they also emphasize that past legislation that threatened to cut off us funding of the united nations such as the kassebaumsolomon amendment was effective and led to substantive changes in operations and programs possible instruments for furth ering us reform policy congresss influence over us funding of the united nations is powerful tool for furthering us reform policy at the ited nations however there may be other strategies for congress to consider when advocating its reform agenda these strategies have been widely used by many past and current members of congress and administrations and include but are not limited to resolutions members of congress may propose andor enact simple or concurrent resolutions expressing an opinion fact or principle in one or both chambers of congress some members of congress have used these resoluti ons to voice an opinion about us policy in the united nationsor the united nations itself httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33848crs12 48 article 100 of the charter states in

perspectives and priorities significant challenge for advocates of reform is finding common ground among the disparate definitions of reform held by vari ous stakeholders the global community has common definition of reform and as result there is often debate among some over the scope appropriatene ss and effectiveness of past and current reform initiatives one method fo r determining how stakeholder defines reform may be to identify policy priorities in the reform debate in some cases common objectives among stakeholders have translated into substantive reform policy though shared goals do not always guarantee successful outcomes recent reform debates in the ge neral assembly and its committees drew attention to fundamental differences that exist among some member states particularly developing countries repr esented primarily by the group of 77 and china and developed countri including the united states japan and the united kingdom developed countries which account for the majority of assessed contributions to the regular budget would like the secretarygeneral to have greater flexibility and authority to implement reforms specifically those related to oversight and human resources developi ng countries however generally object to policies that may enhance the power of the secretarygeneral and decrease the power of the general assembly and its budget and administrative committees observers are concerned that this difference in refo rm philosophy will create deadlock in the general assembly and significantly delay the implementation of some key management and budget reforms selected internat ional perspectives stakeholders engaged in the reform debate have differe nt perspectives on how reform should be implemented nd how to prioritize specific reform issues83 several key actors including the european union the group of 77 and china developed countries and nongovernmental orga nizations have weighed

priority and supports the panels efforts to explore how the system may improve system coordination in the areas of developm ent humanitarian assistance and the environment the eu actively supports th reform of core organs including the security council gene ral assembly and ecosoc86 and it also attaches particular importance to the implementation of the millennium development goals87 the group of 77 and china g77 the g77 is loosely affiliated group of 132 member states representing the interests of developing countries88 it has played significant role in recent reform debates due in part to its large membership which can be significant voting bloc in the general assembly the g77 generally supports reform and s long viewed development as key reform issue emphasizing that it should be given the utmost priority by the united nations89 the g77 views reform as process to examine how the mandates of the united nations can work through well coordinated synergies to achieve the millennium development goals it believe s that reform should not alter the intergovernmental nature of our the united nations decisionmaking oversight and monitoring process additionally the g77 does not view reform as mechanism to reduce budget levels to fund more activities from within the existing pool of resources nor to redefine the roles and responsibilities assigned to the various organs 90httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33848crs21 91 for example the g77 opposed proposals by secretarygeneral annan that gave the secretariat more power to move hire and fire secretariat staff as well as to

the establishment of an ethics office and whistleblower protection policy it has however activ ely opposed other initiatives proposed by the secretarygeneral particular ly those proposals that it feels may weaken the authority of the general assembly in the areas of management budget and oversight91 the g77 also maintains that the positions of all member countries should be taken into consideration during the reform process the g77 has also expressed concern that reform initiatives proposed by the secretary general may be influenced by the larger financial contributors such as th united states japan and some members of the european union92 developed countries in some cases the reform priorities of developed countries may not always align with the reform priorities of the g77 and other developing countries while the g77 views development as top reform priority many developed countries tend to focus on management budget and structural reform generally developed countries make si gnificantly larger financial contributions to the system than developing country member states and therefore may want to ensure that their funds are used in what they perceive as the most effective way for example the united states and the eu which together account for significant portion of the re gular budget view management and budget reform as top priority japan which contributed approximate ly 166 of the regular budget in 2007 also views manageme nt reform as priority particularly secretariat reform security council reform and systemwide coherence93 the differing perspectives on re form among developing and developed nations were highlighted in december 2005 wh group of member states led primarily by develope d countries such as the united states and japan sought to link progress on management reforms to the budget the countries placed spending cap of 950 million about six mont hs of spending on the twoyear 36 billion budget in hopes that the genera l assembly would

that may require diffe rent processes for imp lementation these reforms might be achieved by amending the charter or through various non charter reforms charter amendment is rarely used practice and has only occurred on three occasions noncharter reforms are more common and comparatively easier to achieve amending the charter articles 108 and 109 provide for potential changes to the charter article 108 of the charter states that proposed charter amendment must be approved by twothir ds of the full general assembly and be ratified according to the constitutional processes of twothirds of member states including the all permanen t members of the security council106 the charter was first amended in 1963 to increase u n security council membership from 11 to 15 members and to increase ecosoc membership from 18 to 27 it was last amended in 1973 when ecosoc membership increased from 27 to 54107 examples of possible reform initiatives that might i nvolve amending the charter include

assembly has established various fora for discussing reform issues including committee on the charter of the united nations109 and working group on the security council110 the general assembly has also implemented reforms on its own by adopting proposals introduced by member states or the secretarygeneral111 the secretarygeneral can also implement reform in his capacity as chief administrative

general ssembly in 2006113 possible challenges to reform achieving meaningful and comprehensive reform is significant and ongoing challenge for member states congress may wish to take possible reform obstacles into account when considering legisla tion that exercises oversight or supports reform agenda national selfinterest and differing reform perspectives each member state has its own political agenda and foreign policy goals and may also have its own definition of reform as result member states often hold differing views on how best to implement reform and how to measure the success or failure of given reform initiative in some cases failure to r each consensus can lead to significant delay or failure of certain reform initiatives some member states package their policy priorities as reform to further their own policy goals this can cause distrust among member states as countries question whether reform proposals by other member states are base d on selfinterest or genuine desire to improve the system competing priorities some observers cite the inability of member states or secretariesgeneral to effectively prioritize reform initiatives as an obstacle to reform when secretary general annan pres ented his 2005 reform proposals for example he re quested that they be adopt ed by the general assembly not in increments but as package of reforms114 instead of considering large series of reform proposals some observers argue that member states should select only few reform priorities and work to ward their adoption and implementation others contend that the most efficient way to achieve reform may be for member states first to adopt reform initiatives th ey can agree to and then gradually work toward tackling the more divisive and complicated reform issues organizational structure and bureaucracy the united nations is highly complex and decentralized orga nization and therefore may be slow to consider or implement potential reforms some argue that there is culture of inaction115 in the united nations and that managers and staff are resistant to the implementation of new prog rams or changes to existing programs many contend that

overall lack of planning may affect the progress and ultimate succe ss of reforms already imple mented as well as those reforms currently being considered by the general assembly116 some also emphasize that without proper implement ation plans and followup member states will be unable to adequately gauge the overall effectiveness of reforms limited resources many observers note that significant challenge for reform efforts may be the effective implementation of reforms within the current budget some reform initiatives such as the peacebuilding commission were established by member states to operate within existing resources117 many argue that the existing budget limits may not be able to support all of the reform initiatives currently being considered some member states including the united states however cont end that money saved from other reforms such as mandate review could create fundi ng source for further reforms andor the creation of new programs or bodies external influences the complex relationships that exist among member states outside of the system may be another challenge affecting reform efforts these relationships are entirel independent of the united nations but can affect how countries work together with in the framework to achieve reform objectives military conflict religious and ethnic differences political conflict trade and economic issues and geography can all potentially impact reform cooperation among member states httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33848crs29 118 for more detailed account of the kasse baumsolomon provisi ons see crs

or if they may have influenced the adoption of reform measures at the united nations there is evidence that legislation such as th kassebaumsolomon amendment and the helmsbiden agreement may have led either directly or indirectly to substantive changes in policies the following paragraphs highlight selected reform legislation from 1986 to the present and note any subsequent changes to internal policy kassebaumsolomon amendment 19861987118 in the mid1980s some members of c ongress expressed concern that us influence over the budget was not propor tionate to its rate of assessment in 1986 congress passed legislation popular ly known as the kassebaumsolomon amendment which required that the us assessed contribution to the regular budget be reduced to 20 unless the unite d nations gave major financial contributors greater say in the budget process119 subsequently in 1986 the general assembly adopted new budget and planning process that incorporated consensus based budgeting as decisionmaking mechan ism thus giving member states with higher assessment levels potentially greater voice in the budget process office of internal oversight services 1993 in the early 1990s some members of congress and the administration were concerned with the apparent lack of oversight and accountability within the system in 1993 as part of the fy1994 state department appropriations act
