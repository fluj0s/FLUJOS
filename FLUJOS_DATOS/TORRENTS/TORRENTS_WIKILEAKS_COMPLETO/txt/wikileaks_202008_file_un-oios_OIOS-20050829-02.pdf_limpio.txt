and the length of service at one duty station the hardship elemen t depends on the assigned duty station category as defined by the international civil serv ice commission the nonremoval element

director of division of human resources management the comments made are reflected as appropriate in this final report ii audit objectives 6 the main objective of the audit was to asse ss the administration of the mobility and hardship allowance at unhcr and more specifically to evaluate the adequacy effectiveness and efficiency of internal controls evaluate whether adequate guidance and procedures re in place ensure compliance with regulations rules polic ies and administrative procedures iii audit scope and methodology 7 the audit focused on the administration and payment of mobility and hardship allowance paid for the period 1 january 2003 to 31 december 2004 there were disbursements of us 204 million as recorded on t he general ledger paid to approximately 1600 staff members 2 8 the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records from information made avail able oios analysed all payments made to staff and followedup on 76 cases where there w ere unusual or unexpected trends in payments for these cases the information in person nel files was compared to payroll data to ensure the correctness of the allowance payments iv audit findings and recommendations compliance with policies 9 according to stai20022 and to the unhcr staff administration and management manual samm chapter 3 paragraph 317 after five years of service at one duty station the amount paid for the mobility element of the allowan ce shall be reduced and the nonremoval element shall be discontinued exceptionally howev er the payment of the unreduced amount for mobility may continue for further year and t hat of nonremoval for further two years an exception can be granted if the needs of the ser vice require the staff member to remain at the duty station beyond five years 10 unhcr did not apply the exception rule b ut automatically granted twoyear extension for nonremoval this practice stems from memorandum dated 26 may 1997 from the chief policy and planning section to the chief staff support now pas both from dhrm the memorandum was drafted when the time lim it of the nonremoval element stic199728 dated 5 may 1997 was introduced th justification for an automatic extension to seven years was that it was in the int erest of consistency with other agencies since most organizations had interpreted exceptionally to mean almost always as assignments were always at the request of the or ganization moreover the memorandum explained that unhcr staff unlike in the secret ariat did not own their posts and could not expect to remain indefinitely at any one duty station it was again mentioned that if unhcr staff were obliged to remain at any duty stat ion for periods beyond the maximum sal of four years it would be always at the reques t of the organization 11 oios disagreed with this interpretation exceptionally does not mean almost always and in many cases the extension of sal is at the staff members request and in the staff members interest if it wasis at unhcrs re quest oios would not object if an extension was granted provided it has been process ed through the proper channels and approved by the appropriate authority 12 unlike nonremoval exceptions with relati on to mobility are approved on caseby case basis at the debriefing pas stated that exceptions were approved either by the head of pas or by the director of dhrm 13 it did not seem correct or logical that tw elements of the same allowance were treated differently when granting exceptions dhrm justifie d the continued payment of the allowance as it was only paid to few staff member s in oios opinion this is not reasonable justification particularly as dhrm was u nable to provide us with list of the staff receiving the twoyear extension moreover offi cial iomfom appears to have been issued on this matter oios recommended that dhrm r econsiders the practice and discontinue granting automatic exceptions to staff with each application reviewed on case3 bycase basis as is done for the mobility element the cost associated with twoyear extension for reference point of p4 level staff is some us 4100 and therefore there is potential for significant savings by unhcr dhrm agreed with oios recommendation and with immediate effect have implemented change in practice in future all cases where the staff members sal has been extended at the req uest of the office it will be reviewed by the chief pas for approval to grant an exceptional extension b administration of the allowance 14 oios assessed that the administration of m including all three elements of mobility hardship and nonremoval generally compl ied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and found that controls wer operating effectively during the period under review 15 some attention was required with regard to personnel files in some cases personnel action forms p5s were not filed chronologically and evidence that recoveries had been instigated where not on file one personnel file index number 784591 had been signed out in august 2004 and at the time of the audit it was still missing the personnel administration section has brought these findings to the attention of human resource staff the missing file has been located and is available on record 16 in may 2003 unhcr discontinued in accord ance with policies the yearly advance payments of mobility and hardship yet oio s found one case index number 067154 where the staff member was paid lump sum advance of us 18000 in july 2004 for the period june 2004 through may 2005 there was justification as to why lump sum advance was paid contrary to rules and procedu res oios suggested at the exit conference that dhrm review this case and document on file the reason for paying the advance in future advance lumpsum payments fo r mha should be made pas is in the process of reviewing and documenting the case for t he staff members personnel file 17 oios could not reconcile the earnings and deductions reports edrs data to the general ledger oios was led to understand that the edr listing of mha included other entitlements posted to the mha column in the report as there was other column to post them due to the restricted structure of the old mai nframe system oios found 24 general service staff who according to the edr listing d received mha in june and september 2004 the payroll section dismissed this as an erro r but they could not explain why these payments were recorded as mha in the edr oios pro vided list to dhrm and suggested that even though the amounts involved are not signi ficant us 4000 the erroneous payments be reviewed moreover oios found staff mbers whose salary was withheld while waiting for the separation action p35 to b processed were still included in the edr in one case reviewed the former staff member remai ned on the edr for eight months after separation pas is in the process of reviewing the cases with p ayroll 18 the system of calculating the allowance is manual and data such as the hardship category of an assigned duty station is not automat ically counted unlike the system imis used by the united nations as result there is higher risk of error oios noted that number of errors were made but they were normally captured when the staff member was reassigned nonetheless the manual system resulted in number of adjustment payments for example one case involved recovery of some us 2 6000 from one staff member 4 c msrp human resources and payroll module 19 during the development of the msrp human r esources and payroll module oios would advise dhrm and the financial resources servi ces to ensure appropriate and more accurate treatment of recording entitlement payment s and temporary assistance costs dhrm should also ensure that reporting is taken into acc ount early on in the development work and that the testing phase includes assuring the reliab ility of reported data 20 as mobility and hardship allowance is co mplicated entitlement this needs to be carefully taken into account in developing the msrp human resources and payroll module 21 pas has opened discussions with the financial resou rces services concerning the issues raised above v acknowledgement 22 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and cooperation extended to the auditors by the staff of the unhcr division of huma n resources management in particular for the designation of an audit focal point which greatly facilitated the audit while clearing issues with pas egbert c kaltenbach chief unhcr audit service office of internal oversight services
