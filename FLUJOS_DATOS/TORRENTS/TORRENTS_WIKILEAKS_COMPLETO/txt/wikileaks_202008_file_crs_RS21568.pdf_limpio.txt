governments sought different policy approaches that reflect ed substantial differences in economic structure and scale between the two republics this in turn presented insurmountable hurdles in the effort to harm onize the republics ec onomic policies some observers believe that the structural differences and divergent priorities between the two republics were simply too great to allow the union to function as single state in the long run the pull of moving closer to european integration played large role in keeping the union in force however montenegros l eadership never relinquished its ultimate goal of independence eu integration since playing key international role in brokering the belgrade agreement the european union remained the primary external force promoting continuation of joint serbia and montenegro state as both republics share the goal of attaining eu membership eu officials attempted to leverage this influence by insisting that serbia and montenegros surest and

toward achieving an saa with the eu should not hinder prospects for montenegros independe nce in fact they view independence as means toward quicker eu integration and the recent eu decision to
