security marc labonte government and finance division july 18 2007 abstract one reason that social security reform is on the congressional agenda is the large projected longterm ﬁscal shortfall facing social security estimated at an average of 09 of gross domestic product gdp between now and 2080 but relatively little attention has been given to the potential longterm shortfall faced by the rest of the government which is estimated to be more than 65 times larger than social securitys shortfall the governments overall ﬁscal gap under an extension of current policy estimated at an average of 72 of gdp between now and 2080 is the result of the large projected increase in future spending that is not matched by any projected increase in tax revenue most of the increase in spending occurs in medicare and medicaid social security is the third largest contributor to the ﬁscal gap if viewed from the revenue side the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts increased the ﬁscal gap by an average of 22 of gdp between now and 2080 the ﬁscal gap measure may be useful to policymakers because it highlights the unsustainability of current policy in the long term and the potential cost of inaction and it provides mea sure that can be used to estimate the implications of current policy for the macroeconomy and generational equityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22232g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

longterm fiscal shortfall that social security is projected to face in particular observers point to the 75year shortfall faced by the social security trust fund which amounts to present value defined below of 47 trillion according to official estimates while this amount is unquestionably large the governments ability to close that shortfall under current policy depends on the fiscal position of nonsocial security spending and revenues if the rest of the budget were in surplus then revenues could be transferred from the rest of the budget to finance promised social security benefits without raising taxes or cutting spending on social security however if the rest of the government were in deficit then there would be general revenues to transfer to social security to finance the benefits promised to retirees without policy changes that improved the governments overall fiscal position thus to determine whether the government will have the means to compensate for social securitys fiscal shortfall and honor promised benefits look at the governments overall fiscal position there is official estimate of the governments overall fiscal shortfall or fiscal gap there have been two recent unofficial estimates however that reached similar conclusions according to the more detailed estimate the gove rnments overall fiscal gap to 2080 equals an annual average of 72 of gdp or sum of 363 trillion in present value terms as seen in figure 1 under an extension of current policy 1 in this estimate social security accounts for 47 trillion of the fiscal gap to 2080 and the rest of the government accounts for 316 trillion of the gap in other words the projected fiscal gap facing the rest of the government is more than 65 times larger than the one facing social security 1 alan auerbach william gale and peter orszag sources of the longterm fiscal gap tax notes may 24 2004 p 1049 unless otherwise noted similar results can be found in jagdeesh gokhale and kent smetters fiscal and generational imbalances washington dc aei press 2003 cbo presented gokhale and smetters results in congressional budget office measures of the us governments fiscal position under current law august 2004 but presented data only over an infinite horizon please note that auerbach et 47 trillion projection of so cial securitys 75year shortfall is similar to the social security trustees official projection but based on different assumptions including the use of different and longer time period 20042080 vs 20072081 different forecasting assumptions and older data

trillions of pvrest of government social security source aue rbac h gale and or szag 200 4 note pv present value gdp gross domestic product see xt for details the fiscal gap measures in present discounted value terms the cumulative excess of future spending over future revenues plus the current national debt to keep the national debt from rising as share of gdp until 2080 taxes would need to be immediately raised or spending immediately cut by 72 of gdpfar greater than the changes required to balance the fy2006 budget because the budget deficit is forecast to grow significantly from present levels under an extension of current policy 2 the fiscal gap like budget deficits in general can be eliminated only through higher taxes or lower spending there is objective way to assign the source of the fiscal gap to excessive spending or inadequate taxation by definition the fiscal gap is caused by spending exceeding taxation whether this means that spending should be lower or taxes higher is value judgment but in the discussion below the reader should keep in mind that future deficits are not growing because spending rises under current policy rather future deficits grow because revenues are not projected to rise along with spending fiscal gap calculations are made in present value terms because 1 deficit today cannot be meaningfully compared to 1 deficit in 50 years present discounted value calculations adjust for the fact that dollar borrowed today woul d grow because of compound interest if dollar were borrowed today at say 3 real rate of interest it would grow to 438 in 50 years in this example the fiscal gap could be reduced by 1 by instituting onetime tax increase or spending cut equal to 1 today or by instituting onetime tax or spending cut equal to 438 in real terms 2 auerbach et use an adjusted version of cbos baseline as the basis of their projection it differs from cbo over the first 10 years of the projection by assuming that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts will be extended tax extenders that are routinely renewed will not expire alternative minimum tax amt reform will not be allowed to expire and discretionary spending will keep pace with population growth after the first 10 years they use the trustees projections for medicare and social security and cbos projections for medicaid they assume that discretionary spending other entitlement spending and income tax revenue will stay constant as percentage of gdp for more information on the cbo baseline see crs report rl31414 baseline budget projections discussion of issues by marc labonte

eliminate the fiscal gap are smaller if taken now rather than in the future failure to adjust future sums into present value terms overstates the contributions of future financial flows relative to present flows if future deficits were not discounted as 5year and 10year budget totals are usually presented then the fiscal gap would be much larger than 363 trillion3 for example social securitys annual deficits in 75 years are large equal to about 2 of gdp but social security is currently in surplus and will remain so until 2018 therefore social security reduces the fiscal gap in the short run and its overall contribution to the fiscal gap is relatively small 09 of gdp once its distant deficits are discounted to the present by contrast budget deficits today outside of social secur ity will compound under current policy and become very large in the distant future the budget deficit outside of social security in 2004 was 49 of gdp more than twice as large as social securitys deficit at its 75year peak the policy changes that moved the budget from surplus to deficit in the past four years have increased the fiscal gap by more than social securitys total contribution to the fiscal gap g15g142g138g156g158g155g146g151g144g561g157g145g142g561g8g146g156g140g138g149g561g9g138g153g561g152g151g561g157g145g142g561g21g153g142g151g141g146g151g144g561g21g146g141g142g561 because social security is intended to be entirely selffinanced it is the only program that can be assigned portion of the governments fiscal gap in straightforward manner although the same sort of straightforward comparison of spending and revenue could be made for medicare part it could not be made for medicare parts b c or d since they were designed to rely heavily on general revenues most other spending programs receive general revenue because most other programs do not receive specific revenue streams there is way to compare projections of any other programs spending to its revenue therefore if the sources of the fiscal gap were to be broken down by spending programs somewhat arbitrary assumption about how much general revenue to dedicate to each program must be made in one scenario auerbach et assume that each program continues to receive its current fraction of general revenue for the next 75 years in other words they assume that each programs share of the revenue pie in the future is determined by its share of the pie today this assumption means that spending programs that grow relative to other programs in the future such as medicare and medicaid will be assigned higher portions of the fiscal gap than if some other assumption were made estimates of the fiscal gap under other assumptions can be found in their article medicare and medicaid spending are projected to increase from 38 of gdp in 2004 to 167 of gdp in 2080 this increase is driven by the aging of the population and the assumption that health care spending will continue to grow as share of gdp table 1 shows that the rapid projected growth in future medicare and medicaid spendingwhich are not matched by any corresponding increase in revenues under current policyare responsible for most of the fiscal gap by this measure similar results were found in another recent estimate of the fiscal gap published by aei press 4 3 some economists argue that the fiscal gap should be measured over an infinite horizon rather than 75 years the main drawback to the 75year period is that even if the fiscal gap were eliminated it would reappear in the 76th year the main drawback to using an infinite horizon is that the longer the projection window the larger the uncertainty and errors in the projection will be if an infinite horizon is us ed the fiscal gap increases to 105 of gdp or 855 trillion in present value terms in any case the results are qualitatively similar under either time horizon the bulk of the gap is due to increases in spending on social security medicare and medicaid 4 jagdeesh gokhale and

fiscal gap is not the result of spending or revenue policy decisions in isolation but rather represents the shortfall under current policy of past and projected future revenue relative to past and projected future spending table 1 illustrates the contribution of various spending programs to the fiscal gap given current revenue policy the opposite should also be able to be seen the contribution of different revenue decisions given current spending policy the major policy change affecting revenue in the past few years has been the 2001 tax cuts pl 10716 which were expanded and accelerated in 2003 pl 10827 assuming that the tax cuts are not allowed to sunset auerbach et have estimated that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts have increased the 75year fiscal gap by an average of 22 of gdp or total of 109 trillion in present value terms 5 this equals nearly onethird of the total fiscal gap and is larger than the contribution of any single spending category except medicare to the fiscal gap the authors estimate that total spending would need to be immediately reduced by 9 to cancel out the effects of the tax cuts on the fiscal gap 5 this estimate assumes that the amt has been reformed but does not assign the cost of amt reform to the tax cuts even though interaction between the amt and the tax cuts raise the cost of amt reform

would need to be reduced by 72 of gdp annually between now and 2080 to keep the national debt stable as share of gdp deficits at the end of the projection will be even larger than the 75year average financing deficits this large on an ongoing basis would be unprecedented and lead to continually rising national debt if current policy were not altered at some point credito rs would likely conclude that they could not reasonably expect the government to honor its debt and refuse to continue financing the deficit this would disrupt government operations and lead to serious economic and financial disruptions the fiscal gap highlights this danger while current year deficits or even 10year deficit projections do not

large budget deficits would still have negative effect on economic growth private capital investment spending must be financ ed out of national saving or foreign borrowing national saving consists of household saving business saving and government saving when the government runs budget deficit it has negative saving rate in the case of foreign borrowing the budget deficit is said to crowd out private investment because it is financed out of private saving that is diverted from financing private investment since interest rates are determined by the supply of national saving and investment demand budget deficits raise interest rates all else being equal private investment is source of economic growth if budget deficits crowd out private investment then the future size of the economy will be smaller and future living standards will be lower than they otherwise would have been 7 to the extent that shortfalls in national saving can be financed through foreign borrowing interest rates will not rise and private investment will not be crowded out but foreign borrowing comes to the united states in the form of trade deficit americans can borrow abroad only if they import more than they export while foreign borrowing is one factor that appears to have prevented the budget deficit from pushing up interest rates at present it is highly unlikely that the united states could borrow enough abroad to prevent longterm crowding out of private investment under current policy 6 these issues are analyzed in greater depth in crs report rl32747 social security and medicare the

budget deficits become unsustainably large because of the power of compound interest spending cuts or tax increases that reduce the budget deficit today would reduce the fiscal gap more than if the same spending cuts or tax increases were implemented in the future that is because reductions in the budget deficit would reduce interest payments on the national debt which compound to further reduce future deficits from what they otherwise would be by contrast if action is taken the current trajectory of deficits wi ll lead to larger national debt and higher interest payments which will compound to increase future deficits further for example auerbach et estimate that if action is taken betw een now and 2014 the fiscal gap will increase by another 11 percentage points of gdp

large fiscal gap may have little effect on economic outcomes today it portends significant reductions in economic output in the longterm future budget deficits allow current generations to consume more than they otherwise would by borrowing against national saving to finance spending this implies that consumption is in effect being transferred from future generations since they will consume out of smaller economy to current generations under current policy to compound the generational transfer the payasyougo nature of elderly entitlement spending means that if entitlement spending as share of gdp increases as current policy dictates it would be financed through higher taxes on future workers as result of these two factors current policy makes current generations better off and future generations worse off than if there were fiscal gap equity questions can be identified but not resolved by economic analysisonly the political process can determine whether it is fair to transfer consumption from future generations to current generations g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 marc labonte specialist in
