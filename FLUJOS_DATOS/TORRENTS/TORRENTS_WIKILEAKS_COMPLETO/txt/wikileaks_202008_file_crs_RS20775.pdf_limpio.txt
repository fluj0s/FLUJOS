g343g561g11g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561 in cases of significant differences with the president over foreign policy especially deployments of us military forces abroad congress has generally found that use of its constitutionallybased power of the purse to be the most effective way to compel president to take actions regarding use of us military force overseas that he otherwise might not agree to thus on various occasions since the vietnam war era congress has used funding cutoffs or significant restrictions on the use of funds as means of ending or circumscribing the use of us military personnel for foreign operations as the examples set out below indicate the use of funding cutoffs and restrictions to curtail or terminate the presidents use of us military force abroad has proven to be much more efficacious in giving effect to congresss policy views in this area than has the war powers resolution

g11g151g141g152g140g145g146g151g138g561 during the last years of the vietnam war there were number of efforts in congress to attach amendments to legislation to restrict military actions by the united states in the indochina region as part of larger effort to compel the withdrawal of us military forces from the area nearly all of these proposals did not pass more than one house of congress due to vigorous opposition from the president to them those that did succeed in enactment into law are as follows on december 22 1970 congress cleared the special foreign assistance act of 1971 hr 19911 for

since its enactment in 1973 there is specific instance when the congress has successfully utilized the war powers resolution to compel the withdrawal of us military forces from foreign deployments against the presidents will ever president from president nixon forward has taken the position that the war powers resolution is an unconstitutional infringement on the authority of the president as commanderinchief to utilize the armed forces of the united states to defend what he determines are the vital national security interests of the united states it should be noted however that through co mpromise with the congress in september 1983 president reagan agreed to the multinational force in lebanon resolution pl 98119 that determined that the requirements of section 4a1 of the war powers resolution became operative on august 29 1983 and that congress authorized the continued participation of the us marines in the lebanon multinational force for 18 months president reagan signed pl 98119 on october 12 1983 soon after enactment of pl 98119 241 us marines in lebanon were killed on october 23 1983 by suicide truck bombing on february 7 1984 president reagan announced the marines would be redeployed and on march 30 1984 reported to congress that us participation in the multinational force in lebanon had ended it is also important to note that beginning in august 1990 following the iraqi invasion of kuwait president bush over period of months deployed substantial number of us military personnel to saudi arabia to defend us friends in the regi on and in an effort to induce iraq to withdraw its military forces from kuwait these actions were taken without express authorization by congress under the war powers resolution or any other act of congress months later in january 1991 congress passed hjres 77 the authorization for use of military force against iraq resolution pl 1021 which president bush signed on january 14 1991 in that legislation congress declared that hjres 77 constituted specific statutory authorization for the president to use united states armed forces to achieve objectives set out in various cited united nations resolutions relating to iraqs aggression against kuwait if he made certification to congress that such use of force was necessary congress also noted in this bill that it constituted the authorization contemplated by section 5b of the war powers resolution however in his signing statement regarding hjres 77 president bush noted the following as i made clear to congressional leaders at the outset my request for congressional support did not and my signing this resolution does not constitute any change in the longstanding positions of the executive branch on either the presidents constitutional authority to use the armed forces to defend vital us interests or the constitutionality of the war powers resolution i am pleased however that differences on these issues betwee n the president and many in the congress have not prevented us from uniting in common objective the president in short did not characterize request for congressional support for his actions as request for congressional authorization of them although congress for its part characterized its action as requisite authorization more recently controversy over us military involv ement in kosovo led to an effort to use the war powers resolution as means to address the question of whether the president could order us combat activity abroad in the absence of congressional authorization to do so this debate began in earnest when on march 26 1999 president clinton notified the congress consistent with the war powers resolution that on march 24 1999 us military forces at his direction and in coalition with nato allies had commenced air strikes against yugoslavia in response to

against the ethnic albanian population in kosovo the presidents action taken in the absence of congressional authorization led to efforts to use the war powers resolution as vehicle to either support or overturn the presidents actions congress also attempted to use denial of funding for the kosovo operation on april 28 1999 the house of representatives passed hr 1569 by vote of 249 180 this bill

by vote of 2427 this joint resolution would have declared state of war between the united states and the government of the federal republic of yugoslavia the house on that same day also defeated on
