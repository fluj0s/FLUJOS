terrorist groups members of one indigenous network je maah islamiyah ji which has had extensive ties to qaeda are known to have helped two of the september 11 2001 hijackers and have confessed to plotting and carrying out attacks against western targets these include the deadliest rrorist attack since september 2001 the october 12 2002 bombing in bali indonesia that killed appr oximately 200 people mostly westerners since the bali bombing in 2002 which ji is suspected of carrying out crackdowns by various governments in the region encouraged and in some cases supported by the us government nd military are believe d to have severely weakened the organization its ability and willingness to carry out attacks against western targets ji however has not been eradicated to combat the threat the us has pr essed countries in the region to arrest suspected terrorist individuals and organi zations funded and tr ained indonesias elite counterterrorist unit and deployed troops to the southern philippines to advise the philippine military in their fight against the violent abu sayyaf group it has also launched regional maritime security initiative to enhance security in the straits of malacca increased intelligence sharing operations restarted military military relations with indonesia nd provided or requested from congress substantial aid for indonesia and the philippines also ce 2001 thailand and the united states have substantially increased thei r antiterrorism cooperation the responses of countries in the regi on to both the threat and to the us reaction generally have varied with the intensity of their concerns about the threat to their own stability and domestic politics in general singapore malaysia and the philippines were quick to crack down on militant groups and share intelligence with the united states and australia whereas i ndonesia began to do so only after attacks or arrests revealed the severity of the threat to its citizens many governments view increased american pressure and military presence in their region with ambivalence because of the political sensitivity of the issue with both mainstream islamic and secular nationalist groups the muslim insurgency in southern thailand has escalated in recent years as has terrorist activity in southern areas of the philippines the report looks at the rise of isla mist militancy and the ji network before discussing terrorism in the region and c oncludes with section on options for us policy strategies include placing greater emphasis on attacking the institutions

interpretation of islam and willingness to push political and social agenda to implement islamic law distinctions are also drawn between those ra dicals and extremists who would advocate an islamist agenda through the political proce ss and those terrorists and militants who would also use violence or the threat of violence to promote such cause terrorism in southeast asia the rise of islamist militancy in southeast asia overview while there has been significant antiwestern terrorist activity in southeast asia counterterror measures in recent years appear to have significantly degraded antiwestern terrorist groups ability to launc h attacks against western targets in the region us attention in the region has been focused on radical islamist groups in southeast asia particularly the jemaah islamiyah terrorist network that are known or alleged to have ties to the qaeda ne twork many of these groups threaten the status quo of the region by seeking to creat independent islamic states in majority muslim areas overthrow existing secular governments andor establish new supra national islamic state encompassing indone sia malaysia singapore the southern philippines and southern tha iland in pursuit of these obj ectives they have planned and carried out violent attacks against american and other western targets as well as against southeast asian targets add itionally qaeda has used its southeast asia cells to help organize and finance its global activities including the september 11 attacks and to provide safe harbor to qaeda operatives such as the convicted organizer of the 1993 bombi ng of the world trade center ramzi yousef1 combating antiamerican terrorism in southeast asia presents the bush administration and congress with delicat foreign policy problem most regional governments also feel threatened by homegrown or imported islamic militant groups and therefore have ample incentive to coope rate with the us antiterrorist campaign despite mutual interests in combating terrorism southeast asian governments have to balance these security concerns with domestic political considerations although proponents of violent radical islam remain very small minority in southeast asia many governments view increased american pressure and military presence in their region with concern because of the politi cal sensitivity of the issue with both mainstream islamic and s ecular nationalist groups the rise in antiamerican sentiment propelled by both the usled invasion and occupation of iraq and many southeast asian muslims perceptions of americas stance on the israelipalestinian conflict as blatantly proisrael makes it even more difficult for most governmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34194crs2 2 daljit singhthe terrorist threat in southeast asia in

is to find way to confront the terrorist elements without turning them into heroes or martyrs in the broader south east asian islamic community furthermore the continued activities of qaeda and jemaah islamiyah will require coordinated international response in region where multinational instituti ons and cooperation are weak southeast asia has been the home of indigenous islamic militant groups for decades traditionally the linkages among these groups were relatively weak and most operated only in their own country or islands focusing on domestic issues such as promoting the adoption of islamic law sharia and seeking independence from central government control in indonesia various schools of islamic thought have competed for followers and public attention but most have not called for an islamic state the more radical groups effectively were kept in check by strong leadership from presidents sukarno 19501965 and especially suharto 1967 1998 moderate islamic groups formed the main legal opposition to the suharto regime which ended in may 1998 since suhartos fall religious consciousness has been on the rise among indonesian muslims giving greater political space for ra dical groups to operate in recent years indonesian counterterror efforts have been successful and appear to have significantly curtailed ji operations the philippines has had violent muslim separatist movement for more than century the moros of mindanao and th sulu archipelago including the island of jolo fought stubborn bloody and ultimately futile insurgency against the american occupation of the southern ph ilippines following the spanish american war 1898 several muslim ex tremist groups in the phili ppines have focused their operations in the relatively isolated muslimmajority regions in

1902 series of central governmentdirected assimilation policies were ins tituted which has inspired va rying degrees of resistance from the ethnic malay muslims many of whom have sought to preserve their own identity by the late 1960s number of armed separatist gr oups had formed but attempts to forge broad coalition of resistance failed in 1981 bangkok revamped its approach to the south emphasi zing economic development and public participation in governance and encouraging hundreds of fighters to accept political amnesty the shift was largely successful and armed movement s weakened although residual groups became more radicalized nd continued guerilla activities through the 1990s muslim political participati on increased and violence declined significantly however since 2004 sectar ian violence has surged in the southern provinceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34194crs3 in contrast to its neighboring nations malaysia does not currently have significant indigenous separatist group engagi ng in violent actions against the public while malaysia has been used gatherin g point for members of various terrorist organizations it has been relatively free of the terrorist attacks that have troubled other southeast asian nations although th ere are political parties and people within malaysia who support the cr eation of more conserva tive islamic government in malaysia the selfidentified moderate muslim nation has history of comparative religious tolerance and rejection of violence done by socalled islamic fundamentalists at the sa time the malaysian govern ment has been staunch critic of rhetoric that conf lates terrorism with islamic fundamenta lism which it sees as being antiislam the emergence of radical islamic moveme nts in southeast asia in the 1990s can be traced to the conjunction of several phenomena among these were reaction to globalization which has been particularly associated with the united states in the minds of regional elites frustration with repression by secularist governments the desire to create panislamic southeast asia reaction to the israeli occupation in the west bank and gaza strip and the arrival of terrorist veterans of years of fighting in afghanistan southeast asian terrorist and militant groups can be placed on spectrum that spans the relatively narrow goals and objectives of the separatist muslims in southern thailand or southe rn philippines to the global antiwestern agenda of qaeda in between can be placed groups such as ji that has an internal debate over the relative emphasis on achieving an islamist agenda within individual states as opposed to focusing their fight directly ag ainst western targets these groups as well as others such as the abu sayyaf group w ill be explored in greater detail below the rise of qaeda in southeast asia beginning in the earlytomid 1990s the qaeda terrorist network made significant inroads into the southeast as ia region qaedas southeast asian operatives who have been primarily of middle eastern origin appear to have performed three primary tasks first they set up local cells predominantly headed by arab members of qaeda that served as regional offices

also has taken advantage of southeast asias generally loose financial controls to use various countries in the region as places to raise transmit and launder the networks funds by 2002 according to

the relationship between jemaah islamiyah and qaeda although many an alysts at first assumed that ji is qaedas southeast asian affiliate reports including leaks from interrogations of captured ji and qaeda operatives have shown that the two groups are discrete organizations with differing t hough often overlapping agendas11 whereas qaedas focus is global and definitively targets the west jemaah islamiyah is focused on radicalizing muslim southeast as ia starting with indonesia and some ji leaders are said to feel that attack ing western targets will undermine this goal after the arrests

bilateral rather than multilateral in nature in the near term barring another major terrorist attack it is difficult to foresee these features of us strategy changing since they are based upon features of inte rnational relations in southeast asia relatively weak multilateral institutions the poor histor of multilatera l cooperation and the wariness on the part of most re gional governments of being perceived as working too closely with the united states addressing these deficiencies could be elements of the longterm goal of competing against terrorist ideologies thus far the strategy of arresting jem aah islamiyahs leadership is thought to have crippled jis capabilities significantly this may mean that continued push to arrest the networks leadership could dramatically reduce jis ability to threaten western targets directly additionally it appears that middle and lowerlevel ji functionaries level of co mmitment may not be as fana tical as commonly thought114 however the

that addresses host of real or perceived social economic political and ultimately ideological challenges120 some analysts believe southeast asian states perceive the united states as focused on the
