increasingly aware that issues and challenges surrounding subnational governance in afghanistan will be crucial to national deve lopment stability and security this period has also been time of extraordinary change in subnational governance structures among those changes has been the introduction and expansion of community development councils cdcs established under the nation solidarity programme nsp to approxi mately twothirds of the villages in afghanistan this working paper presents findings from areu research on subnational governance in afghanistan including the role that cdcs play at community levels it is more detailed presentation of findings that are reviewed in synthesis paper covering the research on subnational governance as whole entitled subnational statebuilding in afghanistan areu march 2008 that synthesis report finds that while significant progress has been made towards establishing new institutions many challenges remain in making subnational governance structures sustainable coherent and effective the development of legitimate and effective subnational governance will increasingly depend on coherent strategy incorporating shared vision of the role of subnational government entities in various sectors and their relations with nonstate actors and customary governance arrangements the development of policy toward cdcs must be viewed in the framework of this larger challenge and solutions to questions surrounding the future of cdcs must be resolved in its light key findings the creation of cdcs under the nsp have in troduced dramatic change in the develop ment resources available to many communities in the country and where these resources have been converted to successful subproj ects the acceptance and legitimacy of the programme and by extension the government has been expanded however the relationship of cdcs as newly introduced institution within the local governance system as whole is complex and varied community acceptance of cdcs is conditioned by past experience comprehensiveness of material and human resources available for facilitation and local implementation patterns it is also heavily dependent on the delivery and use of resources and declines with delays or misuse of resources the implementation of all phases of nsp has been carried out in varied ways including elections cdc composition and configuration development of community development plans cdps and the scope of activities take n on by cdcs outside project selection and implementation this variation is complex and making compromises in one area such as the form of elections held may facilitate gains in others such as womens influence on decisions through direct participation in meetings local norms and customs are important in determining these outcomes but also important are the resources creativity and depth of involvement in th area of the facilitating partner while many cdc members report that they are involved in nonnsp governance functions such as dispute resolution th functions are not universal where they occur they are often carried out in combination with customary structures and individuals forming hybrid form of authority partial exception is where previous governance structures were focused on one powerholder in such instances cdcs have reoriented the sources of local authority th rough their collective and elected nature the changing face of local governance co mmunity development councils in afghanistan 9 there are barriers to genuine participat ion of women in both the development functions and governance functions of the cdcs women participate less in governance functions than in project selection and th eir participation in general appears to be dependent on the quality of facilitation in the absence of facilitation womens participation suffers at an even faster rate than overall cdc activity an exception to this seems to be in few social protection functions great deal of attention is currently being paid to the current and futu re place of cdcs in the local governance systems but this attent ion has yet to produce coherent and clear vision for cdcs or their relationships with other levels of government in discussions of cdcs in afghanistan there is an implicit and at times explicit distinction drawn between their role in local development and their role as governance institutions this debate has become unnecessarily and harmfully polarised cdcs in their role as managers of the co mmunitydriven development process of nsp are already functioning as governance institutions they are involved in governance for development in this capacity cdcs have made considerable contributions to the immediate welfare of community members an d made important contributions to the inclusion and representation of marginalised groups particularly women in such activity key issues for future policy toward cdcs it is important to overcome the artificial distinction between governance and develop ment cdcs already play the role of an institution involved in governance for development with other roles related to that co re identity at the same time it is vitally important to consider the future of cdcs and what role they can play in achieving improved development and livelihoods in context of effective democratic and culturally appropriate governance institutions the establishment in 2007 of the independent directorate for local governance idlg may help to provide locus for the development of policy for the future of cdcs such policy if it is to enjoy wide political acceptance must answer several key questions should cdcs be formally recognised as state institutions as of early 2008 bylaw calling for increased formalisation of cdcs was being circulated this approach in the absence of more comprehensive legal framew ork stresses the formalisation of cdcs without paying sufficient attent ion to the local variations in cdc functions the most appropriate mix of functions for them and the benefits that may accrue from their status as communitybased and not governmental organisations at the same time institutional means for supporting cdcs shou ld form part of the mixture of policy options available when determining the future role of these councils what will be the resources both material and in terms of technical assistance and facilitation available to cdcs after the d of the nsp cdcs have functioned most positively in the selection and implementation of nsp subprojects and their acceptance legitimacy and ability to perform ot her tasks are all related to the resources they bring to communities consideration of the future role of cdcs must include discussion of the range of resources that will be available and the mix of governmental and nongovernmental involvement in providing these what will be the appropriate scale for the delivery of such resources cdcs are already in some areas combining efforts through joint projects and in other areas initiatives to cluster cdcs are underway these efforts suggest that clusters that respond to locally appropriate development scales appear more naturally due to infrastructure or afghanistan research and evaluation unit 10 resource interdependencies that may be present at that level this raises questions about the organisation of development representation below and at the district level should cdcs perform administrative governan ce tasks as well as development tasks mandating single universal governance role for cdcs would produce mixed outcomes due to the variation in how cd cs currently function in rela tion to customary governance structures while there is evidence of fruitf ul governance improvements linked to cdcs these are often achieved through the implicit or explicit recognition of preexisting governance patterns not wholesale attempts to replace them how will the impact of cdcs on the representation of women and other marginalised groups be strengthened because the role of cdcs in empowering women and other vulnerable groups is dependent on active facilitation it cannot be assume that the gains made to date will persist as nsp comes to close consideration of how to support the broadened inclusion and representation seen in the context of cdcs must continue these questions can not be answered in isolat ion they are closely related to many other issues of subnational governance policy these include the roles and relationships of district governors the form of districtlev elected representation in the future the fiscal status of subnational state units and the sequencing of changes in all of these areas it is hoped that this discussion of cd c functioning over recent years can contribute to this vital process the changing face of local governance co mmunity development councils in afghanistan 11 1 introduction since 2004 the government of afghanistan goa and its international partners have become increasingly aware that issues and challenges surrounding subnational governance in afghanistan will be crucial to the countrys development stability and security this period has also been time of extraordinary change in subnational governance structures during 200506 provincial councils shurae wolayati were elected and seated provincial development committees pdcs were establis hed public administrative reform efforts expanded to some provinces and districts and the national solidarity programme nsp and its associated community development counc ils cdcs expanded into larger numbers of communities the centrality of governance and statebuilding issues to the development agenda of the of afghan government and its international partners in combination with the number and complexity of initiatives affecting subnational governance has meant that definite need for improved understanding of governance at subnational levels to assess what changes these developments were producing or might produce in the future to address this situation areu conducted extensive field research on subnational governance over approximately 18 months from april 2005 to november 2006 the nsp is one of the most wideranging development initiatives in afghanistan since 2001 and it is regarded by many as one of the most successful as such it requires careful analysis this working paper presents findings on the functioning of cdcs formed under nsp it provides more detailed presentation f f i n d i n g s t h t r l s r v i w d i n synthesis paper covering the research on subnational governance as whole called subnational statebuilding in afghanistan 200506 areu march 2008 those who wish discussion of the place of cdcs in the broa der subnational governance and statebuilding environment should refer to that publication 1 there is some duplication of discussion in the two reports the key finding of that synthesis report is that while significant progress has been made towards establishing new institutions many challenges remain in making subnational governance structures sustainable coherent and effective governance at local levels still confronts problems of persistent insecurity informal power relations corruption and patronage and inadequate state capacity beyond these contextual difficulties the development of legitimate and effective subnational governance will increasingly depend on coherent strategy incorporating shared vision of the role of subnational government entities in various sectors and their relations with nonstate actors and informal governance arrangements the development of policy towards cdcs must be viewed in the framework of this larger challenge and solu tions to questions surr ounding their future must be resolved in its light 11 key concepts given the attention paid to governance issues internationally and in afghanistan it is worth clarifying the conceptual framework used in this research by briefly discussing the concept of governance as well as few related concepts governance governance concerns ways of organising resources and responsibilities towards collective ends at this broad level governance can be defined as the process whereby societies or organisations make important decisions termine whom they involve and how they 1 this synthesis paper also describes the rationale conceptual framework and methodology of the overall research project in more detail afghanistan research and evaluation unit 12 render account 2 all governance analysis therefore involves questions of process participation and accountability however the analysis of how governance takes place is not meaningful without considering the context and domain that is being analysed in short one must always consider the question of governance where and for what governance contexts may include but ar not limited to households communities societies and nationstates as well as organisations like firms bureaucracies religious and nongovernmental entities areus subnational research program has examined several subnational contexts that is how decisions are made and implemented that affect populations below the national level the focus of this working paper is the level of the community as defined by the nsp community is grouping of more than 25 families corresponding to existing information about villages statebuilding statebuilding refers to efforts to increase th importance of state actors structures and processes in governance systems to shift governance toward government it is the attempt to reform build and support government institutions making them more effective in generating public goods statebuilding implies conscious intervention to improve the capacity reach and performance of state institutions statebuilding is inherently both political and technical the gap between the political and technical dimensions of statebuilding can be aggravated by the urgent imperatives of postconflict reconstruction which reduce the ability to tailor programmes to local realities and the easier transferability of technocratic and organisational lessons than complex political or cultural ones 3 this research aims to analyse the issues that emerge when interventions with statebuilding im plications interact with the afghanistans complex governance context this working pa per addresses these aspects of statebuilding in relation to the formation of cdcs with the goal of improving local governance 12 research objectives and methodology the primary objective of the research from which this working paper draws was to identify and better understand key issues affecting statebuilding interventions at subnational levels in afghanistan the research also aimed to explore how governance is changing at subnational levels particularly in respon to programmatic interventions and any implications for current and future governance programming research methodology the design of this research included particular focus on governance changes taking place in relation to the nsp the research focused on six provinces and several districts within each of those provinces with the exception of one province paktia where district work took place the intention was to have 12 sample districts though these were not ultimately evenly distributed across provinces it is important to note that this selection was designed to maximise variation in local conditions within the constraints of security but is not statistically valid sa mple for quantitative analysis 2 t plumptre what is governance

evaluation unit 14 13 political and inst itutional context the afghan political context is characteristised by formal state centralisation combined with actual fragmentation of power among changing variety of local and regional actors4 this fragmentation has been expressed in recent areu work in terms of the distinction between the jure and facto state 5 this model emphasises the divergence between formal and actual governance in afghanistan statebuilding in afghanistan could be described as the progressive attempt to move the formal and the actu closer together the formal institutional context in afghanistan is informed by preexisting institutional arrangements and the post2001 bonn process afghanistan has 34 provinces divided into 398 rural districts although that number has not been ratified by national institutions despite its determination being shortterm benchmark in the afghanistan compact 6 there are approximately 217 municipalities di vided among 34 provincial municipalities the capitals of each province and an unclear number of rural municipalities that often corresponds to the seat of district government the number of rural communities or villages in afghanistan is matter of interpre tation the central statistics office counts 40020 rural villages while the nsp counts 24 000 communities for the purposes of establishing community development councils 7 though this working paper focuses on the r l f c d c s n t h c m m u n i t l v l i t i s n c s s r t c n s i d r l s t h v r l l subnational governance structure what follows is brief introduction to the subnational governance institutions in afghanistan the provincial level provincial government consists of the line departments of the main sectoral ministries the provincial governors office the elected provincial council and in some provinces the local offices of other agencies such as the national security department nsd the afghanistan independent human rights commission aihrc and the independent afghanistan reform and civil service commission iarcsc the ministerial departments have responsibility for service delivery in areas such as policing health rural development and education until late 2007 the governors office had the dual role of representing the president and reporting to th ministry of interior provincial councils pcs were elected simultaneously with the national assembly in 2005 and have an unclear mandate comprising advisory conflict resolution and oversight roles provincial development committees pdcs are not constitutionally mand ated but were established to bring order to the disparat coordination and rudimentary planning activities springing up around the country by 2005 and to create structure for provincial input into national planning processes the district level districts are currently the lowest level of fo rmally recognised government administration in afghanistan their administrative structure reflects that of the province government at the district level consists of district office s of some central ministries the number of which is function of the district grade and can vary from only few departments such as health education and rural rehabilitation an d development up to as many as twenty departments in addition there is typically police department and prosecutor in each

woleswal has been representative of the ministry of interior and formally plays coordinating role8 informally the role of the uluswal varies depending on relations with the provincial authorities local customary an d informal powerholders and often includes dispute resolution and other problemsolving activities in most cases uluswals maintain some kind of semiformal advisory councils called shuras or liaise with community leaders maliks arbabs or qaryadars where these remain significant figures their relations with cdcs range from close function cooperation to having interaction the municipal level municipal administration is led by mayors currently appointed by the president municipalities have functional and servicedeli very responsibility mainly for urban services and revenue collection responsibilities larger provincial municipalities are divided into urban districts nahia and have varying representative systems sometimes including neighbourhood representatives wakiligozar held over from prewar administrative systems all municipalities with the exception of kabul are theoretically overseen by the newly formed independent directorate of local governance idlg the village level village institutions largely informal and widely varying across the country are discussed in more detail throughout this paper many ngos have relied on shura type bodies that are constituted in various ways to assist in community mobilisation and programme implemen tation as of early 2008 the nsp had throug h nongovernmental partners facilitated the election of cdcs in approximately twothirds of the villages in the country constitutional and ands provisions the constitution provides for increasing repr esentation at subnational levels through the election of representative bodies at village district provincial and municipal levels9 provincial councils were elected and seated in 2005 as of early 2008 however elections had not been held for any of the other bodies called for and there were firm public plans to do so outside of the constitutional framework the establishment of pdcs the expansion of the nsp and the creation of cd cs have altered the institutional landscape considerably recently the national area based development programme nabdp has established planning bodies at the district level and the idlg has been formed with responsibility for supervising the offices of provincial governors district governors provincial councils and municipalities except kabul municipality 10 8 uluswal is sometimes translated as district admi nistrator

and the afghanistan compact the january 2006 introduction of the iands and the afghanistan compact marked the end of the transitional process governed by bonn ag reement these two documents now form the framework for policy institutional and budgetar coordination the broad principles guiding this framework include enhancing government ownership harmonising donor and government policies improving development ou tcomes and service delivery by building capacity improving information and coordination and sharing accountability the iands stresses statebuilding as defined above but does not give clear signpost s regarding an overall policy on subnational governance for example what relative reso urces responsibilities and roles different subnational units should have in respect to serv ice delivery representation and accountability in this sense the iands process has not yet substantially altered subnational governance policy environment that is reacting to events and programming rather than building towards coherent vision of formal subnational governance afghanistan research and evaluation unit 16 2 cdcs and nsp in the subnational governance context communitylevel governance in afghanistan involves scales that are and have historically been below the established presence of fo rmal state structures which typically extended to the district or at times the subdistrict alaqadari or hauza level during much of the twentieth century the central go vernment would in many areas have local interlocutor in the form of khan qaryadar or malik the identification of that individual was based on different criteria and methods in different places in some cases they would be appointed from the outside but in most they would have preexisting leadership role through heredity property or some combination of both 11 the limited presence or absence of formal government institutions and officials in communities does not mean that governance does not take place there communitylevel governance in afghanistan at least in rural ar eas has long been handled primarily by local nonstate actors and structures undp has defined local governance as set of institutions mechanisms and processes through which citizens and their groups can articulate their interests and needs mediate their differences and exercise their rights and obligations at the local level 12 at the community level range of nonstate actors and structures perform these functions in different governance domains partial list of some of these historical governance actors and structures in afghanistan is presented in table 21 it is important to emphasise the variation in the prevalence and influence of these actors and structures throughout the co untry variation depends not only on ethnic or regional differences but also on the situation and history of individual communities the national solidarity programme na tionallevel communitydriven development programme was first introduced in some area s of the country in 2003 it expanded in subsequent years covering up to twothirds of the communities in the country in early 2008 communitydriven development refers to programmatic interventions that emphasise community participation empowerment local contributions and the development of community capacity or social capital in providing resources for develop ment projects at community level 13 this working paper describes the outcomes when national level communitydriven development programme with ambitious goals and complicated implementation structures is introduced in context that is complex varied and dense with nonstate governance the major finding of the research is that even though nsp has welldeveloped set of standard procedures and is based on international practice in communitydriven development the reality of afghanistans communities means that its implementation has been varied and has produced wide range of different outcomes this variation is important in assessing the outcomes of the programme itself the sustainability of the structures it has created and the place of these structures in the larger framework of evolving subnational governance and statebuilding efforts in afghanistan 11 for discussions of local governance patterns in afghanistan see for example r favre interface between state and society discussion of

drawn from international and national ngos as well as one agency habitat fps facilitate the election of community developm ent councils cdcs help them to identify community development priorities to be addres sed by block grant funds delivered in three instalments and facilitate project implementation 14 the author acknowledges work by palwasha ka kar and jennifer brick in preparing this table 15

and solutions with facilitating partners kabul areu 2005 afghanistan research and evaluation unit 18 the nsp has two stated objectives first the programme is local development initiative through the formation of cdcs it supports community input into selection and implementation of communitymanaged subprojects comprising reconstruction and development second the programme is local governance initiative aiming to lay the foundations for strengthening of community level governance 16 the reality of nsp implementation and the political context of afghanistan has meant that various ministerial actors subnational state authorities facilitating partners and even communities and customary authorities have differently emphasised these two goals this ambiguity has adversely affected the integration of the nsps structures into comprehensive vision for subnational governance in afghanistan nsp implementation at the community level nsp ideally follows fairly typical cdd implementation cycle described in more detail in subsequent sect ions of this chapter initially the nsp fp introduces the principles of the programme to the community following this civic education phase the fp organises an election for the cdc which then chooses its officers through process of consultation with the community the cdc identifies community development priorities in community deve lopment plan cdp and applies for funding for specific subprojects to be implemented with an nsp block grant the subproject application is vetted by the nsp oversight cons ultants oc based on set of eligibility criteria and may sometimes need to be modified the block grant is delivered in three instalments the community is meant to handle local procurement and the management of funds during subproject implementation the completion of the subprojects is subj ect to oc inspection and unused funds are directed to other subprojects early provisions in the programme for reelection of cdcs after two years and the introduction of cond smaller block grant have been largely foregone as the programme has been implemented in 2007 nsp entered second phase nsp ii in which significant aspects of the programme management structure and implementation have been altered for new communities 16 national solidarity programme nsp operations manual kabul nsp 2004 unless noted otherwise the october 2004 operations manual is referred to in this chapter as it was the version in effect during the majority of the research period there have been subsequent editions box 2 origins and progress of the

their promises and this is why we didnt believe them we thought that if they were really helping us they would give us money directly and not projects but once we saw the start of the programme we realized we should participate and help this programme move forwar d cdc members nangarhar 2005 31 community reactions the first interaction between the community and the nsp comes as communities are selected for mobilisation and the programme is introduced to them in the research sites the community responses to the introduction of the nsp varied widely in few cases fps encountered an outright and persistent refusal to participate some communities responded with extreme scepticism while others sent representatives the local drrd or the fp to proactively petition for nsp to be introduced in their community interviews with community members cdc members and focus groups of the social organisers suggested three factors were particularly important in determining the community reaction to the introduction of nsp 1 history of ngoun involvemen t in the community or district the most frequently mentioned factor shaping initial community responses to the introduction of nsp was previous experience of ngo activity in the district or the specific community in the majority of cases where peo ple discussed their initial reactions in these terms this experience was cited as negative factor social organisers from three of the five fps involved in study communities cited previously unfulfilled ngo promises as reason for initial scepticism in most cases these problems did not refer specifically to that organisation but rather to ge neric distrust of ngo activity rooted in experiences from both before and after 2001 this finding is supported by assertions in small number of communities that their acceptance of the programme was heightened by an effective effort by the fp to clarify that the nsp was in fact government programme and not simply an ngo initiative in one case the cdc noted that 80 percent of the community felt the programme would be helpful because the fp representatives explained that it was government programme not an ngo programme cdc member bamyan 2006 in one case in badakhshan the community reported that radio advertisements featuring then minister of rural rehabilita tion and development hanif atmar had convin ced them that the nsp was government initiative and prompted them to actively ex press their interest to authorities in the district centre previous ngo involvement did not always work against programme acceptance however communities under the implementation of two fps with longstanding and multiprogramme involvement in local communities cited the longstanding efforts of these organisations in their districts as contributi ng to positive reaction when the nsp was introduced in short the historical reputation of ngo or agency involvement was an important factor shaping community receptiven ess and could work in both positive and negative ways in very small number of cases the opposite was true lack of previous experience with ngo activity contributed to suspicion about the motives of the fp for example in one community where the fp had not worked before early in the nsp social organisers noted that the mullah and elders refused us perm ission to work in that community they thought we were christians that we would teach them lessons unrelated to islam and afghanistan research and evaluation unit 20 that we came to the community to carry out our own plans17 one fp noted that their implementation plan called for mobilising less remote communities before remote ones so that these communities would gradually be come familiarised with the value of the programme18 2 local implementation of nsp in keeping with this last finding the research also found geographic effect in the acceptance of the programme at the time of introduction that is in areas where the programme had already been implemented nearby there was more enthusiasm for the programme and more attention paid by communi ty notables in cases across two provinces the community petitioned actively for nsp to be introduced on the basis of seeing it implemented in neighbouring communities or neighbouring districts we knew that this is true government programme because we had seen it being implemented in other district villages so we went and asked the fp to imple ment it in our village too cdc member faryab 2005 note that this example combines two of the important effects already noted recognition of the governments involvement and local implementation in the case of two of the five fps involved in study communities this effect was reflected in implementation strategies rather than mobilising on the basis of needs assessment the order of mobilisation was based on geographic criteria either communities were mobilised across an entire district at time or contiguous communities were mobilised generally starting with the least remote we get lot of pressure from villages that are not receiving nsp we try to cover contiguous villages and then promise the next side that they will be covered the next year fp nsp manager badakhshan 2006 this sentiment was echoed by oc offices in badakhshan and faryab who noted that in given district sometimes partial coverage causes complaints 19 in general contrary to some predictions of resistance from customary or traditional authority figures the research found that the most common problems encountered in gaining community acceptance appear to have been scepticism and apathy sometimes coupled with objections to the requirement to include female community members in the elections and resulting cdcs this latter issue usually arose after initial acceptance of the programme 3 increasing acceptance over programme phases even when the community agreed to participate relatively quickly about half the cdcs interviewed reported that they did not take the programme entirely seriously until some later phase of implementation this effect was more frequently reported from cdcs formed earlier in the life of the nsp in year 1 and 2 of the programme thus there is temporal effect as well as spatial one in improving community reactions the longer the programme was running in district or province the more accepting communities tended to become scepticism in the early phases of the progra mme was often overcome only when the first instalment of money arrived in the community although in few cases the holding of an 17 areu focus group nsp social or ganisers

quiet or keep us fr om our work we began to trust the pro gramme when we received the first instalment cdc member and village elder badakhshan 2006 after the election when they took photos was also an important moment cdc member bamyan 2006 the connection between resources and legitima cy is strong one and supported by the finding that late disbursements of nsp funds had very negative effect on community perceptions of the programme and its implementers especially during 2006 20 it is important to consider that community acceptan ce of the creation of cdcs is intimately related to their role as channel for resour ces for the community the fact that the cdc is elected is legitimating factor pointed to by some communities and fps but not as clearly as the arrival of resources21 32 facilitation times after the introduction of the programme an d the agreement of community leaders to participate there was also great variation in the time from introduc tion of the programme to the election of the cdc in the study di stricts this period ranged from one to six months two factors were identified by facili tating partners as contributing to this variation in facili tation times 1 fp staffing in many cases the time period between the in itiation of the programme and the election was not necessarily result of differences in the communitys reaction but rather the staffing levels and capacity of the fp for example almost all nsp communities studied had between two and five civic education meetings with the fp before holding an election but the time it took to conduct these meetings depended on the number of communities to be covered and the number of staff available to do so for example in the district of ishkashem 35 communities in badakhshan it was possible to conduct 3 or 4 civic education meetings in one and half months by contrast peri urban district near the provincial capital of faizabad 187 communities required six months to reach the election phase desp ite community members having proactively requested the programme because the fp was not able to visit each community with the same frequency in most cases the variation in the introduction period reflected staffing levels and ease of travel more than the comm unitys reaction this finding is supported by the focus groups of social organisers across the study districts who never reported that more than five meetings were needed to proc eed to the election after initial acceptance of the programme 2 female participation another issue that influenced facilitation mes was the management of female participa tion in the election and the cdc in two cases this issue was cited as problem in the civic education phase of the programme in both of them the realisation that the resources and benefits of the programme were real aided in breaking what had been deadlock 20 on some reasons for late nsp funds disbursement see h nixon aiding the state international assistance and the statebuilding paradox in afghanistan kabul areu 2007 8 21 areu interview fp district nsp c oordinator bamyan september 2006 afghanistan research and evaluation unit 22 when we first started the nsp there was resistance to womens participation but now people have heard of it and have seen the benefits so the men allow the women and even encourage the women to participate female cdc members pashtun zarghun herat 2005 in one case in badakhshan mixed community of ismaelis and pashtuns were motivated to come to mutually acceptable compromise on womens participation due to the insistence of the fp that neither could benefit unless they were able to agree on meeting the requirement to form mixedsex cdc which was subsequently elected 22 this represented dramatic change from the prior situation in which women from the pashtun portion of the community were not even known by name in the rest of the community interestingly nangarhar with its predominantly tribal pashtun population did not feature delays of this type the reason appears to be that the fp involved mostly operated under an assumption that bringing wo men into the election process would be fruitless and relied on selection instead women dont know about the elections we didnt hear about it we werent called to have elections nothing 23 there is link between these two factors in that shortage of female staff is common fp staffing problem that exacerbates delays by making it difficult to access and mo bilise female members of the community24 in sum the introduction of nsp becomes progressively easier over both space and time since there are positive demonstration effects arising from its implementation in addition the main source of conflict at the introductory stage is over selection of communities to be mobilised not within indivi dual communities following this reasoning geographic approach to implementation is more likely to be successful because it provides rationale for the order the programm is introduced that is more comprehensi ble to the communities involved it also makes it more likely that communities will know that nsp is more than unmet promises when it comes to their turn as community perceptions are changeable and heavily influenced by local experience an important question is whether poor performance in community may result in neighboring communities rejecting nsp this is an important consideration given the problems widely cited by cdcs surrounding late grant disbur sements complaints about project selection being overridden but not explained to the communi ty or outright corruption in short the acceptance of nsp will only remain as good as the performance of the programme and poor performance and negative perceptions wi ll have dramatic repercussions in communi ties beyond those materially affect ed through the spread of distrust second conclusion in relation to introduc ing the nsp is that the resources cdcs can access for the community are an important sour ce of legitimacy while this connection may seem obvious the removal of second block grants in nsp ii and the slow disbursement of funds show that it has not been adequate ly reflected in programme design there has been relative lack of attention so far to the other source of legitimacy of the cdcs that they are elected in communities visited had cdc reelection taken place despite the desire of several communities and fps to carry out such reelections in these cases the fps were waiting for guidance from mrrd on the reelection process even after two or three years of nsp facilitation 25 22 areu cdc focus group badakhshan october 2006 23 female community members nangarhar 2005 24 previous areu research on nsp elec tions found that womens participatio n in decisionmaking in relation to community development is the most difficult and sensitive problem in the nsp approach to inclusive community development boesen from subjects to citizens 57 25 at the time of writing some communities had held reele ctions but it is not clear that systematic or fixed schedule is or could be adhered to given the variations outlined here the changing face of local governance co mmunity development councils in afghanistan 23 33 establishing community development councils the process for electing cdcs is well define d in the nsp operations manual and despite some changes in subsequent editions has the following core features 1 eligibility is the same as for national elections 2 one person one vote 3 secrecy of the ballot 4 women and men are eligible to be elected to the cdc 5 candidate lists and electioneering are prohibited and 6 40 percent of eligible voters must vote for the election to be valid in addition the programme stipulates that th election be based on clusters of not more than approximately 20 families divided on geographical ie by neighbourhood basis each of which elects one representati ve the manual outlines some steps to deal with especially large more than 300 families communities and allows flexibility in how the ballot boxes and ballots themselves are managed to best allow womens voting and ensure secrecy of the ballot 26 electing the cdc members the principal finding on the election of cdcs is that despite the specific process defined in the operations manual elections were conduc ted in variety of different ways the way that cdcs were formed varied great deal among study sites this variation was often related to the way that womens participation was handled but also involved the use of clusters and candidacy in incorporating different population groups in the research the following types of elections were identified standard in these cases the elections were conducted largely in line with the nsp manual the community was divided into clusters of families based on location and each cluster elected one representative all electors were able to vote for people of either gender and candidacy and campaigning were prohibited it is important that in four of 14 cases this method resulted in all votes going to males and thus required additional measures to ensure womens participation in the cdc either in mixed or separate councils 27 approximately half of the thirty cdcs visited were elected in line with the operational requirements of nsp and the resulting councils were sometimes mixed sometimes segregated and sometimes allmale standard with separate male and female elections this method echoed the standard election but in addition to divi ding the community by geographic criteria the elections for men and women were separated men voted only for men and women only for women in eight of the thirty study communities this method was in used with variations in herat 3 of 9 cases and nangarhar 2 of 7 cases total of five study communities held separate elections for separate male and female councils of equal size using the same cluste rs for each in faryab by contrast in three of five communities studied 34 additional femaleonly clusters were formed to divide the women of the community into voting groups this guaranteed female 26 nsp operations manual 1517 27 this pattern of significant minority of elections resulting in allmale winners was broadly reflected in aggregate data where available for example in faizabad municipality 5 of 45 standard elections resulted in females being elected areu interview nsp manager faizabad badakh shan 7 october 2006 afghanistan research and evaluation unit 24 representation but also institutionalised minority status for women this method represents local fp adaptation to ensure women were included in single cdc standard with consociational and genderspecific clusters in one case visited also in faryab the male clusters were organised by subtribe rather than spatial location to ensure representation of all co mmunity groups at least among males in addition three female clusters were iden tified to ensure female representation and the outcome was single mixedgender cdc maleonly elections in two cases standard election was held but which only involved male electors elected an allma council where this method was used separate female cdc was later appointed parallel elections an innovative case in bamyan involved two elections one for mens council and one for womens both men and women were for eligible for both elections effectively casting on vote for men then one for women candidacy in one case in herat the community voted as whole for candidates who had presented themselves to the comm unity as whole there was separate election for women based on clusters cluster selection in four cases in nangarhar the social organisers identified candidate for each cluster and either through voting or selection this candidate was confirmed as the representative the re presentation was thus structured as in the manual but single candidacy was used in place of an open election seemingly eliminating the element of choice through secret ballot selection in one case there was election the community and social organisers simply selected the council this also took place in nangarhar and reflected general but not complete pattern of deviance from programme guidelines on the part of the fp bangladesh rural advancemen t committee brac it should be noted that the districts in question were cons iderably insecure and this may have af fected the process chosen these eight election types represent confirme d cases among the study sites and are not an exhaustive list some of these methods do not constitute election s at all while some such as separate male and female elections violate universal principles for free vote this finding is important to consider in efforts to scale up the programme or formalise cdcs outside the context of nsp it is particularly important if cdcs are considered as possible precursor for the village councils called for in the constitution as the majority of these observed variations cannot be consider ed general elections as called for in the constitution 28 types of cdcs not only did the study communities feature ra nge of election types but the way that the cdcs were subsequently organised also varied fp staff and communities almost always described this variation in terms of the way that representation communication and influence between male and female members was organised these types do not capture variation in the patterns of inclusion and representation of other groups there were four types of cdcs formed in respect to thei r organisation of gender representation standard mixed cdc the nsp operations manual indicates that ideally each nsp community should have single cdc and that measures should be taken to ensure that women are able to participate in both electing and being elected to that 28 constitution of the islamic republic of afghanistan art 140 the changing face of local governance co mmunity development councils in afghanistan 25 council in one case where women were elected single allmale cdc was in place segregated elected male and female shuras while formally single cdc in practice most cdcs have two bodies that meet separately one for men and one for women this is the most common outcom among the study sites the way that communities describe these councils so varies the womens council may be called the womens cdc or womens shura or subcdc their participa tion in decisionmaking is either limite d to subprojects in the categories for women and vulnerable women or is faci litated through family gobetweens with the male council segregated elected male and appointed female shuras in some cases the elec tions resulted in an allmale cdc this could occur either because electors only elected males or because the election only permitted males to vote and be elected in most of these cases the fp and the community selected female shura in an attempt to meet nsp requirements maleonly cdc in two of the study communities maleonly cdc was formed in one community in faryab this is because mixed election produced single allmale council in nangarhar one community simply selected male council due to especially strict community norms on womens participation in public activities relationships between ection and cdc types the two tables on the following pages summarise the collected data on the election types and the resulting cdc structure the data demonstrate that range of different election types and resulting cdc structures were found in provinces across the country the standard model of cdc election defined in the nsp procedures was found in four of the five provinces where communities were studied but this model only accounted for lf of the overall number of communities this variation is appears to be due to local factor s that cannot be generalised to the provincial level possible exception is nangarhar where communities studied held standard election the second most common model was separate election among men and women for male and female members respectively this model could lead to the creation of either mixed or segregated councils except single case where only male co uncil was formed the more dramatic deviations from the standard nsp model were relatively infrequent the forms of cdc formation that were least inclusive or participatory or that were not elections at all tended to be adaptations to restrictive gender norms at the community level womens councils were appointed to offset restrictions on womens ability to vote in nangarhar the fp did in three cases forego an election altogether although the reasons for this are not clear 29 29 other studies indicates that careful facilitation and us of islamic teachings can be successful in overcoming these restrictions even in very conserva tive settings but require time boesen from subjects to citizens 57 afghanistan research and evaluation unit 26 table 31 observed election and cdc

the fp adju sted the elections procedures away from the standard model in order to facilitate some womens participation in the cdcs by holding separate male and female elections the fps were able to create female councils where it might not otherwise have been possible in less restrictive areas where it was possible to form mixed cdc through mixed election fps took steps to ensure women would be represented via female clusters but by community consent limited the number of female clusters to three or four out of committee of ten or twelve members 32 communities willing to create mixed cdcs ge nerally felt that female representatives should be in the minority forming about onethird of the council33 communities that were planning on creating separate male and female shuras as in herat and nangarhar allowed for equal numbers of women to be elected via two equivalent but gender segregated elections there is thus potential tradeoff between the degree of participation of women in an election and the way in which thei r input into the deliberation of the cdc is handled the more that womens participation in the council was allowed the less democratic was the structure of th eir participation in the election 34 by the same logic the combination of fully mixed election and mixed cdc sometimes resulted in lower number of female representatives than other arrangements 35 this dynamic may have important implications for programme changes aimed at increasing female participation as such changes may need to decide where to focus attention on th elections or on the cdcs structure for representation the flexibility of fps in adapting the elec tion system to community views on womens participation is one of the factors that have allowed cdcs to be formed in such wide 32 areu interviews fp social organisers faryab august 2005 33 this ratio was described as appropriate and consensu by the communities and fps the reasons for the acceptance of two to one ratio of men to women are unclear but it does ec ho some provisions of hanafi jurisprudence in relation to wi tnesses and inheritance rights 34 this finding is reinforced by work by mccarthy who finds that opening spaces for participation happens in complex and not necessarily linear way mcarthy spaces of power and participatory development in afghanistan 27 35 areu focus group unhabitat nsp staff yakawlang bamyan 11 september 2006 afghanistan research and evaluation unit 28 range of locations but also has implications for the standardisation of electoral processes where fp facilitation was weak and especia lly where fps had few female staff this flexibility did not occur and even prevented the formation of cdcs via any electoral process choosing the cdc leadership third kind of variation concerned how the leadership of the cdc was selected unfortunately complete data on the method of choosing the leadership of the cdc was not collected through this study as the rese arch focused on elections however an indicative survey of the data turned up the following models selection by cdc male cdc members selected their officials by consensus in at least one case in nangarhar selection according to vote totals the cdc member who received the most votes became the chair the next highest vice chair and subsequently treasurer and secretary in at least one case in herat election by cdc cdc members voted for officers in secret ballot in at least three cases in faryab election by community community members voted for the officers from among elected cdc members in at least one case in bamyan officials elected onebyone the community elected each position in turn from among candidates corresponding with the single case of communitywide candidacy based election in herat though this study did not provide sufficient data to be draw systematic conclusions on this matter it is clear that wide range of inte rpretations exist among fps and regions about how to choose cdc officers the nsp operations manual give relatively little guidance on this issue attention to this issue is warranted however considering that the selection of the cdc head was matter of contention in some communities interviewed change to the operations manual calling for two of the four officers to be women has in one fps case reduced their ability to assemble mixedsex cdcs 36 the primary finding regarding the early phases of the nsp is great variation in the actual implementation of programme provisions regarding the formation of cdcs the next two sections examine the findings surrounding the two core functions of the cdcs set out in programme documents community development and local governance 36 areu interview fp nsp manager badakhshan october 2006 the changing face of local governance

communitylevel meetings to establish co mmunity development plan cdp this cdp consists of list of subprojects chosen and prioritised by the community and should not include projects that are disallowed under the nsp this plan should also detail community contributions and the manner of inclusion of women and vulnerable individuals among project beneficiaries 37 these requirements have changed over the cour of the nsp and have been interpreted in different ways ranging from an entitlemen t of 10 percent of the block grant for womans project typically humancapital development to selecting second sub project of varying cost focused on female beneficiaries an important departure from the original entitlements for women was the curt ailment of the proposed topup or second block grants which were often never disburse d due to extended times administering the first grant and the subsequent remova l of these topup grants from nsp ii 38 this study collected information both on the projects selected and the dynamics of project selection within the communities tabl 41 and 42 below indicate the first and second subprojects in the cdps prepared by communities these da ta do not represent projects approved or implemented as in some cases projects were rejected by the fp or oc and in others only the first project was underway at the time of the research39 the third and subsequent subprojects were excluded if specified in the cdp because these had not been started in any communities visi ted and did not seem likely to form an operative part of the cdp in the shortte

represen tative the heavy emphasis on infrastructure over livelihoods education and health proj ects mirrors the pattern found for all sub projects nationally 40 in the areu sample irrigation figured lower and electrification higher than in national tota l perhaps due to the lack of sample communities in the most arid parts of the south due to the difficulties of collecting comparable data simultaneously from both male and female councils where they sat separately limited information is available on the incorporation of expressed female priorities into the cdp where there were separate female councils their priorities often differed from men focusing more on livelihoods and education an additional gender dimension of subproject selection involved the location of infrastructure and

subprojects to be included in the cdp 44 areu interview with fp district manager herat july 2005 afghanistan research and evaluation unit 32 this process always involved repeated meet ings to achieve consensus and sometimes large number of meetings or considerable controversy discussion about the cdp took long about three months of weekly meet ings we brought all the villagers together and we made list of all the village problems which were 18 acted suggested we reduce the number of projects to the most important by comparing with th budget and referring the list back to the whole village we

days of long argument we all agreed cdc member of mixed cdc yakawlang bamyan 2006 this process of consensus building appeared to aim at choosing projects which would benefit the widest range of community member s and its prevalence suggests that the attempts to build nsp on existing afghan norms of consensus decisionmaking are quite well founded this process of consensusbuilding indicates some potential for propoor development represented by participation of the community in cdp development as box 3 shows in few cases this norm of equity was specifically referred to as reason for the prioritisation agreed despite being more common than other processes consensus was not used in all cases to choose projects in one community the cdc described subproject selection as occurring by

this last case was one of the three where rm of equity was expressed indicating that such principles may still form part of di scussions between elected cdc members and elders as in most other aspects of nsp operation considerable variety seems to be the norm in the way that subprojects are chosen 43 multicommunity projects and appeals outside nsp while the focus in nsp throughout the first three years of implementation has been on projects within single community in four of the communities visited there were projects either planned or underway jointly with neighbouring nsp communities these joint projects were sometimes for single shared project sometimes for separate projects for joint use in one case the commu nity anticipated trading project outputs to help fund their own project operations and maintenance some communities combine their community bloc k grants for joint project in faizabad badakhshan three communities agreed to dona land they held in common for school to be shared among them importantly this was viewed as appropriate in part because these communities had once shared school that had been destroyed system of budgeting and compensation was established which took into account each communitys population and also the third communitys need to construct drinking water project by excusing them labour contribution in exchange for cash 45 similarly in paktia six communities were reported to have combined budgets to build two high schools46 in almar faryab one community also reported planning joint projects with neighbour to provide both electricity and drinking water in other cases the communities agreed to build separate projects but for joint use these latter arrangements seemed at first glance more prone to cause conflict or dissatisfaction among one of the parties box 4 45 areu interview cdc members faizabad badakhshan october 2006 46 areu interview drrd staff paktia june 2006 box 4 conflicts over joint projects in an interesting case in herat two neighbouring villages agreed to build separate projects for joint use one community centre and one hamaam the female members of the cdc in the community which built the hamaam expected that their community would be able to use the other space for weddings and other gatherings we wanted community centre because we have problem of space for weddings and funeralswe made an agreement with neighbou ring village that we would build the hamaam which was second priority in our cdp they would build the community centre and we would share the two but they made the community cent re into mosque an elder secretly had mihrab put into the community centre so when it was unveiled it had mihrab in it and was mosque female cdc and yout h group member herat 2005 this conflict appears to have two dimensions th deception of at least the female members of the second community by the first and the bversion of programme rules as religious buildings are not permitted under nsp rules case that was related at second hand by an fp has similar aspects two communities decided to jointly build road by sharing their labo ur however when the road reached the first community it withdrew its assistance leaving the second community without the part of the road to it completed afghanistan research and evaluation unit 34 in variation on joint projects community in bamyan that was one neighbourhood of larger town installed generators to provide electricity for the adjoining neighbourhood as well as itself on the basis of preagreed pr ice for electricity of 80 afghani per bulb per month thus both communities were able to re alise benefits while the first could offset its costs and install greater generating capacity 47 it is important to note that these examples of joint project selection took place before the introduction of formal programmes to group cdcs together such as jicas intercommunal rural development programme irdp or the broader national areabased development programme nabdp 48 they tended to reflect broade r fp involvement in communities through broadbased rural development programmes for example where fps implemented more comprehensive programmes the social organisers viewed cdcs as an institution that goes beyond their role in implementing nsp cdcs are an institution in the society in our area for example we take plans from the cdc as input to our capacity building programmes we hold the trainings according to outstanding needs identified by the cdc in effect we fund cdc priorities outside nsp social organisers bamyan 2006 in few other cases cdcs participated in getting nonnsp support from an ngo that was not an fp in one case in badakhshan flood protection project was completed with additional ngo support in community also engaged in joint nsp project 49 similarly in some cases other implementers have used cd cs to resolve differences over beneficiary lists in another case in faryab the cdc co ntacted the provincial education department directly after agreeing to donate land for the building of school which was later built by different organisation50 i n m s t c s s t h f p p i n t d t manteqa level common interests derived from geographical or resource interdependence as determining the scale of the group of cdcs involved despite these cases which seemed to depend on solid facilitation and the availability of other fp or nonfp programming in the area the relative infrequency of joint projects and the appearance of some conflict in about half of the cases where they appeared suggests the goal of intercommunal solidarity is still somewhat distant from the reality of nsp implementation 47 areu interviews cdc members in adjoinin g neighbourhoods bamyan september 2006 48 study of cdcs

this paper the nsp is not only aimed at introducing and managing development projects it is also local governance initiative aiming to lay the foundations for strengthening of community level governance governance can cover range of public and quasipublic goods cdcs affect the process participation and accountability involved in managing development resources both internal and external to the commu nity they therefore play role in th governance of community development the intention of cdc activity in community governance however is not limited to managing nsp block grants these committees may also alter the participation process and accountability involved in community cisionmaking in other areas of these two nsp goals there has been far more emphasis on evaluating the cdd aspects of nsp than its governance aspects this gap is in part due to the different nature of the data involved 51 nevertheless there is significant evidence that cdcs are playing role in other aspects of community governance the most prominent do mains of community governance activity emerging from the study were dispute resolution community labour ashar and social protection for the vulnerable these domains ar discussed next followed by an analysis of the place of the cdc in the systems of local governance 51 dispute resolution claims of the involvement of cdcs in some form of community dispute resolution are widespread the elected and collective basis of the cdc appears to contribute to their role particularly in areas where previous disputeresolution mechanisms focused on influential individuals and not collective measures this is not to say however that cdcs or their members solved disputes alone much more common is kind of hybrid arrangement where cdc members may work together with noncdc customary leaders or other community representatives of the 29 communities studied only four repo rted that the cdc did not play any role in dispute resolution three of these negative responses were located in single district of nangarhar province under single fp in this district clear distinction was drawn between the cdd function and other governance and problem solving cdcs are different from other shuras or jirgas in that they plan and organise velopment projects cdc members nangarhar 2005 the various data collected in this district however indicate that the lack of involvement of the cdcs was partly due to prevailing soci norms about the appropriate role of such council and partly due to weak facili tation by the fp in that district 52 in the other less remote nangarhar district studied all communi ties reported cdc dispute resolution role while some involvement of cdc members in di spute resolution appears to be widespread the disputes involved and the characteristics of this involvement vary quite widely all of the disputes reported appeared to fa ll in one of three broad categories the first type of disputes related to th nsp programme or development activity more generally these often the allocation of land or other resources for development activities or the selection of communities for nsp implementation 51 mcarthy spaces of power and particip atory development in afghanistan 24 52 areu interviews cdc members social organi sers community members nangarhar august 2005 afghanistan research and evaluation unit 36 other disputes were not directly related to new development activities but had community resource dimension for example access to common paths roadways or water supplies third category was personal familiar or civil and even at times criminal matters between community members in many cases the lines between these types of disputes are blurred as showed in box 5 two characteristics of cdcs appeared to cont ribute at times to their role in dispute resolution their elected and collective basis and the contribution of nsp resources as incentive to solve conflicts the fact that cdcs are elected and have co llective quality seemed to be important in the acceptance that their decisions enjoyed in certain contexts in areas where communi ties identified single arbab uluswal police or local commander as the former main actor in dispute resolution communities fp s and local authorities noted that cdcs decisions over small land and livestock disputes were more accepted due to the elected and collective nature of the council conflict or disputes were previously so lved by the arbabs personal decision or both sides were obligated to go to th uluswal for solution now the cdc is elected by the people they bring problems there for solution cdc members faryab 2005 box 51 selected examples of disputes wi th cdc involvement in dispute resolution three small villages combined under the nsp to form single cdc and decided on three projects from their budget but before they began the prt came and completed drinking water project in one village with prt funds th is created conflict between the three villages because one already had their pr ojects completed before beginni ng nsp work the cdc resolved the problem by allowing the fi r s t v i l l g t h v s c n d p r j c t i n r d c n s t r u c t i n reconciliation was the key factor in fact the second two villa ges did not gain anything new from the solution fp nsp manager badakhshan 2006 b we have solved conflict between our and an other village over water we have built check dam to hold water for our use but the excess d caused damage to their cultivated areas and they wanted us to keep the water away as we were poor it was difficult to rebuild the water source elsewhere the cdcs selected representatives and estimated the value of the crops and gave them compensation for this year fo r t h l n g t r m w p p r c h d m i n i s t r f

been nine deaths four cdcs were formed and they met as conflict resolution committee and they also were given the opport unity to cooperate under another of the fps rural development programmes as development cluster the projects helped though the budget is generally small nsp social organisers bamyan 2006 d one villager contracted with another to gi ve daughter and the prospective bridegroom

conflict we sometimes have up to two such problems week to solve cdc members faryab 2006 the changing face of local governance co mmunity development councils in afghanistan 37 cdcs have additional authority due to being elected and have resolved land dis putes because they are seen as representatives of the community social organisers faryab 2005 cdcs are better at conflict resolution th an qaryadars or arbabs on the one hand it is because they are an elected shura and on the other hand the decision is more acceptable because they are many and not one district governor badakhshan 2006 in two cases cdc members noted the importance of project funds in helping resolve disputes within and between communities both of these communities had had long standing conflicts one of them deadly in dicating poor dispute resolution capacity beforehand in such cases the incentive of the project funds can play role in reconciliation several nsp communities in talking about previous systems also pointed to bribery or costs associated with dispute resolution serv ices by district officials or local appointees such as qaryadars or maliks as factor not present with cdcs 53 an important related finding is that where collective mechanisms such as shura jirga or jalasa are used to resolve disputes they ar more likely to be combined with cdc activities rather than being replaced by them illustrating this phenomenon three different interviewees in badakhshan community answered question about dispute resolution the first suggested that community elders resolved disputes the second that the cdc resolved them while the third explained that because the elders had been elected to the cdc both were in fact right 54 social organisers sometimes described this model in terms of conflict resolution committees including both cdc members and elders while other cdc members described meeting together with elders to solve particular problems 55 dispute resolution activity thus often involves mixture between councils and customary leaders ten of the 25 cdcs who claimed role in dispute resolution clearly stated that they performed this role in combination with elders or religious figures in some way based on the frequent attendance of noncdc elders in cdc meetings during interviews it is likely that these figures understate the amount of in volvement of elders in dispute resolution activities in about half of the total communiti surveyed it seems likely that hybrid form of customary and elected authority is applied to dispute resolution in much of the remainder it seems that previously disputes were resolved by individual powerholders not by collective shura these characteristics of cdcs appear to increa the acceptance of decisions even when those decisions do not substantively benefit one of the parties as in the first example in box 5 above and below person wanted to build house on comm on land near neighbouring village but he had not been allowed our cdc went an d discussed it with them and they lowed him to build the house cdc members badakhshan 2006 the element of consensus and reconciliation ev ident here seems to be repeated pattern and may form the link with the authority derivi ng from the representative character of the cdc in this respect it was notable that th one district in nangarhar where none of the 53 areu interviews cdc and community members nangarhar bamyan and badakhshan august 2005 septemberoctober 2006 54 areu interview cdc members badakhshan october 2006 55 areu interviews social organizers and cdc members bamyan and faryab 20056 afghanistan research and evaluation unit 38 study sites reported conflict resolution role for cdcs was also the district where their members had not been elected despite these potential benefits of cdc involvement not all dispute resolution efforts by cdcs were reported as positive in our community one resident did not allow our second cdc project road to pass over some land of his despite it be nefiting the communit the first project had been drinking water scheme and the members of the cdc resolved to turn off the water to the houses in the group where this land lies about 15 households in all we would like to discuss this with the district official but we have not yet solved the problem cdc and community members badakhshan 2006 general tendency to obscure unsolved confli cts due to sense of privacy or collective shame was noted in number of interviews so it is likely that the research does not accurately reflect the prevalence of outstandin g conflict it is important therefore not to overstate either the changes or potential for dispute resolution brought by nsp nevertheless taken as whole the evidence supports the idea that cdcs or cdc members in combination with others can play role in dispute resolution but without displacing the procedures and legitimacy of more customary means limits to female participation in dispute resolution an important caveat to this finding is that it applies primarily to the role of male cdc members in part this has to do with the role of fps the election of cdcs and decisions about community development priorities occu r through heavily facilitated process with procedures emphasising the participation of women without the fps presence this participation falls off 56 of the 25 cdcs reporting some dispute resolu tion role only two groups of female cdc members reported participating in processes of community dispute resolution in most places the meetings on disputes were consid ered somewhat separate process and in two cases the use of predominantly male spaces like guesthouses or mosques reinforced this separation we have only participated in important meetings like choosing canal but cant participate in other meetings because male members hold them in the mosque to prevent us from participating female cdc member badakhshan 2006 beyond this broader conception of comm unity dispute resolution women in four communities indicated that they did resolv through mediation conflicts with particu larly sensitive gender dimension or other wom ens and childrens conflicts in one case the womens cdc defused tension created when some boys had made crude remarks about the corpse of drowned girl by di scussing the matter with the two families 57 beyond these four communities where women sp oke of their role in solving conflicts further discussion revealed these functions were actually more related to social protection for poor and vulnerable women 52 cdc involvement in ashar and social protection in six of the 29 communities visited the cdc iden tified itself as having role in organising ashar or community labour typically this included cleaning irrigation canals and repairing roads ashar was also explained by some cdcs as means for mobilising the labour portion of the communitys contribution to nsp subprojects although acknowledged as pre 56 areu focus groups various social organisers 200506 57 areu interview female cdc members nangarhar august 2005 the changing face of local governance co mmunity development councils in afghanistan 39 existing institution shar is relatively widespread phenomenon in afghanistan and in the cases where the cdc identified this role it often represents continuation of previous practice where questioned further most of these cdcs did not differentiate between the functioning of ashar under cdc leadership or in its more traditional form in some other cases ashar projects were incorporated into the cd p in other cases such projects were envisioned as partly independent previous areu research supports the general finding that ashar is preexisting institution but that its scope and productivity may be enhanced by the involvement of cdcs 58 more prominent and novel role of cdcs was in the area of social protection one working definition of social protection is that it includes initiatives both formal and informal that provide social assistance to extremely poor individuals and households social services to groups who need special care or would otherwise be denied access to basic services social insurance to protect people against th risks and consequences of livelihoods shocks and social equity to protect people against social risks such as discrimination or abuse 59 not all these roles are seen in all places and others constitute traditional community functions for example collecting money from the community for funeral ceremonies60 there is significant evidence however that cdcs were able to formalise and expand some social protection functions across these categories61 social assistance and social insurance occurred through the cdcs creation of beneficiary lists for various activities such as nsp training projects or relief in the case of natural disasters and the collection of money for people suffering illness social services and social equity were manifested in some cases by the creation or identification of small jobs in the community for particularly vulnerable individuals such as widows in many communities cdcs maintained community box which was either to collect money for poor families experiencing life cycle shocks or livelihoods shocks such as illness or to support future community projects see table 51 table 51 social protection functions with cdc involvement

one case all social prot ection functions claimed actively by cdcs occurred under the same three fps several cdcs acknowledged that the community box function was an extension of customary function of

practices afghanistan research and evaluation unit 40 or death62 while the collection of money for the poor and vulnerable on an ad hoc basis may be seen as an extension of traditional activity its institutionalisation in community box was only seen under two fps one of which noted that they had instituted community boxes in almost all their communities beyond those surveyed 63 this may indicate that as with dispute resolution wher customary practices are merged or formalised with cdc functions through active facilitation they ma be more accepted than when introduced entirely anew as small but versatile initiative the community box was also viewed in some cases as an important ongoing role for the cdc beyond the scope of the nsp it doesnt matter if nsp ends our cdc is legitimate shura it will always func tion from now we have plans for creative projects like charity box and we have decided to train our young people in different professional fields cdc members herat 2005 an important feature of the social protection function is that in all cases where cdcs claimed to carry them out the female cdc members were aware and usually active in performing these functions in the cases of employment and several of the beneficiary lists which were for literacy or tailoring training this function was in fact carried out by the female cdc members social protection is th us an area with more womens participation than dispute resolution feature that seems so to be linked to the degree of facilita tion an overall conclusion can be drawn that womens participation is most prevalent in the areas where fp involvement is more intensiv suggesting that facilitation is not only important for the scope of cdc activity but so has important gender implications in the absence of good facilitation or at the end of fp involvement it seems likely that the level of womens participation may suffer even more quickly than cdc activity in general 62 areu interview cdc members

co mmunity development councils in afghanistan 41 6 conclusions and recommendations the creation of cdcs under the nsp have in troduced dramatic change in the develop ment resources available to many communities in the country where these resources have been converted to successful subprojects the acceptance and legitimacy of the programme and by extension the government has been strengthened as relatively new institution within the local governance system the position of cdcs is complex and varied several key conclusions can be drawn from the analysis to date community acceptance of cdcs is conditioned by past experience comprehensiveness of material and human resources available for facilitation and local implementation patterns it is also heavily dependent on the delivery and use of resources and declines with delays or misuse of resources the implementation of all phases of nsp including elections cdc composition and configuration cdp development and the acti vities taken on by cdcs outside project selection and implementation has been carried out in vari ed ways this variation is complex it appears that compromises in one area such as the form of elections held may facilitate gains in others such as womens influence on decisions through direct participation in meetings local norms and customs are important in determining these outcomes but also important are the resource s creativity and depth of involvement in the area of the facilitating partner while many cdc members claim to be involved in other governance functions such as dispute resolution these governance functi ons are not universal and where they occur they are often carried out in combination with customary structures and individuals forming hybrid form of authority partial exception may be where previous governance structures were focused on one powerholder where cdcs through their collective and elected basis can reorient the sources of local authority there are barriers to genuine participation of women in both development functions and governance functions of the cdcs this participation is less in governance functions than project selection and it appears to be very dependent on the quality of facilitation in the absence of facilitation womens participation will likely suffer at an even faster rate than overall cdc activity an exception to this seems to be in few social protection functions great deal of attention is currently being paid to the current and futu re place of cdcs in the local governance systems but this attent ion has yet to produce coherent and clear vision for cdcs in particular their relationship to other governance structures until now consideration of how to bridge this gap and cr eate strategy for cdcs that combines their role in community development with permanent place in subnational governance has lagged behind the advance of the nsp itself reason for this lag has been the lack of clear shared vision of the future shape of local governance at provincial district and community level which has limited the ability to plan for the future of cdcs there is an impl icit and at times explicit distinction drawn in discussions of cdcs in afghanistan between their role in local development and their role or potential as governance institutions this distinction is currently central to the discussion about the future of cdcs and th most appropriate programming to support local governance into the future this debate has become harmfully and unnecessarily polarised governance describes the mechanisms for participation process and accountability involved in collective action and decisions an important domain of governance activity at afghanistan research and evaluation unit 42 any local level is the management of resources for local development cdcs in their role as managers of the communitydriven development process of nsp are already functioning as governance institution they are involved in governance for development in doing so they have made considerable contribution s to the immediate welfare of community members though their impact on longerterm livelihoods outcomes may be less clear without reference to the overall rural development context 64 t h h v l s m d important if varied contributions to the in clusion and representation of marginalised groups particularly women in such activity in some cases the role of cdcs in governan ce for development has meant that cdcs have had to engage in the resolution of disputes regarding the disposition of development resources within and among communities this type of dispute resolution falls within the domain of consensually accepted cdc gove rnance activity by extension some cdc members or in few cases cdcs as corporat entities have come to provide resolution mechanisms of other local disputes finally cdcs have taken on the role of organising communal labour or social protection again re presenting an extension or fusion of their role with customary preexisting governance activity concerning public goods it is important to overcome the artificial distinction between governance and develop ment first step in doing that is to conti nue to emphasise the role that cdcs already play as an institution involved in governance for development with varying configura tion of extended roles related to that core identity at the same time with the transition from nsp i to nsp ii and subsequently to set of successor programmes it is crucial to consider the future of the institution what role can cdcs play in achieving the commonly held aspirations of afghans for improved development and livelihoods in context of improved effective democratic and cultura lly and religiously appropriate governance institutions the newly established idlg in combination with range of other actors involved in development and governance at the subnational level may help provide locus for the development of such policy doing so succe ssfully is crucial step in afghanistans current transition to development process th at realises the strategic interdependence of community governance and development through the establishment of the the basic institutions and practice of democratic gove rnance at the national provincial district and village levels for enhanced human development as demanded by the interim afghanistan national development strategy iands 65 there are several key questions that are cent ral to any effort to develop policy with wide political acceptance for the future of cdcs should they be formally recognised as state institutions bylaw calling for increased formalisation of cdcs is in circulation this bylaw calls for the recognition of cdcs by formal state authorities their designation as the community interlocutor for all development intervention s and grants them some administrative functions this process is largely driven by m rrd thus far and is yet to enjoy wide political acceptance it may be that this approach in the absence of more comprehensive legal framework stresses the formalisation of cdcs without paying sufficient attention to the local variations in cdc functions and the benefits of retaining their status as communitybased and not governmental organisations at the same time institutional means for 64 s barakat et midterm evaluation report of the national solidarity programme

governance co mmunity development councils in afghanistan 43 supporting cdcs should form part of the mixture of policy options available when determining the future role of these councils what will be the resources both material and in terms of technical assistance and facilitation available to cdcs after nsp it is clear that cdcs have functioned most positively in the selection and implementation of subprojects and their acceptance legiti macy and ability to perform other tasks are all related to the resources they bring to co mmunities consideration of their future role must include discussion of the range of resources that will be available and the mix of governmental and nongovernmental involvement in providing these if cdcs are to continue to function in wide areas of the country new resources need to be coupled with technical support and an effort to strengthen the capacity of the community and the cdc itself what will be the appropriate scale for the delivery of such resources in some areas cdcs already combine efforts through joint projects and in other areas programmes to cluster cdcs are underway these efforts suggest that clusters that respond to locally appropriate development scales appear more naturally due to infrastructure or resource interdependencies that may be present at that level this raises questions about the organisation of development representation below and at the district level currently addressed piecemea l by nabdp and other clustering programmes without clear link to plans for district and village level representation in the long term should they perform administrative governan ce tasks as well as development tasks mandating single universal governance role for cdcs would produce mixed outcomes due to the observed variation in how cdcs cu rrently function in relation to customary structures while there is evidence of fruitf ul governance improvements linked to cdcs this is often achieved through the implicit or explicit recognition of preexisting governance patterns not wholesale attempts to replace them how will the impact of cdcs on the inclusion and representation of women and other marginalised community groups be strengthened and deepened the role of cdcs in empowering women and other vulnerable groups is dependent on active facilitation gains in this area cannot be assumed to be persistent gains just as the cdc itself cannot be considered persistent institution without consideration of the factors discussed in this paper as nsp comes to close consideration of how to support the broadened inclusion and representation in the context of cdcs must continue these questions can longer be answered in isolation from many other questions in subnational governance policy these include the roles and relationships of district governors in relation to other bodies the form of districtlevel elected representation in the future the fiscal status of subnational state units and the sequencing of
