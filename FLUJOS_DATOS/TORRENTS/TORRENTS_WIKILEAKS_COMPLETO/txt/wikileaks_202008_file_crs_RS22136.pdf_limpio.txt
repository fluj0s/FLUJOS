96 of its land borders settling the maritime boundaries with australia is critical to future division of an estimate d tens of billions in oil and gas deposits beneath the ocean floor east timor has argued that the maritime boundary should lie at the midpoint between the two countries while australia is arguing that it should lie at the end of its continental shelf under the previously negotiated boundary with indonesia the boundary was set closer to the then indonesian contro lled territory of east timor than the midpoint between east timor and australia australia n foreign minister downer indicated that australia which did much to facilitate east timors independence and east timor had reached substantial agreement on all major i ssues during talks in dili in april 2005 and that the details of the agreement would be settled in the near future the agreement is thought to include an additional a2 to a5 b illion for east timor in return it is thought that east timor will agree to not raise the issue of the sea boundary for some time14 the us position is that this is bilateral issue between east timor and australia representative barney frank and senator jack reed initiated letter urging australia to to establish fair boundary w ith east timor in march 200515 reform many experts see the missi on in east timor as successful and confirm that untaets mandate was unprecedented in scope with wide range of power granted to the transitional administrator as reform gains attention in the 109th congress it is likely that the legitimacy of this claim and the east timor experience willbe examined further drawing out lessons l earned and focusing on the contributing factors which could perhaps be applied elsewhere
