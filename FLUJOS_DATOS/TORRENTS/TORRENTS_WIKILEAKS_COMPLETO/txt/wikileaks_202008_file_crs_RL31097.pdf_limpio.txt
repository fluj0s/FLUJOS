2008 pl 110247 revised the federal ac quisition regulation to require certain contracts to private entities to include cl ause that encourages the donation of food specifically the law requires that

certain types of nonprofit organizati ons may be deductible for income tax purposes only up to specified limits and may be in the form of either cash or property the charitable contribution deduction is allowed only for th taxable year in which the contribution is made any unpaid subscriptions or pledges are not deductible til actually fulfilled some of the more typical organizations to which contributions are deductible include churches universities schools nd hospitals as well as many other public assistance charities such as food pantries soup kitchens homeless shelters etc if contribution is made to an individual such as homeless family living on the street that contribution is not deductible even though actuated by charitable motives in order to qualify as an organization to which contributions are deductible the recipient must be organized or incorporat ed in the united states or in one of its possessions and certified as charitable organization by the internal revenue service2 contributions to foreign charitabl organizations are not deductible donation however to an othe rwise qualified organization is deductible even though some portion of the funds of such organi zation are used in foreign countries for charity limitation on the amount deductible the deduction for contributions either in cash or in property made by corporations is limited to 10 of taxable in come computed with adjustments the 10 cap was raised from 5 by the passage of the economic recovery tax act of 1981 the legislative history of the 1981 act indicates that congress was hopeful that corporate charitable contributions would be stimulated by the increase in the caphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31097crs3 3 the internal revenue code normally subjects corporate profits to the corporate income tax under its subchapter c corporations subject to income tax are thus often referred to as c corporations 4 s corporations are not subject to the corpor ate income tax and their net profits are passed through to the individual shareholders the num ber of which must be limited to 75 or less who are taxed on the profits under the individual income tax 5 the definition provides for 1 stock in trad of the taxpayer or other property of kind which would properly be included in the invent ory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year or property held by the ta

corporations may not exceed 10 of taxable income in any given year if contributions exceed this limitation the excess may be carried forward to future tax years corporations may carry over excess charitable contributions nd compute tax as though the excess gifts were actually made in such subsequent years thus when charitable contributions in one year exceed the limitation corporation might u ltimately secure the full benefit taxwise of the contribution even though denied part of it in the year in which the contribution was initially made the law allows that excess charitable contributions may be carried forward for fiveyear period this carryforward provision applies to both gi fts of cash or property contributions of property including food products in general if charitable contribution is made in the form of property the basis for the charitable deduction is dependent on the type of taxpayer ie individual or form of business entity to whom the pr operty is donated and for what purpose the donated property is to be used corporate gifts of property that would ge nerate capital gains if sold eg stocks and bonds are deductible by co rporations at market value however gifts of depreciable property are deductible at the co rporations basis rather than fair market value thus under current tax law the deduction is reduced by previously taken depreciation in the case of fully depr eciated machinery and equipment the allowable charitable contribu tion deduction would be zero under current tax law c corporations3 are provided more favorable tax treatment of contributions of certain type s of inventory and ot her ordinaryincome property to specified charitable organi zations this provision is temporarily available to s corporations4 partnerships and sole pr oprietorships through 2007 all donors are allowed to deduc t their cost plus onehalf the difference between their cost and the market value of the donate d goods however in case may the deductions

deductionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31097crs5 11 lucky stores inc v commissioner 105 tc 420 1995 12 since onehalf the fair market value was less than basis the donor would have received the exact same deduction for contribution to food bank or for discarded inventory which in both cases is tax deduction for basis past legislative proposals as noted earlier in this report current law provides an enhanced deduction for donations made by c corpora tions of property which in cludes food products for the care of the ill the needy or infants this enhanced deduction available for food products is used primarily by businesses for unsaleable products the most frequent reasons for products not being sold at market are errors in labeling merchandise that has been crushed or dented or products that may be too close to the expiration date recommended for sale there have been four parts to legisla tion proposing to change the tax law for donated food pr oducts two of which were addressed in the 109th congress typically the proposals would extend the enhanced deduction fo r food inventory to all taxpayers engaged in trade or busin ess secondly the enhanced deduction would be available only for apparently wholesome food which is newly defined under some of the legislative proposals third the determinati on of basis of the qualified contributions would be set as percentage of th foods fair market value finally some proposals have set the fair market value of donated foods to be the same price as similar food items sold by th taxpayer at the time of the contribution or in the recent past apparently wholesome food typically legislative proposals have defined apparently wholesome food to include food that may not be readily marketable due to appearance age freshness grade size surplus or other conditions the new law provides slig htly more rigorous definition the inclusion of the definition and the discu ssion of how fair market value is to be determined is designed to lessen valua tion problems for taxpayers caused by lack of clarity in the regulations court case in the 9th circuit was also at odds with the regulations regarding donation valuation as issued by the internal revenue service and the findings in that case clarified the issue the court case held that the value of surplus bread inventory donated to qualified charity wa s determined to be the sa as the full retail price of the bread11 the internal revenue service irs contended that the retail value of the bread was half the norma l sales price since the indus try practice of major bakers is to discount fourdayold bread but if th court had ruled the value of the bread was half the retail selling price the donor would have receive d tax benefit and thus encouragement to make such charitable donations12 the courts findings contradicted regulations issued by irs the new definition of apparently whol esome food parallels the definition included in the bill emerson good sa maritan f ood dona tion act 42 usc 1791b2 that act defines the term apparently wholesome food as food thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31097crs6 13 deduction is to be allowed for any part of the unrealized appreciation

local laws and regulations even though the food may not be readily marketable due to appearance age freshness grade size surplus or ot her conditions this definition was also used in the temporary law enacted by the ka trina emergency relie f act pl 10973 abbreviated history prior to the passage of the tax reform act of 1969 the general rule was that taxpayers who contributed appreciated property to charities were allowed charitable contribution for the fair market value of the property moreover tax was imposed or collected on the appreciation as an example farmer making charitable contribution of portion of his crop not only received tax deduction of the fair market value of the donated crops but also escaped the tax on the difference between his crop production costs and fair market value b ecause the tax savings from the charitable deduction in the case of ordinary income property was measured by the taxpayers marginal tax rate it was possible for taxpayers to make contributions which permitted greater aftert ax benefit than would have been received if the crop had been sold and the farmer allowed to keep the proceeds after paying tax on the gain it should be remembered that tax rates at that time were much higher than todays rates since this provision was s een as unfair when compared with those making charitable cash gifts the tax reform act of 1969 changed the law so that the appreciated value was to result in reduc tion of the contribution deduction to the extent of the appreciation it was with passage of the tax reform act of 1976 pl 94455 that corporations were provide d more favorable tax treat ment of contributions of inventory such as food to certain char itable organizations the 1976 act provided that such gifts by corporations were to be based on the taxpayers basis in the property and onehalf of the unrealized appr eciation as long as the deduction did not exceed twice the propertys basis13 in summary of the act it was stated that the enactment of the tax reform act of 1969 had resulted in reduced contributions of certain types of property to charitable institutions in particular those charitable organizations that provide food clothing medical equipment and supplies etc to the needy and disaster victims had found that contributions of such items to those organizations were reduced14 it was stated in the general explanation of the law that congress believed that it was desirable to provide greater tax incentive than in prior law for contributions of certain types of ordinary income property which the donee charity uses in the performance of its ex empt purposes howeve r congress believedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31097crs7 15 ibid p 673 16 giving usa 2004 the annual report on philanthropy for the year

corporate pretax profits and the gross domestic product both rose in 2006 indivi dual giving represented 756 of total giving and corporate gifts were 43 of the total with f oundations and bequests representing the remainder however these numbers mask the importance of corporate charitable gifts because religious organizations receive little funding from either corporate donors or their foundations since individuals are the primary support of religious institutions the ameri can association of fundraising counsel aafrc trust for philanthropy inc found that for 2006 contributions to religion represented 328 of all charitable gifts16 it is important to remember that companies support nonprofits through cause related marketing public relations sponsorships contracts and other joint promotional activities as well as through advertising expenditures these types of expenditures are not shown as charitable gifts in an earlier edition of giving usa the aafrc trust for philanthropy inc made the following four points corporate giving has ranged from low point of 07 to high of 23 of pretax income over 30 year s with historical variation largely due to changes in tax law profits grow fastest in the service industries like banking andtelecommunications nonmanuf acturing companies cannot take advantage of taxdeductible gifts of inventory that make up much of the manufacturing sectors charitable activity even though non manufacturers make up large component of profit growth there is trend toward strategi c corporate support which is not counted as charitable gift by the company the irs or giving usa nonetheless this activity appeals to both companies and non profits and may be mutually satisfactory substitute for charitable giving there is practical reason why companies should use pretax income as the basis for determining their charitable contribution levels there is reason not to pursue strategy in which charitable support to nonprofits increases without consuming an increasing share of corporate profits17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31097crs8 17 continued 1997 american association of fundraising counsel trust fo r philanthropy new york 1998 p 22 18

deduction provision in the internal re venue code those companies are pharmaceuticalhealth care or comput erinformation technology firms issues and observations corporate charitable contributions are rarely prominent issue in consideration of us tax policy first corporate managers have been careful about making charitable contributions since their respons ibility is to provide the highest rate of return that is legally possible to those w ho have invested in th corporation often making charitable contributions conflicts with this mandate having said that corporations do make charitable gifts all the time it is also true that their contributions are usually intended to enhance the corporations visibility or image before the consuming public that is goodw ill is valuable asset for corporation and charitable contributions help to cr eate that goodwill however it generally makes difference to corporation whethe r it deducts its payment as charitable contribution or as business advertising expense because either deduction lowers its federal income tax by the same amount21 only when the special rules for contributions of inventory come into play does it make difference as to how the gift is viewed and how the value of the c ontribution changes under current tax law equity concerns there are equity challenges to extending the current enhanced tax deduction for corporate contributions of food to all taxp ayers engaged in trade or business such as small family farms and family operated restaurants sometimes referred to as entrepreneurs in this report primary obstacle is that th cost basis could be higher for corporations than for small business this result can be caused by the inclusion of wages and germane taxes such as social security unemployment taxes etc that are paid by corporations but are not alwa ys included in the cost basis of small businesses such as farmers who grow cr ops or ownerchefs who own individual restaurants since it can be expected that onehalf of the appreciation of the crops generally would be lower for corporations with the full deductibility of the cost basis than for individual farmers an inherent advantage would still be given corporate farmers with their higher cost basis for example if corporation has cost basis of 7000 with appreciation of 3000 this equals market price of 10000 small entrepreneur would more likely have cost basis of 3000 and an appreciation rate of 7000 for the same 10000 market price in the corporate case onehalf of the appreciation 1500 and the cost basis 7000 is equal to 8500 in the case of the entrepreneur one half the appreciation 3500 plus the cost basis 3000 is equal to 6500 thus the cor poration would receive nearly 2000 more in deductibility httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31097crs10 22 the graduated corporate tax rates both increase and decrease across taxable incomes this graduation is justified as an aid to small businesses as corporate taxable income rises the graduation is eliminated through phaseouts corporate tax rates for taxable income up to 50000 are 15 between 50k and 75k the rate is 25 between 75k and 100k the rate is 34 between 100k and 335k the rate is 39 between 335k and 10m the rate is 34 between 10m and 15m the rate is 35 between 15m and 18333333 the rate is 38 taxable incomes over that amount pay at the 35 rate most very large corporations pay tax rate of 35 it can be argued that the temporary law provides more equity among all taxpayers engaged in trade or business than the current permanent law which provides the enhanced deduction only to c corporations and does not include provisions for s businesses or individuals tax rate differentials in addition it should be not ed that tax rates and the graduation of those rates are different for individuals and corpor ations current law provides for corporate tax rates which ra nge between 15 and 35 depending on the companys taxable income phaseouts can make the effective rates for certain corporations rise as high as 39 in ta x year 2005 individuals will be subject to six tax rates ranging from 10 to 35 in all cases whether corporat or individual the value of the enhanced deducti on is dependent on the appli cable tax rate typically those with higher incomes would receive more advantage than those with lower incomes under the proposal22 thus it does not appear that full equity can be achieved through the extension of the curre nt enhanced deduction for corporate gifts of food inventory to all taxpayers engaged in trade or business for example large corporation will most likely have 35 rate small farmer filing joint return whose income is less than 182800 woul d be subject to 28 rate it may also be noted that the law applies onl to food inventory and as such may discriminate against other similar forms of charitable contributions such as gifts of clothing for the poor an alternative possi bility tax credit from an economic perspective the use of tax credit rather than deduction would better promote equity among all business taxpayers tax deductions are useful in defi ning income that should be taxable for instance in the case of individuals it is typically argued that charitable contributions are made using funds that ar longer within the taxpayers control and thus monies to which the taxpayer may longer lay real claim in this instance the deduction helps to define th income that should be subject to tax tax credits are subtracted from tax liability whereas tax deductions are subtracted from income to determine the amount subject to tax the net result is that for each 1 of tax credit the tax liability is reduced by 1 deductions reduce tax liability by only percentage of the duction depending upon th tax rate of the taxpayer tax credits are used primarily to reduce taxes directly rather than to define the base on which taxes should be collected and are frequently used as incentives further tax credits can be used by all eligible taxpayers who owe taxes since they are subtracted directly from tax liabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31097crs11 23 proposed legislation is silent on this topic 24 42 usca 1791 bill emerson good samaritan food

on gpo 2001 p 10 26 lucky stores inc v commissioner 105 tc 420 1995 27 the court ruled that lucky stores sold four day old bread at full retail price and did not discount sales to its own customers further the court found that the quantity of sales of fourday old bread was irrelevant the court noted that the irs argument over the industry practice of discounting fourday old bread did not prove fair market value but rather that continuedother issues we have assumed that fa rmers may donate crops to qualified organizations for gleaning which is defined as the act of taxexempt organization that either harvests the crop or gathers the grain or other produce left in the field after an initial harvest23 farmers decision to abandon crops in th field is typically made at the time of harvest fixed costs such as seed fertilizer and other costs such as purchased irrigation water typically referred to as s unk costs are not take n into consideration when making the decision to harvest the decision to move crop to market is based on whether the farmer will receive market price for the crop that exceeds his cost for harvesting packing and transporting th crop in those cases where the decision is marginal ie the point at which the fa rmer may break even to harvest or not to harvest it would be to the farmers adva ntage to make use of the proposed enhanced deduction by opting to have the crop gleaned by an exempt organization expenses associated with the harvest w ould be incurred while deduction would be available to offset taxation of the farmers other taxable f unds alternatively the use of carryover of the deduction for offsettin g taxable funds could be available for up to five future tax years appropriate valuati on of donated goods primary problem with products that have shelf li ves is determining an appr opriate value for the goods donated under certain proposal s the fair market value can be determined by the price of the same or simila r food items sold by the taxpayer at the time of the contribution or sold in the recent past prior legislative language provided safe harbor for taxpayers by defining apparen tly wholesome food that is eligible for donation under this proposed definition the food may be apparently wholesome even if it is not readily marketable due to appearance age freshness grade size surplus or other conditions this defi nition is the same as provided in the bill emerson good samaritan food donation act 24 in discussing this valuation problem wh ich is now part of the legislative history25 court case was cited where the tax court held the value of surplus bread inventory donated to qualifie d charity was determined to be the same as the full retail price of the bread26 the internal revenue serv ice irs contended that the retail value of the bread was half the normal sales price since the industry practice of major bakers is to discount fourdayold bread27 if the court had ruled the value ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31097crs12 27 continued lucky stores could have sold the bread at discount if it so chose to do so 28 since onehalf the fair market value was less than basis lucky stores would have received the exact same deduction for cont ribution to food bank or for discarded inventory which in both cases is tax deduction for basis 29 some products have higher disposal costs than others for example unneeded medical supplies and certain computer compone nts may have high destruction costs 30 it should be noted that lucky stores delib erately overproduced brea d by doing so they were able to assure that bread was in stock at all times for customer needs thus they were able to keep their customers happy and in their stores to purchase product while also knowing that they would receive tax bene fit for the overproduction often when firm has excess capacity an additional units cost ma be relatively small because there are many fixed costs or in some cases there may be fixed costs associated with goods produced for sale rather than goods pr oduced for contributions such as the expenses associated with advertising costs for goods sold 31 cost estimates for the proposals introduced in the 109th congress are not available 32 as an example the pharmaceutical industry coul d request similar safe harbor for valuing drugs donated near their expiration date the bread was half the reta il selling price following industry practice then lucky stores would have received tax benefit and thus couragement to make such charitable donations28 the courts findings contradict ed regulations issued by irs one effect of passage of the proposed gislation would be to make the ruling in the lucky stores case the law of the land rather than being applicable only in the 9th circuit opponents of the provision ma argue that there are economic incentives rather than tax incentives for stores to c ontinue to make such gifts for example there are costs associated with disposal of product29 obviously the gifting of products reduces disposal costs in addition companies can expect goodwill commonly referred to as cause marketing high profile contributions can contribute to image building for th firm and influence public opinion30 it is anticipated that opponents of the legislation may argue that the changes would reduce revenues to the federal government the joint committee on taxation estimated that enactment of the provision in the care legislation introduced during the 108th congress would have resulted in revenue loss of 255 million over the fiveyear period of 20022006 with an estimated increase to 626 million over the 10year period of 2002201131 it was expected that other industries would have requested similar tax treatment32 which if granted would ve lead to an additional reduction in tax receipts at time of increasing budget deficits direct subsidy programs as an alternative in the past some have argued that it would be preferable for the government to pay directly for the additional support of food prog rams rather than creating expenditures through the tax system direct government subsidies would assure that such funds were likely to be allocated under objective procedures and woul d therefore go to all the poor strictly based on need further it is argued that direct government spending programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31097crs13 would assure that expenditures would be subjected to periodic review under the budgetary process some feel that the expansion of the charitable deduction to all taxpayers engaged in trade or business provides gr eater food benefits to people living near farm production areas where the food is harv ested more so than to people living far from farm areas in large cities further gifts made by farms are likely to be seasonal others note that more restau rants are located in populated areas and that they may be the primary beneficiaries of the provi sion proponents of th proposals are most likely to argue that more food would be ava ilable to the elderly poor and infants for each tax expenditure dollar than through other direct government food expenditure programs another argued advantage woul d be that most likely there would be minimal federal governme nt involvement in administering the program both sides have agreed that the proposed change woul d add complexity to the tax return filing process for greater number of taxpayers in the charitable contribution arena some have suggested that since there is sunset provision congress would have an opportunity to evaluate the success of the change
