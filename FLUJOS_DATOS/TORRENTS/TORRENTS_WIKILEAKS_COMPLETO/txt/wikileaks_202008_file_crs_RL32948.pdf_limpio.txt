the public and policy interest in animal agriculture has focused on impacts on water resources because animal waste if not properly managed can harm water quality through surface runoff direct discharges spills and leaching into soil and groundwater more recent issue is the contribution of emissions from animal feeding operations afo enterprises where animal s are raised in confinement to air pollution this report provides background on the latter issue afos can affect air quality through emissions of gases such as ammonia and hydrogen sulfide particulate matter volatile organic compounds hazardous air pollutants and odor these pollutants and compounds have number of environmental and human health effects agricultural operations have been treated differently from other businesses under numerous federal and state laws some environmental laws specifically exempt agriculture from regulatory provisions and some are designed so that farms escape most if not all of the regulatory impact the primary regulatory focus on environmental impacts has occurred under the clean water act in addition afos that emit large quantities of air pollutants may be subject to clean air act regulation some livestock operations also may be regulated under the release reporting requirements of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and the emergency planning nd community righttoknow act epcra questions about the applicability of these laws to livestock and poultry operations have been controversial and have drawn congressional attention enforcement of federal environmental laws requires accurate measurement of emissions to determine whether regulated pollutants are emitted in quantities that exceed specified thresholds two reports by the national research council evaluated the current scientific knowledge base and approaches for estimating air emissions from afos as guide for future management and regulatory efforts stakeholders may find little agreement on these issues with the exception of agreeing on need for research to estimate measure and characterize emissions and to develop and evaluate technologies to mitigate and control emissions in an effort to collect scientifically credible data on air emissions in january 2005 the environmental protection agency epa announced plan negotiated with segments of the animal agriculture industry called the air compliance agreement it is intended to produce air quality monitoring data on afo emissions while at the same time protecting participants through safe harbor from liability under certain provisions of federal environmental laws issues related to this agreement which has been controversial among environmental advocates state and local air quality officials and some industry groups are discussed separately in crs report rl32947 air quality issues and animal agriculture ep s air compliance agreement coordinated by claudia copeland

is 100 billion per year indu stry in the united states livestock and poultry are raised on an estimated 13 million farms throughout the nation about 238000 of these farms are considered animal feeding operations afoagriculture enterprises where animals are kept and raised in confinement an estimated 95 of these are small businesses most afos raise fewer than 300 animals very large afos housing 300 or more animals such as cows or equivalent numbers of other animal species are defined as concentrated animal feeding operations or cafos for more than two decades organizational changes within the industry to enhance economic efficiency have resulted in larger confined production facilities that often are geographically concentrated increased facility size greater numbers of animals being raised at large feedlots and regional concentration of livestock and poultry operations have in turn given rise to concerns over the management of animal wastes from these facilities and potential impacts on environmental quality from an environmental quality standpoint much of the public and policy interest in animal agriculture has focused on impacts on water resources because animal waste if not properly managed can adversely impact water quality through surface runoff and erosion direct discharges to surface waters spills and other dryweather discharges and leaching into soil and groundwater however animal feeding operations can also result in emissions to the air of particles and gases such as ammonia hydrogen sulfide and volatile organic chemicals voc at issue today are questions about afos contribution to total air pollution and corresponding ecological and possible public health effects resolving those questions is hindered by lack of adequate accurate scientifically credible data on air emissions from afos data that are needed to gauge possible adverse impacts and subsequent implementation of control measures this report provides background on these issues 1 it first reviews the types of air emissions from livestock and poultry operations and their human health and environmental impacts it then discusses provisions of several federal laws concerned with environmental impacts beginning with the clean water act because protecting water resources has been the primary regulatory focus regarding livestock and animal operations the environmental protection agency epa has authority to address afo air emissions under several lawsthe clean air act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund and the emergency planning and community righttoknow act epcrawhich are discussed next questions about the applicability of these laws to livestock and poultry operations have been controversial in several arenas and have drawn congressional attention studies by the national research council concerning air emissions are reviewed as are relevant activities of the states and the us department of agriculture finally the report identifies number of key research questions needed to characterize and evaluate animal agriculture emissions in january 2005 epa announced plan called the air compliance agreement that would produce air quality monitoring data on animal agriculture emissions from small number of farms while 1 this report focuses on the animal production segment of agriculture other types of production agriculture also can generate air emissions such as land preparation and crop harvest activities prescribed burning and other farming practices or emissions associated with storage and use of mobile source fuels and operation of farm vehicles engines and equipment while some of these types of emissions may contribute to air quality problems especially in agriculturedominated regions they are outside the scope of this report

manure can be converted to ammonia nh 3 by combination of processes ammonia released from the surface of liquid manure storage structures rapidly adheres to particles in the air due to its cohesive propert ies thus contributing to the formation of ambient particulate matter specifically ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate these particles form to varying degree in the presence of ammonia and oxides of nitrogen or sulfur see below once emitted ammonia also is redeposited back to earth in rainfall that can harm surface waters and aquatic life in lakes and streams ammonia aerosols in rainfall contribute to oxygen depletion of aquatic systems and excessive growth of algae as well as acidification of the environment it is estimated that emissions from animal waste account for about onehalf of the total natural and anthropogenic ammonia emitted in the united states annually ammonia has strong sharp characteristic odor that disperses rapidly in the air health effects at low concentrations include eye nose and throat irritation exposure at very high shortterm concentrations can be lethal particles are highly complex in size physical properties and composition for regulatory purposes airborne particulate matter pm is commonly considered as coarse particles those less than 10 microns in diameter referred to as pm 10 or fine particles those less than 25 microns in diameter referred to as pm 25 pm 10 and pm 25 can be directly emitted geologic material including from unpaved roads and other dust agriculture is major direct source of pm 10 from sources such as grain mills or storage facilities feeding equipment and particles generated in other mechanical processes in contrast pm 25 is different class of particles resulting more from evaporation and atmospheric chemical processes than from direct emissions fine particles are formed in the atmosphere through the chemical interaction of precursor emissions such as sulfur oxides nitrogen oxides and vocs afos can contribute directly to particulate matter through several mechanisms including animal activity animal housing ventilation units and particles of mineral and organic material from soil and manure that adhere to air molecules as described above particulate matter can contribute indirectly to fine particle formation by emissi ons of ammonia nitrogen oxides and hydrogen sulfide which are converted to aerosols through reactions in the atmosphere particle formation is highly dependent on atmospheric temperature humidity concentrations of the precursor

difficult to predict particles of differing sizes have been linked to health effects larger particles tend to be deposited in the upper airways of the respiratory tract whereas small particles have both health and environmental effects they can be deposited in the smallest airways in the lungs and while still airborne also play an important role in formation of regional haze populations with longterm exposure to heavier loads of particles have higher rates of mortality from major cardiovascular diseases as well as increased rates of morbidity the primary environmental and ecological effects of particles are related to haze and decreased visibility which is caused by the suspended aerosols that both absorb and scatter light hydrogen sulfide h2s is colorless gas with strong and generally objectionable rotten egg odor it is produced in anaerobic oxygendeprived environments from the microbial reduction of sulfate in water and the decomposition of sulfurcontaining organic matter in manure acute human health effects include respiratory and cardiovascular irritation as well as headaches h2s may have local effects of concernespecially odorand may contribute to the atmospheric sulfur burden of regions with high density of afos but few other sources methane and nitrous oxide are known to contribute to global warming an estimated onehalf of global methane comes from manmade sources of which agriculture is the largest source with livestock production being major component within the sector epa estimates that 25 of the nations methane emissions come from livestock agricultural methane is produced by ruminant animals but also is emitted during microbial degradation of organic matter under anaerobic conditions nitrous oxide forms via the microbial processes of nitrification and denitrification in the united states animal waste accounts for about 6 of nitrous oxide emissions many of the complaints about afos are generated by odor odor from afos is not caused by single substance but is rather the result of large number of contributing compounds including ammonia vocs and hydrogen sulfide as classes of compounds odor and vocs can be considered together vocs also referred to as reactive organic compounds or rog vaporize easily at room temperature and include large number of constituents such as volatile fatty acids sulfides amines alcohols hydrocarbons and halocarbons in terms of their health and environmental effects some vocs may irritate the skin eyes nose and throat they also can be precursors to the formation of pm 25 and ozone smog adverse effects of ozone include lung damage and exacerbated respiratory disease as well as diminished visibility ozone in the troposphere the lowest layer of the atmosphere which is closest to the earth has both natural and anthropogenic sources it can damage forests crops and manmade materials and harm respiratory tissue through inhalation ozone that occurs naturally at groundlevel is generally at low concentrations that are not believed to threaten human health or the environment ozone that is byproduct of human activity is formed through the interaction of sunlight with vocs nitrogen oxides and other substances and adds to the total atmospheric burden of the pollutant effects of these pollutants occur on variety of scales as shown in table 1

and other factors systems and strategies now in wide use by farmers are those that have proved the most costeffective and reliable at achieving their design objectives land application has been and remains the predominant method for disposing of manure and recycling its nutrient and organic content for the most part design objectives for managing manure do not include minimization of emissions of ammonia methane or other gaseous compounds but rather focus on odor and dust control avoidance of direct discharge to surface water and land application at rates that are beneficial to growing crops3 as noted above emissions of odors gases and dust from livestock production facilities arise from buildings manure storage and land application eliminating emissions from one of these sources will likely not eliminate emissions entirely as control technologies often address only one of the three sources many of the available technologies reduce emissions none eliminates them4 some technologies have been evaluated to the point of demonstrating efficacy but most have not been evaluated systematically emissions from buildings can be reduced by inhibiting contaminant generation or by capturing and treating the air as it leaves the building eg by using biofilters to treat ventilation air or wet 3nrc 2003 afo report pp 4647 4 iowa state university and the university of iowa study

release frequent manure removal is one of the best ways of reducing contaminant generation within the building other methods that can be used inside buildings include using bedded solid manure ie manure mixed with bedding that creates solid stack of material chemical additives on animal litter and diet manipulation there are four general types of manure storage deep pits outdoor slurry storage anaerobic lagoons and solid stacks outdoor storage is the most apparent source of odors controls that have been shown to be effective when managed properly include various types of covers permeable and impermeable natural such as straw or cornstalks and synthetic techniques to manipulate the manure to minimize emissions also exist but have certain limitations for example separating solids from liquid manure reduces the load on anaerobic lagoons but also creates second waste stream to manage which may be detrimental to overall air quality proper aeration will eliminate odors from outdoor storage but it is expensive in liquid system anaerobic digesters reduce odors but they are also not economically feasible 5 emission control during land application is best done by direct injection of liquid manure below the soil surface solid manure is generally less odorous than liquid but because it cannot be injected rapid incorporation into the soil by plowing or similar techniques is the best method to minimize odors while many treatment technologies are available that may be important in mitigating emissions the effectiveness of most of them is not well quantified extensive research

of california at davis california state university fresno purdue university texas am university and others and information on available control measures and strategies for agricultural sources of air pollution is being presented 6 experts believe that cost increased management requirements and lack of economic or regulatory incentives to encourage or require their use are the primary reasons that

efficiency have resulted in larger confined production facilities that often are geographically concentrated8 the driving forces behind structural change in livestock and poultry production are different than those that affect many other industries technological innovation and economies of scale9 from 1982 to 1997 the total number of us operations with confined livestock fell by 27 at the same time the number of animals raised at large feedlots generally confining 300 animals or more increased by 88 and the number of large feedlots increased by more than 50 10 the traditional image of small farms located in isolated rural locales has given way to very large farming operations some on the scale of industrial activities increased facility size and regional concentration of livestock and poultry operations have in turn given rise to concerns over the management of animal wastes from these facilities and potential impacts on environmental quality agricultural operations often have been treated differently from other types of businesses under numerous federal and state laws in the area of environmental policy one observer noted that agriculture is virtually unregulated by the expansive body of environmental law that has developed in the united states in the past 30 years11 some laws specifically exempt agriculture from regulatory provisions and others are structured in such way that farms escape most if not all of the regulatory impact the clean water act cwa for example expressly exempts most agricultural operations from the laws requirements while under the clean air act caa most agricultural sources escape that laws regulatory programs because the majority of them do not meet the caas minimum emission quantity thresholds moreover in implementing environmental laws federal and state regulators have traditionally focused most effort on controlling the largest and most visible sources of pollution to the water air and landfactories waste treatment plants motor vehiclesrather than smaller and more dispersed sources such as farms nevertheless certain large animal feeding operations are subject to environmental regulation the primary regulatory focus on environmental impacts has been on protecting water resources and has occurred under the clean water act in addition facilities that emit large quantities of air pollutants may be regulated under the clean air act some livestock operations may also be subject to the release reporting requirements of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the superfund law and the emergency planning and community righttoknow act the following sect ions describe relevant provisions of these laws 8 for additional information see crs report rl33325 livestock marketing and

water act cwa 33 usc 12511387 provides one exception to policies that generally exempt agricultural activitiesand specifically the livestock industryfrom environmental rules the law protects water quality by combination of ambient water quality standards established by states limits on effluent discharges and permits12 the regulatory structure of the cwa distinguishes between point sources eg manufacturing and other industrial facilities which are regulated by discharge permits and nonpoint sources pollution that occurs in conjunction with surface erosion of soil by water and surface runoff of rainfall or snowmelt from diffuse areas such as farm and ranch land most agricultural activities are considered to be nonpoint sources since they do not discharge wastes from pipes outfalls or similar conveyances pollution from nonpoint sources is generally governed by state water quality planning provisions of the act however the cwa defines large animal feeding operations that meet specific regulatory threshold number of animals termed concentrated animal feeding operations or cafo they are small percentage of all animal feeding operations as point sources and treats cafos in manner similar to other industrial sources of pollution they are subject to the acts prohibition against discharging pollutants into waters of the united states without permit in 2003 epa revised regulations that were first promulgated in the 1970s defining the term cafo for purposes of permit requirements and specifying effluent limitations on pollutant discharges from regulated feedlots these regulations are intended to address the concern that animal waste if not properly managed can adversely impact the environment through several possible pathways including surface runoff and erosion direct discharges to surface waters spills and other dryweather discharges leaching into soil and groundwater and releases to air including subsequent deposition back to land and surface waters the primary pollutants associated with animal wastes are nutrients particularly nitrogen and phosphorus organic matter solids pathogens and odorousvolatile compounds data collected for the epas 2000 national water quality inventory identify agriculture as the leading contributor to water quality impairments in rivers and lakes animal feeding operations are only subset of the agriculture category but 29 states specifically identified animal feeding operations as contributing to water quality impairment 13 the 2003 clean water rule applies to approximately 15500 of the largest animal feeding operations that confine cattle dairy cows swine sheep chickens laying hens and turkeys or about 65 of all animal confinement facilities in the united states the rule details requirements for permits annual reports and development of plans for handling manure and wastewater the rule contains performance standard which prohibits discharges from regulated cafos except in the event of wastewater or manure overflows or runoff from an exceptional 25year 24hour rainfall event parts of the rule are intended to control land application of animal manure and wastewater 14 on october 31

vacated other parts and remanded still other parts to epa for clarification epa estimates that under the revised rule about 15300 cafos or 74 of the 20700 cafos operating in 2008 will be required to obtain permits the revised rule also provides for greater public participation in connection with nutrient management plans requiring that they be subject to public notice and review and be included as enforceable elements of permit under the 2003 rule cafos were to obtain permits by february 2006 and to develop and implement nutrient management plans by december 2006 because of the time required to develop the revised rule as result of the federal court ruling epa pushed back the deadlines for permits and nutrient plans to february 27 2009 the compliance deadline extension will not apply to new livestock operations or to existing cafos that were required to obtain permits prior to the 2003 rule15 scientists recognize that actions taken to mitigate harmful water quality impacts of managing animal waste can have implications for air quality in complex ways that are not perfectly understood environmental policies do not always account for interactions between media for example to meet water quality goals lagoons are commonly used to store and treat manure waste from swine and other operations these storage systems volatilize nitrogen thereby reducing its concentration in lagoon effluent but the volatilized nitrogen compounds escape into the air creating odors contributing to fine particulates haze and potentially hastening global climate change 16

specifically creates five classes of ozone nonattainment from least to most polluted marginal moderate serious severe and extreme more stringent control requirements are imposed in areas with worse pollution generally major source is stationary source that emits or has potential to emit 100 tons per year or more of any pollutant however regulated sources of haps that emit more than 10 tons per year of an individual hazardous pollutant or 25 tons per year of all haps combined or sources in the most serious nonattainment areas that emit as little as 10 tons per year of vocs or x are defined as major sources and would be subject to these caa requirements states sip provisions must be at least as stringent as federal requirements but beyond the core caa framework states have latitude in adopting requirements to achieve national ambient air quality standards states for example may regulate additional categories of sources or may define major sources more stringently than do federal programs most agricultural operations are believed to be minor sources of air pollution and few have been required to comply with the acts permit requirements some environmental advocates have argued that many large livestock facilities emit more than 100 tons per year of regulated pollutants especially ammonia and should be regulated as major sources under federal law however federal and state officials generally have placed low priority on regulating agricultural sources and further lack of adequate air quality monitoring data hampers the ability of regulators to answer key questions agricultural air pollution has become more of an issue in some parts of the country as epa implements the 1997 naaqs for particulates which epa revised in september 2006 19 and as nonattainment areas look to reduce pollutants from more sources as they strive to come into attainment as discussed previously emissions of ammonia and several other afo pollutants are precursors that transform in the atmosphere to form secondary particulate matter aside from ammonia other agriculture pollutants include dust that contributes to pm 10 diesel emissions from farm equipment and emissions from specialized activities such as crop burning20 2004 lawsuit brought in federal court by environmentalists argued that feedlots must be regulated under the clean air act and must obtain caa permit to construct under provisions of the idaho sip the company intending to construct large feedlot had argued that the sip did not require permit for key pollutants from ag ricultural sources including ammonia and hydrogen sulfide in september 2004 the court ruled that the states plan did not allow such exemptions indicating that any agricultural facility in the state with sufficient emissions levels would have to obtain permit the case was settled early in 2005 when the parties to the lawsuit agreed to request that the idaho department of environmental quality conduct rulemaking to establish process for caa permitting of dairies in the state idaho conservation league v adrian boer didciv 104cv00250blw february 1 2005 industry officials say the case has limited implications because it refers specifically to the idaho sip but environmentalists involved in the case believe it could have significance nationally because of the mutual agreement by the parties on emissions

excluding those types of afo emissions from applicable caa requirements in 2003 letter to epa state and local air program administrators said that such policy if pursued would crea inequities in caa application between similar operations in some sectors but not others since barns and lagoons are the dominant sources of emissions from the cafo industry such policy would exempt most agricultural operations from many provisions of the clean air act the result would be an evisceration of states and localities ability to address air quality problems emanating from agricultural operations 21

quality impacts and have some level of significance and virtually all emission sources even very small ones are regulated both areas have large concentrations of confined animal feeding operations agriculture is the san joaquin valley basins most important industry and significant source of its air emissions thus agricultural sources have been particular focus of efforts to implement the federal and state laws in both regions22 for more than 30 years california law specifically exempted existing major livestock production or equipment used in crop growing from all vironmental permitting requirements in 1994 epa notified the state that the agriculture exemption was defect in the states clean air program that prevented california from fully regulating all air pollution sources that notification and settlement of lawsuit by citizen groups seeking to force epa to impose air pollution controls on californias agriculture industry finally led epa in october 2002 to withdraw federal approval of the states program pursuant to the clean air act epa was then required to implement federal program while the state addressed the cited deficiencies following that action and during the time it temporarily had responsibility for the california program epa evaluated ways to administer the law while minimizing significant new permitting requirements on thousands of existing agricultural sources in the state major concern was recognition that there was insufficient scientific information about agricultur air emissions to immediately issue permits to sources or mandate pollution control requirements epa considered various regulatory options but did not actually issue any permits in california before its responsibility for the state program ended in august 2003 the state reassumed responsibility after the legislature enacted measure california sb 700 that removed the long standing exemption for agriculture and set timelines for existing facilities to apply for clean air permits and install control technologies sb 700 regulates crop growers dairies poultry farms cattle ranches foodprocessing operations and other agriculturerelated businesses in the state as of january 1 2004 it made these sources subject to air quality permitting and specified emission mitigation requirements deadlines and requirements differ depending on the size of facilities level of emissions and the attainment status of the region where the source is located the state and its local air quality management districts in california the state sets overall rules and policies and 35 local agencies have primary daytoday responsibility are now implementing sb 700 the law mandated that the state air resources board review scientific information and adopt definition of large confined animal facilities by july 2005 that information is now being used by local air districts to begin issuing permits to facilities and adopting various regulations to control emissions under sb 700 the district rules must require facilities to obtain permits and to reduce emissions to the extent feasible for severe and extreme ozone nonattainment areas the law requires best available retrofit control technology barct in moderate and serious areas regulated facilities will need to use reasonably available control technology ract in federal ozone attainment areas where air quality problems are less significant districts must adopt rule requiring existing large confined animal facilities to reduce air contaminants to the extent feasible unless the district makes finding that

board seeks to include the majority of emissions or animals which are in the larger livesto ck facilities in the state by focusing on large facilities and excluding smaller farms dairies and other operations the board expects to obtain the most air quality benefit while regulating the fewest number of facilities under the approach approved by the board in june 2005 agricultural operations in areas designated in nonattainment for the federal 1hour ozone standard will be defined as large confined animal facilities based on specified numbers of animals at the facility for example facilities with 1000 or more milk producing cows or 650000 chickens at broiler chicken operations and will be required to obtain air quality permits in areas with less significant air quality problemsthose designated as in attainment for the federal onehour ozone standardthresholds are twice as high eg 2000 milkproducing cows or 13 million broiler chickens 23 in addition the state board is working with local air districts university researchers and others to develop and evaluate research on emissions factors from livestock operations to be used by facilities that are required to obtain air permits affected industries are closely watching these research studies and the standards being adopted by local air districts even before the state board defined which existing facilities face new requirements some local air quality control districts had moved ahead with permitting and emission reduction requirements for example the san joaquin valley district adopted rules to reduce pm emissions from general cropbased agricultural operations and dairies with 500 or more cows and in the south coast district dairies with 50 or more cows are required to reduce emissions industry contends that the state board should have first established how much pollution comes from livestock operations before any permitting requirements were implemented but the local districts interpreted sb 700 as requiring permits by january 1 2005 the local districts have attempted to provide flexibility but the overall situation has created substantial confusion for the farm community in california districts also have adopted additional rules more recently for example the san joaquin valley district adopted rule in june 2006 to curb voc emissions from dairies and other cafos farmers in the state have resisted efforts to implement federal and state laws to regulate emissions from agriculture some in industry contend that agriculture emissions are not major sources of pollution and that any regulation should await completion of federal and state studies that are examining the industrys contribution to air pollution while california sb700 focuses on existing agricultural sources by lifting the longstanding exemption for such operations from the state health safety code new and modified agriculture sources in the state also became subject to permit and regulatory requirements of the california state implementation plan sip new or modified sources located in nonattainment areas which may emit air pollution must obtain new source review permits that require installation of best available control technology bact and require purchase of offsets or emission reduction credits from other sources in the same nonattainment area in relation determined by the severity of the air pollution problem local district rules implement these federal and state requirements for example san joaquin valley district rule 2201 requires new or modified stationary source including agriculture sources to install bact when the potential to emit voc exceeds 2 pounds per day and to purchase offsets for voc when the sources potential to emit exceeds 10 tons per year 23 state of california

from the dakotas minnesota and wisconsin south through texas sweeping across the southeast to the coastal states of georgia the carolinas virginia maryland and pennsylvania and north through new york and vermont 25 the issue of evaluating and managing the health and environmental impacts of emissions from animal agriculture facilities has largely been left up to states air quality has not been the driving force behind state government action on afos bu t has emerged out of longstanding concern to protect water resources several states have recognized need to regulate air emissions from agricultural operations but many states have not yet directly adopted or enacted programs affecting afo emissions state programs under statutes and regulations both implement and supplement federal caa requirements that is in some cases state programs have been adopted to ensure state compliance with requirements of the federal law and to implement sips such as facility permits that apply to construction and operation of livestock operations in other cases states have enacted more comprehensive laws and regulations calling for air emission testing and monitoring manure management to abate pollutant emissions inspections and testing some states have regulatory programs or ambient air standards for odor andor certain afo pollutants such as hydrogen sulfide for which naaqs apply in states with significant animal production facility management statutes often govern construction and operation of afos primarily for purposes of protecting water quality with incidental provisions for air quality for example facility management statutes often contain setback requirements for confinement buildings and waste impoundments that may help to reduce ai r emissions by avoiding or minimizing odor nuisances survey of seven states 26 identified number of measures to govern air emissions from livestock facilities but comprehensive regulatory systems states have used varied techniques to control air emissions from afos state programs set emission limits require use of best management practices and impose other preoperational and operational requirements hydrogen sulfide and odor

facilities that treat animal wastes separate regulation establishes an odor emissions standard for swine feeding operations and requires that anaerobic waste impoundments be covered north carolina like colorado has focused its regulatory efforts on odor emissions from swine operations all afos must use management practices that control odors and some swine operations must submit odor management plans although it does not require control technology eg covers unless best management practices fail north carolina does not have air emission standards for h2s ammonia or odor separate survey done by the nebraska department of environmental quality found that more than half of the states have standards for hydrogen sulfide states base standards on variety of issues including odor or nuisance

seaboard farms case in order to clarify the governments position on the issues but epa declined to do so within the timeframe specified by the court three other cases in federal courts while not specifically dealing with reporting violations and air emissions or what constitutes facility for reporting purposes also have attracted attention in part because they have raised the question of whether animal wastes that contain phosphorus are hazardous substances that can create cleanup and natural resource damage liability under superfund in 2003 federal court in oklahoma held that

requirements arguing that releases from poultry growing operations pose little or risk to public health while reporting imposes an undue burden on the regulated community and government responders 30 in december 2007 epa issued proposal in response to the poultry industry petition31 epa proposed to exempt releases of hazardous substances to the air typically during digestion or decomposition from animal waste at farms from the notification requirements of cercla and epcra the exemption would apply to releases to the air from manure digestive emissions and urea including animal waste mixed with bedding compost and other specified materials farm is defined in the proposal as an agricultural operation from which 1000 or more of agricultural products are sold annually the same definition used by the department of agriculture epa explained that the rule is justified because of the resource burden to industry of complying with reporting requirements since the agency cannot foresee situation where response action would be taken as result of notification of releases of hazardous substances from animal waste at farms 32 the proposal drew significant public comment and response while such regulatory exemption might satisfy many agriculture industry groups who seek waiver or other means to limit possible liability under cercla and epcra environmental advocates and other interested entities opposed the exemption saying that emissions from animal wastes are not trivial or benign critics noted that the epa proposal would exempt releases of ammonia as originally requested in the industry petition plus hydrogen sulfide and all other hazardous chemicals such as nitrous oxide and volatile organic compounds released from animal wastes it also would apply to all livestock operations not just poultry farms some argued that an exemption is premature since epa is moving forward with research on emissions levels which could be undermined by regulatory exemption see crs report rl32947 air quality issues and animal agriculture ep s air compliance agreement coordinated by claudia copeland state air quality officials opposed blanket regulatory or legislative exemptions and they recommended that if the agency 30 in 1998 epa granted an administrative exemption from release reporting requirements for certain radionuclide releases epa cited authority in cercla sections

of pollutants that cafos are releasing to the air and water gao recommended that epa develop comprehensive national inventory of cwapermitted cafos and accelerate its efforts to develop protocols for measuring and quantifying air contaminants from animal feedlots gao noted that epa has been criticized because its current air emissions monitoring activities are limited in scope and sample size and may not produce sufficient information to shape future regulation moreover gao questioned the basis for the cerclaepcra exemption that epa proposed in 2007 it is unclear how epa made this

2005 that house energy and commerce subcommittee held hearing on animal agriculture and superfund the subcommittee on environment and hazardous materials heard from agriculture industry witnesses who urged congress to provide policy direction on the issue that has resulted from recent and potential litigation other witnesses testified that the reporting and notification requirements of cercla and

waste and hazardous substances current laws and legislative issues by claudia copeland some members of congress have been critical of epa s proposal to exempt routine animal waste air releases from cercla and epcras reporting requirements questioning the potential for harmful environmental and enforcement impacts of the proposal37 at september 24 2008 hearing where gaos recent report was discussed38 several house energy and commerce subcommittee members said that they are skeptical of the epas authority for blanket exemption others suggested that an exemption fo r small farms whose emissions are unlikely to cause environmental harm would make sense epa and usda witnesses supported the proposal saying that the air release waiver would only affect reporting meant for emergency response situations but would not affect requirements to report emissions of hazardous substances from other farm sources or releases of hazardous substances from manure into soil ground water or

issue of air emissions from cafos received some attention the clean water act requires epa to consider nonwater quality environmental impacts such as air emissions when it sets effluent limitations and standards epa recognized that certain animal waste management practices can either increase or decrease emissions of ammonia andor hydrogen sulfide and that some regulatory options intended to minimize water discharges such as anaerobic lagoons and waste storage ponds have the potential to result in higher air emissions than other options due to vo latilization of ammonia in the waste likewise emissions of nitrous oxide are liberated from nd application of animal waste on cropland when 37 letter from reps john dingell albert wynn hilda solis to stephen l johnson epa administrator

denitrification39 some environmental groups had urged epa to address or restrict feedlot air emissions as part of the water quality rule in the proposed rule and the 2003 final revised rule epa generally evaluated air emissions impacts of the rule but it said that insufficient data exist to fully analyze all possible compounds and the significance of air emissions from feedlot operations in part because of this lack of information in 2001 epa asked the national research council nrc of the national academy of sciences for report evaluating the current scientific knowledge base and approaches for estimating air emissions from afos epa asked the nrc to identify critical short and longterm research needs and provide recommendations on the most promising sciencebased approaches for estimating and measuring emissions usda joined epa in the request for the study at the time epa was under court order to issue the water quality rules and hoped that the nrc report would help assure that rules aimed at improving water quality would not have negative impacts on air emissions in an interim report released in 2002 the nrc responded to several of the epa questions 40 nitrogen emissions from production areas are substantial the committee found and control strategies aimed at decreasing emissions sh ould be designed and implemented now it recommended developing improved approaches to estimating and measuring emissions of key air pollutants from afos and initiating longterm c oordinated research by epa and usda with the goal of eliminating release of undesirable air emissions the committee said that implementation of feasible management practices that are designed to decrease emissions such as incorporating manure into soil should not be delayed while research on mitigation technologies proceeds this report focused particularly on the suitability of an approach for estimating air emissions from afos presented in 2001 draft epa report in that report epa attempted to develop set of model farms based on manure management systems typically used by large afos and identify emissions factors that could be associated with each element of the model farm in the absence of actual data from extensive monitoring epa hope d that emission factors could be applied to model farms to estimate annual mass emissions 41 an emissions factor is representative value that attempts to relate the quantity of pollutant released to the atmosphere with an activity associated with the release of the pollutant the emission factor approach is based on measuring emissions from set of defined afos to obtain an average emission per unit per animal unit or per production unit process such as manure storage piles and lagoons stall areas and feed storage areas then multiplying the emission factor by the number of units and period of time eg annually the current method of estimating cow chicken swine or any other livestock animal emissions is generally expressed in terms of emissions per head per year using this method fa cility emissions are directly proportional to the number of animals at the facility the nrc recognized that direct measurements of air emissions at all afos are not feasible however it found that the model farm construct described by epa cannot be supported because 39 nitrification and denitrification are biological processes that respectively oxidize ammonia to nitric acid nitrous acid or any nitrate or nitrite and reduce nitrates or nitrites to nitrogencontaining gases 40 national research council the scientific basis for

consider variations in many factors geography climate management appr oaches that could affect annual amounts and temporal patterns of emissions from an individual afo alternatively the nrc recommended that epa consider more complex processbased approach to focus on activities that determine the movement of nutrients and other substances into through and out of each component of the farm enterprise the nrc expanded on these recommendations in its final report issued in 200342 overall it found that scientifically sound protocols for measuring air concentrations emission rates and fates are needed for the elements compounds and particulate matter associated with afos similarly standardized methodology for odor measurement should be developed in the united states the nrc said the report noted that emissi on factor approaches should be broadened to integrate animal and crop production systems both on and off the afo ie imported feeds and exported manure in order to represent the full environmental effects of animal production systems such systems analysis should include impacts of best management practices bmps aimed at mitigating afo air emissions on other parts of the

health and environmental impacts of runoff from afos that strategy consisted of multiple elements and was based on national performance expectation that all afo owners and operators would develop and implement sitespecific comprehensive nutrient management plans by 2009 to protect water quality and public health the importance of relationships between air quality and agriculture has received

may find little common ground sometimes the only point of agreement is the need for more and better research to resolve key questionsand each side hopes that research findings will support its own

on wide range of topics currently is being supported by federal agencies number of individual states academic institutions and industry but there is apparent coordination or unified strategy the monitoring study that epa proposes as part of the air compliance agreement is intended to answer some questions however in view of criticism of the study doubts exist about the studys utility some

issues and recommended substantial research efforts in both the short term and the long term research in the short term four to five years the nrc said can significantly improve the capability of scientifically sound modeling approaches for measuring and estimating air emissions especially for processbased modeling that the nrc recommends be devel oped by epa and usda longterm research program 2030 years that encompasses overall im pacts of animal production on the environment can have substantial results in decreasing overall impacts on the environment while sustaining production at high level for the long term coordinated research is needed to determine which emissions are most harmful to the environment and human health and to develop technologies to decrease their releases into the environment44 priority research needs identified by the nrc usdas agricultural air quality task force45 and others fall into two broad categories fundamental research to estimate measure and characterize emissions and technology research including technology transfer foremost is the need to produce scientifically sound standardized methodology as basis for measuring and estimating gaseous and particulate emissions and odor from afos on local regional and national scales the science for estimating air emissions from individual afos should be strengthened along with models to understand the totality of afo processes including dispersion transformation and deposition of emissions this information is needed in order to assess relationships between emissions potential health indicators and candidate regulatory and management programs related concern is that much more needs to be understood about community level impacts from exposure to afo emissions occupational health studies have documented adverse health effects among afo workers such as acute and chronic respiratory diseases but experts agree that occupational health risks cannot be extrapolated to community health risks peer reviewed studies of health impacts on residents in the vicinity of livestock operations are limited these findings support conclusion that afo air emissions constitute public health hazard deserving of public health precautions as well as larger well controlled populationbased studies to more fully ascertain adverse health outcomes and their impact on community health 46 with regard to technology there is need to develop standardized measurement technologies for pollutants and odorous compounds emitted by afos and effective practical and economically feasible technologies to reduce and control odors and pollutants experts believe that there is need to develop and evaluate innovative treatment processes for each of the major sources of afo emissions confinement buildings manure storage areas and land application research further should include programs to provide for transfer of economically viable technologies to all producers in its 2003 report the national research council observed that epa and usda have not devoted the necessary technical or financial resources to estimate air emissions and develop mitigation 44 nrc 2003 afo report pp 11 174175 45 aaqtf cafo

deficiency in defining highpriority research programs the report said each has pursued its regulatory and farm management programs under the assumption that the best curre ntly available information can be used to implement its program goals it concluded that change in research priorities in both agencies is needed if air emissions are to be addressed with an adequate base of scientific information47 congressional attention to the issues discussed in this report has been limited with the result that developments are proceeding largely by administrative and some judicial actions not through legislative policymaking as described previously one aspect that has attracted congressional interest is questions about the applicability of cercla and epcra to livestock and poultry operations that interest has been apparent in the context of appropriations legislation and more recently in legislation to amend cercla to clarify that manure is not hazardous substance hr 4341 and s 3681 in the 109 th congress similar legisla tionhr 1398 and s 807was introduced in the 110th congress none of these bills has seen further action house subcommittee held hearing on these issues in november 2005 and another discussed above in september 2008 finally there appears to be wide agreement among stakeholder groups on the need for more research on large number of related issues but congressional interest in supporting or funding more federal participation in research activities is unclear
