anatomy of the gpm lecture given on 4 april 1963 how are you today this is the fourth of april ad 13 1963 ive forgotten what roman year it is offhand havent calculated it out lately nobodys using that calendar but scientologxically its the year of the win thats for sure this is another talk today on the gpmthe anatomy of which i am getting to be quite an authority and this is one of the more interesting pieces of bricabrac that thetan can pack around and youre making steady acquaintance with it which might serve you in some good stead i dont know if youve put together for yourself or tried to take look at the significances of what youre trying to do or what you are doing in essence or realize the antiquity of the project in which youre engaged mans been trying to do this for very very long time and has been successfully drowning himself in the process and on the whole track you have been trying to do this for very long time its quite interesting now that it is occurring and that something is happening and if youre having any trouble at all finding goals or finding the bank or finding items in the gpm let invite you to this interesting sidelight do you yourself have any idea of what youre tackling or are you just going through bunch of confused motions thats something you should ask yourself you say well all this theory is all very well and good but what i want to do is get down and audit well thats fine but are you in the position of radio repairman who doesnt know anything about the radio he is repairing and if you are in that position youre going to be very worried and very upset and very distressed and so forth it is essential to audit pc today on the ramifications of goals and the gpmits essential to know what you are attacking i know that sounds very banal but in actual fact some of the mistakes you are making arent banal theyre idiotic it simply shows lack of acquaintance with what you are trying to do youre trying to clear somebody youre trying to clear thetan very good why isnt he clear well he isnt clear because he misguidedly or otherwise tried to protect or get rid of or acquire havingness he had some misalignment on the subject of havingness and then he decided to think not confront and his thinkingness is dominant so that he now finds it totally unnecessary to know what he is attackinghe merely classifies it all under big group or class of thoughtall men are alike all woman are alike all women are evil all religion is bad this sort of thing so he gets classification so he knows now what is dangerous and it isnt necessary to go through the arduous process of knowing what he is going up against so you see that in auditing gpmim not saying youre doing thisbut there is every tendency there to not confront why you as the auditor have some tendency not to confront what you are doingand certainly the pc has fantastic tendencies not to confront because hes running straight through not to confront thats why he has an item this item is bad women great great so he has an item bad women what does this essentially mean this means his inability fostered by himself and by reason of postulating goal and so forthto confront women has enormously been reduced so now he is in situation where he doesnt have to think about individual women he just thinks about bad women and there he is hes got it all thought out now he doesnt have to think any further somebody says woman he says well thats bad women and what do you do to counter bad women well you become debaucher whatever debaucher is you see and thats the pattern of behavior you go through in handling women somebody says women you become debaucher thats dead simple see youve gotyouve got in other words total packaged answer theres the stimuli women so now we know the package response and were all set its almost as simple as car mechanic when you look at car then you are mechanic youd better be mechanic if you look at car so the terminal is mechanic and the oppterm is car if youre mad at cars then the thing to do is become mechanic i dont know if youve had your car repaired lately but i think thats usually the pair that youll find in most of the garages if youre mad at cars you become mechanic then you can really wreck them now whats this amount to this means that youre auditing pc whose confront is very poor on the subject that he is being asked to confront on his confront is very poor now you as an auditor qandaing with the pc and taking his directions and so forthare taking the directions of somebody who cant confront on the subject hes being audited on and although every now and then the pc is right particularly when he cognites on the item or something like thathes right you know bang thats it something like that providing the meter says hes right too why hes right but whatwhat in essence are you doing when you qanda and fumble and around now this pc may have very fine confront on the subject of anything under the sun but what youre auditing him on the very fact that it is his bank says that he has noconfront on it well fortunately you the auditor dont have the same bank so therefore you can confront on the subject that the pc cant confront on this is fortuitous but that is what you are there and that is what you are forto keep the pc headed in the right direction now there isnt really any excuse for fumbling around on the subject of the gpm and goals because the data is now all known that weve got the data there it is i mean the gpm has certain anatomy goals line up in that particular line and items are created in that particular way and well thats all there is to it i mean there it is how do you list you list in certain way and how do you find items you find items in certain way and there are certain rules which apply and so forth and if you really know what gpm is and really know what the goal is and how it lines up and all this sort of thing its really very easy job its nothing to lose nights sleep over its very easy job you know youre there or you dont know youre there but to what degree are you taking advantage of the knowledge which we already have to what degree are you taking advantage of this knowledge well to very slight degree indeed to great extent youre still fumbling with how many do you list what should the meter say and so forth you have not surmounted totally at this stageyouve not surmounted probably in its totalityall of the things which youre handling or the complexity of these things in other words youre not handling them all at once youre still trying to get the tone arm centered so that you can null you know and as matter of fact what are you nulling well others of you have this grasp and youve already collided with the situation and understand what you are going up against now the reason im stressing an understanding of this is what youre doing is terribly simple it is an idiots simplicity because of course youre handling something an idiot put together i mean thetan becomes complete idiot when he starts postulating goals and cutting down his confront and doing bunch of package thinking and all this sort of thing getting himself in the soup turning on all kinds of somatics having all sorts of trouble running into unsolvable problems and eventually denying his own goal and cutting his own throat and saying well thats it and so forth ive ive postulated this goal to be catfish and here we are few eons later and oh i hate catfish you see and so hes mixed up hes the original mixed up kid now despite the fact that the freudians in their defeat at the hands of aberration and such studies of the mind said that you had to be aberrated in order to get along at allwell that has validity at all ive had some interesting experiences in that myself i had an oppterm conventional music thats very interesting in one of these banks had an oppterm conventional music if the music was conventional why it had nothing to do with it had to be unconventional music well it didnt rule out musicbut it certainly ruled out any ability to look at piece of music and get anything out of it i had to remember it and go around sideways and move down the corners of the thing and well not just this item but just as general confront picks upwell i find out now i can listen to piece of music and play the piece of musici dont even have to have the music conventional it doesnt matter and the funny part of it is auditing is improving my ability to play more than practice is improving it well as far as im concerned being well conversant with the fields of the artswriting and all that sort of thingknowing the limitations and agonies of actual professional application in these fieldsi know exactly what was blowing my brains out all along the line and they were aberrations they were aberrations on the subject well itheres such item but long books supposing id had an item long books well good heavens what would i do every time i thought oh ive got to write long book you know i just would have quit all kinds of somatics would have turned on would i have been able to write long book now as far as being able to fight things and get mad and raise the devil in life and have game and all that sort of thingwhy getting rid of the gpm in certain spheres doesnt seem to have interfered with that at all i mean im twice as mad as i used to be at certain things reading the paper this morning i think the kennedy administration won itself another medal but i begin to see what is aberrated conduct not according to some unconfronted standard i begin to see what is actual aberrated conduct and am able to predict where thats going to land somebody you see and am very far from destroying the gamei find myself getting more and more involved in whats going on and in present time and the normal thing that is avoided by somebody who has an awful lot of items and so forthis present time hes involved with games that dont exist well did you ever try to play in tennis court with racket and ball and net and partner i think youd look silly you might be there in tennis court but there you are racing back and forth and fanning the air and so forth and theres interchange theres scoreboard nothing well that is very good picture of what most people are involved in doing theres somebody sitting there and he goes like this lot see he goes like this lot nobody can quite understand why he goes like well hes being writer you see thats as close as he can come to it anymore you know hes still got an item he should be going like this but actually this is as close as he comes to it see or maybemaybe hes an old kettledrummer or something we dont know but he is playing some game that doesnt exist and let assure you theres nothing that is less fun and theres nothing that looks more ridiculous than somebody who is playing game which longer exists now the fixed character of goals and the fixed character of items in the gpm give us an enormous number of games which an individual obsessively plays which dont any longer exist he has reason to be playing these games they arent any fun and they make him feel awful and nobody else is playing these games and he rather tends to draw out of contact with all of existence well whats thiswhat am i talking about here basically well im talking about the fact that he doesnt need this gpm which i think is rather plain but getting rid of it is highly uncomfortable activity and very confusing to the pc extremely confusing to the pc hes in the middle of all sorts of items which give him all sorts of weird values hes susceptible to arc breaks that he himself doesnt understand what they are hes going up against ideas and postulates that in large part were quite germane in some other age and time but longer apply now he understands them he can understand them still and he knows what they do to him but they dont look to him much like games thats because the game is longer extant and hes prisoner of his own postulates and life accordingly is quite unnecessarily unhappy and miserable lifelifes bad enough without having some false misery and false nonsense added up onto it you could probably cope with life all right if you didnt have all your old tin cans and chains and so forth that you were dragging along with you you dont even have to be up to ot to cope with life once you begin to see what it is all about and stop misemoting on certain subjects that have nothing to do with your life well be that as it maythis is dissertation on aberration this is just dissertation on the subject of this gpm and these goals that an individual postulates he postulates these goals and then he accumulates certain set of items and then he eventually turns against the very goal which he himself has postulated finds that inhe is now in deep state of degradation because hes denied himself completelyhas to turn around and postulate another goal to get himself out of the mess and then eventually it wears out and he is going up against again his own postulate so he now has to postulate another goal oh this goes on and on and hes just getting unhappier and unhappier and hes less and less able and less and less powerfuland he is less and less capable of governing himself he is governed by series of unseen unknown voices impulses urges pains that demand that he do certain things which might have been all right when knighthood was in flower or when he was space patrolman but dont quite work out where he is at the present timemanager of knitting factory you see it doesnt quite go hes having hard timehes giving himself this hard time what we are trying for in essence is selfgoverned individual weve spoken great deal about selfdeterminism and otherdeterminism but unless an individual is capable of exercising his own true selfdeterminism he is then incapable of selfgovernment and so he will always be subjected to various tyrannical exterior forces he is incapable of continuing on through life under his own steam he has to be nursed along and all kinds of things well you see that regardless of the power this individual could generateregardless of his ability to knock over radio towers and the domes off capitols and so forth as an operating thetan regardless of all of this stuff regardless of his ability to make wine turn into tea at two thousand yards at spot glance all thats very intriguing but lets look at it within framework which is far more comprehensible this individual is liability to all about him unless he himself is capable of selfgovernment thats interesting isnt it now control of his own environment does not necessarily mean violation of the rights of everyone in that environment but certainly on the fact that he operates on the greater good for the greater number of dynamics and he solves his problems on that basiswhen he is capable of selfgovernment he has crossed the biggest hurdle in the direction of controlled or happy environment he is looking all about him as he lives through his environment for enemies that victimize him well i think thats very interesting because standing right in the boots that he is standing in as he looks around that environment is his own worst enemy now that isnt just an itemthat is fact that is fact buildings wont fall on his head anywhere near as hard as he himself is falling on his head life cannot do anything to him at all actually but he himself can accomplish his own destruction and that is true of every human being alive and this is the kind of world we live inwhere everywhere we look we see people bent on their own destruction i have this experience continually people race along over some level plain toward some deep cavern or chasmand theyre going along madly in the direction of the lip of this cliff and theyre about to fall into this chasm and i say to them hey hey hey hey you know you go along that way about another fifteen twenty feet you know and you go over and the fellow says i guess i know what im do1iiiiieeeeeeennnngg boom and you say what do you know it happens rather continuously i meantheres hardly week goes by but what across my desk isnt evidence of somebody whos going to go over the cliff i still as matter of form say to them hey theres cliff there you know and as matter of form sit back and listen to the dwindling scream its almostits almost as if pointing out to them ways and means of selfdestruction gives them the direction that they want to travel well its interesting living around such people now we in scientology are cut above that the definition of true scientologist isnothing very esoteric that one would want to use in the papers and so forth because only scientologist would understand this definition and that is this matter how mad he gets matter how upset he gets matter what outrageous things he is doing true scientologist knows back of it that he is doing it and has an inklinghe may not know exactly why but he has an inklingthat it is because of something he has done that makes him do it he never quite loses sight of his own causative hand in his own fate well here i am mad as the devil at this car well he may go right on kicking the tires you understandhe doesnt necessarily totally control himself on the subjecthe may go right on kicking the tires and cursing out the car but somewhere back here he says you know i must have done an awful lot of lousy things to cars to be treating car this way you know he still has he still has that little thing he may be fighting with his wife or she may be fighting with her husband and mad as hops you know just trrahrrahthrah and wipe it out man you know and at the same time you know kind of well what have i done to him or her that is making act this way that is never quite lost sight of it may not be strong enough or powerful enough to monitor or control the conduct but it is there scientologist is somebody who knows he is capable of understanding his motives not just the overtmotivator sequencehes capable of understanding his motives and you could put that down as the definition of what makes scientologist different than raw meat scientologist knows that he is capable of understanding his motives if he went just little bit deeper and thought just little bit harder about it and looked just little bit harder why he would know why he was doing this thing he knows that there is an explanation to what he is doing well now if person who is calling himself scientologist really has never grasped that one facthes going to have an awful lot of trouble grasping what the gpm is all about why well he doesnt think there is cause now i to my shame we only have we do have student right now who really doesnt know that overt acts cause people to blow he doesnt know this he hasnt got this down and he let somebody blow well hes got ways to travel well why doesnt he know that well thats because he himself doesnt quite have this one datum he doesnt know that he himself is doing the things hes doing because of something he has done he doesnt really believe that he is capable of understanding his own motives you see so not being totally cognizant of this one factnot really thinking or believing that he is capable of understanding his own motives or handling himself or controlling his own motives or picking up his own overts or any of this sort of thingthen he doesnt think that the other fellow has caused his own difficulties so of course he cant audit the gpm theres nothing more manifest in the world than the gpm as confirmation of person causing his own trouble thats reason to condemn him scientologists dont do that but its alsothere isalso there is reason not to understand it fellow made postulatehe said im going to square this all up to be pirate thats what im going to do im going to be pirate tobeing pirate that solves all of thisthat just solves everything im going to be pirate yes that solves all the trouble ive been having im going to be pirate and few trillennia later he sees pig going down the road with ring in its snout and he faints and has heart attack everybody says look at what the hot weather has done to him the hot weatherthe hot weather might have assisted all this but who did it to him he did it to himself way back down the track he said to be pirate and of course pirates wear rings in their noses there it is who did it he did it well now you cant go around condemning this person for having done it to himself unless you are capable of establishing for his reality and yours toowhat he did to himself and in such way that it eradicates that causation in the past well you dont have to blame him if you can eradicate it well all of these causations for his quote misfortunes unquote are initially and basically resident in the gpm now those of yesteryear have actually far more force on him than those of today but because they exist in yesteryear and because today has in it all of the force contained from yesteryear till nowit seems to him that those items in which he exists herethat these items he exists with in present time draw gpm here and this is the pt situation these items here in present timeoh those items are terribly important maybe hes sitting in something that says womenwomen who look like beatniks you know maybe thats the oppterm see now hes going mad he doesnt even know hes got this hes formed it up but hes going mad on this subject and his wifes very neatly dressed girl and everything else and hes always calling her beatnik and she never can figure it out and he never can figure it out and here are these items herea chronic present time problemchronic present time problem always always always riding along with him riding along with him he has another one he has another one he knows you see that the source of his ulcerous condition you see is because he eats too much harsh food thats the somatic all women are beatniks and what does he have to be he has to be turk in order to combat this in some aberrated way well theres his ulcers and theres his opposition and he begins to think the whole environment is against him when in actual fact its just women are beatniks he sees some uncombed hairhe gets ulcers bang bang just like thatone two well this isnt actually causation this is an effect hes being the effect of these items the fact you can run them out and discharge them is quite remarkable but way down herelets take another bank you see these banks are lots of items long heres another bank heres another bank heres another bank heres another bank another bank heres another bank you get the idea it goes on like this way back here someplace down below in this bank down herehe has goal to be man naturally this one creeps up through charge all the way up to the top here and causes women to be antipathetic to him now when you audit him what are you looking for well actually youre looking for one bank at time thats all youre looking for that bank is monitored by the goal the first goal and that is the thing you are looking for this bank has goal now this top bank may be complete or it may be incomplete but it is only incomplete from the top down it will be perfect in form right up to pt but where is the pt is the pt at where the goal is expiring or is it halfway through we dont know that you would establish that but hes postulated goal now it is that goal which is available and the first action is to find that goal why is that the first action because if you find too many of these items without finding that goal you turn off the pcs rs and rr he cannot orient you dont know what kind of items you are looking foryou shoot out of the bank and all kinds of wild weird things happen so lets put first things first lets find the goal lets find the goal for the first bank now we may be unlucky and find the goal for the second bank when were looking for the goal for the first bank and actually run quite bit of the second bank before we find out that first bank exists all right you still have done nobody any damage youll start up and try to find the top of this thing and youll run into another goal all right but thats mischance in the bulk of the cases you operate with you will find that goal of that first bank thats what you will find and having found that you will find his immediate explanation of what is wrong with him he is causing condition in life which pervades every part of life he is living monitored of course by the fact that all this has gone before but youre not interested in all this thats gone before you are only interested in this first bank the one closest to present time not the first one formed on the time trackthats sooo lord knows how long ago youre interested in the one that was formed just the other trillennia just the other day you want that goal all right now having found that goal you want the packages the itemsthe pairs of items these are always in two in 3m they are not in four as in the fringe areas that you get in 212 theyre always in two and they follow certain pattern and there they aretheyre already there to be run you have to find the goal in order to run them and then having found the goal what are you looking for youre looking for the highest oppterm in the bank well in truncated gpm one that is cut off at the top the highest oppterm will not be very violently stated and it will be more difficult your first list when you do this first list on other banks which are complete you will be amazed at how easy it is but because not all the items are formed at the top of the gpm yet you may have some difficulty with this but the bulk of the cases you wont have any difficulty with it now youre looking for certain items and you find those items by following certain rules you think well we had an awful lot of rules and we threw those away we didnt just last night somebody in the z unit actually nulled list that i think had seven rrs on it each one of which fired during nulling well we could have real idiots picnic out of this you know you mustnt have two firing at the same time on list but its all right to have seven firing on the list thats idiot you want one firing on list you see youve got certain rules the second you find two are firing on list man extend the list nobodys broken those rules down extend the list till you only got one firing on the list now i just saw another folder that horrified twice running i have checked the list twice running i have checked the list unbeknownst to the auditor i put the pc on the meter mean of but this auditorthis auditor had item item item item item item item x and thenthis is the way the list looked well of course it had many items along the aw aw please for year and half ive been telling youfor year and half ive been telling you goddamnit dont do that why because the list is not discharged what are all these stroke stroke stroke stroke stroke stroke stroke stroke stroke x what is that the first thing it says to you is the list is insufficiently listed to take the charge of it off nobodys changed any of the listing rules youve been overlisting for the most part and skipping items but please stop that and then you know what i found you know what i found i found that those marked rs and those marked rr were still firing halfway aw what does this mean that means that we had dishonest auditor dishonest auditor and i just decided to come down on this with thud and i have do you know what an x means do you know what an x means it doesnt mean this didnt rs it doesnt mean this didnt rr it means this does not produce any reaction of any kind on the meter and when you put an x down in front or behind an item i want you to have said and be true to your statement this does not produce reaction on the needle that is what x meansthis produces reaction on the needle well you say thats impossible i mean you go down these lists and and they do produce reactions on the needle oh wake up for christs sakes ive only been trying to teach you this for year and half the list is not complete its charged oh you say were liable to overlist let tell you something the bypassed item is more likely to occur early on the list than late on the list if youre going to pick an item that will bypass an item you understand its liable to occur earlier up here more likely to occur it doesnt always sometimes its the first item on the list and it bypasses items lets say its this onethis fourth one down here from the toplets say its this one huh all right what about that one its geewhizzera geewhizzer ah but geewhizzer isnt due to come up for another three items its part of the bank but it isnt due to come up for three items what we want is whatnotter and whatnottermy god what notter is clear down here thats whatnotter in other words the next item we want is whatnotter and if you list to this onethe second item geewhizzer and then take fully charged list and null ityoull get some kind of idiots performance like this by the wayyouve never listed it down to where the next item on the list occurred why well lookahere now lets look at our definitions why is this and excuse for swearing because i justif i could just teach you the ethics of the situationthey include never giving the pc an item unless it fires see the items got to fire and never putting an x down so long as goal or an item even goes click matter how slightly you understand it can have faint roughing of the needle as you call it youll find that quite common in goalsyou couldnt get it to tick for the life of you and if you examined it at 128 sensitivity youd find as you said it theres slight tiny roughness of the needle well you cant get it as readit wont read and nothing else will read but were talking about something that goes tick man you know tick tick and youd put an x down across something like that ooooh youve just told lie that is lieand very vicious one because it says that this list here was improperly listed and improperly nulled and it is covered up by the fact that an x is put there this x is put there ohho why why did we put an x there in the first place why would we try and out you knowin in in in in in in in in in x what are you doing nulling list like that i mean you know how list nulls this is the way list ought to look theres nothing much to these lists the list as you null should look something like this if youre going to null whole list thats the item now how do you get one like that how do you get one like that well by listing it until its null oh but what happens if you overlist it well the pc protests it and then you have dirty needle im afraid you have to know how to audit theres substitute for knowing how to audit the two things that go out and give you dirty needle are protestnow put this down well because these arethese are i thinki dont think i ever stated these both consecutively and together protest and decide protest and decide are the buttons you have to get in every now and thenon pc thats prone to have dirty needle on everything and you cant null on hes protesting fail to reveal of course gives you the dirtiest needlethat gives you the most twiggletwiggle but were not interested so much in that but its protest and decide that foul up list the pc has decided that the item isnt on it the pc has decided that there is item on it the pc has decided that the auditing question is wrong the pc has decided something and youll continuously have reaction and the pc is protesting youll continuously have reaction well whats this mean the protest and decide are all the buttons you need to get in in actual fact when youre nulling you show the pc the list for anything hes done to it or something like this and he eventually startsif the pc is being overlisted hell protest and decide you mostly dont have to get them in at alljust lean across and show the pcyou say hey hey take look at these things you know have you done anything withyou had any thoughts on this list not have you invalidated anything thats getting in button have you had any thoughts on this list the pc looks it over oh i thought that to be cockroach i thought that was very funny goal ah you say all right your needle is now clean again but do you know that amount of rudiments or anything elseno amount of themwill clean up list which is still charged learn that learn that and amount of rudiments will clean up list that has been listed overlisted into the ground that the pc is going out of his head on itll just continue with dirty needle in other words theres two extremes theres underlisting and theres overlisting dont do either one how long is list well list is long enough so that it nulls properly and has an item on it thats how long list is well how can you tell if something is underlisted well if you have bunch of dirty needles and zzzt and brrrp and if the thing is an unclean needle very dirty needle as you go down the line and if two items occur on the listin other words you get two rocket reads or an rs and rock slam or two rses on the list and so forthyou know the list is not complete so you have to continue it well whats an overlisted list well the pc is just kind of in apathy about it all and upset and sort of audited into the ground and it all is sort of tight and the mass is tight and the needle is tight and the auditors just been nut thats all the auditor had complete list and didnt know when to stop well this asking the question for test is all very well but it is rough rule of thumb you have to add five more after the thing cleaned up or youll very often miss the item the item was about to go on but isnt on yetbut because its about to go on it doesnt act as charge on the needle and therefore the question is freed of that burden and youll find itll go on in the next few its not matter of judgmentits matter of pure mechanics an overlisted or an underlisted list are equally difficult to null you get terrific protest going you see if you start overlisting and you get continuous dirty needle its as simple as that i mean these are matters of judgment these are matters of observation what are you trying to do youre trying to find the next consecutive item or youre trying to find the pcs goal thats what youre trying to do and in order to do that you have to pay attention to this other phenomena the other phenomena is that if you cant null list why youve either overlisted it like madat which time the pc has already decided the item is on the listwhich gives you continuous read and the pc is protesting like mad because he says the item is on the list and with both of these thingswith both of these things at playyou of course can never null the thing in addition to that overlisting has tendency to suppress the actual item and youve just wasted an awful lot of time now you also can put more items on the list than you actually need you might even get the wrong one firing or something weird might happen on an overlist well an underlist is easily detectable because more than one item rrs or rsesor everything on the list is live you call these things and so forth well if you call this item here and it gives you little tick and flash and so forth well dont put an x down there man why its not out you see it isnt that it doesnt rr and therefore is out heh it has reaction on it and therefore is not out and i dont care what youre looking for the rules and laws of listing remain what they are sir youll never have the item now lets go little bit further lets go little bit further and lets you find out something about the gpm letsyou know something you probably already do but lets make sure you do what are you doing when youve got goal to be lady getting an oppterm steam locomotive and terminal astronomy what are you doing why why do you even stop i mean why do you evenwhy do you even read anything back to the pc man you know its wrong well what are you doing where are you you know youre supposed to be the auditor is this your item ive got something here that rrs sure youve got something that rrs youve got something that rrs from fifteen banks away and it rrs well sure anythingll rr if it didnt belong to the goal now lookahere look at this most likely list youre going down this most likely list going down the most likely list going down the most likely list and so forth and finally why you think well thats about itthats the end of that its to be lady you see and youve got items like chemistry sets cockeyed jazaboos porphyry and granite astronomy steam locomotives and so forth aaaaaaaah list must be complete i guess ill null it ahhahha ooooohthere it goestheres the one that rocket reads 9a steam locomotive all right thats the hottest thing in your bank steam locomotive and then we oppose that and we oppose that and we oppose that and we dont have any rr left on the pc well why you arent even operating in the bank to be lady what item do you want look know your gpms manknow your gpms what item do you want youre not going to evaluate for it and give it to the pc but youre sure going to list till you get this kind of thing now look the pcs confront is not very good the pcs confront is too bad and the pc is not going to recognizethe pcs not going to recognize his items until hes listed long enough to find his items lets take this to be lady and were getting items like porphyry and granite crab tarts this is as close as he can get to his goal you see youve just got to list until you find something on there thatwomen who are ladies or something like this dont you see you get what i mean oh you say oh well this is prettylooking pretty good now women who are ladies and there it is we start nulling this thing off and all of sudden why women who are ladies pshew well we know what the top oppterm iswe already know the script if its goal to be lady the top oppterm is going to have something to do with being lady and the pc is now very much opposed to it see that being lady ladylike actions women who are ladies its only in this middle ground of gpmif youre looking at line plotits only in the middle ground of the gpm that it departs at all and then itll have something thats quite germane itll have something like to be lady niceness mannerliness something like that thatsbe your middle ground but the items that youre looking for for top oppterm as you list this list down here its got to have something to do with lady and i dont mean something to do women who are very beautiful and sweet i mean its got to have lady in it you understand lady or ladies you know englishenglish words space lady that is part of the terminal or ladies iadies is part of it or you havent got anything so what are you doing picking it up what are you doing i mean thats adding the auditor in there to terrific degree but on your most likely list youre getting everything under the sun moon and stars but something which has the exact wording of the goal in it one way or the other well whats your top terminal on to be lady it isnt actually to be tramp itll be somebody who wants nothing to do with being lady or something like that dont you see somebody who cant be ladythat will be the top oppterm i mean its so simple and somebody here recently on an audit had an item on goal person with this goal ah but look thats never part of the bank somebody with the goal to catch catfish yeah oh yeah thats it so the pc hadnt stated it the pc hadnt stated it well how do you get around this obviously if you tried to null this listyou see it mechanically confirms the significance of itif you tried to null this list most likely and it didnt have anything on itlady lady ladies you knowif it didnt have stuff like this on itit isnt going to be discharged why because you havent got any of the gpms items on the listwhats going to discharge it see its as simple as that it isnt going to discharge by somebecause youre charming as an auditor its going to discharge because its got something on it that belongs simple you know i could probably steer pc by lengths of lists straight through gpm without halt or an upset on just how many are listed and you know and checking it uphow many rr and that the list is nullable and not more than one fires in other words steer them through totally blind with assistance of any kind from the significance of the item but i could also steer them through one with rrhardly meter how well i know what gpm looks like well you down there at the bottom youve got the goal just stated as goal thats simple youve got at the top of the thing youve got the reverse side of the goal youve got people who catch catfish thats become an enemy something like that or catfish catchers thatll be up the top of this thing the oppterm is established therefore and then the terminal the top terminal that is up at the top will be somebody who doesnt want anything to do with catching catfish or some such statement as that down on the terminal side of the thing youve got the goal as an ri to catch catfish the next item up from that is the goal to catch catfish the next item up from that is somebody with the goal to catch catfish or somebody or something with the goal to catch catfish and occasionally itll be somebody with goal to catch catfish and then above that somebody or something with goal to catch catfish and then catfish catcher well weve taken care of now great many items the rest of those items will be germane they will not have catfish in them or something like that but theyll all be germane you might even go so far afield as people who dont like fish or people who wont eat or people who hate sports you mightyou might even have something like that or you might have unluckiness you see but youre getting pretty far afield the middle ground of gpm is the bottom of the oppterm column and the middle of the gpm is left to question the rest of it is not left to question it could be rephrased just exactly looking at the goal you look at the goal you could actually write those thingsi say youd better not but you could actually write them in on the plot thats whatyou practically could write them in theres aslightly different ways of stating them pc could even become aware of these things and the goal will discharge and everything will be fine but if you know what youre heading for and if you know what youre trying to get on your line plot and you know what youre trying to list why it assists you enormously not to make stupid mistakes so follow it all mechanically do it all mechanically obey all the mechanical rulesand to that add your good sense to be ladyoppterm steam locomotive terminal astronomy well ron iheres the gpm ive got her line plot okay ive got her line plot fine here wheres the rest of the items well she didnt have any as matter of fact thats the whole gpm youre going to see some of these youre going toits going to be your unpleasant duty to point out to an auditor that somewhere he has bypassed everything but the goal hes fortunate he still has the pcs goalit still rocket reads but everything else has been bypassed the gpm and all items in it not only has he done this but he has also gratuitously added the contentsthe odd and random contentsof two or three other gpms theres ways of checking this if an item ticks it came wrong way off list that is to say you go back on the line plot and you check all the items on the line plot you find something tickingthe list it came off of was too complete or incomplete one or the other youve got to adjust that list get another itemthrows you back into the gpm its actually not very hard to do you remind of somebody who is sent out into the front yard to find dozen white stones amongst the gravel and the white stones are there and you keep coming back with gray stones pink stones and green stones and saying look there they are the pcs sort of messed up was sick all day yesterday but heres this beautiful green stone steam locomotive and hehhehyoure just not using your good sense you go out in the front yard youre supposed to find dozen white stones all right you even know theyre white you can pick them up you could almost pick them out you hardly have to audit the pc at all to put together his line plot of course if he put the pcif he put his own line plot together without the thing being run and discharged hed be one of the sickest pcs you ever had anything to do with but that doesnt have anything to do with the fact that you know what should be there and if youre not getting what should be there boy youre doing something wrong then the mechanical rules are out too what youre doing is spectacular to such degree that it has never been done on the track this is just unknown information never been done twentyfive hundred years ago they banged few guys out of their head we did that the other day on the long john television program to the benefit of the whole new york audience i sent cable over and i said bang somebody out of his head well there was professor sitting there who was saying nyaa nyaa nyaa scientology and so forth and thomass wife according to report i hadtold him try not to be three feet back of his head and by god there he was made very good radio i wonder how many other people in new york city tried not to be three feet back of their heads at that moment i imagine there were couple of taxicabs hit other taxicabs about that moment but actually thats as far asbesides some codes and morals and things like thatthats about as far as buddhism went you know what they told you to do in buddhism after that although were the inheritors of all the empire of buddhism in actual factwe should not be blind to what the buddhist didhe got overwhelmed by the gpm oh you think so you dont think he did huh hahahaha what do you think nirvana is youve seen pictures of nirvana havent you populated totally populatedbig circular mass that youre supposed to go into and become one of all with everything he collided with the gpm but he didnt know what it was he thought it was heaven well were way beyond that what were doing is so spectacular that its totally out ofcompletely out of the range of believability that we have ataccomplished this thing and yet we areand are accomplishing it we have accomplished itthere we are aha but what happens now are you supposed to sit there in total reverence just because this is enough to overwhelm every thetan in this universe are you supposed to now sit there in state of overwhelm i dont think you are you know the score you can become the master of this thing well why not do so youre on youryoure on the way out from this youve won what are you doing cowing before kowtowing to and being slave on the subject of the great overpowering gpm youve got it youve got it made well go ahead and audit it learn more of it its not formidable all you have to do is an honest job of auditing today and sensible job the gpm merely proceeds from goal you clean up the gpm for that goal you find the next goal weve even got easy ways to do that and as soon as youve got the goal to the next gpm then clean up with prepcheck the gpm youre working in go on and find the items of the next goal oh its not easy on the pc but as soon as you get the stunt its awful easy on the auditor and the easier it is on the auditor and the more cleverly an auditor can do this and the easier it is for an auditor to do this the easier it is on the pc you go on down the track at high rate of speed this can be done this is being done we are being successful its time for you to wake up and take look despite the gpm you now have permission to confront thank you very much good night
