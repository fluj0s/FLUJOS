president and the senate share the responsibility for filling vacancies in the federal judiciary20 while it is the president who nominates persons to fill federal judgeships the appointment of each nominee also requires senate confirmation although not mentioned in the constitution the senate judiciary committee also plays an important role midway in the processafter the president selects but before the senate as whole considers the nominee it is the judiciary committee in the senate that has committee jurisdiction over most federal judicial nomina tionsnamely those to the supreme court the courts of appeals the district courts including the territorial district courts the us court of international trade and the us court of federal claims 21 the need for the president to make nomination to an article iii court judgeship arises when vacancy occurs on the court due to the death retirement or resignation of judge or when judge announces the intention to retire or resign22 in considering judicial candidates for possible nomination the president frequently receives recommendations from us senators23 by longstanding custom dating back to the mid 1800s senators of the presidents party have provided presidents such advice recommending candidates for judgeships situated in their states or linked by tradition to their states24 also by custom senators not of the presidents party play consultative role and may convey to the president their views about candidates under consideration for judgeships in their states25 the judgeships for which senator ordinarily recommends nominees or is consulted are those in the us district court or courts which 20 article ii section 2 clause 2 of the constitution provides that the president shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint judges of the supreme court and all other officers of the united states whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for and which shall be established by law 21 nominations to the court of appeals for the armed forces fall within the jurisdiction of the senate armed services committee nominations to the us tax court fall within the jurisdiction of the senate finance committee and nominations to the court of appeals for veterans claims fa ll within the jurisdiction of the senate veterans affairs committee 22 vacancy also would occur if judge was removed by congress through the impeachment process but historically such occurrences have been extremely rare specifically in our nations history there have been 15 impeachment trials in the senate 11 against judges seven trials have resulted in convictions all against judges crs report rl32935 congressional oversight of judges and justices by elizabeth b bazan and morton

1953 described the wellestablished custom which has prevailed since about 1840 wherein us district judges are normally selected by senators from the state in which the district is situated provided

of appeals circuit of which the senators state is geographic partprovided the circuit judgeship historically has been associated with the senators state26 after selecting someone to fill judicial vacancy the president formally submits nomination in writing to the senate27 usually on the same day it is received by the senate the nomination is referred to the judiciary committee the committees first formal public step is to hold hearing on nomination the committee subsequently meets again to vote on whether to report the nomination to the full senate committee vote to report even vote to report with an unfavorable recommendation sends the nomination forward to be considered by the senate as whole while vote against reporting historically very rare occurrence prevents the nomination from going forward and in effect defeats the nomination in committee the next step in the appointment process occurs when the senate votes to confirm or disapprove the nomination vote to confirm requires simple majority of senators present and voting if the senate votes to confirm the nomination the secretary of the senate then attests to resolution of confirmation and transmits it to the white house 28 in turn the president signs document called commission officially appointing the individual to the court the signed commission is then returned to the justice department for engraving the date of appointment determined by the actual day the president signs the commission and for the signature of the attorney general and the placing of the justice department seal 29 once the president has signed the commission the incoming judge is eligible to be sworn into office the new judge actually takes two oaths of officea judicial oath as required by the judiciary act of 1789 and constitutional oath which as required by article vi of the constitution is administered to members of congress and all executive and judicial officers as with nominations in general judicial nomin ations sometimes fail to advance through each procedural step in the appointment process after referral to committee nomination might not receive hearing or after receiving hearing might not receive committee vote on whether it should be reported even if favorably reported by committee nomination might not receive vote by the senate on whether to confirm the majority leader might not schedule vote or some senators might oppose taking such vote and supermajority of threefifths of the full membership of the senate would be needed to invoke cloture on the nomination 30 if nomination fails to receive senate vote on confirmation it ultimately will be either withdrawn 26 president is generally believed inclined to avoid selecting judicial nominee opposed by homestate senator of the presidents partygiven the custom of senatorial courtesy wherein the senate as collegial body customarily supports senators in disputes with th president over judicial appointments in their state two scholars have written that as result of this custom senators of the presidents party who object to district judgeship in their home state have virtual veto over the nomination robert carp and ronald
