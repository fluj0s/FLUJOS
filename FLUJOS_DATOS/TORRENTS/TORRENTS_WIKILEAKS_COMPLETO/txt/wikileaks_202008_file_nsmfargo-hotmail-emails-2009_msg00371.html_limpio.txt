diversity and distress of metro detroit makes it ripe for recruitment detroits big city and the economy is not real good he said anywhere the economy is bad people are looking for answers and i think we provide some jack kay university of michiganflint professor who has studied racist groups said these people can be incredibly savvy in spreading their message but first schoep whose group uses detroit post office box must secure his position as the areas preeminent f√ºhrer in another part of metro detroit rival is trashing his group we at the anp never had anything to do with them and we
