conduct involving pages some members of congress called for spension of the house page program until full evaluation was completed50 this sentiment prompted one representative also former page to say the pages arent responsible for this scandal members of congress are and any reforms that go fo rward ought to have primary focus on our behavior not that of the pages51 another member suggested the

congress chair the house page board53 most of the discussion following the llegations in 2006 that were investigated by the house committee on standards of official conduct focused on needed changes in the house page board as well as the necessity for the pages to have an advocate separate from congre ss when there is problem one former page recommended in 2006 and again in 2007 that congress

former page the greatest resource and protection for the page academy can be found in its alumni former pages now hold considerable power throughout th legal business and media worlds55 other recent proposals as reported in th press have called for the creation of united states page foundation to help fund the page program and offer support to current and former pages56 transferring oversight from the house clerk to the house sergeant at arms or splitting the responsib ility for the program between the house majority and minority leaders57 when earlier congresses discussed possibl changes in this system the dialogue often centered on the appropr iate age range for these young messengers as well as improving their supervision housing and education prior to limiting the ages of pages to high school juniors in 1983 congress had last discussed the page age issue between 1966 through 1970 when it was considering other internal reforms in 1966 the joint committee on the organization of congress recommended limiting congressional page appointments to those individuals who had completed hi gh school and were not over 2158 the house took action on this recommendation but the next year the senate voted to limit all page appointments to those who had completed the 12th grade and were not over age 2259 in the 91st congress when the house rules committee reported the legislative reorganization act of 1970 it contained provision limiting house and senate pages to those who had completed the 12th grade but were not over age 2160 when the house took up this portion of the

been limited to juniors in high school when the speakers commission on pages studied the page system in 1982 it addressed the age and term of service of pa ges both with concerns for the moral and legal responsibilities of congress64 the members considered using senior citizens or retired military personnel as pages this alternative was rejected because the nature of page work and the sometimes strenuous duties would make messenger duties inappropriate to the age and experience of this age group and these individuals have other opportunities for public service65 the use of college students was also rejected because of questions raised about their leve l of enthusiasm for page work and their desire for more substantive work66 the speakers commission also considered several possible alternatives to the services rendered by pages67 these included maintaining some form of the present system assigning the duties to augmente d staffs of members officers and committees contracting for the page services with outside firms or combination of all these alternatives the commission rejected the augmentation of existing staffs because it was felt that approach would not be cost effective and congress would have less control over the system contr acting with outside messengers was also rejected because of the potential expense and potential problems presented by the irregular congressional sche dule and the security requirements of congress the commission concluded that wh ile improvements were need ed the present system has worked satisfactorily for nearly 200 years68 issues and alternatives as noted in this report the house investigations in the 109th and 110th congresses have been the impetus for memb ers of congress and others in and out of government to reexamine the page system these discussions have centered more on the oversight of the page progra m rather than on its retention httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33685crs15 69 http wwwcloseupor g and

the oversight and wellbeing of house pages appear to be evidence of the houses commitment to safe environment for pages the page board was created to be foundation for ensuring in cohe rent and comprehens ive manner the safety and positive experience of pages the additi on of parent and former page to the board and the requirement for regular meetings was intended to have positive impact on the publics perception of the overs ight of the page system and to be major step toward restoring confidence in the program having parent and former page as board members was also expected to improve communication between those with authority for the prog ram and the parents of pages raising the age of pages is something congress could again consider in doing so it would face the issue of whether olde r persons would be willing to perform the page duties and work at the current sala ry levels of pages the disposition of buildings currently used to house and edu cate the pages would likewise need to be assessed through the years there have been pe riodic discussions about altering or replacing the page system any major changes that would suspend or replace the page system could have an impact that reaches beyond the program itself the necessity of the duties currently performed by the pa ges as well as who would perform those duties in their absence and at what cost would also have to be addressed eliminating the program could reflect negatively on congress in considering retaining high school age pages or having an outside group manage their supervision congress could l ook to established programs such as the closeup foundation and presidential classr oom for fee these organizations have brought thousands of middleschool and highschool students to washington dc over the years to promote informed particip ation in government through educational programs these organizations supervise th students while they are in washington and provide them housing as well as meals69 if foundation independent of congress were to manage the page program it would likely have to be done visàvi s the congressional c odes of c onduct that prohibit inkind contributions of services to support the activities of congressional office70 the house committee on standards of official conduc t and the senate select committee on ethics would likely have to be involved even though they have given approval over the years to certain privately funded intern programs
