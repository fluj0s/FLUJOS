african centre for technology studies rescuing the kyoto protocol perspectives for african negotiators special issue of innovation1 request for publication funds summary the african centre for technology studies acts is seeking us 10742 to finance the production and distribution of special issue on climate change of its regular magazine innovation this issue will aim to better prepare the african delegates to the resumed sixth conference of the parties cop 6 meeting to be held in may 2001 in bonn germany by providing up to date overview of main issues at stake for africa the talks follow the failure to make breakthrough by negotiators from 170 countries that gathered in the hague in november 2000 the meeting will aim to set the operational details for commitments on reducing emissions of greenhouse gases under the kyoto protocol and b reach agreement on actions to strengthen implementation of the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc itself africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change and its impacts and has low capacity to adapt to these changes mostmany delegates from africa lack the necessary negotiating skills needed at international meetings such as the cop the climate convention and its protocol present numerous opportunities for africa to adapt to climate changes and its impacts while achieving other urgent development needs at the same time it is important therefore that all efforts to rescue the kyoto protocoldeadline at cop 6be pursued the costs to this continent as result of the protocol not going into force are more than it would benefit it is imperative therefore that african delegations be equipped with the necessary information to boost their negotiating tasks on the various issues at stake as contribution towards this effort acts will be publishing the special issue of innovation that will be distributed to african delegations just before the bonn articles in this issue are being prepared by some of the most seasoned negotiators on climate change on the continent this sentence may be too strongly worded besides some of the authors are researchers and some are from the system 10 introduction negotiators from 170 countries gathered in the hague in november 2000 to attend the sixth conference of the parties to the unfccc the two objectives the meeting aimed to achieve were setting the operational details for commitments on reducing greenhouse gas emissions under the 1997 kyoto protocol and b reaching an agreement on actions to strengthen the implementation of the unfccc itself initial hague meetings mainly by the subsidiary bodies sb to the convention aimed to reduce the differences on the text for decisions on range of issues related to the protocol and the unfccc including the transfer of technology and capacity building to assist developing countries and countries with economies in transition the adverse effects of climate change and the impacts of implementation of response strategies best practices in domestic policies and measures to address greenhouse gas emissions the mechanisms outlined under the protocol compliance system for the protocol and issues relating to land use landuse change and forestry lulucf sector add these issues are critical in terms of strengthening the financial and technological capacity of african countries and reduce adverse impacts of climate change breakthrough was achieved at the end of these talks and decision was reached to resume negotiations in may 2001 in bonn germany during the fourteenth session of the sbs much work remains to be done therefore with particular focus required on resolving political disputes relating to key unresolved issues such as accounting for carbon sinks use of the protocols flexibility mechanisms the compliance regime and funding assistance for developing countries to adapt to climate change it is clear that the protocols survival will largely depend on the outcome of the resumed talks and significant negative implications are imminent for developing should this round of talks fail too african countries and the small island states stand to lose much should the protocol not go into force triggering accelerated ratification the resumed cop6 round of negotiations is critical point where many decisions will be taken it is hence important that all possible efforts towards the preparedness of the african delegates be encouraged as its contribution towards this end the african centre for technology studies proposes the publishing of articles on issues at stake for africa at the climate talks in magazine that will be widely distributed to african delegates this effort will go long way in building the holistic delegate information base and awarenessraising process 20 the road to bonn africas concerns as countries prepare to go to bonn two main concerns for africa remain first the continents economies and livelihoods depend on the available natural resources that are increasingly being threatened by climate change and its impacts one such impact is the sea level rise that threatens to submerge significant proportion of the coastlines on the continent and other small island states according to the latest ipcc report2 the global average sea level rose between 01 and 02 metres during the 20th century the rise is attributed to thermal expansion of sea water and widespread loss of land ice for example it is predicted that 1m sea level rise could destroy up to 25 of the nile delta agricultural land and displace about 8 million people3 according to the same ipcc report the globalaverage surface temperature in the 20th century increased by about 06c with the 1990s being the warmest decade since 1861 this new report attributes the warming to concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases and their radiative forcing that have continued to increase as result of human activities changes have also occurred in several other important aspects of climate such as regional increases in precipitation cloud cover warm episodes of the ninosouthern oscillation enso phenomena and the frequency and intensity of droughts over the last few decades that impacts associated with global warming are manifesting is reason enough for africa to brace itself for the worst the continent must be assisted to adaptation to the changing climate whether or not the protocol goes into force the continent lacks adequate capacity financial and technological to oversee its adaptation to climate change and impacts of response strategies however the climate convention has provisions article 44 through which developing nations may be assisted financially and technologically in adapting the kyoto protocol through article 12 also prescribes the cdm mechanism via which finances and technologies for reducing greenhouse gases may be transferred from developed to developing countries that would concurrently ensure sustainable development is achieved in host countries recent assessment of the world bank aij project in burkina faso4 vindicates the need for africa to support adoption the cdm flexibility mechanism defined under article 12 of the kyoto protocol that resembles the cdm in their operational detail as understood so far the imminent success of cdm projects in africa would ultimately depend on the eligibility of projects vast majority of emission reduction projects in africa would influence the domestic energy use patterns while others would require alterations in current landuse and forestry management practices5 modalities on how all these can be achieved within an environment of an operational kyoto protocol are among the crunch issues at the negotiating table in bonn come may 2001 secondly the negotiating capacity of the delegates from africa does not match that of delegations from other developed country regions gauging from the high political tensions that characterised the collapsed talks at the cop6 and the unwillingness by major industrialised countries such as the us and japan to change their positions on certain issues there is clear need for new negotiating approach by african at the sessions at the resumed talks the delegates will need to work even harder to defend their positions on the identified major issues of concern this requires information on and knowledge of the sticky issues before hand to enable informed debates and to avoid costly compromises for the continent there are few perennial delegates to the cop meetings who demonstrate knowledge of the issues under debate through their active participation the presence of the vast majority of african delegates will however need to be felt at all future cop and sb sessions on climate change if relevant breakthroughs are to be realised effective participation by african negotiators at the annual sessions is hampered by lack of basic negotiating skills unbalanced knowledge scale among the negotiatorsan aspect which slows discussions high turnover of negotiators small size of national delegations and the proliferation of simultaneous meetings and contact groups6 there is the need to strengthen their skills to manage the process cooperatively as regional block the continent needs seasoned negotiators to build stronger presence in multilateral negotiation processes they should be able to link africas urgent needs to the issues at stake at the climate negotiations in order to build national support given the delicate nature of the factors that influence the appointments of national delegations eg politics lack of funding poor communication that hinders information flow etc it is unlikely that the situation will improve in the very near future under current national governance systems that are entirely responsible for nominations the ongoing implies the need for urgent shortterm solutions aiming to equip delegations to sb and cop meetings prior to the sessions efforts are needed to avail relevant and timely information focusing on the issues at stake for the continent the information should be prepared and presented by peers with stronger grasp on the issues on africa and with long experience in international negotiations this could be through regional workshopsuch as one7 recently held in dakar senegalfor country delegates an option likely to limit the numbers of those taking part from each country alternative cost effective media include posting the information onto the internet and mailing hardcopy newsletters and magazines to delegates through recognised national institutions the latter option can ensure wider circulation and impact provided it is implemented on time to supplement any planned and ongoing efforts by african groups towards strengthening their roles at the resumed talks the climate change policy programme at acts will be publishing special issue of innovationa regular magazine published by the centreto be launched three weeks before the bonn session the magazine will then be mailed for wide distribution through national climate change focal points and other reliably fast means while others will be delivered to other interested delegates in bonn 30 objective acts is pursuing this project entirely as shortterm objective the overall objective of the project is to present the african delegates with synthesised information on the issues at stake for africa at the climate talks this will be in the form of short articles prepared by fellow delegates with wider experience and knowledge on climate change negotiations as they confront the massive text on various issues under consideration it is hoped the delegates will make marked impact through informed voting that is crucial in avoiding compromises that are contrary to the needs of the continent the resumed cop6 is critical point where many decisions will be taken that will make or break the kyoto protocol all efforts to contribute to the preparedness of the africans should be encouraged 40 activities towards production of the magazine 41 soliciting of articles broad list of scholars and policymakers with wide experience in negotiations at the international level was prepared these were then contacted by phone and email and requested to prepare articles in their areas of interest in line with the issues at stake these are issues on sinks flexibility mechanisms and supplementarity compliance regimes and financing for adaptation to climate change they are expected to develop their articles on the various assigned topics focusing on the bonn meeting from the perspective of the collapsed talks in the hague in november 2000 all the authors are actively involved in the international climate change negotiation

delegates attending the 14th session of the subsidiary bodies and resumed cop 6 talks whose physical addresses are not readily available plus any others attending the conference the editor will endeavour to ensure that all african delegations have enough copies 45 feedback questionnaire brief questionnaire of about 1 page will be attached to each copy on which each reader will be required to respond to certain questions the aim of this will be evaluate the effectiveness of the magazine on the delegates performance and the negotiations process delegates will also suggest ways of improving their knowledgebase and negotiating skills conspicuous boxes shall be located in strategic places for the delegates to drop in the questionnaires towards the end of the talks from these questionnaire
