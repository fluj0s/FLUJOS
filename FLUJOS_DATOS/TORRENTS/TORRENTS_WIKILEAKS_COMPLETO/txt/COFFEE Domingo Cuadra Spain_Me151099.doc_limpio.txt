to anne schlumberger date 15 october 1999 from valerie mullen trust department telephon345 949 7212 fax 345 949 0993 subject coffee cup investments ltd dear anne i acknowledge receipt of your memo of 7th october i am disappointed to note that the investment manager only passed you the paperwork on the same date although the payment was made to the client on 16th september 1999 may i please ask you to remind him that the correct procedure is to have the authority before the payment is made i realise that there are practical reasons why this route is not followed but there should not be lapse of almost 3 weeks between making the payment and advising the trustees this not only endangers the credibility of the structure it also gives us as trustees problems with having the resolutions signed by our trust committee members in zurich i also enclose the account documentation you requested i am providing the hold mail agreement on the basis that you hold only the copy that the client obviously obtains and that copy will still be sent to us as trustees i have not spoken with you in long time and hope that all is well with you kindest regards valerie mullen
