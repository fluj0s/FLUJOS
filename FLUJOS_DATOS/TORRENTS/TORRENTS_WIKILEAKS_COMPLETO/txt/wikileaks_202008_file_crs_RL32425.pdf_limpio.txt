congress passed legislation creating the transportation secu rity administration tsa the agency was charged with making improvements to the countrys transportation security systems and protecting against future terro rist attacks tsa was also given the authority to establish regulations for protecting certain information from public disclosure these regulations govern sensitive security information or ssi the ssi regulations prohibit tsa offici als and employees having need to know status from disclosing transportation s ecurity information that details security programs and equipment training and security procedures vulnerability assessments or other related information the regula tions pertaining to ssi are exempt from freedom of information act disclosure tsa is required however to provide ssi to authorized congressional committees the purpose of the ssi regulations is to restrict information relative to future terrorist attacks tsas application of the ssi regulations s however resulted in some controversies over airport secu rity procedures employee accountability passenger screening and airport secrecy agreements some experts believe that too much information has been kept from the public in these circumstances tsa states however that protecting ssi is warranted because of the need to protect transportation systems fundamental issue in this controvers is the tension between securing the nations transportation systems and keeping the public informed democratic governments benefit from an informed citizenry however broad openness may provide potential enemies with information that enables attacks on the transportation infrastructure what level of risk re sulting from public access to ssi is acceptable to policymakers and the public what alternatives are available to the present system and what are their strengths and weaknesses this report provides background inform ation on and analysis of issues concerning the ssi

washington post oct 10 2003 p a11sensitive security information and transportation security issues and congressional options introduction democratic governments face difficult tension in weighing their duty to protect information vital to security concerns while keeping the public informed the 911 terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon gave greater emphasis to this issue in the context of an immediate need for the federal government to protect the nation from fu ture terrorist attacks given that the 911 terrorist attacks were accomplished using commercial airliners as weapons congress sought to strengthen transportation security by establishing the transportation security administration tsa1 congress directed the new agency to assess and protect agai nst threats to the nations air land and maritime transportation systems in the act creating the new agency congress incorporated the concept of sensitive security information ssi and directed the agency to establish regulations to protect such information from public disclosure when disclosure would detract from the secu rity of the nations transportation system and the safety of travelers and crews accordingly tsa is faced with finding an appropriate balance between its mandate to protect ssi from disclosure and the need to keep the public adequately info rmed about transportation security the application of ssi regulations issu ed by the tsa however has generated controversy some critics charge that the agency has withheld too much information from the public pilots fight attendants nd consumer advocates assert that tsa is muzzling debate of security initiatives by labeling too many of the agencys policies and reports as too sensitiv for public dissemination2 for some the issue is simply conflict between two arguably legitimate needs the need for security versus the publics need for open access to information so they can make rational travel and transportation decisions for themselves

to whet her our openness was what made us so vulnerable3 with view to informing congressi onal debate on whether the tsa has achieved an appropriate balance between security needs and the information needs of the traveling public this report traces the origin of the ssi concept and its incorporation into tsa transportation security regulations it explains how the treatment of sensitive security information differs from the treatment of national security information it discusses the tensions inherent between the need to protect sensitive information and the need to dvise the traveling public adequately on transportation security matters and it pres ents and analyzes pertinent legislative policy options that may be of interest to congress ssi and the development of ssi regulations sensitive security information is information that desc ribes air carrier screening procedures airport or air carrier security programs maritime transportation security procedures or other related transportation security matters the ssi concept appears in federal statutes that prohibit the disclo sure of information obtained or developed in carrying out security activities if the tsa administrator formerly the under secretary of transportation for security determines that such disclosure would be detrimental to the safety of passengers in transportation4 tsa regulations specify the categories of information that may be protected as ssi5 when the tsa designates information as ssi its disclosu re is limited by strict needtoknow basis as determined by tsa disclosure restri

is protected at one of three levels top secret secret or confidential and access to the information depends on the level of classifi cation and the users level of clearance22 ssi regulations do not set time limits for declassification and release the only provision for the release of ssi is for alleged perpetrators of crimes or their representatives to receive ssi for the sole purpose of providing the info rmation necessary to prepare response to the allegations23 eo 12958 as amended calls for the establishment of specific date for declassification of protected national security information if date is set on the document then 10year limit is established24 the standards set for the classification and declassification of national security information are arguably higher and more specific than the standards for sensitive security information the l ack of specificity of ssi re gulations has raised questions about the withholding and eventual disclosu re of transportation security information accordingly we now turn to the tensi ons that can occur when the government withholds sensitive security information keeping in mind how the handling of national security information differs from that of sensitive transportation security information safeguarding transportation infrastructure vs public access to information democratic governments continually face the difficult problem of weighing their duty to protect information vital to security concerns against their responsibility for keeping the public informed the rrorist attacks of september 11 2001 gave

years tsa has applied the ssi provisions of the transportation security regulations to redu ce the risk of vital security information from reaching the wrong hands in one inci dent tsa withheld information about an airport event involving an individual who passed through security checkpoint without being stopped the agency stated it was not going to be issuing any kind of report because

exploited every weakness we had30 tsa officials state that the release of security and training procedures could aid in the planning of similar attack and that the divulgence of any information about tsas security systems could endanger the entire transportation infrastructure the public availability of security information also could increase the plausibility of threats to paralyze tran sportation systems the disruption could obstruct tsas efforts to prevent real threats additionally the related increased costs to tsa private companies and the public could be great31 airports have already experienced increased costs through combination of factors including new capital projects unfunded security ma ndates and envir onmental demands32 public information issues as the preceding sections suggest in post 911 environment it is arguably appropriate and necessary for the federal government to reevaluate the balance between making information public and the need to protect the nation from terrorist threats ssi regulations are an attempt to prevent transportation security information from reaching the wrong hands and being used to plan another 911 attack some say however that the public disclo sure of information is not threat to security but the key to it33 the disclosure of information has long been held as one of the primary ways to combat fraud and abuse in government as supreme court justice louis brandeis once stated publicity is justly commended as remedy for social and industrial dis eases sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants electric light the most efficient policeman34 by this logic it is possible that ssi protection could reduce public pressure for improving security systems for example it has been asserted that baggage screening machines used to detect bombs and other security threats are experiencing number of false hits where something other than bomb or other security risk causes the machine to make

dont want to give road map to the bad guys36 others consider the release of transportation security information an incentive for change some say the restriction of information deprives travelers of information that they could use to assess travel risks37 further these policies might lead to public complacency as former white h ouse chief of staff john podesta notes openness does not destroy secu

values of transportation security nd public disclosure these options include accepting the existing ssi regulations giving greater specificity to the agencys protection requirements settin g time conditions for ending protection seeking expert advice requiring periodic congressional br iefings and establishing an oversight board option 1 maintain the status quo congress could leave standing the current authorizing statutes and regulations for ssi under this option tsa appears to have full authority to prohibit the disclosure of ssi to the public this tsa authority is similar to that of the faa upheld in the1993 case public citizen v faa where an aviation consumer group challenged the faas authority to promul gate and withhold from the public its rules on certain sensitive security

sensitive security information ssi and transportation security background and controversies by mitchel sollenberger pp 56disclosure would jeopardize passenger safety is more than just finding of fact it is prediction of the likely future effect of disclosure40 the present arrangements have so far raised only minor public complaints41 for example in des moines iowa local law enforcement officers and airportofficials voiced concerns over airport s ecurity agreements which prohibit local police from commenting on any incident invol ving ssi that has occurred on airport property without authorization by tsa 42 after some clarification of the agreement by tsa officials and the creation of training seminar for des moines police the issue was resolved43 although the continuation of the current ssi regulations appears to provide adequate protection of vital transportation information some believe that the increased availability of some transportation security information can be an incentive for constructive change the belief is that by making more of some transportation information available the public can make stronger or better informed case to the industry and government to improve secu rity weaknesses in the transportation system in addition many of the contr oversies over ssi are largely unknown to the public and thus do not constitu pressing concern moreover the publics lack of information limits public participation in polic ymaking for and support of improved transportation systems security option 2 create specifi c protection standards congress could require greater specificity for ssi regulations for example the vague and highly discretionary need to know principle provides set standard for determining who may receive ssi possible solution would be to have tsa create categories of persons who could receive certain ssi information such as tsa officials security personnel private companies and the public for example specific information about breach in security at an airport check point might be available only to tsa offici als and security personnel private companies and the public would be provided only genera lized reports about the incident this approach could provide better c ontrol over the details of information publicly released and minimize its value to potential terrorists in addition interested parties would know beforehand the kind of information they would be provided and what to expect from tsa officials if similar incidents occur this refinement could also ease public appr ehension about security incidents while providing more detaile d sensitive information for security personnelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32425crs12 44 for more information on declassifica tion arrangements see crs report 97771 security

protecting and reducing government secrecy washington gpo 1997there is at least one limit to this option some types of information may need to be protected at all times for example releasing incident reports to the public may have unintended consequences such as revealing vital security procedures to potential terrorists option 3 establish time limits for protection congress could have tsa place time limits on the protection of ssi as noted earlier in this report classified national security information has specific dates for its declassification if date is set on the classified document then 10year limit is established44 similar requirement c ould be made for certain ssi information for example reports of security incidents or breaches at airports might lose ssi protection 10 years after their creation with the possibility that some portions might selectively continue to have ssi protection for an additi onal number of years thus such report might be publicly released afte r 10 years but with paragraph or few sentences redacted other reports such as upgraded security contingency plans vulnerability assessments or information pertaining to research and development projects could be released after longer period of prot ection nonetheless allowing for the public disclosure of certain ki nds of reports documents and records containing ssi after 10 years would make important materials available to among others taxpayers histor ians and policy analysts option 4 create an advisory commission congress could establish an advisory commission or committee to study ssi security arrangements and provide r ecommendations such panel was most recently created by congress in 1994 the commission on protecting and reducing government secrecy which largely focused on the classified national security information system45 the new study commission might also be tasked with considering the integration of ssi protection arrangements with existing information protection systems as well as exploring other congressional opti ons identified here such as establishing time limits for discontinuing protection and strengthening ssi management accountability commission on ssi could offer several be nefits first the commission option allows for full study of the ssi without needing to act immediately while also responding to public pressure when th commission issues its report congress could consider its recommendations and implement them on selective basis either immediately or at later date implementation might occur thru legislative action or voluntary tsa compliance the difficulty with this option is that many commission recommendations are often not implemented in addition commissions repor t may not alleviate publichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32425crs13 46 house rule

periodic congressional briefings or reports on ssi administration similar briefings and reports are currently given to the house and senate intelligence committees which also require the director of central intelligence the secretary of defense the secretary of state and the director of the federal bureau of investigation to submit annual reports on intelligence activities the committees also often request department and agency heads to testify about current inte lligence issues46 the senate when pproving nominations has also expressed its sense that intelligence community officials should keep the senate intelligence committee fully and currently informed with respect to intelligence activities including anticipated activities and those that may constitute violations of constitutional rights or other law47 each intelligence committee may also disclose publicly any information that it determines would serve the public interest48 congressional briefings or reports could include tails on variety of ssi matters such as 1 incidents involving breaches of airport security and airport security agreements 2 the number of requests and denials for information concerning alleged violators of legal enfo rcement action and 3 lists of legal cases or actions involving ssi regulations49 there are several benefits to requiring briefings or reports on ssirelated issues both houses of congress have establishe d similar briefing systems for intelligence matters moreover disputes over the disc losure of ssi should not be problematic because congress already holds closed hearings on sensitive intelligence matters50 requiring periodic briefings or reports could help cong ress identify transportation information in the public intere st that should be disclosed there also are however several drawbacks to this option number of committees have oversight authority over tsa solution to this problem might behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32425crs14 51 see eo 12958 60 fed reg 19825 federal register vol 60 apr 20 1995 p 19825 52 president john f kennedy assassination records collection act of 1992 pl 102526to provide in the authorizing statute which committees have jurisdiction to investigate ssirelated matters another draw back might be the lack of media and public attention to the issue congress might be unwilling to require periodic briefings if the issue does not appear to be serious concern in addition congress would become overburdened if it tried to manage every matter or controversy arising in each agency finally pursuing this option might entangle congress and the relevant committees in the public dispute over ssi availability option 6 establish lect oversight entity congress might also consider establishing select oversight entity with powers to review ssi management and its protection by tsa board with similar functions was established in 1994 to settle disputes about the declassification of national security information the interage ncy security classifi cation appeals panel iscap51 the panels membership includes the secretaries of state and defense the attorney general the director of central intelligence the archivist of the united states and the presidents assistant for national security affairs iscap is charged with 1 making final dete rminations on classification challenges 2 approving denying or amending exemptions fro m automatic declassification sought by agencies 3 making final determinati ons on mandatory declassification review requests appealed to it and 4 generally advising and assisting the president regarding these matters there is also the information security oversight office isoo mandated by eo 12958 which monitors executive branch security classification and declassification polic and practices nd related matters congress could create similar entity or designate an existing one to monitor ssi administration the entity could have final authority on ll ssirelated issues deciding to either reject or accept protection justifications made by tsa the board could also make recommendations for imp roving current ssi management and generally advise congress on ways to protect transporta tion security while providing the public needed information there are several benefits to this option first it would establish system for reviewing all ssi protection decisions in addition the entity might alleviate ssi management criticism this option how ever could create added pressure when entity leadership is considered former tsa or other transportation officials might make up large percentage of board because of their expertise in the field of transportation security an unbalanced membership could create even more criticism solution could be to established review board similar to the one created by congress to reexamine presid ent john f kennedy assassination records that were still regarded as t oo sensitive to open to the public52 although the jfk review board was presidentially appointed the act required the president to select board members from list of names submitted by four professional associations the american historical associ ation the organization of american historians thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32425crs15 53 pl 102562 sec 7society of american archivists and the american bar association53 such model could be reproduced for ssi review board there is however final drawback poten tially inherent in this option review by an oversight board may be too timeconsuming for the release of information in the public interest by the time review occurs the usefulness of the information may have passed the options identified here offer cour ses of action which congress may pursue with view to balancing the need to protect sensitive transportation security information and the realization of the peoples right to know about the policies activities and operations of their government regarding transportation security each option has demonstrated stre ngths and weaknesses tsa and its ssi regulations have been in existence in their present forms for less than three years the agency has demonstrated its willingness to work with complainants to make adjustments of its ssi regulations and their application but tsas cooperation may not be sufficient to realize successful balance between transportation security needs and the publics need for information in this event cong ress may choose to examine these or other options that could provide resoluti on to this issue of ssi information
