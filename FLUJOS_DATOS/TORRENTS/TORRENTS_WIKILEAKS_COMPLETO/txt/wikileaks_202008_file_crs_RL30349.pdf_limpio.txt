of time to develop new budget process and involved tradeoffs between the legislature and executive5 the legislation gave the president substantial responsibilities and authority over the federal budget formulation process to assist in this endeavor the statute also created the bureau of the budget in the treasury department the bureau was later moved to the executive office of the president and is now known as the office of management and budget as counterweight to these enhancements of executive power in the budget process congress established the general accounting office in the legislative branch in large part through the transfer of comptroller and auditor duties from the treasury department congressional work on what was to become the 1 921 act began two years earlier with legislative proposals to transfer the duties and responsibilities of the comptrollers and auditors from the treasury department to an entity independent of the executive departments and indeed located in the legislative branch this initial legislation was vetoed by president woodrow wilson who objected to section allowing for the removal of the new comptroller general by congress alone through concurrent resolution 6 this provision was later changed to allow for the removal of the comptroller general by adoption of joint resolution the joint resolution which must be signed by the president is subject to presidential veto and the possibility of veto override the 1921 act abolished the post of comptroller and assistant comptroller of the treasury along with the six auditors in the department their personnel records and resources were transferred to the new general accounting office the establishing authority also vested gao with the powers and responsibilities of the auditors

to review recommendations about such reductions and report his findings to the president who in turn was to issue sequestration order mandating spending reductions specified by the cg additional legislative mechanisms or fallback provisions to cut spending were also included in the statute the supreme court held however that the delegation of authority to the cg was unconstituti onal concluding that the powers vested in the comptroller general under section 251 violate the command of the constitution that the congress play direct role in the execution of the laws 14 in contrast to

hearings held by panels other than the select committees on intelligence other ic components however ve not asserted the sa proscrip tion to gao audits in contrast to the cias stand for instance the department of defense has issued the following instructions it is dod policy that the department of defense cooperate fully with the gao and respond constructively to and take appropriate corrective action on the basis of gao reports but dod is also to be alert to identify errors of fact or erroneous interpretation in gao reports and to articulate the dod position in such matters as appropriate

much larger experience different levels of autonomy for entities within the agency or department are more organizationally varied and exhibit more functional diversity and mission multiplicity resulting in crosscutting and shared juri sdictions with other executive entities the gao payforperformance implementation along with similar efforts in executive agencies have raised concerns over several matters in congressional hearings in the 110 th congress and other forums40 and have led to legislative proposals to modify the comptroller generals powers in this regard discussed above41 the issues include whether the changes are implemented fairly and impartially across the board whether the plans criteria and standards are clear and appropriate whether the measurements used to compare personnel in gao and elsewhere lead to valid and reliable conclusions whether the changes produce the desired results whether they have an adverse effect on employee morale and whether they prompt or endorse requests for similar authority in other government entities earlier the offices payban determinations had been challenged by 308 employees resulting in favorable settlement for 1242

or piecemeal approach to similar transformation could arise because of differences between policyimplementing executive agency and legislative support agency in terms of missions functions authority organization and procedures it could also arise because of concerns from some stakeholders such as federal employee unions about several matters whether certain executive agencies could meet the gao standards due to different organizational cultures and conditions for instance what unintended consequences might occur how the new managerial powers might be manipulated or misused and what the full

under gaos current statutory charter the comp troller general and deput comptroller general are nominated by the president following recommendations from special congressional commission and are confirmed by the senate when vacancy occurs in the office of the comptroller general or the deputy special congressional commission consisting of member s of both chambers and both parties is established to recommend individuals to the president for appointment46 added by the general accounting office act of 1980 94 stat 314315 this process became operational the following year under the arrangement the recommending commission consists of the speaker of the house the president pro tempore of the senate the majority and minority leaders of the house and senate the chairmen and ranking minority members of the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs and the house committee on oversight and government reform and when the deputys post is vacant the comptroller general the commission determines the criteria and standards for its nominees the current process includes examination of the backgrounds and future plans of potential nominees including of course their credentials accomplishments and relevant work experience in the private sector and public office these examinations are conducted by the commission members and staff through interviews and meetings with the candidates as well as with interested and knowledgeable parties and review of rele vant materials and documents later examinations are held by the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs which reports the nomination to the full senate 47 the commission must recommend at least three individuals but the president may ask for additional names for consideration or nominate some one else the original bill called for five names to be submitted however the number was reduced according to the report of the senate committee on governmental affairs because three names is more realistic figure considering the high qualifications for the office of comptroller and deputy comptroller general requirement to generate five names might be extremely difficult to satisfy48 the reporting panel also recognized that the pr esident could still nominate an individual not recommended by the commission in light of the presidents authority under the appointments clause however it is expected that the pres ident would give great weight to the commissions recommendations49 this expectation has been met on the two occasions since the 1980 enactment when vacancy in the office of comptroller general arose presidents reagan in 1981 and clinton in 1998 each selected nominee from the initial congressional list 46 proposal from gao would change the process for the deputy by allowing the cg to appoint the deputy after consultation with the congressional commission hr 3268 110th congress described above 47 for the most recent illustration see us

system was added in 195359 in considering the legislation the senate committee on government operations received the views of both the civil service commission csc and the comptroller general the committee st ated that the new retirement system for the comptroller general was designed to conform to the particular nature of the office which witnesses testified was similar in character tenure and independence to the office of federal judge and that its provisions are designed to conform to retirement benefits provided for federal judges 60 the post was regarded as unique in statement on behalf of the chairman of the civil service commission who favored the retirement provision for several reasons the comptroller general is unique in that he is independent of executive control b cannot be removed except by the congress and c is not eligible for reappointment after serving 15year term 61 letter to the committee from the csc elaborated on these and other rationales it noted that the comptroller generals duties were important and complex demanding the appointment of mature man who would not necessarily have had previous government experience and might not after leaving the post62 the resulting condition is that upon completion of his term the comptroller general will normally be of such advanced age as to deter if not prohibit his acceptance of employment in other pursuits63 lindsay warren the comptroller general at the time echoed these sentiments the fixed 15year term without the possibility of reappointment is too long for such an officer to retain other ties and too short to provide lifetime security or sufficient longevity to buy an annuity under the civil service retirement system important and complex duties of the position dict ate the appointment of mature man who upon completion of his term would normally be beyond the age when he might seek new fields of activity the office is part of the legislative branch of the government and is of semijudicial nature 64 continued such an election is irrevocable and must be made within 10 years and 60 days after the start of service as comptroller general cg electing the special lifetime

on its own or more usually at the request of congress its members and panels over the past decade questions have arisen over several matters affecting gaos structure organization and powers the process and resulting delay for selecting the comptroller general the absence of confirmed deputy for more than twentyfive years the unsuccessful attempt to gain access to information from presidentially established panel headed by the vice president problems in securing independent access to the records of certain agencies and limitations on gao auditing of all components of the intelligence community as result bills have been introduced in the 110 th congress which would enhance gao access to executive branch information clarify the offices jurisdiction over the intelligence community provide reimbursement for certain audit costs and establish statutory inspector general in gao in the mid1990s gao underwent substantial downsizingin funding and staffingin part because of congressional criticism of its perceived orientation towards the previous two administrations and concerns about its missions and roles in the meantime the office has experienced paradox between its budget and personnel levels its annual budget has increased regularly over the past 10 yearsreaching its highest level in fy2008while its staff has been downsized falling to its smallest level at the
