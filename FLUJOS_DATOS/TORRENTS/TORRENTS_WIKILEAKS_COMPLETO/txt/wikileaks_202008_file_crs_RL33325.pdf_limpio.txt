resources science and industry division january 15 2008 abstract some groups believe that federal oﬃcials have not enforced existing laws designed to prevent anticompetitive behavior andor that the laws themselves should be strengthened to better address todays market realities others assert that present competition and antitrust policies remain adequate and eﬀective they believe that the sectors structural changes are desirable outgrowth of other factors such as technological and managerial improvements changing consumer demand and more international competition early in the 110th congress number of bills were introduced to address one or more of these perceived problems in livestock markets which sponsors often broadly refer to as competition issues the senate version of the farm bill hr 2419 includes many of these provisions it creates new special counsel for agricultural competition at usda to investigate and prosecute violations of competition laws prohibits most major packers from owning or controlling livestock more than 14 days prior to slaughter provides new protections to producers and producer groups under the agricultural fair practices act afpa strengthens enforcement authorities over live poultry dealers under the packers and stockyards ps act alters some provisions for swine and pork in the mandatory livestock price reporting program and establishes new mandatory reporting requirements for dairy products among other provisions with the exception of provision on arbitration clauses in livestock and poultry contracts there are comparably fewer provisions addressing competition issues in the house version of the farm bill consequently the inclusion of competition provisions in the new farm bill will likely be conference item during farm bill

livestock and meat production and marketing sometimes referred to as consolidation concentration andor vertical integrationhave long generated interest and controversy in congress although usda still considers beef cattle production farm level to be among the least concentrated agricultural sectors just four firms slaughtered 71 of all us cattle in 2005 in 1985 the thentop four packers accounted for 39 of all cattle slaughter according to industry and usda statistics four firms slaughtered 63 of all us hogs in 2005 compared with 32 in 1985 live hog production itself has seen sweeping changes over the past 25 years the number of us farms with hogs declined from 667000 in 1980 to 67000 in 2005 those remaining have become much larger and less diversified operations with at least 10000 hogs now represent less than 1 of all producers but more than half of total us production usda reports many hogs today are sold through production contracts where pork processor might provide the pigs and other inputs and contracting producer farmer provides facilities and labor debate has revolved around the impacts of such changes on farm prices consumers global competitiveness and the traditional us system of independent farms and ranches inherent in these questions is the role government should play in monitoring and regulating agricultural markets some groups believe that federal officials have not enforced existing laws designed to prevent anticompetitive behavior andor that the laws themselves should be strengthened to better address todays market realities others assert that present

ranchers have had to adjust to significant changes in the structure and business methods of the livestock and meat sectors in recent decades at the farm level animal production in general and hog production in particular have undergone significant consolidation since 1980 beef and pork packing slaughtering and processing have consolidated rapidly since 1980 into fewer and larger plants as an industry consolidates it can become highly concentrated with relatively small number of firms accounting for most production or sales the successive stages of cattle and hog production processing and marketing also are becoming more carefully managed and aligned often referred to as vertical coordination or in its most advanced form vertical integration where most stages are owned or financially controlled by single entity some farm constituencies assert that these structural changes have undermined the more traditional us system of smallerscale independent familybased farms and ranches created closed markets with less price transparency eroded farmers negotiating power and contributed to lower prices paid to farmers these groups believe that federal officials have not enforced existing laws designed to prevent anticompetitive behavior and that the laws themselves should be strengthened to better address todays market realities others assert that present competition and antitrust policies remain adequate and effective they believe that the sectors structural changes are desirable outgrowth of other factors such as technological and managerial improvements changing consumer demand and more international competition many of the changes in business relationships along the livestock and meat marketing chain have brought us consumers the ample variety of highquality lowpriced products they now enjoy it is argued new laws or more aggressive interpretation of existing laws will stifle private investment and innovation and make the industries less competitive defenders of current policies argue early in the 110 th congress number of bills were introduced to address one or more of these perceived problems in livestock markets which sponsors often broadly refer to as competition issues several such provisions are included in the senate and house versions of the 2007 farm bill hr 2419 which would repl ace provisions of the last omnibus bill the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 pl 107171 the nate version of the farm bill includes more of them including creating new special counsel for agricultural competition at usda to investigate and prosecute violations of competition laws prohibiting most major packers from owning or controlling livestock more than 14 days prior to slaughter providing new protections to producer members of agricultural cooperatives and handlers under the agricultural fair practices act afpa strengthening enforcement authorities over live poultry dealers under the packers and stockyards ps act altering some provisions for swine and pork in the mandatory livestock price reporting program and establis hing new program for mandatory daily product information reporting for dairy products among ot her provisions however with the exception of provision on arbitration clauses in livestock and poultry contracts there are fewer provisions addressing competition issues in the house version of the farm bill consequently the inclusion of competition provisions in the new farm bill will likely be conference item during farm bill negotiations between the house and senate conference negotiations on the new farm bill are scheduled for early 2008 this report provides comparison of these provisions

vertical integration are often ascribed to the meat and poultry sector as whole individual industri within the sector do differ in how they are structured and function the following discussion focuses primarily on the beef and pork industries1 g4g142g142g143g561g18g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561 most us beef cattle are born bred and pastured on large number of widely dispersed often smallsized farms and ranches called cowcalf operators these operators keep some heifer calves from each years crop for breeding herd replacement the rest generally are sold at from 6 to 12 months of age to feedlots or sometimes to an intermediary known as backgrounder who readies them for feedlots these lots fatten them to slaughter weight and sell them to the packing houses on the one hand the number of beef cow operations has declined by more than 500000 over the past 30 years 2 on the other hand cowcalf operations that hold fewer than 100 cows remain responsible for approximately half of all us marketings statistics indicate number of small herds providing calves to feedlots and backgrounding operations is key component of the cattle industry notes an american farm bureau fede ration

where five states marketed 75 of all fed cattle kansas nebraska texas oklahoma and colorado although more widely dispersed 75 of the total us beef cow inventory also is in the middle states stretching approximately west to east from colorado and utah to kentucky and tennessee and north to south as far as the canadian and mexican borders and beyond4 beef packing is much more concentrated than cattle production four firms slaughtered 80 of all young cattle steers and heifers in 2005 and 71 of us cattle of all types in 1985 the then top four firms claimed 50 of all steerheifer slaughter and 39 of all cattle slaughter5 recent concentration numbers approach those of the early 1900s when 50 to 75 of the market was dominated by five firms which slaughtered several species6 another way the federal government weighs concentration is the socalled herfindahlhirschman index hhi which is considered to be more comprehensive measurement than the fourfirm percentage cited above an industry with an hhi below 1000 is considered to be unconcentrated an industry with an hhi between 1000 and 1800 is considered to be moderately concentrated an hhi above 1800 is highly concentrated the beef packing

had more than 900 head and might typically specialize in single stage of hog production such as finishing according to usda operations with at least 10000 head now represent less than 1 of all producers but more than half of total us production usda reports in fact the hog production segment of the indust ry now has about 30 key firms plus several hundred additional significant operators8 rapid adoption of vertical coordination methods see below drove much of the consolidation in the hog industry particularly during the 1990s when farm prices declined to historic lows causing tens of thousands of small operators to cease raising hogs from 1993 to 1998 alone us farms with one or more hogs declined by nearly half from 218060 to 114380 according to usda six large producerssmithfield premium standard farms seaboard prestage cargill and iowa selecttogether accounted for nearly 30 of us hog production in 2003 9 in hog packing in 2005 four firms slaughtered 63 of all us hogs compared

decades is the trend toward vertical coordination of production with processing and marketing the barkema article has characterized this trend as supply chainstightly orchestrated production processing and marketing arrangements stretching from genetics to grocery supply chains bypass traditional commodity markets and rely on contractual arrangements among the chain participants to manage the transformation of livestock on the farm to meat in the cooler this business model was pioneered in agriculture by the poultry industry which began to integrate shortly after world war ii 11 poultry producers were the clear leader in delivering nutritional and convenient products to consumer s while at the same time sharply controlling costs according to barkema the hog industry s been closely following in poultrys footsteps now typical are contract production arrangements with large integrators who may provide the genetics pigs and other inputs and contracting producer farmer who provides facilities and labor for those who raise livestock all of these change s have meant fewer options for selling for cash at auctions or other open markets and more pressure to enter into longerterm arrangement with buyer andor processor often these arrangements take the form of agricultural contracts which usda defines as agreements between farmers and their commodity buyers that are reached before harvest or the completion of livestock production stage other alternative marketing arrangements also are used by producers and processors 8 informa economics special report the

terms for promised transaction such as date of delivery the expected price and other specifications contracts enable farmer to shift some financial risk to the buyer cushion widely fluctuating price swings and guarantee an outlet for production in return buyers gain reliable and uniform supply of raw material consumers also benefit through lower prices consistently higher quality and wider array of convenient products it is argued the growth in contracting has come largely at the expense of spot or cash markets where farmers retain full autonomy and receive prices based on prevailing market conditions and product attributes at the time of sale usda observes 12 it distinguishes two types production contracts are when the farmer provides service to the contractor who usually owns the commodity the farm ers payment may resemble fee for service rather than payment for the commoditys value for example in poultry production processing companies provide the chicks feed veterinary services transportation and production specifications to farmers who raise the chicks for the companies usually in facilities the farmers own marketing contracts emphasize the value of the commodity rather the farmers services they can specify in advance the basis for the price that will be paid the quantity to be delivered and where and product attributes but the farmer retains major management control and ownership of the commodity until delivery in 2003 contracts production or marketing covered 47 of all livestock production value up from 33 in 19911993 this compares with 31 of all crop

15 usc 18 requires parties to file notification of proposed mergers or acquisitions if the action will trigger certain size andor ownership criteria set forth by hsr such notifications must be made to the agencies that administer these laws the department of justice doj and the federal trade commission ftc which have 30 days to review them and to determine the need for any further informati on usdas role here is advisory mergers or acquisitions likely to substantially lessen market competition are violation of section 7 of the clayton act doj or ftc merger review is intended to prevent anticompetitive conduct before it occurs the principal focus during merger review is not on the merging parties but on whether the merger would change the market structure to such degree that competition likely would be substantially lessened the premerger remedies dojftc might seek with respect to proposed merger that would violate section 7 of the clayton act are either filing legal action to stop the merger or else conditioning federal approval on modifications to remove perceived antitrust concerns eg divestiture by one or another party of assetsoperations that duplicate or overlap those of the other parties negotiating such changes often is seen as in the interests of all parties because going to court can be expensive timeconsuming and risky two other classes of anticompetitive behavior may be subject to findings of antitrust unlawfulness first violation of section 1 of the sherman act collusion can occur when separate firms agree among themselves not to compete with each other this would include such matters as the prices to be paid for product resources or prices charged to consumers second violation of section 2 of the sherman act monopolization or

concentration gipsa contracted six projects to five universities it also helped researchers collect organize and analyze livestock transaction data over several years according to an oklahoma state university fact sheet among the consistent findings from the six projects were that few major cattle feeding states including texas nebraska and kansas represent the core geographic market for fed cattle and price discovery all other areas are linked to this market center although the strength of the linkage diminishes as plants are located farther from the core where the highest cattle prices are paid by packers larger and more efficient packers appeared to be passing back some of their efficiency gains to the feeders with higher prices paid for larger sale lots of cattle and to the largest feedlots higher prices were paid by larger packers with larger slaughter capacities and high plant utilization and higher prices were paid for cattle purchased closer to their plants

meatpacking is high especially for fed cattle slaughtering and fabricating we must not lose sight of the fact that conc entration has increased in part as meatpacking firms increased industry efficiency research to date suggests price impacts from packer concentration have been negative in general bu t small also research shows that efficiency gains from moving to fewer and larger meatpackers have more than offset any market power impacts use of captive supply methods remained reasonably stable from 1988 to the mid 1990s captive supply usage has seasonal component and can vary widely from plant to plant and week to week evidence suggests captive supplies increased in the last half of the 1990s buyers and sellers use captive supplies for various reasons but most believe they are beneficial or they would not be used research suggests that larger plants make greater use of captive supply procurement methods to keep plant utilization high evidence suggests larger plants use captive supplies strategically ie increasing the use of captive supplies as cash market prices and price variability increased price impacts from captive supplies have been negative in general but small 19 other research has documented either negative or positive price impacts with each studys outcome dependent upon what assumptions were us ed and what particular aspect of livestock marketing was examined noting the particular controversy over whether contracts and other marketing arrangements besides open cash transactions could lead to abuse of market power usda official commented typically contract prices for cattle and hogs are tied to the spot market price as result as more animals are sold through contracts or other arrangements and fewer through the spot market the actual number of transactions on which contract payments are based becomes smaller this thinning of the market is often alleged to increase the ability of large buyers to manipulate prices research on this

released the final rti report in february 2007 which contains more quantitative analysis of these amas including the extent of their use and possible price effects on industry participants the report could receive closer attention if congress as some anticipate debates whether to include competition provisions in new farm bill the final rti report asserted that many packers and livestock producers prefer amas because they provide such benefits as cost and risk management and better product quality assurance given the current marketing environment and recent trends use of amas can be expected to increase moderately for lamb but very little or not at all for the beef and pork industries the report predicted however the report observed cash market transactions serve an important purpose in the industry particularly for small producers and small packers reported cash prices also are frequently used as the base for formula pricing for cash market and ama purchases of livestock and meat rti reported rti reported that 85 of small producers surveyed said they relied only on the cash market when selling to packers compared with 24 of large producers likewise 10 of large beef packers surveyed reported using only the cashspot market to purchase cattle compared with 78 of small packers with regard to price impacts the rti study concluded that the use of amas is associated with lower cash market prices with much larger effect occurring for finished hogs than for fed cattle however in aggregate restrictions on the use of amas for sale of livestock to meat packers would have negative economic effects on livestock producers meat packers and consumers the rti report did caution that us meat industry market conditions during the period it studied were unusual these

problems in livestock markets which sponsors often broadly refer to as competition issues several such provisions were included in the senatepassed farm bill hr 2419 which includes various amendments to both the ps act and the afpa provisions include creating new special counsel for agricultural competition at usda to investigate and prosecute violations of competition laws prohibiting mo st major packers from owning or controlling livestock more than 14 days prior to slaughter providing new protections to producer members of agricultural cooperatives and handlers under the afpa strengthening enforcement authorities over live poultry dealers under the ps act altering some provisions for swine and pork in the mandatory livestock price reporting program and establishing new requirements for mandatory daily product information reporting for dairy products among other provisions the housepassed bill however contain few comparable competition provisions although it does require usda to

omnibus 2007 farm bill advocates want lawmakers to strengthen existing antitrust authorities to impose more mandates on the executive branch to enforce these authorities and to provide new contract protections for farmers among other options early in the 110th congress senate agriculture chairman harkin had introduced wideranging bi ll s 622 that he said would be the basis for developing proposed competition title in the new farm bill this year26 replacing the current 2002 farm bill farm security and rural investment act of 2002 pl 107171 two other senate bills including competition

legislative activity leading to enactment of the 2002 farm bill the senate agriculture committee voted in november 2001 to delete competition title from the omnibus farm bill s 1628 also proposed by chairman harkin during subsequent floor action on the bill the senate did approve number of individual competition amendments two such amendments were retained by housesenate conferees in early 2002

livestock marketing regulatory and related programs title x that is based in part on chairman harkins wide ranging bill s 622 among other senate provisions in the house although representative boswell chairman of the house agriculture subcom mittee on dairy livestock and poultry had introduced the house version of s 622 as hr 2135 few elements of hr 2135 were included in the draft bill forwarded to the full committee and passed off the house floor in fact major organizational difference between the house and senate farm bills is that while the senate bill contains separate livestock competition title the house bill contains separate title on horticulture and organic agriculture title x the senate bill does not contain separate horticulture title but instead includes such provisions under subtitle f of title i producer income protection the house bills livestock provisions are mostly contained in the miscellaneous title of the farm bill title xi

concerns about captive supply meaning animals that are either owned by or committed to meat packer except for short period directly before slaughter when packers buy fewer animals on the spot open cash market reported prices may longer accurately reflect the preponderance of prices paid it is argued reduced transparency ie prices and terms that all market players can view equally works to the disadvantage of the far larger number of producers trying to sell their livestock to the relatively few packers who buy them it is argued in the 110 th congress s 305 by senator grassley would amend the ps act to prohibit meat packers from owning or feeding livestock directly through subsidiary or through an arrangement that gives the packer operational managerial or supervisory control over the livestock or over the farming operation that produces the livestock to such an extent that the producer is longer materially participating in the management of the operation exceptions would be for arrangements made within seven days before slaughter for producerowned cooperatives that also slaughter their livestock and for packers that either slaughter only at one plant or are too small to be covered by livestock mandatory price reporting see below the measure is similar to bills s 818 hr 4713 offered in the 109 th congress by senator grassley and by representative boswell respectively

approved similarly intended amendment that conferees subsequently deleted from the final version opponents of packer ownership ban counter that evidence of price manipulation is lacking and that ban could reverse many of the efficiency gains made by the livestock industry in recent years through closer packerproducer alliances they also cite the results of the recentlyreleased rti study of marketing practices see above the senate farm bill hr 2419 includes new provision similar in intent to the grassley bill it would prohibit most major packers from owning or controlling livestock more than 14 days prior to slaughter allowing for some exceptions the packer ban would only apply to packers who are already required to report their prices through the mandatory price reporting law or packers who slaughter over 120000 head of cattle each year the ban would not apply to ownership arrangements entered into within 14 days of slau ghter of the livestock by packer or to any cooperative or entity owned by cooperative where the majority of ownership interest is held by active cooperative members or to packers not required to report to usda under section 212 of the agricultural marketing act of 1946 7 usc 1635a or packer that only owns one livestock processing plant sec 10207 the provis ion would allow for certain transition rules for packers who already own feed or control lives tock intended for slaughter on the date of enactment of this act the senate bill would require that usda promulgate regulations under this section that prevent discrimination against producers with smaller volume of business sec 10208 the house version of the farm bill does not include comparable provision prohibiting packer ownership or control prior to slaughter

110th congress would amend the afpa to address what their sponsors view as inequities in contracting between agricultural producers and those who buy their commodities the harkin bill s 622 would prohibit the use of confidentiality clauses in contracts require them to more clearly spell out producer obligations give the producer three days to review or cancel contract and limit processors right to terminate contract where the producer had made capital investment of 100000 or more to satisfy contract requirements both s 622 and separate grassley bill s 221 would allow the use of arbitration to settle contract disputes only if both parties consent to it in writing both the harkin and grassley bills are similar to measures s 2307 and s 2121 they had introduced in the 109 th congress the grassley bills also mirror 2001 floor amendment to the 2002 farm bill s 1731 1046 that was adopted by the senate but then deleted by conferees from the final legislation sponsors have argued that such amendments to the afpa are needed because agricultural consolidation has left producers with so few processorbuyers that some of these processorbuyers can and do impose unfavorable contract terms on the producers forcing them to either accept or exit the industry entirely also in the 109 th congress identical bills by senator enzi s 960 and representative pomeroy hr 4257 would have made it unlawful under the ps act for packers to use forward contracts that are based on formula price or that do not contain firm base price the bills also would have limited the size of all contracts to more than 40 cattle 30 swine or equivalent groups of other livestock and would have required packers to offer contracts for public bidding open to all

now can use formula pricing arrangements to avoid participating in more transparent open market and to unfairly change the prices they pay producers after sale is made opponents of the various ps and afpa proposals have asserted that buyers use these and other contracting arrangements to ensure steady supply of animals or other agricultural commodities to keep highcapacity plants operating efficiently such arrangements also allow for necessary price adjustments for quality grade or other marketprescribed factors these types of bills would hurt producers too because many of them use contracts or other marketing agreements with packers to limit their own exposure to price volatility and to obtain capital opponents added again citing the result of the recent rti study chairman harkins bill s 622 also would signif icantly alter the afpa so that it would cover crops in much the same way livestock is covered under the ps act more specifically it would be unlawful under the afpa for any covered person ie dealer handler contractor processor or commission merchant to engage in any unfair unjustly discriminatory or deceptive act device or anticompetitive practice in or affecting the marketing receiving purchasing sale or contracting for the production of any agricultural commodity many of the same types of individual practices now cited under the ps act as unlawful for livestock buyers would also be explicitly cited as unlawful for crop buyers under the proposed new afpa the senate farm bill hr 2419 proposes certain changes to afpa including expanding the definition of association of producers to also include general livestock poultry and farm groups sec 10101 broadening the types of prohibited practices sec 10102 and changing the current enforcement provisions to make the law consistent with amendments to create special counsel for agricultural competition the senate version also would remove aspects of the law that some producer groups believe have made the afpa less effectivefor example by clarifying civil actions against handlers including providing for preventive relief damage and attorneys fees and related issues sec 10103 among other changes and requiring usda to promulgate new rules and regulations sec 10104 the house bill does not provide for amendments to the agricultural fair practices act

special counsel for competition matters to investigate and prosecute violations of the afpa and of the ps act the new special counsel who would have to be confirmed by the senate would also would be liaison with and consult with the department of justice and the federal trade commission on competition matters affecting food and agriculture s 622 also contains language intended to make it easier for producers to prove in court of law that they were treated unfairly by packers sponsors of this proposal said that stronger enforcement authorities are needed in part because gipsa officials have largely failed to enforce existing laws they pointed to report by the departments office of inspector general oig which concluded that gipsa was not been able to adequately oversee and manage its investigative activities gipsa had difficulties defining and tracking investigations planning and conducting complex investigations and making agency policy oig found for example databases were

senate agriculture committee at the hearing gao also testified that in 2000 it had identified two critical factors that detracted from the agencys ability to investigate anticompetitive practices in livestock markets 1 investigations were being planned and conducted by economists without formal involvement of attorneys from usdas office of general counsel ogc resulting in lack of legal perspective on potential violations and 2 the agencys investigative practices were not suited for the more complex competition related concerns recently being raised moreover usda had not fulfilled promises to implement the 2000 gao recommendationssuch as integrating ogc attorneys into gipsa investigations and improving more effective management procedures for approving and reviewing investigations 29 at the senate hearing gipsas thenincoming administrator said that usda generally agreed with and was implementing the oig recommendations such as the development of management structure for receiving reviewing and acting on policy issues and internal requests for guidance clarification of agency policy directives on investigations versus routine regulatory activities and encouragement of gipsa legal specialists to work more directly with ogc in addition to amending the ps act to include packer ownership ban the senate farm bill hr 2419 would make other changes to the ps act that broaden producer rights and protections and strengthen usda enforcement under the act among the principal changes is the creation of new special counsel for agricultural competition at usda to investigate and prosecute violations of competition laws including the afpa and the ps act sec 10201 the special counsel would also serve as liaison between and act in consultation with the department of agriculture the department of justice and the federal trade commission with respect to competition and trade practices in the food and agricultural sector this provision is essentially adapted from language in chairman harkins bill s 622 and bill introduced by senator grassley s 1759 s 622 cont ains provisions establishing new office of special counsel at usda to investigate and pr osecute violations of competition laws s 1759 also would establish usda special counsel for competition matters deputy attorney general for agricultural antitrust matters in the department of justice and an agriculture competition task force to examine agricultural competition matters among other funding and programmatic changes other changes to the ps act in the senate bill would establish new requirements for contracts between producers and processors for example the bill includes provisions strengthening usda enforcement authorities over live poultry dealers including pullet and breeder

contract within three business days after the contract execution date contract producers who have made an investment of 100000 or more for purposes of securing the production contract with packer live poultry dealer or swine contractor would be given at least 90 days to correct an alleged breach before contractor can terminate contract except under certain circumstances packer live poultry dealer or swine contractor would also be prohibited from requi ring additional investments of the contract producer during the term of the contract unless the additional investments are offset or agreed to by the contract producer the senate farm bill also provides for producer choice of jurisdiction and venue and allows for arbitration to settle disputes if both parties consent in writing however some proposals that might have made it easier for producers to prove unfair treatment under the ps act were not ultimately included in the final senate farm bill although several amendments were submitted and some were debated on the senate floor for example s 622 included language that would have limited judges deciding court cases under the ps act from requiring producers to show both individual harm and competitive harm to the entire industry an amendment to hr 2419 was submitted harkin samdt 3667 to include this language in the senate farm bill but was not adopted another amendment tester samdt 3666 also would have limited ps act court cases from allowing certain pricing mechanisms in cases where the packer may have legitimate business justification samdt 3666 was debated but voted against when it was brought up during the senate floor debate other submitted senate amendments included proposal to require all forward contracts to have fixed base price enzi samdt 3691 series of amendments
