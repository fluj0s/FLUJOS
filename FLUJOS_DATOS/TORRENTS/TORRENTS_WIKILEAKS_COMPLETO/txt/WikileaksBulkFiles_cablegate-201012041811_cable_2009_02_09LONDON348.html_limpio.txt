prel mcap eun pins uk subject the british ask is our special relationship still special in washington ref london 266 classified by charge richard lebaron for reasons 14bd 1 cnf summary secretary clintons public praise for the usuk special relationship following her february 3 meeting with foreign secretary miliband coming on the heels of the presidents january 26 phone call with prime minister brown has gone long way to calm what has been stronger than usual outbreak of british political and media anxiety about the future of usuk relations the atmospherics surrounding the relationship with the united states are always under intense scrutiny in britain but uk media pundits and parliamentarians have openly worried over the last several months that the obama administration might downplay relations with the brown government because of perfect storm of factors the brown governments support for bush administration foreign policies uk economy suffering the most severe financial downturn in europe politically weak prime minister who must face voters in the next 15 months and growing us frustration with uk military failings in afghanistan and iraq fears about the end of the special relationship were further fueled by british overreading of the new administrations initial statements more than one hmg senior official asked embassy officers whether president obama meant to send signal in his inaugural address about usuk relations by quoting washington during the revolutionary war while the removal of the churchill bust from the oval office consumed much uk newsprint typified by london times story this week entitled churchill bust casts shadow over the special relationship 2 cnf summary and comment cont downing street and the most senior levels at whitehall never shared the level of anxiety over the future of the relationship that gripped the british punditocracy and now that highlevel contacts across the atlantic are resuming such as the visit of special envoy holbrooke and milibands meetings with special envoy mitchell any whitehall concerns about the relationship with washington will further dissipate the issue still has traction as subject for the uk media and chattering class however recent uk media posturing over the binyam mohamed case uk resident in guatanamo bay as test of the obama administrations commitment to new approach to fighting terrorism as well as british irritation about the original buy american language in the us stimulus legislation demonstrates that the british public will be pressing to test the administrations commitments and looking for signs of distance between london and washington although this period of excessive uk speculation about the relationship is more paranoid than usual we agree with senior mp who told us that ultimately the people who really matter in all this those who do the serious business know that where it matters over defense security issues intelligencesharing the relationship is deep ongoing and abiding end summary more speculation than usual 3 cnf every us presidential inauguration sets off debate at british think tank seminars and on uk editorial pages about the sustainability of the special relationship under new us president the debate this year however is louder than at any time since the fallout from the passportgate affair sent shivers through the uk chattering class about the relationship between newlyelected president clinton and prime minister john major in 1992 over the last several months much of the british press predicted weakening if not the outright demise of the special relationship simon tisdall in the leftleaning guardian fretted that the worrying question is whether president obama believes theres anything special about britain and it may all be little less special than before the rightleaning times editorialized that gordon browns phone is unlikely to be the one that rings when washington calls the new best friend in washington will be president sarkozywho has advertised his fondness of america from his first day in office and is close to philip gordon the new fluent frenchspeaking us assistant secretary of state for europe hes just not that into us 4 cnf for many uk pundits break in the special relationship will come because of the new us presidents personal history several commentators have explored president obamas life story to see what it might mean for london 00000348 002 of 004 his approach to the uk his relative youth which gives him historical experience of the wwii and cold war alliance with london his formative years in the pacific rather than in europe and his kenyan grandfathers treatment at the hands of british colonial forces in kenya where he was imprisoned have led many uk commentators to conclude the new president has natural link to the uk perhaps even an antipathy to the uk and this will weaken usuk ties the times correspondent in washington summed up this view mr obamahas personal experience of our shared world war ii experiences and little of our cold war alliance in his memoir dreams from my father he described his trips to drink tea on the thames before flying away from europe that just wasnt mine to discuss his kenyan roots with british passengers who displayed arrogant attitudes to the godforsaken countries of africa fearful uk wonders what it brings to the table 5 cnf for more serious observers however and quite few of the embassys official and parliamentary interlocutors the reasons to worry about the future of the relationship are based on the uk political and economic landscape that the new administration encounters as it takes office as the spectator commented in an editorial this week glimpse into the national psyche of britain in the winter of 2009would find british public and leadership shaken by the extraordinarily difficult times economic uncertainty and widespread hardship ahead that has clearly translated into british fear that the uk at this point in time has little to offer new administration in washington uk politicians and foreign policy commentators point to perfect storm of factors now in play that may make the special relationship less special from the weakness of prime minister browns own political standing and the crisis in the uk economy to fears that the us is frustrated with the uk militarys perceived failures in afghanistan and iraq there is also widespread suspicion that washington has become infatuated with french president sarkozy and his proamerican views 6 cnf michael fabricant tory mp and strong supporter of close us alliance summed up these fears when he told poloff that the uks economic situation reminds the british that britain needs the us more than ever to work with us to get out of this but i fear we seem more like iceland to the new administration right now than any other european capital because our downturn is so bad and the brown government so weak the economic downturn also means that the uk may not be able to provide the financial resources be it for development or new peacekeeping operations ref that washington has often looked to london to provide this has sparked concern that the uk will be viewed as less valuable an ally than it was when overflowing government coffers and strong british pound allowed the blair and brown governments to lead the way in pledges of international aid and other support to global hot spots and the economic weakness of the british economy is matched by the domestic political weakness of the brown government which trails in the polls and must hold an election later than may 2010 the chatham house director posed question at recent seminar that several interlocutors have also raised with embassy staff do the political realities in paris and london argue for the new administration building bridges to sarkozy rather than relying on weak british government that may be out the door soon us criticisms of uk military sting as well 7 cnf also sparking concern on this side of the atlantic are perceived us criticisms of the value of the uk military contributions in afghanistan and iraq especially at time when the new administration will be looking for allies to contribute more in afghanistan brooks newmark tory mp who follows defense issues told poloff he fears an erosion in uk public support for continued engagement in afghanistan because of the criticism of our troops from us military commanders and others in washington which newmark believes will also drive wedge between the administration and downing street this sensitivity over perceived us criticism of the value of the uk militarys contributions reverberates in the uk media which frequently quotes unnamed us military officers dismissals of the uk militarys performance in iraq and afghanistan leading daily telegraph columnist wrote that president obama will want the uk to provide more troops to afghanistan but that following browns abandonment of his american allies in basra there is london 00000348 003 of 004 growing feeling in the us especially in the pentagon that britain cant be relied on matter how many additional troops it may offer looking for signals and reading tea leaves 8 cnf british media and contacts are busy overreading perceived signals for evidence of tensions in the relationship this overreading would often be humorous if it were not so corrosive much was made in the british press and even by serious hmg officials of the fact that the new presidents inauguration speech mentioned the uk only in the context of the british enemy harrying george washingtons troops although some noted that was one more mention than the uk got in candidate obamas 7000word essay setting out his foreign policy intentions which did not mention the uk at all and secretary clintons statement before the senate foreign relations committee was similarly parsed and much was made of the fact that the uk was fourth in recitation of us allies and it was particularly painful to those british tea readers that germany and france were named first similarly the fate of bust of churchill in the oval office during president bushs tenure has been closely monitored in the uk media and by our hmg contacts very few of whom failed to sinister meaning into the decision to remove the bust which was on loan to the white house and removed for that reason even the press coverage of foreign secretary milibands meeting with secretary clinton though positive reflected the british paranoia and close reading of any supposed tea leaves on the special relationship the guardian for example told its readers that when uk leader visits washington he or she must mention the special relationship but american leaders anxious to avoid upsetting other allies steer away from referring to the special relationship and speak instead of special relationship at least until secretary clinton showed her inexperience and in her final remarks uttered the words the special relationship at her press event with david miliband does downing street share these concerns 9 cnf downing street and senior levels in whitehall never shared this level of anxiety about the future of the relationship under an obama administration the presidents january 26 phone call to prime minister brown in which the president told the prime minister he looked forward to continuing and strengthening the special relationship helped quell any concerns about londons place in the hierarchy of us allies the prime ministers office made sure it was released to the uk press that brown was the first european leader to speak with the new president following his inauguration the us officer at the cabinet office told us that both the fact of the call and the tone of the conversation was reassuring and he downplayed any concern about the relationship at least inside the cabinet office similarly foreign secretary milibands february 3 meeting with secretary clinton which uk media and foreign office contacts all carefully noted was the secretarys first meeting with foreign minister sparked positive coverage and appeared to reassure many british observers clinton praises special relationship miliband first to meet new us secretary of state was typical of the headlines that followed the meeting 10 cnf despite these clear signals from the new administration the strength of the special relationship still has traction for the uk media and political class some in the uk used the binyam mohamed case this past week in which uk high court ruled against making us classified information available to uk lawyers representing guantanamo bay detainee as test of the obama administrations commitment to new approach to fighting terrorism and to the special relationship with leading tory politician charging for example that denying evidence to uk court of law in this case raises doubts about the existence of the socalled special relationship with washington british irritation with the original buy american language in the us stimulus legislation which the uk media spun as test of the obama administrations commitment to free trade agreements with its european allies is also an example of how elements in britain still look for signs of distance between london and washington there is also still palpable concern among our parliamentary and fco contacts that although there are many areas where the brown governments priorities track us policies under the new administration the high expectations in britain about new london 00000348 004 of 004 golden age of bilateral cooperation are themselves potential threat to the relationship john spellar senior labour mp and government whip summed this up at the moment theres unrealistic euphoria towards the new presidentmps are forgetting that ultimately presidents have to behave in certain way some of us are destined to be disappointed by him policywiseon the other hand the people who really matter in all this those who do the serious business know that where it matters over defense security issues intelligencesharing the relationship is deep ongoing and abiding comment those who know the relationship know its strength 11 cnf though tempting to argue that keeping hmg off balance about its current standing with us might make london more willing to respond favorably when pressed for assistance in the long run it is not in us interests to have the uk public concluding the relationship is weakening on either side the uks commitment of resources financial military diplomatic in support of us global priorities remains unparalleled uk public confident that the usg values those contributions and our relationship matters to us national security this is theme embassy london stresses privately and publicly to reassure the public and hmg as new administration officials begin their working relationships with uk counterparts and introduce themselves to the uk public through media and conference events it is theme we recommend they highlight as well visit londons classified website httpwwwintelinksgovgovwikiportalunit
