6307c10 shspec282 auditing skills for r3r some of the material in this tape is also to be found in hcob 9jul63 technical summary the required skills of processing and why we have the exact number of skills necessary to make an ot unfortunately they are not simple and they are numerous but they break down to about five skills which must be perfect they are 1 the ability to follow an auditing cycle 2 the ability to give it repetitively 3 the ability to read meter very well 4 the ability to read understand and follow the procedure of bulletin 5 the ability to get and keep pc in session any time an auditor cannot handle an upperlevel procedure it is because of the fact that he cannot do one of these five basic things as an auditing supervisor knowing this will enable you to get auditing done if the auditor cannot get results with process it is one of these skills not the process is awry amount of persuasion will overcome the lack of one of these skills you like to think that you are up against case level in training an auditor low case level does make it harder to teach some people but if you make that criterion of whether you can train someone you will lose there is case requirement for training you mustnt q and with the i cant of someone if you make him do it you make him right not wrong to agree with the i cant is q and aing with his aberration the d of t must never be permitted to refuse student because getting into the practice of doing so leads to limiting who can be trained to the point where auditing gets done when the instructor says yes you cant the instructor is invalidating the reactive mind and the students ability to audit deteriorates rapidly it takes some people little longer to get towards those basics and just do them but if you keep at it they will get there complex technology like r3r will show up the weak points in any of your five basics for instance given what you are handling in r3r if you q and you get major bad reactions 2 and occurs when the auditor doesnt make his intention stick in the session he tends to become the effect of the pc the level of error is always stupidly elementary and has nothing to do with what process you are running or how complicated that is r3n and r3r look very complicated they have lot of steps and lots of doingness but if you can do the basics of auditing you will have trouble it is fantastic to have process that runs engrams by rote all that can give you real trouble in r3r is wrong date and wrong duration which can result from faulty meter reading or faulty dating procedure it is difficult for an expert meter reader to get dates and durations of engrams if the auditor cant read the meter well wrong date doesnt mean minor wrongness it is something grossly wrong which rapidly snarls up the time track wrong date produces bypassed charge and grouped track the bpc is fantastic if person has his attention on date or something it will tick once on the meter even if it isnt the right date hence you can q and you might say that dubin case is just someone who has his dates mixed up you could probably cure dubin by accurate dating nothing drives the pc battier than to have wrong duration say the incident is really trillion years long and you give him duration of two days the pc tries in vain to find the beginning of the incident he cant because he is looking at something that happened two days before so it stays all black and gruesome when you get that phenomenon you reduration the incident what made r3r workable is that pc has perception on any incident that is properly dated and durationed that is where perceptics lie there are only three reasons for perception 1 wrong date 2 wrong duration 3 it has gpm in it wrong assessment and overrun chain already flat give you ta but not necessarily perception the incident can get obscured if it has gpm in it because black energy goes up and obscures the engram this was caused by the pcs protest in the incident when lights go off in an incident look for gpm if that happens you have to get the pc to straighten out the gpm by taking him to the first pair of items in it get the motion out pick up another pair of items get the ta motion off that pair etc just clean it up rapidly then run it as an engram it is never very long or very difficult to run there is point where r3r and r3n cross start the case on r3r and pick up any implants that turned up while running r3r check for an implant on the duration step if you get onto the helatrobus implant clean them up get the first pair of items and discharge them with rocket reads etc then go back to r3r use r3n as the adjunct it is there are some technical details that you have to know these include 1 how to assess an arc break 2 what lists one should use 3 ability to do an accurate and thorough l and n to complete but not overlisted list the source of arc breaks on lists is incompleteness of lists you can however assess prepared arbitrary list without fear of having the incomplete list phenomena turn on because the pc never started the list so it isnt complete but in regular list in order to get the items you do have to be able to do l and n which includes metering if you are having trouble with r3r be sure that your difficulties do not stem from troubles with getting in ruds or say writing while watching the meter learn to audit by fundamentals and you will have trouble with procedure that just combines the fundamentals your main danger as an auditor is being too complicated recognize that the simplicities of the game are what make it hang together and work wrong date and wrong duration are the only things that give you trouble wrong assessment is very junior and generally just gives you ta because wrong date and wrong duration are such lies it is difficult for the pc to asis them and what happens to the track when you move to wrong date it is very hard to get the right date and duration to read even when the pc is in session and you are on the right chain date is easier than duration because the beginning of the incident is so hard for pcs to see especially at the beginning one source of wrong assessment is overrun when you try to go earlier than basic case levels 5 6 and 7 see pp 414415 above all have channel through the bank on which the pc has reality where he can be run on engrams without dubin using r3r so if you find that channel and run the pc in it the pc wins and can go on up
