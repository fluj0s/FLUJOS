or mentally incapab of taking care of themself who has lived with the taxpayer for more than onehalf of the tax year the new rules remove the pre 2005 requirement for the dependent care tax cred it that the taxpayer maintain household in which the qualifying individual lives other tax provisions in addition to the changes for the above tax provisions used by families technical amendments were made to number of tax provisions to conform them to the new defin itions in the personal exemption the joint committee on taxation estimated that the changes made by the new law for more uniform definition of child will result in revenue loss of 942 million over the fy2005fy2009 period1 current issues on february 6 2006 the natio nal association of enrolled agents sent letter to the commissioner of the internal revenue service expressing concern about ambigu ities and uncerta inties with respect to the definition of child in certain cases2 the letter outlined through examples specific taxpayer circumstances in which literal interpretation of the new definition could lead to unintended consequences that may be contrary to the intent of the law for the new definition of child one of the examples cited is that of married couple with two children aged 14 and 22 living at home with an adjusted gross income agi of 400000 on their joint tax return the couples 22yearold child is not student and has 15000 year in wage income the older child can not be claime d as dependent by the couple under prior law and must file his own tax retu rn under prior law the minor child 14 would be claimed as dependent by the couple on their joint tax return but because of the couples agi level the personal exemption for the child w ould be phased out they would be receive tax benefit and the child tax credit would not be available to them the association notes that under current law with the new defi nition the minor child 14 could be the qualifying child of the older child 22 enabling the older child to claim personal exemption for the minor child the child credit and earned income credit resulting in significant tax refund the administration as part of its fy2007 budg et proposed two clarifications to the definition of child 1 that taxpayer c ould not be the qualifying child of another individual if the taxpayer is older than the individual and 2 if parent resides with child for over half of the tax year only the parent would claim the child as qualifying child the administration estimates that thes clarifications would raise 11 billion over the fy2007fy2011 period
