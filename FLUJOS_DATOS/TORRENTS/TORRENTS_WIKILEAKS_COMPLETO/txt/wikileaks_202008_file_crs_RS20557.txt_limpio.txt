specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division summary programs for implementing networkcentric warfare ncw in the navy include the cooperative engagement capability cec and naval integrated fire control counter air nifcca systems the it21 program and forcenet related program is the navymarine corps intranet nmci congress has expressed concern for some of these programs particularly nmci this report will be updated as events warrant networkcentric warfare networkcentric warfare ncw also known as networkcentric operations nco is key element of defense transformation ncw focuses on using computers high speed data links and networking software to link military personnel platforms and formations into highly integrated local and widearea networks within these networks personnel are to share large amounts of information on rapid and continuous basis the department of defense dod and the navy view ncw as key element of defense transformation that will dramatically improve combat capability and efficiency1 examples of navy ncw programs cec and nifcca the cooperative engagement capability cec system links navy ships and aircraft operating in particular area into single integrated air defense network in which radar data collected by each platform is transmitted on real time ie instantaneous basis to the other units in the network units in the network share common composite realtime airdefense picture cec will permit ship to 1 for more on ncw see crs report rl32411 network centric warfare background and oversight issues for congress by

transformation background and issues for congress both by ronald orourke crs2 shoot airdefense missiles at incoming antiship missiles that the ship itself cannot see using radar targeting data gathered by other units in the network it will also permit air defense missiles fired by one ship to be guided by other ships or aircraft the navy wants to install the system on aircraft carriers aegisequipped cruisers and destroyers selected amphibious ships and e2c hawkeye carrierbased airborne early warning aircraft over the next several years the system has potential for being extended to include army and air force systems tests of cec aboard navy ships in 1998 revealed significant interoperability ie compatibility problems between cecs software and the software of the airdefense systems on some ships in response the navy undertook major effort to identify understand and fix the problems the cec system with the new fixes passed its technical evaluation techeval testing in february and march 2001 and final operational evaluation opeval testing in april and may 2001 in 2002 the primary cec contractor raytheon faced potential competition from two firms lockheed and small firm called solipsys for developing the next version of cec called cec block ii solipsys had devised an alternative technical approach to cec called the tactical component network tcn solipsys entered into teaming arrangement with lockheed to offer tcn to the navy as the technical approach for block ii in latedecember 2002 raytheon announced that it had agreed to purchase solipsys in earlyfebruary 2003 raytheon and lockheed announced that they had formed team to compete for the development of block ii some observers expressed concern that these developments would reduce the navys ability to use competition in its acquisition strategy for block ii as an apparent means of preserving competition the navy in mid2003 announced that it would incorporate openarchitecture standards into block ii divide the block ii development effort into series of smaller contracts for which various firms might be able to submit bids in december 2003 however the navy canceled plans for developing block ii in favor of new plan for developing joint service successor to block i the conference report hrept 108283 page 290 on the fy2004 defense appropriations act hr 2658pl 10887 directed the navy to keep the appropriations committees informed on potential changes to the cec block ii acquisition strategy and stated that if the navy adopts new acquisition strategy the additional funds provided in this act for cec block 2 may be merged with and be available for purposes similar to the purposes for which appropriated the house and senate armed services committees in their reports hrept 10989 page 178 and srept 10969 pages 108 109 respectively on the fy2006 defense authorization bill hr 1815s 1042 expressed satisfaction with the navys efforts to improve interoperability between the cec system and other combat direction systems and ended requirement established in the conference report hrept 105736 on the fy1999 defense authorization act pl 105261 for the navy to report to congress on these efforts on quarterly basis the naval integrated fire controlcounter air nifcca system is to combine the cec system with the e2d advanced hawkeye carrierbased airborne radar and control system awacs aircraft and the sm6 version of the shipbased standard air defense missile both now in development to expand the navys networked airdefense capabilities out to the full range of the sm6 missile among other things nifcca will enable navy forces at sea to provide overland defense against enemy cruise missiles crs3 current navy plans call for nifcca to be partially deployed in fy2011 and fully deployed in 20142 it21 it21 which stands for information technology for the 21st century is the navys investment strategy for procuring the desktop computers data links and networking software needed to establish an intranet for transmitting tactical and administrative data within and between navy ships the it21 network uses commercial offtheshelf cots desktop computers and networking software that provide multimedia organizational intranet the navy believes it21 will improve us naval warfighting capability and achieve substantial cost reductions by significantly reducing the time and number of people required to carry out various tactical and administrative functions fy2008 funding requested for it21 continues to provide integrated shipboard network systems increment 1 procurement and installation to achieve full operational capability foc for all platforms by fy20113 forcenet forcenet is the navys overall approach for linking various networks that contribute to naval ncw into single capstone information network for us naval forces the navy has highlighted forcenet as being at the center of sea power 21 the navys vision statement for the future the navy states that undersea forcenet satellite communications satcom fy2008 funding provides the internet protocol ip connectivity between antisubmarine warfare asw platforms to conduct collaborative asw connecting the platforms for collaborative asw enables sharing of time critical queuing classification and targeting data provides means for precluding blueonblue engagement and ensures rapid positioning of asw platforms into the best attack posture to prosecute the threat submarine4 some observers have criticized forcenet for being insufficiently defined5 the naval network warfare command issued functional concept document for forcenet in february 2005 but navy officials acknowledged at the time that the concept was not yet adequately defined and stated that an improved version of the document would be published in 20066 the conference report hrept 107732 on the fy2003 defense appropriations bill hr 5010pl 107248 expressed concern about the lack of specificity and 2 for discussions of nifcca see amy klamper fire

page 156 on the fy2004 defense appropriations bill s 1382 expressed support for the forcenet program but also said it is concerned that requirements have been approved or implemented and that there is duplication of effort especially in the areas of experimentation and demonstrations the committee directs that the forcenet program establish these requirements test them within the navy warfighting experimentations and demonstrations line pe0603758n and release the approved requirements changes as quickly as possible nmci significant program related to ncw is the navymarine corps intranet nmci which is corporatestyle intranet linking more than 300 navy and marine corps shore installations nmci is to include total 344000 computer work stations or seats as of january 2006 the navy had ordered 341000 seats and fully implemented about 264000 the navy planned to achieve steadystate operation of all nmci seats during fy2007 in october 2000 the navy awarded an industry team led by electronic data systems eds corporation an 69billion fiveyear contract for installing supporting and periodically upgrading the nmci in october 2002 congress through pl 107254 authorized twoyear extension to this contract which is now worth 89 billion congress has closely followed the program for several years the nmci implementation effort has experienced number of challenges and delays 2005 report from dods weaponstesting office identified problems found with the program in 20037 on september 30 2004 the navy and eds restructured the terms of the nmci contract to consolidate the number of performance measures and focus on measuring results rather than implementation steps user reaction to the system reportedly has been mixed8 december 2006 government accountability office gao report on nmci stated nmci has not met its two strategic goals to provide information superiority and to foster innovation via interoperability and shared services navy developed performance plan in 2000 to measure and report progress towards these goals but did not implement it because the program was more focused on deploying seats and measuring contractor performance against contractually specified incentives than determining whether the strategic mission outcomes used to justify the program were met gaos analysis of available performance data however showed that the navy had met only 3 of 20 performance targets 15 percent associated with the programs goals and nine related performance categories by not implementing its performance plan the navy has invested and risks continuing to invest heavily in program that is not subject to effective performance management and has yet to produce expected results 7 jason ma dote report identifies nmci problem areas found during 2003 test inside the navy feb 7 2005 8 navy marine corps intranet public affairs eight percent of customers surveyed satisfied with nmci navy newsstand mar 6 2007 john hoellwarth after five years nmci still frustrates

navy mar 20 2006 crs5 gaos analysis also showed that the contractors satisfaction of nmci service level agreements contractually specified performance expectations has been mixed since september 2004 while significant percentage of agreements have been met for all types of seats others have not consistently been met and still others have generally not been met navy measurement of agreement satisfaction shows that performance needed to receive contractual incentive payments for the most recent 5month period was attained for about 55 to 59 percent of all eligible seats which represents significant drop from the previous 9month period gaos analysis and the navys measurement of agreement satisfaction illustrate the need for effective performance management to include examining agreement satisfaction from multiple perspectives to target needed corrective actions and program changes gao analysis further showed that nmcis three customer groups end users commanders and network operators vary in their satisfaction with the program more specifically end user satisfaction surveys indicated that the percent of end users that met the navys definition of satisfied user has remained consistently below the target of 85 percent latest survey results categorize 74 percent as satisfied given that the navys definition of the term satisfied includes many marginally satisfied and arguably somewhat dissatisfied users this percentage represents the best case depiction of end user satisfaction survey responses from the other two customer groups show that both were not satisfied gao interviews with customers at shipyards and air depots also revealed dissatisfaction with nmci without satisfied customers the navy will be challenged in meeting program goals to improve customer satisfaction the navy identified various initiatives that it described as completed under way or planned however the initiatives are not being guided by documented plans thus limiting their potential effectiveness this means that after investing about 6 years and 37 billion nmci has yet to meet expectations and whether it will is still unclear9 department of defense officials conceded problems with the implementation of nmci at march 28 2007 hearing before the terrorism and unconventional threats and capabilities subcommittee of the house armed services committee10 issues for congress potential issues for congress include the following is the navys implementation of nmci adequate to what degree is the system achieving its goals does the navy have clear and adequate
