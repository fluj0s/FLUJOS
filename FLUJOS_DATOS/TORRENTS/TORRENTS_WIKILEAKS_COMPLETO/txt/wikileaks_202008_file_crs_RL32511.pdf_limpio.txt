significant reduction in the cost of covered products to the american consumer step secretary has been willing to take fda has argued that it is impossible to monitor the millions of transactions and guarantee that these drugs would be safe meanwhile some states and municipalities looking at ways to contro l their expenditures for prescription drugs have created websites to direct us consum ers to

prescription dr ugs often cost less abroad particularly for the uninsured and many of the derly who pay retail prices4 under current law only the manufacturer of prescription drug may legally bring it into the united states the law allows us pharmacists and wholesalers to do so only if the secretary of health and human services hhs first certifies that those drugs would be safe and that th program

not have the information necessary to show chain of custody for that reason wh fda published final regulations to implement this section of the pdma in december 1999 the small business administration petitioned the agency arguing that enforcement of the provision would drive 4000 or more secondary distri butors out of business subsequently fda delayed the effective date of this provisions

tommy g thompson declined to implement the law as well stating that to import drugs under the meds act would make it impossible to adequately guarantee the safety of prescription drugs24 moreover the secretary argued that the costs associated with the documenting sampling and testing of imported drugs as the statute required would make it very di fficult for consumers to recognize any noticeable

headache time magazine feb 2 2004most recently by about 7029 this was consistent with the canadian pharmaceutical pricing boards 67 finding30 the differentials between canadian and us retail prices are much less for generic drugs31 and not surprisingly they constitute only small portion of what individuals impor t to the united states from canada32 advocates for legalizing drug imports including many members of congress feel that us consumers have shouldered the rising cost of prescription drugs for too long this is unfair they say particular ly for consumers who lack health insurance and are forced to pay higher retail prices at pharmacies while consumers in other countries especially those with nationa l health plans have access to the same pharmaceutical products at much lower prices consumer dissatisfaction is magnified they argue because some of th drugs were developed through research supported by us taxpayers if foreign suppliers offer fdaapproved pharmaceuticals at prices significantly lowe r than in this country advocates insist that consumers pharmacists and wholesaler s must have safe viable and legal way to import these drugs33 drug import volume growing internet

successfully offered the drug importation provisions as an amendment to the federal trade commission reauthorization bill s 1392 pproved by the senate commerce science and transportation committee but there was further action on that bill52 all the bills seek to balance the availa bility of imported prescription drugs for both commercial and pe rsonal use with the assurance that those imports would be safe and effective the underlying goal is to reduce or restrain the growth of the financial burden that prescription drugs pl ace on us consumers they all would act primarily by replacing or am ending section 804 of the ffd ca striking difference between these bills and current law is their elimination of the provision that has so far been the chief obstacle to imports hhs secretary certificati ons about risk and cost throughout the following discussion of issues this report refers to provisions in these bills issues for congressional consideration an individual imports drug for pers onal use pharmacist or wholesaler imports drug for commercial use ma nufacturer imports one of its own drugs each of these situations involves two issu that are at the heart of congressional debate can we ensure that imported drug s and how they would be used would be safe and effective and if congress chooses to proceed how could it craft an administratively feasible statutory and regulatory drug import framework that results in us consumers gaining access to lower priced prescription drugs drug safety and effectiveness health concerns summarized as safety and effectiveness focus on two domains the first is product integrity is the produc t what the seller purports it to be the second is appropriate use does this i ndividual need this drug at this time product integrity

overseas manufacturing fda could not guarantee the integrity of each shipment particularly those th at arrive by mail as th volume of imported drugs has greatly increased in recent years some commentators have cautioned that inspectors who cannot closely examine each and ever package will find it more and more difficult to keep counterfeit pharmaceuticals out of the country especially if they look exactly like fdaapproved drugs nd appear to comply with all us regulations while less concerned with drugs obtained from canadian pharmacies they worry that some counterfeit drugs produced elsewhere could be shipped to canada and then on to us consumers aside from such intentional acts fda is concerned with actions that might inadvertently affect the safety and effectiv eness of imported drugs it cautions that the labeling of some drugs may not be in english or otherwise lack adequate directions for use not ve been packaged and stor ed under conditions appropriate to prevent degradation or not have b een made under current good manufacturing practices all related to requirements for fdaapproved products if the drugs are subpotent or ineffective patients may suffer complications from the illnesses that their prescriptions were intended to tr eat without ever knowing the true cause53 although each of these circum stances could adversely affect us consumer the fda has or could be given options with which to address many of these threats that are less drastic than total ban on dr ug importation it c ould define and require appropriate labeling in english it could set certification standard it could enforce the laws requirement that pr escription drugs require prescriptions adding that the prescriber must be licensed in the united states and it could encourage anticounterfeiting technology or increase bor der and mail inspections the expense of these activities however would diminish the apparent price differential between us and foreigndispensed drugs to what degree is matter of debate all this raises the question to ensure the safety and effectiveness of drugs sold to us consumers how can the congre ss and fda decide which drugs could be eligible for import drug eligibility and f daapproval status most proposals would require that the drugs be fdaapproved meaning that they have gone through the rigorous fdarequired and substantiate d process of safety and ffectiveness testing and are therefore approved by the fda for sale in the united states these bills would prohibit the importation of biologics and controlled substances imported pharmaceuticals that do not meet these us standards and are not manufactured under fda regulatory oversight would be considered unapprove d drugs and could not be imported legally current law

require supplemental application to fda and whether fda would re quire that the appli cation be processed before the drug could be marketed the greggbradley bills require that imported drugs be

distribution system some have characterized this as twotiered system implying an actual or perceived difference in quality permitted countries with product integrity in mind legislators could look to

deemed illegal current law requires that the importer or manufacturer certify that the drug is fdaapproved properly labe led not adulterated nd not misbranded provide laboratory records of

the importer certify that the drug is fdaapproved and pr ovide laboratory records of authenticity testing if the drugs were not in count erfeitproof packaging the greggbradley and dorganemerson bills approach this differently rather than call for laboratory testing of drug sample s they start with the assertion that the fdaapproved manufactured pr oduct has passed inspection as safe and effective

adverse financial impact of legal importation for example companies may export drugs that have different nonpharmacologic characteristics eg color size shape or dosages than the fdaapproved counterpart product in tended for retail distribution in the united states because these exported products would literally ppear different from their fdaapproved domestic counterparts they would be d

us distribution could serve in addition to addressing safety to in fluence industry decisions corporate investment other concerns have been that the larger manufacturers might curtail thei r investments in research and development industry spokespeople have not sought to allay those fears stating for example it is widely understood that these policies will limit patient choices and stifle the incentives for research and development of the innovative medicines patients need to treat diseases like alzheimers diabetes heart ailments and cancers87 some economists point out that while substantial lost income would lead to lower investment the tipping point is unknown and difficult to estimate because industry data and in ternal discussions are not public one approach to alter

reflects buyers sensitivity to price something manufactur ers may include in pricing decisions108 congressional options for controlling drug costs clearly the high cost of prescripti on drugs affects the purchasing power of individual consumers and public and private entities also the trend is toward the development of evermore sophisticated dr ugs with complex dosing schedules and intense
