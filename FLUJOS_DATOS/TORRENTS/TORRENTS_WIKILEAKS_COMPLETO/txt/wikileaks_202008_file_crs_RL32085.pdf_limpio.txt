1975 most notably the education of the handicapped act eha pl 94142 t he education for all handicapped children act of 1975 substantially amended the eha cr eating the essential structure and principles of federal assistance to special education that are still reflected in current law in 1990 the name of the act was changed to the individuals with disabilities education act by pl 101 476 congress made extensive amendments to idea in 1997 pl 10517 and again in 2004 pl 108446 however the basic characte ristics of the act resemble those first enacted in 1975 12 in 1975 when the act was originally enacted congress established the goal of providing up to 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure to assist states and local educational agencies with the excess costs of educating students with disabilities hrept 10877 p 93 13 beginning in fy1999 certain amounts have been excluded from appropriations for the purposes of calculating percentages of appe from fy1999 to fy20 04 these amounts were designated for evaluations and studies for fy2005 and succeeding fiscal years these amounts are designated for techni cal assistance to the statesfull funding of idea actual and proposed part b grantstost ates funding and state grant amounts are often discussed in term s of 1excess costs 2 author ization levels of funding and 3 maximum state grants each of these measures discussed below can be an indicator of the full funding of idea excess costs when congress enacted the predecessor legislation to idea11 in 1975 the available estimate of the cost of educating children with disabilities was on average twice the cost of educating other children determination was made that the federal government would pay some proportion of this additiona l or excess cost the metric for determining this excess co st was the national average perpupil expenditure appe the final determinati on was that the federal government would pay up to 40 of this excess cost12 although appropriations for idea part b grants to states have increased significantly over the last decade funding still falls short of the amount that would be necessary to pr ovide 40 of appe ie 40 of excess cost one measure of idea full funding table 3 shows estimated percentages of excess cost since fy1995 this percentage shown in column six is obtai ned by dividing the dollars available per child with disability column 4 by the appe column five the amount available per child with disability was obtained by dividing the appropriation for the part b grantstostatesprogram column 2 by the number of children with disabilities column 313 the fy2008 appropriated amount accounts for 172 of the estimated excess cost and the fy2009 budget request would account for 171 of estimated excess cost for fy2008 the estimated amount needed to reach 40 of average perpupil expenditure appe is 255 billi on the product of 40 of the number of children with disabilities and the appe the fy2008 appropriation of 109 billion is well below this amount httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32085crs7 note that any increase in appropriations does not necessarily mean an increase in the percentage of appe for exam ple the fy2007 appropriation increase by 200 million over the fy2006 amount yet the per centage of appe declined from 177 to 171 this resulted because the grow th rates of the number of children with
