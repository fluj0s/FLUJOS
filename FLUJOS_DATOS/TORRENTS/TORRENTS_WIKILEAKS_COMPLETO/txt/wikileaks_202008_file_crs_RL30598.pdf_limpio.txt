when the armies of ethiopia and eritrea clashed on their common border in may 1998 despite generall close ties stemming from historical links and the personal relationship betw een eritrean president isaias afwerki and ethiopias meles zenawi relations between the two countries began to deteriorate after eritrea launched its own currency in late 1997 and ethiopia responded by insisting that all

other parts of the common border by june 1998 after both sides launched air attacks on cities the conflict ceased to be solely border dispute it became war of honor and settling of scores especially

1995 the ruling eprdf won 95 percent of the votes in both regional and national elections the elections were boycotted by most oppo sition groups in part because the gover nment refused to renegotiate the constitution and form caretaker government following the elections the ruling eprdf appointed meles zenawi prime minister and negasso gidada an alliance member assumed the ceremonial position of

eritrean security forces did illtreat some ethiopians but there was evidence of systematic policy of deliberate expulsions or widespread illtreatment ethiopia had halted use of the port at assab eritrea where many of the ethiopians had been employed ethiopia justified the expulsions on security grounds and has responded to ais criticism in detailed report in august 19994despite continued efforts and calls for ceasefire by the oau the united states and the united nations ethiopia had rejected ceasefire without explicit eritrean commitment to withdraw from the disputed areas events in ethiopia and eritrea have undercut the african renaissance pursued by the clinton administration and others particularly during president clintons trip to africa in the spring of 1998 the leaders of

with the help of mediators the united states and rwandan governments led intensive peace negotiations but failed to persuade eritrean authorities to accept proposed peace plan in mid1998 eritrean officials insist that they had not rejected the proposal although president isaias criticized the us for believing in quick fix the conflict escalated in early june 1998 with fighting on three fronts and air strikes by both sides president clinton brokered moratorium on air strikes in june 1998 and the conflict consisted mainly of occasional artillery exchanges until february 1999 when ethiopia launched major ground offensive the agreement on the air moratorium was breached when ethiopia used its planes to attack eritrean positions ethiopian forces were able to eject eritrean troops from the disputed badme area in this campaign after weeks of intense fighting the oau peace proposal in late 1998 the organization of african unity oau presented an 11point plan calling for the withdrawal of eritrean troops from badme to positions held before may 6 1998 and demilitarization of the borders in late 1998 ethiopia accepted the oau plan while eritrea requested clarification on some points after ethiopian forces ejected eritrean troops from the disputed badme area the government of eritrea accepted the proposed oau peace plan framework agreement ethiopia however rejected eritreas acceptance of the oau plan arguing that eritrean forces must withdraw from all disputed areas first ethiopia argued that the oau peace plan calls for eritrean forces to withdraw from all disputed areas while eritrea maintained that the plan only demands the withdrawal of its forces from badme the oau peace plan was vague on this issue the plan called for the withdrawal of eritrean force from badme and its environs in its response to eritreas clarification request the oau agreed with eritreas interpretation of badme and the environs however the oau failed to respond to letter sent by the government of ethiop ia in which ethiopia argued that its understanding of badme and the environs includes all areas occupied after may 6 1998 subsequently both sides accepted the oau framework and clarifications offered by the mediators in july 1999 at the 35th oau summit in algeria both ethiopia and eritrea accepted the modalities for the implementation of the oau framework agreement the modalities companion document to the framework agreement call for cessation of hostilities withdrawal of eritrean troops from areas controlled after may 6 1998 and for ethiopian withdrawal from territories taken after february 1999 the document also commits the parties to sign formal ceasefire agreement and deployment of oau and military observers the modalities like the framework agreement

trips to the two countries by former national security adviser anthony lake but lakes efforts and those of the oau have encountered series of obstacles over the past year in testimony before the house africa subcommittee in may 1999 assistant secretary of state for african affairs susan rice stated that the united states has significant interests in ending the war between ethiopia and eritrea as soon as possible the current conflict threatens regional stability and threatens to reverse progress made by ethiopia and eritrea in economic and political development some observers have criticized the clinton administration for not doing enough to take the lead in the peace process they also criticized the administration for not pushing an arms embargo early in the conflict5 us officials argue that the administratio n has been actively engaged in efforts to broker peace from the beginning they also stress that president clinton brokered the air war moratorium between ethiopia and eritrea in june 1998 and has engaged both sides personally on number of occasions in may 1999 the house africa subcommittee held hearing on the ethiopia eritrea conflict members of congress questioned the assistant secretary of state for africa susan rice about the us role in the peace process and encouraged the adm inistration to intensify its engagement in the process in october 1999 the house of representatives passed hconres 46 the resolution commended us and oau peace efforts and called on the united nations human rights commission to investigate human rights abuses in connection with the forced detentions deportations and displacements of populations caused by the conflict obstacles to the peace process in august 1999 the oau with the assistance of the united states came out with another document called technical arrangements eritrea accepted the document while ethiopia rejected it arguing it was inconsistent with the two documents the framework agreement and the modalities areas of claimed inconsistency include the role of the neutral commission as stipulated in the technical arrangements the omission of reference in the technical arrangements to colonial treaties and applicable law for demarcation and delimitation process the timing for the redeployment of eritrean troops the role and responsibilities of the civilian administration and militia to be restored after eritrean withdrawal from areas occupied after may 1998 and the role of the united nations in peacekeeping eritrea had requested earlier that the parties sign the framework agreement and the modalities ahead of the final document ethiopia argued that the signing of the agreements should be done after final agreement was reached the oau mediators initially favored the signing of the two documents

discussions to urge ethiopias acceptance of the technical arrangements faced with the prospect of resumption of the war and unable to move the process forward the mediators opened the technical arrangements for discussion with ethiopia in violation of their own rule that the document be considered as non negotiable opening up the technical arrangements for clarifications and amendments secured ethiopias acceptance of the technical arrangements in principle eritrea on the other hand felt that the mediators had violated their own guidelines by opening up the document and also had kept eritrea in the dark about the negotiations with ethiopia in late april 2000 the parties met in algiers for proximity talks to finalize consolidated technical arrangements proposal the objective of the proxim ity talks was to merge the original eritreanendorsed technical arrangements and the amended version of the document reflected in nonpaper given to ethiopia the algiers proximity talks the talks in algiers ended after six days with breakthrough the eritrean delegation insisted that the parties sign the framework agree ment the modalities and ceasefire before proceeding to substantive talks on the consolidated technical arrangements the ethiopian delegation rejected eritreas demand and pressed for substantive talks without ceasefire agreement the mediators were unable to bridge the differences between the two parties united nations security council delegation headed by the us ambassador to the united nations richard holbrooke attempted to restart negotiations but was unsuccessful one day after the delegation left the region ethiopia launched major offensive and made significant gains within days7 on may 24 the oau made new proposal to end the fighting president abdelaziz bouteflika of algeria current chairman of the oau appealed to both sides to end hostilities and resume proximity talks the sevenpoint oau proposal was largely based on the oau framework agreement and the modalities for implementation the proposal called for an immediate redeployment of eritrean and ethiopian forces to positions held prior to may 6 1998 the oau plan requested eritrea to withdraw first and ethiopia to follow eritrea accepted the proposal while ethiopia insisted it would fight and talk at the same time on may 24 in the face of continued intense military pressure and in response to the oau proposal eritrean forces withdrew from the disputed area of zalambessa ethiopia declared victory but insisted that eritrean forces must also withdraw from other disputed areas in the eastern front several days later the united states confirmed that eritrea had withdrawn from all disputed territories and urged ethiopia to halt its offensive in

for cessation of hostilities the deployment of united nations peacekeeping force the establishment of military coordination commission to expedite the functions of the peacekeeping force and the redeployment of ethiopian forces to positions held prior to the conflict according to the peace agreement ethiopia is expected to redeploy its troops within two weeks after the deployment of the peacekeeping mission ethiopias demand for security zone has also been included in the peace package according to the oau peace plan eritrean forces shall remain at distance of 25 kilometers artillery range from positions to which ethiopian forces shall redeploy8 the military situation overview the armies of ethiopia and eritrea once staunch allies have been engaged in intermittent bloody conflict since the war first erupted in may 1998 there are accurate figures of casualties but many observers say that an estimated 50000 100000 were killed in the twoyear old war most of the casualties are believed to be ethiopians since eritrean forces had been fighting from well dugin trenches one knows for sure how many have been wounded but hundreds of thousands have been displaced as result of the border war on both sides after the conflict began both sides beefed up their forces by early 2000 ethiopia had an estimated 350000 troops while eritrea is believed to have deployed around 250000 both ethiopia and eritrea purchased sophisticated weapon systems including fighter planes from russia ukraine and eastern europe the once feared ethiopian air force which had been dismantled after the ouster of the mengistu regime in 1991 by the current government became major focus of the ethiopian government military strategy pilots and senior military officers who had been jailed by the current ethiopian government for alleged crimes committed during the mengistu era were released from prison to rebuild ethiopias air force and improve its military operations ethiopian forces were caught unprepared in may 1998 when eritrea used tanks and heavy weapons overwhelming ethiopias light defenses at the border within weeks eritrean forces were in control of areas previously administered by ethiopia including badme and zalambessa both ethiopia and eritrea had demobilized significant portion of their forces after the ouster of the mengistu government ethiopias demobilization by far surpassed that of eritreas both in proportion and number after demobilization eritreas forces were estimated at around 60000 with many more in reserve ethiopias demobilization included hundreds of thousands ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30598crs8 former mengistu soldiers restructuring of the air force retiring of the ethiopian navy and demobilizing of its eprdf forces the use of overwhelming force by eritrea in the may 1998 attack surprised ethiopian authorities who were unprepared psychologically and militarily to contain the eritrean advance by june 1998 the conflict spread to an air war in an effort to contain and punish eritrea ethiopia bombed asmara airport and other military targets while eritrea bombed mekele the capital of ethiopias tigray region the eritrean air force bombed school in mekele killing dozens of children and other civilians eritrea initially claimed it had bombed military installation but later admitted that it had bombed the school by mistake the bombing of the school was seen by ethiopian authorities as deliberate act by eritrea to terrorize the civilian population this belief led to hardening of positions within ethiopia and created broad base support for the war efforts against eritrea and many in ethiopia were erroneously led to believe that the bombing of asmara was in retaliation for the attack on mekele there were significant military engagements between june 1998 and early 1999 when both sides began to heavily recruit and shop for arms in february 1999 in the face of stalled peace talks ethiopia launched major offensive in the badme front within days ethiopia broke through eritrean defenses and captured the disputed badme area and penetrated inside eritrea the defeat led to an immediate acceptance of the oau peace plan by eritrea the acceptance of the framework agreement did not lead to major breakthrough in the peace process however instead ethiopia buoyed by its success in badme intensified its attack on the central front in zalambessa and tsorona eritrea reportedly inflicted huge casualties on ethiopian forces in the battle of tsorona causing ethiopia to halt its offensive the strategic thinking eritrean forces may have believed that as long as they fought defensive war from their well dugin trenches ethiopian forces would not succeed in driving them out of the disputed area by all accounts eritrean forces were prepared militarily and psychologically the defeat in badme had been put behind them with the subsequent victories in tsorona and zalambessa but the one thing eritreans were not prepared for and could not prepare for was the level of determination by ethiopia to win the war at any cost as witnessed in the battle of badme and tsorona ethiopian authorities were evidently prepared to lose tens of thousands of soldiers to dislodge eritrean forces from the disputed areas the reported human wave attack resulted in victory for the once humiliated ethiopian troops albeit at very high human cost ethiopia denies that it used human wave tactics another apparent miscalculation on the eritrean side was the belief that the other ethiopian nationalities would not come to support the tigreandomina ted government of prime minister meles zenawi ethiopians did rally behind the meles government albeit for varying reasons even opposition groups who are highly critical of meles threw their support to the government and rallied behind the flag with the notable exception of the oromo liberation front olf and other armed opposition groups the ethiopian diaspora provided much needed political financial and diplomatichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30598crs9 support ethiopia tried to undermine the eritrean government by providing support to eritrean opposition groups but this proved ineffective on may 12 2000 just days after united nations security council delegation left the horn of africa region ethiopia launched major offensive within days ethiopian forces dislodged eritrean troops in the western front penetrating deep inside eritrea in midmay ethiopian forces captured the strategic town of barentu in western eritrea and continued to press further west on may 23 ethiopia launched yet another major offensive in the central front of zalamb essa after two days of intense battle ethiopian forces defeated eritrean forces and captured the disputed town of zalambessa and made additional gains in other parts of eritrea on may 24 at midnight the government of eritrea accepted an oau proposal to withdraw from all disputed areas and cessation of hostilities but ethiopian forces continued with their offensive arguing that the war would stop only after ethiopia verified for itself that eritrea had withdrawn from all areas it occupied after may 6 1998 and after all of ethiopias military objectives are met the speed of the ethiopian advance was due to number of factors including the timing and location of the attack wellplanned operations and use of overwhelming force the ethiopian attack came just days ahead of scheduled national elections eritrean authorities did not anticipate that ethiopia would launch major offensive while in the midst of an election period and in the face of major humanitarian crisis in which an estimated 8 million people are in need of humanitarian aid second ethiopian forces did not attack as anticipated along the highly fortified trenches of the central front instead ethiopia attacked the western front where addis already had succeeded in defeating eritrean forces in february 1999 ethiopian forces were later able to defeat eritrean troops in the central front by using overwhelming force and surprise element many analysts expected the next ethiopian attack in areza strategic town located northeast of zalambessa ethiopian forces however bypassed areza and attacked zalambessa itself another contributing factor to ethiopias success was that eritrea never launched counter offensive but instead fought defensive war from its well dugin trenches eritrean authorities and military planners did not see any political or military advantage in going on the offensive which might have drawn ethiopian troops away from the attack militarily counter offensive would have meant leaving strategic high ground along the borders politically it would have meant invading undisputed ethiopian territory which could have proved costly in internatio nal public opinion moreover eritrean authorities may have expected an early negotiated settlement whereas such settlement for ethiopia would have meant accepting peace without reversing the humiliation it had suffered in the early battles the military setbacks for eritrea were in large part due to eritreas strategic conclusion that it could ill afford to confront much larger force head on instead eritrean authorities focused on protecting their material and human assets it was not uncommon to see eritreans abandon valuable positions during the liberation struggle in the face of overwhelming ethiopian forces but the rapid eritrean retreat in may raises number of questions concerning the state of the eritrean military some observ ers have questioned whether the new generation eritrean fighters lesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30598crs10 the liberation movements the eritrean liberation front elf was founded in the 1960s to fight for eritrean independence the eritrean peoples liberation front eplf splintered from the elf in the 1970s and eventually defeated the elf the tigray peoples liberation front tplf was founded in the early 1970s to fight for tigrean self determination and later to oust the mengistu regime the ethiopian peoples revolutionary democratic front eprdf was founded in the late 1980s by the tplf the eprdf consists of several ethnicbased groups although the tplf remains the dominant member of the allianceexperienced and only marginally comm itted to fight as compared to their predecessors who won the long armed struggle against successive ethiopian regimes contributing factors to the conflict many longtime observers were baffled when the conflic t between ethiopia and eritrea erupted in may 1998 and very few predicted that it would escalate so rapidly but signs of tensions were beginni ng to emerge by mid1990s despite strong ties between the leaders of ethiopias ruling ethiopian peoples revolutionary democratic front eprdf and eritreas ruling party the peoples front for democ racy and justice pfdj relations between the two have not always been warm on number of occasions in the late 1970s and 1980s the tigray peoples liberation front tplf the core group within the eprdf and the eritrean peoples liberation front eplf later renamed the pfdj clashed over political differences and their military strategies differed markedly the older and much experienced eplf was more nationalist in outlook and less ideological the tplf however touted the movement as staunchly marxist and as follower of the albanian model of communism differences over political and economic policies have repeatedly emerged between the tplf and eplf since the late 1970s relations between the tplf and eplf were broken off in 1985 and were not restored until 1988 the eplf ended political and military cooperation closed tplfs radio in eritrea and denied access to humanitarian corridors through eritre at the height of the 198485 famine although the tplf initially dealt with both eplf and its rival the eritrean liberation front elf it eventually allied itself with the eplf in successful military campaign to purge the elf from eritrea tplfs acceptance of eritreas independence was key in forging the relationship since other multiethnic groups had rejected eritreas right to self determination while the eplf was instrumental in training and arming the tplf in the early years tplfs contributions to eritreas libera tion war werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30598crs11 significant tplf forces fought alongside eplf in eritrea on number of occasions in the 1970s and 1980s to fend off dergs repeated large scale military campaigns tplf officials have long resented the notion that they could not have won the war against mengistu without the support of the eplf indeed eplf mechanized forces did play key roles in the final battles against the mengistu regime but without the eprdf in the lead the eplf would have found it difficult to operate in ethiopia being seen or dismissed as an eplf proxy had been major source of irritation and concer n to many in the tplf leadership some extremist elements within the ethiopian opposition groups have consistently promoted the notion that the tplf is antiethiopia and thus foreign entity in the view of some tplf officials the eplf did very little to disabuse people of this perception thus it was pivotal for tplf to demonstrate to its critics by its aggressive war strategy that it was fully independent of and superior to the eplf close personal relations at the leadership level helped defuse tensions in the past but one major political dispute continued to linger even after the movements patched up their differences in the late 1980s the rights of natio ns and nationalities to self determination the tplf maintained during the struggle against the derg the military junta that ousted emperor haile selassie that nations and nationalities in ethiopia have the right to selfdetermination including secession tplf officials also argued that eritreas nine nationalities have the right to selfdetermination including independence position vehemently opposed by the eplf after the ouster of the mengistu regime the tplfdominated eprdf did follow through in supporting eritrean independence the eprdf argued then that if ethiopia was to remain united unity must not be forced on the nationalities the eritrean leadership on the other hand saw eprdfs ethnic federalism as dangerous experiment that could threat political stability in eritrea and the horn of africa region eritrean authorities are concerned that ethnic federalism could encourage secessionist sentiments among the various ethnic groupings in eritrea and the region currency dispute in late 1997 created tension between ethiopia and eritrea though the two sides continued to have warm relations and the two leaders remained close coordinating both domestic policy as well as regional issues but underneath these warm relations there were fundamental differences both on regional and internal political developments many in the ruling eprdf were reluctant to see ethiopia actively engaged in regional affairs while the eritrean leadership took very activist role in regional issues in sudan eritrea took the lead in the isolation of the islamist nif government and broke off diplomatic relations in 1994 while ethiopia supportiv of eritrea and us policy objectives was reluctant partner ethiopia maintained diplomatic relations even though the nif government was implicated in the assassination attempt of president hosni mubarak in ethiopia in 1995 in congo while eritrea strongly supported the intervention of rwanda in 19961997 ethiopia once again was more reluctant the cultural characteristics of both ethiopia and eritrea are another contributing factor many believe analysts often describe ethiopians and eritreans as intensely proud people with strong stubborn streak for both observers maintain national and cultural honor come before everything else the eritreans waged 30year war of liberation against successive and more powerful governments in ethiopia with littlehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30598crs12 support from outside the ethiopians have also fought many wars against major powers including the italians in defense of ethiopian sovereign ty and honor
