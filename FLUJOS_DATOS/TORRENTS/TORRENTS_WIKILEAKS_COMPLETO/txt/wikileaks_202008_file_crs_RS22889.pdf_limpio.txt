law provisions related to the state di rectory of new hires are in section 453a of the social security act federal law provisions related to the national directory of new hires are in section 453i and section 453j of the social security act the national directory of new hires together with the state directories of new hires and th federal and state child support case registries were enacted as part of th 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 3 employers are required to submit wage repor t of uccovered employees every three months to the state employment security agency bout 90 of all private employers are covered by uc the quarterly wage report contains the name social security number and total wages paid to each employee during the calendar quarter 4 office of child support enforcement departme nt of health and human services division of federal systems guide to the national directory of new hires january 2007hires file ie report it contains information that is also on each employees w4 form1 employers are required by pl 1041932 to send new hire reports to the state directory of new hires which then sends the require d information to the national directory of new hires federal employers ie agencies send their new hire repor ts directly to the national directory of new hires 2 the second component of the national directory of new hires is the quarterly wage file3 the quarterly wage file contains quarterly wage information on individual employees in uc covered employment this information comes from the records of the state workforce agencies sometimes called state employment security agencies and the fede ral government when an individual has more than one job separate qua rterly wage records are blished for each job 3 the third component of the national direct ory of new hires is the unemployment compensation file the unemployment compensation file contains information pertaining to persons who have received or applied for unemployment compensation as reported by state workforce agencies4 with respect to this file the state can only submit information that is already contained in the records of the state agency ie generally the state workforce agency that administers the unemployment compensation program thus the national directory of new hires obtains its data from state directories of new hires state workforce agencies and federal agencies the national directory of new hires itsel f is component of the federal parent locator service fpls which is maintain ed by the federal office of child support enforcement ocse and is housed at the social security administrations national computer center in baltimore maryla nd according to the department of health and human services hhs during fy2004 about 690 million records were posted to the national directory of new hires original purpose the original purpose of the national directory of new hires was to help states locate child support obligor s who were working in other states so that child support could be withheld from the noncust odial parents paycheck it is estimated that about 30 of child support cases involve noncustodial parents who do not live in the same state as their children moreover because many noncustodial parents are inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22889crs3 5 although quarterly wage data to certain exte nt duplicate information in the new hires report quarterly wage data alone were not very useful to the cse agencies many noncustodial parents changed jobs so frequently that the quarterly data were often outofdate before the cse agencies received the information generally there is about sixmonth lag between the time the quarterly wage data are submitted to the state workforce agency and when the data are available to the cse agencies 6 pl 104193 allows certain employees of federal or state agency performing intelligence or counterintelligence functions to not be reported to the new hires directories states have the option of imposing civil monetary penalty for the failure of employers to report the required new hire information the penalty cannot exceed 25 per failure to meet the requirements with respect to each newly hired employ ee or 500 if under state law the failure is the result of conspiracy between the employer and the employee to not supply the required report or to supply false or incomplete reporttemporary employment or move from job to job the quick reporting of information on new hires greatly increases the likelihood that the national directory of new hires will be able to locate noncustodial parent and pa ss on the information to states so that the child support enforcement cse agencies can collect child support via income withholding before the noncust odial parent changes jobs5 since its enactment in 1996 access to the national directory of new hires has been expanded mostly to prevent fraud and abuse to certain other progra ms and agencies discussed later national directory data employers are required to collect from each newly hired employee and transmit to the state directory of new hires6 report that contains th name

directory of new hires up from 28 million in fy1999 75 increasehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22889crs6 11 see earlier subsection on d ata deletion requirementssince the establishment of the national directory of new hires federal law has been amended five times to expand access of more programs and agencies to the national directory listed above lthough congress specifically in cluded several provisions that would safeguard the information in the national directory some advocacy groups are concerned that as more agencies and programs are granted access to the national directory of new hires the potential for mismanagement of the database and accidental or intentional misuse of confidential information escalates the national directory of new hires is database that c ontains personal and financial data on nearly every working american as well as those receiving unemployment compensation the size and scope of the national dir ectory has continued to cause much concern over whether the privacy of individuals will be protected in addition to the data security safeguards fe deral law includes priv acy protection provisions that require the removal or deletion of certain information in the national directory after specified time periods11 it has been argued that stronger safeguards may be needed to prevent the unauthorized intrusion into th personal and confid ential information of millions of americans associated with the national directory the federal government and states ad minister numerous benefit programs that provide aid in cash and noncash form to persons with limited income in theory all of these programs could use the employment and income information contained in the national directory of new hires to verify program eligibility prevent or end unlawful or erroneous access to program benefits collect overpayments or assure that program benefits are correct some observers are worried that more of these federal and state programs will try to obtain access to the nationa l directory they contend that expanded or wider access to and use of these data could potentially lead to privacy and confidentiality breaches financ ial fraud identity theft or ot her crimes they also are concerned that broader arra of legitimate users of the national directory may conceal the unauthorized use of the personal and fi nancial data in the national directory some policymakers maintain that althou gh many agencies and programs could potentially benefit from access to the national directory of new hires those entities will not pursue access because many of these agencies currently do not have the computer capacity or capability to use an automated system such as the national directory many of these agencies and programs are administered at the local level where computer availability is limited or computer capability to interface with the automated national directory is nonexistent moreover many of the privacy protections and strict security requirements tied to the national directory may be administratively burdensome for many agencies finally some child support advocates are concerned that the wider access to the national directory may have ne gative repercussions for the cs program in that as other programs and agencies use the national directory effectively and find matches in cases that involve an overpayment t hose agencies will want to co llect their money and may use income withholding as the mechanism to do so thus these other programs will be in direct competition with the cse program for income of noncustodial parents or other debtors
