financing through the banking system following money inevitably requires delving into the intricac ies of interbank transfers one might think that banks exchanging with other banks would be the simplest of all transactions instead interbank transfers require cooperation among competitors and silence among those boasting about their assets interbank transfers involve significant risks for individuals and for the financial system as whole specialized payment systems process the largest most time sensitive interbank financial transactions both public and bankowned systems serve thousands of institutions processing trillions of dollars of transactions the revelations that us officials monitor the society for worldwide interbank financial transactions swift reminds analysts that payment systems are considered critical financial systems swift fedwire chips and other payment systems provide timely accurate and secure financial messages for the largest financial transactions processing such large transactions creates and distributes economic risk the method of processing and regulating each payment influences the liquidity and solvency of individual institutions the choice of payment procedures balances an array of systemic risks these risks include counterparty risk operational risk and legal risk the government monitors and regulates payment sy stems to facilitate financial markets prevent liquidity crises deter fraud and track criminal finances because terrorists target financial institutions and because us investigators track terrorist financing through the payments system the functions of large value interbank transfers is federal issue an interruption of the payment system could cause financial crisis disrupt investment spending and result in recession this report focuses on large value transactions between financial institutions it describes the emergence of bankowned and public systems provides background on sources of economic risk and details the features of fedwire chips and swift that relate to these issues this report will be updated when major system processes change

follow but charming thing to meet the world trade center attacks demonstrated that americas enemies target important financial institutions payment system processors are critical financial institutions1 these payment systems are important both because their workings are crucial to the american economy and because information flowing through these systems may provide clues to terrorist financing normally only of interest to financial specialists paymen t systems gained international notoriety when it was revealed that us investigators monitored belgiumbased swifts financial messages european governments are investigating continued financial information sharing 2 non specialists are now trying to understand the complex web of public and private large value interbank payment services the primary us interbank systems are the federal reserves fedwire and the bankowned clearing house interbank payment system chips 3 swift focuses on international transactions but us institutions can and do participate understanding large value payment systems requires understanding the inherent difficulties in interbank transfers trillions of dollars flow between banks in different countries the depositors of these banks may use different currencies the governments of these banks may apply different regulations the employees of the banks may speak different languages the technical support of the banks may use different computer protocols the relative value of currencies fluctuates during the trading day in the absence of common banking culture or international regulator bankowned payment systems like swift emerged to facilitate transactions between member banks the features of emergent payment systems address economic risk not all payment systems approach their complex problems in the same way for example some payment systems process each transaction at the time it occurs whereas others wait until the end of the day and settle on net basis the choice between these approaches is not just matter of communications equipment or computer proces sing speed although improved technology is beneficial the problem is that the total value of transactions in day is many times the value of the medium of exchange because each interbank transaction may be large relative to any one banks cash reserves processing transactions as they occur could cause gridlock that is bank may be reluctant to part with its own cash until it receives an expected payment from another bank if all banks follow this strategy then banks will be the first to honor payments processing each transaction as it occurs risks grinding the entire system to halt settling all transactions on net basis at the end of the day could alleviate the chances of gridlock but then the system would be subject to the risk that institutions commit to more payments than they can honor payment system structure balances these and other risks 1 government accountability office potential

cannot meet its obligations is its owners problem however if failure of one bank to meet its obligations causes subsequent banks to miss their obligations then there is systemwide problem problems of one isolated entity are called idiosyncratic risk while broader problems are systemic risk the procedures and technologies of payment systems affect the level of systemic risk because banks must process the payments of each others depositors and clients g5g152g158g151g157g142g155g153g138g155g157g162g561g20g146g156g148g497g561g5g155g142g141g146g157g561g138g151g141g561g14g146g154g158g146g141g146g157g162g561 in simple exchange buyer and seller are each others counterparty counterparty risk is the chance that the counterpartys promised payment or note will not be redeemed for full value and on time the two most important forms of counterparty risk are credit risk and liquidity risk credit risk is the risk that promised payment will never be honored liquidity risk is the risk that the payment will not be made on time which imposes costs on the holder of the promised payment banks promised payment is debt the bank holding the promise to pay is the lender the risk that the debtor bank will not honor its promise to pay affects the financial condition of its counterparty the lending bank holding the promise g5g155g142g141g146g157g561g20g146g156g148g561 counterpartys credit risk is the chance that the payment will never be honored credit risk is solvency problem for an individual bank the counterparty credit risk is simply the risk that the other bank will become insolvent before being able to honor the payment obligation systemic credit risk can be minimized through prudent business practices transparent accounting reserve funds and loss sharing rules credit risk can rise to the level of systemic risk for large or central institutions for example financial institutions often publicize their assets and liabilities to bolster confidence in their condition the bonds of reputable institutions are then held as assets by other institutions when major institution suffers financial distress not only does its credit fall but the value of its bonds held by other institutions also falls the capacity of these secondary institutions to meet their own obligations falls because the value of their assets falls an institutions commitment to make payment is just like bond and threatens the payment system in similar fashion modern payment systems seek to minimize credit risk for one thing financial transparency is required in most countries for most institutions the assets and liabilities of most large financial institutions are made public on periodic basis in the united states the banking systems financial condition is subject to government regulation and oversight american banks are required to observe prudent business practices similarly many banks are subject to international agreements for banking solvency through the basel 4 accords 4 the basel committee on bank supervision bcbs gathers repr

supplemental reserves for example the coordinator of the system could maintain joint reserve fund to compensate member institutions if there is default if the system is run by the monetary authority then payments could be guaranteed by the power to create additional funds these forms of credit enhancement generate confidence in the system but could also create the incentive for some banks to overextend themselves knowing that rescuer stood by in case of trouble loss sharing rules are third way to reduce counterparty credit risk under loss sharing rules the failure of participant to make promised payment does not impose all the costs on one counterparty instead survivors rule allocates the losses among the remaining institutions according to previously agreed upon arrangements the loss sharing rule does not eliminate counterparty credit risk but it does reduce the need for each participant to monitor the solvency of each counterparty g14g146g154g158g146g141g146g157g162g561g20g146g156g148g561 unlike credit risk liquidity risk does not depend on the solvency of each counterparty although the bank promising to pay cannot honor its promise at the agreed moment the payment could be made in full if there was additional time this could happen if the institutions cash assets were drained but it still had strong noncash reserves if the noncash reserve assets are in form that is difficult to liquidate and the bank is subject to regulatory review prior to borrowing against assets then the bank might not be able to make payment at the time due systemic liquidity risk can be affected by timing rules reserve funds and transaction limitations systemic liquidity risk is primarily about timing the daily value of traded transactions is many times the amount of cash available to the system as result the order of the payments could theoretically constrain participants for example solvent bank may be expecting to receive payment in the afternoon however the banks cash reserves are at the lowest level it considers prudent the bank might wish to refrain from committing its own cash until it receives payment from someone else however if all participants are reluctant to be the first to lower their cash on hand then none of the participants receive payments and none will start the round of exchange sequential system called gross settlement that becomes illiquid is said to be in gridlock timing rule can affect liquidity risk rather than processing payments immediately the system could keep tally and settle up at the end of an agreed period often the end of trading day settling up on net basis makes the order of trades within given trading period irrelevant participants become more willing to part with liquid assets as long as they are expecting payments any time during the same trading day however all of the daily payment orders of an insolvent bank may be subject to cancellation the possibility of this unwinding of payments in net system creates additional credit risk reserve funds reduce liquidity risk in the same way they reduce credit risk members can be required to contribute to joint reserve fund available to resolve liquidity problems if the system is run by the central bank then cash reserves can be expanded as part of monetary policy the confidence that reserve fund is available can itself reduce systemic liquidity risk because participants may be more willing to pay out liquid assets continued countries and recommends minimum banking standards

pending transactions for each member the limit could be based on the institutions known reserves its trade volume on the exchange multiple of deposit placed with the payment system or other financial calculation the limit prevents any one institution from locking up the finances of large portion of the participants

jeancharles rochet and jean tirole argued that the core economic problem of modern payment systems was credit risk not liquidity risk5 they argued that liquidity is not problem because payment system administrators fully understand the risks and robust alternative markets for financial assets exist if all of the participating banks are solvent then liquidity problems will be resolved by system design or turning to outside suppliers of liquid assets rochet and tirole did not argue that all problems were solved by system design instead they argued that the banks involved in these payment systems are highly sophisticated and understand the risks given opportunities in other financial ma rkets solvent bank would not be threatened by the possibility of counterparty unwinding or system gridlock in one settlement system however they did concede that banks liquidity problem is important because it is signal of larger financial issues g17g153g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g20g146g156g148g561 operational risk includes the physical transmission system and the security of information since payment systems consist primarily of simple messages anything that compromises communications is threat to the system such disruption occurred in 1985 when the bank of new yorks computer failed to process securities trades correctly resulting in more than 20 billion worth of overdrafts other communications problems are potentially more serious computer hacker sending false messages or power outage could create financial chaos payment systems address operational risk through system diversity and information security system diversity refers to the existence of multiple transmission systems the existence of multiple systems allows for payment messages to be sent through alternative channels if one communication network is compromised diversity includes multiple channels within one payment system and multiple payment systems serving each market niche redundancy assures that the failure of one system does not shut down the entire financial structure information security protects the content of messages fraudulent messages could bankrupt institutions eliminate confidence in the system and destroy system liquidity security measures that authenticate users reduce the risk of fraud security measures that prevent improper surveillance reduce the risk that someone will be able to manipulate vulnerable institutions by observing their financial strategies on the other hand security measures that cause delays create credit and liquidity risk in gross settlement systems because delays reduce even further the amount of cash available for transactions 5 jeancharles rochet and jean tirole controlling risk in

laws governing transactions are not administered the way the parties envisioned or when partys property rights are not enforced legal risks are likely to be correlated with other risks because they tend to arise during disputes for example bank might dispute the way loss sharing was processed when another banks payments were unwound or bank might dispute the ruling of regulatory agency concerning the confidentiality of its messages banks should have better knowledge of the legal rules in their own country and in the countries that they have common dealings than in countries that they rarely engage international transactions have additional legal risk because of the diversity of jurisdictions and regulatory environments financial institutions transmit secure payments into country or jurisdiction where they have little prior knowledge or experience the relevant financial regulators in different countries may have different scopes of authority and different policy objectives payment system structure adapts to the regulatory environment and to the level of risk

initiating communication with other us financial institutions 2 us financial institutions initiating communication with foreign institutions and 3 us financial institutions receiving communication

term fedwire refers to both the systems procedures and the fednet computer technology most fedwire transactions are between financial institutions with federal reserve accounts involve large dollar value and are time critical fedwire message instructs the system to reduce the balance of one institutions federal reserve account and increase another institutions federal reserve account these cashless adjustments of accounting balances are immediate and irrevocable in the second quarter of 2006 fedwire processed an average of 15 million messages per day the average value per transfer during that period was 17 million 6 because fedwire is operated by an institution with regulatory authority over its direct participants and with monetary authority fedwire has some control over

authority puts it in position to have superior knowledge of each banks financial condition the federal reserve can alleviate liquidity risk because its monetary authority allows it to credit the reserve accounts which form the basis of each transaction confident that the federal reserves control of each partys federal reserve account could guarantee each payment if necessary fedwire transactions are processed immediately and are irrevocable fedwire effectively includes the federal reserve as third counterparty for each transaction although the federal reserves regulatory authority addresses some counterparty risks fedwire must still synchronize the timing of payments it is realtime gross settlement system rtgs realtime refers to the policy of updating accounts as payments occur the participants running account balance must cover the payment or the transaction could be rejected although some institutions have limited overdraft ability the federal reserve charges fee to discourage abuse of the limited overdraft ability although gross settlement systems could theoretically suffer gridlock the federal reserves monetary powers alleviate this risk although owned by the federal reserve fedwire must operate as business the federal reserve charges fee for each fedwire message and when institutions with limited overdraft ability exceed their balance the

the accounts of its members or subpoena the financial records of troubled institutions however chips reduces its financial exposure by limiting membership to institutions with federal reserve accounts although chips members have federal reserve accounts individual transactions are processed internally to chips only endoftheday net negative positions require adjustments of federal reserve balances chips was net settlement system but adopted some gross settlement procedures in 2001 the result is hybrid structure real time gross ttlement occurs on chips internal accounts but final external settlement occurs on net basis at the end of the day to achieve this chips members post an initial positive position at the beginning of the day then payments are settled on chips accounts in real

regulatory environments private banks have implemented payment systems such as swift the role of central banks in credit and liquidity issues has led to publicly owned payment systems like fedwire bankowned and public administered systems are simultaneously competitors and partners in providing interbank payments whether public or private payment systems deal with counterparty risk operational risk and legal risk the risks inherent in large value interbank payment systems can rise to the level of systemic risks for large institutions and for the coordination of smaller institutions the structure and interrelationship of these systems affects the vel and distribution of these risks throughout the financial system for these reasons the diversity redundancy stability and reliability of these payment systems is of concern to regulators and an oversight responsibility of congress

international counterparts american banks confronted diverse financial environments and fluctuating monetary values across regulatory jurisdictions mixture of state chartered and nationally chartered banks was subject to the laws of their own jurisdictions the promissory notes of these banks circulated as money us dollars still say federal reserve note the notes of unknown or troubled banks often traded at less than face value kind of brand quality discount banks accumulated each others notes through the normal course of business with their own depositors then had to redeem each others notes redeeming large number of notes at once might put strain on one banks reserves however delaying redemption could strain the finances of the bank demanding payment also the value of the banks notes could decline during any delay bostons suffolk bank became the centerpiece of new england interbank clearinghouse system during 18251858 suffolk bank coordinated the interbank clearinghouse the rules of membership required banks to hold reserve deposits with suffolk that could be used to help settle accounts members also agreed to remain financially prepared to redeem their notes in the system the suffolk clearinghouse system affected more than just banks benefit of this system to the typical new england farmer was that the bank notes issued by his local rural bank was more likely to be accepted for full value when the farmer traveled to another town another benefit was that it maintained liquid medium of exchange throughout the region despite the diversity of banks and jurisdictions however disadvantage as perceived by some rural new englanders was that the city banks could manipulate the finances of country banks by observing their note issues and strategically presenting the country banks notes for redemption this could have limit the country banks ability to extend credit in rural areas suffolk banks redemption policies reduced systemic risk since bank notes circulated as money even rumors of the insolvency of one bank would decrease the value of cash on hand of any institutions holding the banks notes this might affect the ability of many other banks to meet their own obligations while the matter was sorted out by requiring member banks to post deposits or hold reserves and by coordinating the order of redemption suffolk bank lessened the risk that member banks would not meet their mutual obligations during its operation the suffolk system was effective in the sense that members notes traded closer to face value than banks notes outside the system and new englands financial markets remained relatively liquid evidence also shows that suffolk banks administration of the payment system assisted its own interbank lending which allowed it to provide extra liquidity to other banks in an era without federal reserve or central bank however the system did not completely provide monetary stability the suffolk system ended in 1858 because of the combination of an economic downturn political unpopularity and competition during its operation the system dealt with many of the same risks inherent in modern interbank payment systems
