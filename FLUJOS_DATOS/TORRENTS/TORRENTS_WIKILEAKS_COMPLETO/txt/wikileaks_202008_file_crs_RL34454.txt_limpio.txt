technology policy resources science and industry division science and technology policymaking primer summary scientific and technical knowledge and guidance influences not just policy related to science and technology but also many of todays public policies as policymakers seek knowledge to enhance the quality of their decisions science and technology policy is concerned with the allocation of resources for and encouragement of scientific and engineering research and development the use of scientific and technical knowledge to enhance the nations response to societal challenges and the education of americans in science technology engineering and mathematics science and engineering research and innovations are intricately linked to societal needs and the nations economy in areas such as transportation communication agriculture education environment health defense and jobs as result policymakers are interested in almost every aspect of science and technology policy the three branches of government executive congressional and judiciary depending on each branchs responsibility use science and technology knowledge and guidance to frame policy issues craft legislation and govern the science and engineering community however is not represented by one individual or organization on matters of scientific and technical knowledge and guidance its opinions are consensusbased with groups of scientists and engineers coming together from different perspectives to debate an issue based on the available empirical evidence in the end consensus is achieved if there is widespread agreement on the evidence and its implications which is conveyed to policymakers policymakers then determine based on this knowledge and other factors whether or not to take action and what actions to take if there are major disagreements within large portions of the community however consensus is not yet achieved and taking policy actions in response to concern can be challenging several organizations when requested by the federal government or congress provide formal science and technology policy advice federal advisory committees congressionally chartered honorific organizations and federally funded research and development corporations in addition many other organizations and individuals international intergovernmental organizations policy institutesthink tanks the public professional organizations disciplinary societies universities and colleges advocacy special interest industry trade associations and labor also provide their thoughts these organizations may agree on the scientific and technical knowledge regarding an issue but disagree on what actions to take in response as their values on proposed policy may differ policymakers may be overwhelmed with an abundance of information from these organizations despite these challenges scientific and technical knowledge and guidance can provide policymakers with an opportunity to make their decisions based on the best information available along with other factors they might take into account such as cultural economic and other values so that societal and economic benefits are enhanced and losses are

policymaking primer scientific and technical knowledge and guidance influences many of todays public policies the following definition is used by some science and technology policy analysts as cornerstone of thinking about science and technology st policy decisionmaking science and technology policy is concerned with the allocation of resources for scientific research and technical development it includes government encouragement of science and technology as the roots of strategy for industrial development and in economic growth but it also includes the use of science in connection with problems of the public sector because of the close association of basic research with higher education this aspect of science and technology policy is difficult to separate from overall educational policy and from scientific and technical workforce policy1 because science and technical knowledge and guidance influences public policy decisionmaking on many other issues some think that science and technology policy does not need to be separate field of inquiry2 others however view st policy as different from other public policy issue areas these differences include the rapidity of change in science and technology novelty of many issues in science and technology scale complexity and interdependence among technologies irreversibility of many scientific and technological effects public worries about real or imagined threats to human health and safety and the challenges to deeply held social values3 this report will provide basic understanding of science and technology policy including the nature of st policy how scientific and technical knowledge is useful for public policy decisionmaking and an overview of the key stakeholders in science and

on survey of developed nations crs2 supports public policy decisionmaking as well as performing and funding research and development overview of us science and technology policy the nations first formal science and technology policy decision may well have been in the us constitution itself in 1787 when the congress was given power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries4 at the request of president washington congress passed its first science and technology policyrelated act regarding patents in 17905 these actions led to todays patent and trademark office pto the constitution also identified the utility of scientific and technical policy guidance in the sense of congressional power to coin money regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin and fix the standard of weights and measures6 this is the origin of todays national institutes of standards and technology nist in addition the constitution stated that capitation or other direct tax shall be laid unless in the proportion to the census of enumeration herein before directed to be taken7 this is the origin of todays us census bureau other constitutional propositions8 not enacted included the power of congress to establish university and seminaries for the promotion of the sciences and encourage by premiums provisions the advancement of useful knowledge and 4 us constitution article i section 8 clause 8 5 jeffrey k stine history of science policy in the united states 19401985 report

the constitution congress requested geological survey in the land ordinance of 1785 to classify lands west of the allegheny mountains that had become source of contention in writing the articles of confederation the precursor of todays us geological survey usgs science and technology policy facets as illustrated in table 1 science and technology policy has four facets science for policy technology for policy policy for science and policy for technology11 these facets cannot be easily separated but can help provide framework to better understand the policy decisions that policymakers are addressing in given situation this in turn can reflect how policymakers consider the policy advice they are given by the scientific and technical community science for policy and technology for policy are when scientists engineers and health professionals see box 1 provide analysis knowledge and data to inform policymakers with the goal of enhancing their ability to make wise decisions this scientific and technical guidance is available for almost any public policy arena classic example is global climate change policymakers debate questions such as at what point actions if any should be taken to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions if action is taken what are the possible impacts of global climate change on the united states and other countries if policymakers decide to take action what policy steps could the united states take to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions or to adapt to global climate change policymakers are the ones who decide what steps should be taken to manage these risks they can base their decisions on the guidance provided to them by the science engineering and health communities in contrast policy for science and policy for technology are when policymakers take actions that influence the st community or the actions in which they engage such as research12 or stbusiness related activities eg patent law in the case 9 max farrand ed the records of the

engineers and health professionals most universities consider the physical sciences life sciences social sciences and economics to be scientific engineering and the health professions such as medicine are considered by most universities as fields related to science that focus on the delivery of services three common definitions used to determine who is scientist engineer or health professional 1 science engineering and health occupations 2 science engineering and health degrees or 3 selfidentification of employment in job that requires science and engineering knowledge estimates such as the number of scientists and engineers can vary among federal agencies based on which definition is used for more discussion on this issue see crs report rl34539 the us science and technology workforce by deborah d stine and christine m matthews related question is what fields are considered to be scientific survey data indicate that the majority of americans consider medicine to be the most scientific followed by biology physics and engineering economics and sociology both social sciences are not considered to be as scientific as these fields although about 50 of americans consider these social sciences to be either very scientific or pretty scientific about 40 of americans consider them not too scientific or not at all scientific the remainder do not know or have not heard of the fields perceptions of what fields are considered to be scientific and who is considered to be scientist can become an issue during discussions related to policy for science this report uses the broadest definition and includes social scientists as science professionals source national science board science and engineering indicators 2008 arlington va national science foundation 2008 chapters 3 and 7 at httpwwwnsfgovstatisticsseind08 historical changes in us science and technology policy in the early days of the united states the focus of science and technology policy was on science for policy and technology for policy of particular importance was scientific and technical advice related to public health agriculture and geography president jefferson for example commissioned the lewis and clark expedition to explore the western united states that opened trade in the far northwest and made significant scientific findings in the life sciences13 as the nation grew scientific and technical knowledge became important for issues related to the military and issues related to the welfare state such as care for the needy and universal education and literacy in general research was supported primarily through the philanthropy of wealthy individuals14 during the civil war however research became part of the militarys mission and the federal government 13 hunter dupree science in the federal government history of policies and activities baltimore johns hopkins university press 1986 14 bruce lr smith american science policy since world war ii washington dc brookings institution 1990 crs6 more actively engaged in policy for science establishing the landgrant college system focusing on agricultural research 1862 and the weather bureau 1870 providing telescope for the naval observatory and supporting polar explorations and surveys of the western united states15 issues began to arise regarding how science should fit into the federal governments structure as result in 1884 congress set up joint commission made up of three members each from the house and the senate chaired by senator w b allison the allison commission discussed proposals for department of science and national university as well as the need for the government to cooperate not compete with universities and concerns about duplication in the end the allison commission affirmed the utility of federal funding of science but did not recommend separate department or any other actions16 at the beginning of the 20th century prior to world war i additional issues became the focus of the nations science and technology policy including conservation medicine and public health and number of additional science organizations were established in the federal government eg food and drug administration in addition the first industrial research laboratories and largescale mechanized industry were started world war i brought about additional application of science and technology to weapon development17 during the period between world war i and through world war ii the role of the application of research to provide technology for both military and economic purposes became evident longer were philanthropists the primary sources of funding for research and development rd instead it was the federal government this lead to fundamental change in the relation between the federal government and the st community this policy for technology focused on areas such as weaponry communications and medical needs such as surgical innovations during this period the capabilities of science and technology were widely recognized due to the use of chemicals aircraft mechanized weapons radar and other technological applications in world war ii as result president franklin d roosevelt established the office of scientific research and development 1941 the manhattan project also began its work at this time managed by the manhattan engineer district of the army corps of engineers and tasked with the goal of building an atomic bomb prior to the japanese or germans18 following world war ii the utility of science and technology to society as exhibited during the war was crystallized in science the endless frontier 1945 report by vannevar bush director of the white house office of scientific research 15 hunter dupree science in the federal government history of policies and

and development to president franklin roosevelt this report which proposed program for postwar scientific research set the stage for todays view of the relationship between the federal government and the st community regarding policy for science19 in his report bush indicated that scientific progress was essential for the war against disease for national security and for the public welfare the report also recommended that the federal government should undertake responsibility for renewing the nations scientific talent to respond to these needs bush proposed new federal agency that would accept new responsibilities for promoting the flow of new scientific knowledge and the development of scientific talent of our youth this recommendation eventually led to the establishment of the national science foundation nsf today science and engineering research and innovations are intricately linked to societal needs and the nations economy in areas such as energy transportation communication agriculture education environment health defense and jobs as result policymakers are interested in almost every aspect of science and technology policy definition of research and development the following definition of rd determined by international intergovernmental guidelines developed through the organisation of economic cooperation and development oecd is used by the national science board nsb research and development rd creative work undertaken on systematic basis to increase the stock of knowledge including knowledge of man culture and society and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications basic research the objective of basic research is to gain more comprehensive knowledge or understanding of the subject under study without specific applications in mind although basic research may not have specific applications as its goal it can be directed in fields of present or potential interest this is often the case with basic research performed by industry or missiondriven agencies applied research the objective of applied research is to gain knowledge or understanding to meet specific recognized need in industry applied research includes investigations to discover new scientific knowledge that has specific commercial objectives with respect to products processes or services development development is the systematic use of the knowledge or understanding gained from research directed toward the production of 19 vannevar bush science the endless frontier report to the president by vannevar bush director of the office of scientific research and development july 1945 united states government printing office washington 1945 at httpwwwnsfgov odlpansf50vbush1945htm crs8 useful materials devices systems or methods including the design and development of prototypes and processes20 these definitions are based on the traditional linear model of innovation that some believe creates false distinction between basic and applied research innovation they believe is instead more nuanced and there is need for distinction between the two see later discussion on perspectives on innovation particularly the section regarding the pasteurs quadrant model these definitions are however the most commonly used in congressional and federal agency discussions regarding federal rd activities industries linked to science and technology although most industries use science and technology to some degree ten industries have been identified by the oecd as having strong linkage to science and technology oecd organizes these industries into two categories knowledge intensive service industries which incorporate science engineering and technology in services or the delivery of services and hightechnology manufacturing industries which spend relatively high proportion of their revenues on rd according to the oecd knowledgeintensive service industries include communications services financial services business services including computer software development education services and health services hightechnology manufacturing industries include aerospace pharmaceuticals computers and office machinery communications equipment and scientific medical precision and optical instruments21 what are some perspectives on science and technology policy the encompassing nature of science and technology policy makes it challenging to provide the full range perspectives on science and technology policy the purpose of this section is to highlight some of the most common differing perspectives that 20 national science board science and engineering indicators 2008 arlington va national science foundation 2008 chapter 4 at httpwwwnsfgovstatisticsseind08 21 organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd knowledgebased industries paris oecd 2001 crs9 generate discussion regarding science and technology policy they include the sometimes different perspectives of the science and technology community and policymakers regarding science and technology policy this section also discusses different perspectives on federal funding of research policy for science and science for policy and policy for technology and technology for policy the perspectives identified here may arise regardless of the issue being discussed whether it be energy transportation agriculture or science itself science and technology community and policymakers number of criteria may determine the utility of scientific and technical knowledge and advice to policymakers these include whether or not this advice is relevant disinterested and credible22 conflicts can occur if these criteria are not met further the st community and policymakers can on occasion view science and technology policymaking quite differently for example while the st community tends to have longtime horizon policymakers must often make decisions very quickly based on the available knowledge see box 2 sometimes the reverse occurs in these situations the st community may believe decision is needed quickly due to the nature of the risk involved while the policymaker is concerned about the political and economic implications of taking the action recommended by the st community the st community may also believe that the knowledge they communicate should be the primary factor influencing policymakers decision while the policymaker believes they need to take into consideration other factors they believe are equally important one analyst identifies four different degrees of interaction between scientists and policymakers from interaction to substantial interaction these include the pure scientist seeks to focus only on facts and has interaction with the decision maker the science arbiter answers specific factual questions posed by the decision maker the issue advocate seeks to reduce the scope of choice available to the decision maker the honest broker of policy options seeks to expand or at least clarify the scope of choice available to the decision maker23 22 bruce lr smith and jeffrey k stine technical advice for congress past trends and present obstacles in m granger

april 2007 at httpwwwostinaorgcontentview2027699 this article is based on roger pielke the honest broker making sense of science in policy and politics cambridge uk cambridge university press 2007 crs10 many would contend however that the reality of st policymaking is such that there is clear delineation as outlined here rather the interaction of scientists engineers and health professionals with policymakers is mix of each of these categories scientists engineers and health professionals like any other us citizen also advocate for action on policies related to the st community itself or promote their personal views for example members of the st community are recipients of federal funding for research employed by universities or colleges impacted by higher education policy work for industries influenced by tax policy and often have general interest in the quality of science engineering technology and mathematics stem education at the k12 level relative to future education and workforce needs scientists and engineers may also have personal preferences with regard to public policies that may influence their political action on issues such as climate change stem cell research or others box 2 science the interaction with policy scientific knowledge is dynamic changing as new information becomes available in this sense science does not reveal truth so much as produce the best available or most likely explanation of natural phenomena given the information available at the time in many cases analysis of data may give an estimate of the degree of confidence in the explanation moreover scientific conclusions naturally depend on the questions that are asked the scientific method has at its heart two values that are strongly implied but not often stated 1 transparent approach in which both new and old data are available to all parties and 2 continuing effort to update data and therefore modify and even reject previously accepted hypotheses in light of new information together transparency and updating are the cleansing mechanisms that gradually sweep away scientific misunderstandings and errors sine qua non for scientific advancement decisionmakers usually seek to affect how the world ought to or should be science provides one source of input for making policy decisions that balance diverse considerations source excerpted from crs report rl32992 the endangered species act and sound science by eugene h buck m lynne corn pamela baldwin and kristina alexander federal funding of research when discussing research and development rd particularly in regard to funding terminology can be important in understanding the premise of an issue in discussing the federal funding of research many analyses focus on rd some however believe this provides false impression of the degree of federal funding going toward research as it does not distinguish between federal funding devoted toward research and that focused on federal funding focused on nonresearch activities such as testing and evaluation of weapons figure 1 illustrates the magnitude of federal funding in each of the rd categories by agency as shown here department of defense dod rd funding which accounts for crs11 approximately half of all federal rd funding is focused on major systems development with approximately 11 for basic and applied research the majority of nondod civilian rd funding however focuses on research particularly basic research figure 1 projected federal obligations for research and development by agency and character of work fy2007 source national science board science and engineering indicators 2008 arlington va national science foundation 2008 figure 46 at httpwwwnsfgovstatisticsseind08 another perspective to the rd budget regarding federal funding of research is provided by the federal science and technology fst budget24 the white house office of management and budget omb includes both an rd and fst budget analysis in the presidents annual budget request to congress according to omb the fst budget highlights the creation of new knowledge and technologies more consistently and accurately than the overall rd data25 while the rd budget includes funding for defense development testing and evaluation the fst budget does not as result the federal fst budget is generally less than half that of the federal rd budget 24 national academy of sciences allocating federal funds for science and technology washington dc national academy press 2005 at httpwwwnapeducatalogphp record_id5040toc 25 office of management and budget research and development chapter 5 in analytical perspectives budget of the united states government fiscal year 2009 available at httpwwwwhitehousegovombbudgetfy2009apershtml crs12 policy for science and science for policy two fundamental policy issues in policy for science include how much federal funding is sufficient to achieve national goals and the degree to which the united states benefits primarily from its investment in research as opposed to the world at large the st community also sometimes has fundamentally different perspectives regarding policy for science issues see figure 2 the alternative perspectives shown in figure 2 do not represent one side of the st community versus another rather they represent views held by various entities in various ways for example junior researchers may favor risktaking when it comes to research funding while at the same time supporting setaside programs designated for researchers at the beginning of their career that enhance their ability to obtain funding as opposed to competing with senior researchers who have already had the opportunity to receive federal research funding figure 2 major alternative perspectives in the scientific and technology community on the allocation of resources for research source us congress office of technology assessment federally funded research decisions for decade otaset490 washington dc us government printing office may 1991 at httpgovinfolibraryunteduotaota_2data19919121pdf crs13 science for policy can be contentious because it informs policy discussions where there are sometimes disagreements as to what policy actions should be taken if any due to the societal and economic implications the same scientific paper may be viewed in different ways depending on the perspectives of the advocate sometimes there are differing views as to the degree of consensus among the st community on particular issue alternatively minority in the st community may have strong beliefs regarding the scientific and technical evidence on an issue that do not agree with the majority as result when science for policy issues are discussed in political setting strong views can emerge on both sides of an issue policy for technology and technology for policy the us bureau of economic analysis has estimated that if rd were treated as investment it would have accounted for 5 of real gross domestic product gdp growth between 1959 and 2004 and 7 between 1995 and 200426 stanford university hoover institution study found that if us students performed in science and mathematics education at level comparable with the worlds leaders us gdp would increase27 as result policymakers are often interested in the innovation process both policy for technology and technology for policy particularly the relationship between science engineering economics education and job creation28 in the case of policy for technology perspectives on given policy may differ because of differing views of the innovation model one perspective of innovation policy based on the linear model of innovation29 leads some policymakers to believe that it is inappropriate to use federal resources to invest in technological development rather private resources should be used to invest in this portion of the innovation process as private entities will receive the returns on investment an alternative perspective is that research and innovation can be so interrelated that it is not possible to separate the two policymakers with this perspective on innovation 26 bureau of economic analysis research and development satellite account 2007 satellite account underscores importance of rd press release at httpwwwbeagovnewsreleasesgeneralrd2007rdspend07htm the press release also states to put the contribution of rd in perspective the business sectors investment in commercial and other types of structures accounted for just over 2 percent of real gdp growth between 1995 and 2004 27 eric

httpwwwcsiiccapdfgodin_30pdf crs14 policy believe that investing federal resources to enhance technological innovation is appropriate and wise use of federal funds30 figure 3 illustrates the linear model of innovation as shown here the federal government invests in research and development moving from basic research to applied research to development creating intellectual property the responsibility then falls to the private sector including inventors entrepreneurs venture capitalists and industry to use that intellectual property to capture that idea and translate it into technology moving it through several stages prototype then product and finally commercialized in such way that consumers are interested in purchasing the result figure 3 one perspective on the

kelly charles t kelley jr technology transfer of federally funded rd perspectives from forum prepared for the white house office of science and technology policy santa monica ca rand science and technology policy institute 2003 at httprandorgpubsconf_proceedings2006cf187pdf the gap between these two stages however is sometimes called the valley of death because of the challenges of taking the intellectual property and transferring that idea to private entities who may or may not be interested in turning that intellectual property into technology as result some believe that the linear model is insufficient as basis for st policy decisionmaking today that the linkage between science and technological innovation is far more complex one visual perspective on this theory of science and innovation called the pasteurs quadrant model describes closer link between research and its intended outcome see figure 431 30 for more information see crs report rl33528 industrial competitiveness

1997 crs15 figure 4 pasteurs quadrant model of science and engineering research source donald stokes pasteurs quadrant basic science and technological innovation washington dc brookings institution press 1997 as described by stokes there are four types of research pure basic research pursued with the goal of fundamental understanding without any consideration of the use eg niels bohr whose goal was to enhance our understanding of atomic structure pure applied research pursued with the goal of use without any consideration of fundamental understanding eg thomas edison whose goal was commercially profitable electric lighting useinspired basic research pursued with the dual goals of basic understanding and use eg louis pasteurs use of his discovery of the process of disease at the microbiological level to develop mechanisms to combat anthrax in sheep and cattle cholera in chickens spoilage in milk wine and vinegar and rabies in people phenomena exploration32 pursued due to research curiosity regarding particular phenomena inspired by neither understanding nor use eg the marking and incidence of bird species or why an 32 this is represented by what appears to be an empty quadrant crs16 apple falls from tree such exploration might lead to the type of research represented by bohrs quadrant or edisons quadrant33 as with previous models presented in this report some would contend that the barriers illustrated in the model are not concrete but porous research can easily move from one category to another as illustrated by the pasteur example mentioned earlier for example there is little distinction sometimes between basic research applied research development and commercialization there may not be much difference for example in biotechnology research conducted at university or at small company funded by venture capital as result some policymakers believe that in knowledgebased economy federal investment in rd should be inspired not only with the goal of fundamental understanding but also on occasion with the goal of use in addition in order for the nation to obtain the return on federal investment in rd and the related societal and economic goals some contend that federal investment should not stop at the point just before prototype and product technological development34 this some believe is particularly important as in global economy foreign firms are as easily able to capture the results of federal investment in research as us firms35 on the other hand some policymakers express concerns that investing in rd in sector closely linked to industry or for that matter at any stage of technology commercialization may result in the federal government picking winners and losers for example although some believe that federal investment in information technology rd has resulted in benefits for the country and helps by setting industry standards others believe that federal investment in information technology rd is inappropriate because it is the federal government not industry who is determining the direction for research and determining technological winners and losers36 in terms of technology for policy differing views regarding policy issues are not that dissimilar as those for policy for technology differing perspectives in technology for policy focus on the degree to which it is appropriate for the federal government to focus on particular technology some believe it is important to undertake policies to encourage implementation of technology others believe that such policy actions might inappropriately influence the

technology for policy policy for science and policy for technology science and technology policy guidance can be used to frame policy issues craft legislation oversee federal activities and govern in addition the decisions congress makes influence st issues such as the funding of research and technological development setting priorities for that funding and supporting science technology engineering and mathematics education in making its decisions congress receives advice from both internal sources such as congressional staff st policy fellows hearings and congressional support agencies see box 3 as well as external sources that will be described later in this report committees38 almost every congressional committee is in some way involved in st policy decisionmaking or uses the scientific and technical knowledge currently available to help them make decisions generally these issues fall into the category of science for policy and technology for policy examples include how to improve nutrition and food safety in the nations schools implement the endangered species act determine drinking water standards respond to bridge collapse and create jobs the primary committees that focus on policy for science and policy for technology include the house committee on science and technology and the senate committee on commerce science and transportation the house committee on science and technology jurisdiction includes many policy areas related to st policy including energy astronautical and civil aviation environmental and marine research as well as the commercial application of technology science scholarships and general category of scientific research development and demonstration39 as result the house committee on science and technology is the authorizing 37 crs report rl30484 advanced vehicle technologies energy environment and development issues by brent d yacobucci 38 it is important to note that the house and senate parliamentarians are

laws programs and government activities relating to nonmilitary research and development41 the senate committee on commerce science and transportation jurisdiction is defined in the senate rules more generally as science engineering and technology research and development and policy 42 the jurisdiction of these committees however does not directly include biomedical research and development such as that supported by the national institutes of health nih which is the federal agency that receives the majority of federal research funding biomedical research is under the jurisdiction of the house committee on energy and commerce43 and the senate committee on health education labor and pensions44 defense research likewise falls under other committees jurisdiction the house committee on armed services has jurisdiction over scientific research and development in support of the armed services45 the senate committee on armed services jurisdiction includes military research and development46 the house and senate committees on appropriations play an important role in st policy although the authorization of federal funding of research often has wide and bipartisan support appropriated research funding faces greater challenge when it competes for the limited amount of discretionary funding with other federal programs in addition not all research funding falls into the jurisdiction of the same committee for example the funding for nsf nasa nist and the white house office of science and technology policy ostp falls under the jurisdiction of the house and senate committees on appropriations subcommittee on commerce justice science and related agencies funding for energy research activities falls under the house and senate committees on appropriations subcommittee on energy and water development for nih it is the house and senate committees on appropriations subcommittee on labor health and human services education and related agencies for dod it is the house and senate

st policy and use scientific and technical knowledge and information caucuses science and technology policy related caucuses frequently organize symposia open to the public on topics of interest to their sponsoring members this provides mechanism for congressional staff to gain better understanding of scientific or technical topic and provides networking opportunity for staff who represent member interested in the topic because the jurisdiction of st policy is widespread throughout congress caucuses and other informal groups can bring together those members who are interested in st policy issues caucuses coalitions ad hoc task forces or working groups are examples of the titles given to these voluntary alliances of members of congress that operate without direct recognition in chamber rules or line item appropriations unlike formal leadership and party groups47 financial support for the caucus events such as luncheon symposium may be provided by interested groups for

informally through friends via referrals or federal agency scientists and engineers the growing importance and influence of science and technology led president franklin d roosevelt to establish the first formal presidentially appointed science advisory mechanism called the science advisory board in 1933 the purpose of this board in place until 1935 was to provide the president with recommendations and central organization for federal government science policy prior to the united states entering world war ii the national defense research committee ndrc coordinated research

november 195753 in 1961 the senate committee on government operations subcommittee on national policy machinery following series of hearings recommended the creation of an office of science and technology ost within the executive office of the president president kennedy established ost in 1962 when president nixon was elected in 1973 he did not appoint members to psac and the ost was abolished later that same year nixon announced that the director of the nsf would also serve as the presidents science advisor there was longer an st policy office in the white house rather science policy analysis office was located within nsf when gerald ford became president he supported the return of science advisory mechanism to the white house but wished to establish it through legislation not executive order54 in the national science and technology policy organization and priorities act of 1976 pl 94282 signed into law by president ford on may 11 1976 congress established ostp within the executive office of the president as result ostp reports to both congress and the white house further from the ford administration until today all presidents have had an ostp with stable organizational structure and director who also serves as the presidents science advisor the role and influence of this office however has varied among administrations depending both on the president

individual can be required to testify before congress unlike someone who is only appointed apst whom congress may not require to testify due to executive privilege perhaps more important distinction is whom the science advisor represents61 is it the role of the science advisor to serve as an advocate and voice of the president or is the science advisors role instead to make the president aware of the views of the st community in regards to national policy or is the science advisor to provide their personal views on an st policy issue to the president or is it combination of the three past science advisors have undertaken all of these roles for example george keyworth who served during the reagan administration is generally viewed as an advocate of that administrations policies on the

its decisions the st community provides this knowledge to the judiciary through its writings and expert testimony examples of cases where scientific and technical knowledge can be useful include product liability medical malpractice and environmental litigation as well as public policy debates such as differences of opinion between political parties regarding elections and voting that involve statistical analysis while the science and engineering research community is constantly refining its theories through empirical testing the judiciary must make decisions based on the scientific facts at particular point in time the judiciary also makes decisions that influence that same science and engineering community76 as supreme court justice stephen breyer states the practice of science depends on sound law law that at minimum supports science by offering the scientist breathing space within which he or she may search freely for the truth on which all knowledge depends it is equally true that the law itself increasingly requires access to sound science this need arises because society is becoming more dependent for its wellbeing on scientifically complex technology so to an increasing degree this technology underlies legal issues of importance to all of us we see this conclusion illustrated throughout the legal system77 the us supreme court has determined when judges should assess the reliability of the scientific methodology and reasoning that supports expert testimony78 at 2006 workshop some experts expressed concerns regarding the judiciarys use of scientific evidence and expertise including whether courts sufficiently recognize minority views in science appreciate differences among the sciences in collecting validating and synthesizing evidence understand that much of the available research relates to populations rather than to individuals and that complex questions may arise in extrapolating data to particular person define validity in way that corresponds with the scientific communitys understanding of the term 76 carnegie commission on science technology and government science and technology in judicial decision making creating

experts case service to assist federal and state judges administrative law judges and arbitrators in identifying highly qualified scientists engineers and healthcare professionals to serve as scientific experts81 the judiciary system can also influence science and technology in science the courts are involved with two types of cases those involving charges of scientific misconduct such as research with human subjects and those related to religious or moral opposition to particular kinds of scientific research or the teaching of science such as biotechnology research or the teaching of evolution in schools82 judiciary activities related to technology focus on issues such as patent policy particularly for emerging technologies when research discovery moves from the realm of basic research to something that can be patented an example in this area is supreme court decision to allow patenting of genetically engineered microorganism83 what organizations provide science and technology advice to policymakers the amount of scientific and technical knowledge and data produced by the st community can be sometimes be overwhelming given the nature of the scientific and engineering research enterprise which relies on system of peer review and replication organizations that provide scientific and technical advice to policymakers can help provide an overview and synthesis of scientific and technical knowledge and data and provide their view of consensus of the st community the science and engineering community however is not represented by one individual or organization on matters of scientific and technical knowledge and guidance its opinions are consensusbased with groups of scientists and engineers coming together from different perspectives to debate an issue based on the available empirical evidence in the end consensus is achieved if there is widespread 79 ibid 80 for more information see httpwwwfjcgovpublichomensf 81 for more information see

conveyed to policymakers so they can determine among other factors whether or not to take policy actions in response if there are major disagreements within large portions of the community however the lack of consensus adds to the uncertainty facing policymakers responding to concern several organizations when requested by the federal government or congress provide formal science and technology policy advice federal advisory committees congressionally chartered honorific organizations and federally funded research and development corporations these organizations are constantly changing see

addition many other organizations and individuals policy institutes the public professional organizations and disciplinary societies universities and colleges advocacy special interest industry trade associations and labor also provide their thoughts see figure 5 these organizations may agree on the scientific and technical knowledge but disagree on what actions to take in response on an st policy as their values on proposed policy may differ for example there may be agreement that action needs to be taken in response to concerns about climate change but proposed policy responses may range from calls for additional research to emission reductions to gasoline tax if the groups agree on general policy response such as emission reduction they may still disagree on the best way to achieve that goal these organizations described below use variety of mechanisms including papers reports and events to convey information to policymakers federal advisory committees federal advisory committees

to the director acd89 epas science advisory board sab and dods defense science board dsb90 not all government executives however decide to have such advisory committees for example although the secretary of energy had science advisory board for many years it was disbanded in 200691 the general services administration gsa committee management secretariat conducts an ongoing review to evaluate whether advisory committees are fulfilling the purpose for which they were established the number of committees and committee members varies from year to year but ranges from 9001100 committees with over 50000 committee members that provide advice to over 50 departments and agencies in almost all cases committee members do not receive any federal compensation for their advice other than their travel and per diem expenses congressionally chartered honorific organizations another source of st policy advice are honorific nonprofit organizations chartered by congress92 the chief of these is the national academy of sciences nas established by congressional charter approved by abraham lincoln in 1863 to provide independent advice on science and technology matters93 the nas is private nonprofit organization whose new members are elected by current members 87 for more information about the nsb see httpwwwnsfgovnsbaboutindexjsp 88 see the most recent edition at national science board

academy of engineering nae and the institute of medicine known collectively as the national academies issue approximately 200 reports year on wide range of science and technology topics some of these reports are issued in response to congressional requests either in law via letter or through informal discussions through its operating arm the national research council the national academies develop reports through committee process that includes an extensive review process all committee members serve on committees pro bono but the academy needs funding for staff and support before congressionallyrequested study can proceed reports requested by congress are generally funded through federal agency but there is requirement for them to do so unless funding is appropriated for this purpose94 another honorific organization that sometimes issues reports related to st policy is the national academy of public administration napa napa is an independent nonprofit organization established by congressional charter in 1984 pl 98257 fellows are elected by their peers and include policy makers public administrators scholars of public policy and public administration business executives labor leaders current and former cabinet officers members of congress governors mayors state legislators and diplomats napas mission focuses on issues related to improving the effectiveness and administration of government often in response to congressional request for example napa has examined the administration and performance of nasa in response to congressional committee the process and funding of congressionally requested studies is similar to that of the national academies95 federally funded research and development corporations ffrdcs ffrdcs are notforprofit organizations financed on solesource basis exclusively or substantially by an agency of the federal government each center is administered through contract with the sponsoring federal agency by either an industrial firm university or nonprofit institution96 as of may 2007 there were 38 ffrdcs97 doe sponsors the majority followed by dod the other federal agencies sponsoring ffrdcs include hhs dhs nasa nsf nuclear

called the critical technologies institute in 1991 rand managed stpi from 1993 until 2003 when ida took over stpi international intergovernmental organizations international intergovernmental organizations also provide st policy advice the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd established in 1961 brings together the governments of countries committed to democracy and the market economy from around the world to support sustainable economic growth boost employment raise living standards maintain financial stability assist other countries economic development and contribute to growth in world trade98 thirty countries including the united states are members of the oecd oecd provides comparative data and policy analysis for its member countries founded in 1945 the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco promotes international cooperation among its 193 member states and six associate members in the fields of education science culture and communication99 unescos st policy activities have two strategic objectives improving human security by better management of the environment and social change and enhancing scientific technical and human capacities to participate in the emerging knowledge societies100 another office involved in st policy is the united nations office for outer space affairs unoosa this office provides forum for intergovernmental discussions on space policy primarily through the committee on the peaceful uses of outer space copuos and manages discussions through its 98 oecd about the oecd

using space technology for development101 an organization active on current issue with high science and technology salience is the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc which received nobel prize in 2007 for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about manmade climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change102 the world meteorological organization wmo and the united nations environment programme unep established the ipcc as scientific intergovernmental body to provide an assessment of the causes of climate change its potential environmental and socioeconomic consequences and the adaptation and mitigation options to respond to it other sources of advice policy institutes policy institute sometimes referred to as think tank is an organization that provides policy analysis and advice think tank reports may be authored by individual scholars teams of scholars or committees many think tanks are nonprofit organizations and some are funded by interest groups some are disciplinary focused some promote particular point of view on policies while and others profess to be neutral some have large staff and are wellfunded others consist of just few staff members and have limited funding referring to report from particular think tank will often create an image in peoples mind as to the policy perspective that may influence the analysis represented in that report some think tanks that work to maintain sustained expertise in st policy include resources for the future the center for strategic and international studies public citizen the world resources institute woodrow wilson international center for scholars urban institute and the council on competitiveness examples of think tanks who comment on many policy areas and sometimes on st policy include the american enterprise institute center for american progress the heritage foundation the brookings institution council on foreign relations and the cato institute public and individual opinion leaders public opinion about science and technology influences st policy decisionmaking the degree to which the public is willing to invest federal funds in research whose outcome is uncertain but which has the potential of enhancing society or solving or ameliorating problems reflects their trust in scientists engineers and health professionals the public also influences whether or not research is conducted in certain fields of research such as embryonic stem cell research research methods such as the use of animals in laboratory research and stem education public attitudes can also influence public 101 for more information on unoosa see httpwwwunoosaorgoosaenoosa indexhtml 102 norwegian nobel prize institute webpage at httpnobelpeaceprizeorgeng_lau_ listhtml crs37 policies related to the application of technology such as the use of genetically modified organisms as agricultural crops or irradiated foods103 based on nsf surveys the majority of americans believe the benefits of scientific research outweigh harmful results science and technology makes our lives healthier easier and more comfortable more opportunities will be available for the next generation due to science and technology americans depend too much on science and too little on faith and the federal government should fund basic research104 in 2006 the percentage of americans who profess great deal of confidence in the leaders of the scientific community was 41 second only to military leaders at 47105 on the other hand many americans do not give correct answers to basic factual questions about science and the scientific inquiry process are skeptical of some established scientific ideas even when they have some basic familiarity with the idea and are receptive to including nonscientific views in science classrooms106 on occasion individual opinion leaders become major spokesperson on an st policy topic although they do not represent particular organization they have often held in the past leadership positions in government business industry or nongovernmental organizations that have heightened their visibility and prominence on an issue an example of such an individual is colin powell former secretary of state who often speaks on behalf of himself rather than an organization professional organizations and disciplinary societies many scientific and engineering professional organizations and disciplinary societies are active in the st policy decisionmaking process the goals of the organization or society are generally to advance and highlight research in their professions or fields the nonprofit organizations and societies in turn represent the views of their members in congress amongst many other activities according to one assessment there are over 3000 such organizations worldwide107 although these groups do have selfinterest this does not necessarily imply that

collapse about the nations deteriorating infrastructure108 professional organization is an organization whose goal is to advance particular profession examples of professional organizations include the national science teachers association nsta the national society of teachers of mathematics nstm and the national society of professional engineers nspe professional organizations conduct activities similar to disciplinary societies as well as in some cases offering professional certification activities the goal of science and engineering disciplinary society is to advance that field of science engineering or multidisciplinary field for example the mission of the american physical society aps is to advance and diffuse the knowledge of physics109 the american chemical society acs objective is to encourage the advancement of chemistry promote research in chemical science and industry improve the qualifications and usefulness of chemists increase and diffuse chemical knowledge promote scientific interests and inquiry and foster public welfare and education the mission of the american association for the advancement of science aaas is to represent the community broadly and advance science engineering and innovation throughout the world for the benefit of all people110 examples of other disciplinary societies active in the washington dc area include the federation of societies in experimental biology faseb the american mathematical society ams the american geophysical union agu asce the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee and the american society of mechanical engineers asme there are also organizations that represent st professionals but which are not limited to particular disciplines for example some organizations focus on enhancing the status of women and underrepresented groups in science and engineering such as the association of women in science awis the society of women engineers swe the national action council for minorities in engineering nacme and the center for the advancement of hispanics in science and engineering education cahsee many of the major science and engineering societies and professional organizations sponsor congressional fellowships where individuals with science and engineering backgrounds have an opportunity to spend time learning about congressional policymaking while they in turn provide scientific and technical expertise and analysis for members of congress in general fellowships last for one year with the fellows acting as special assistants in legislative and policy areas that would benefit from scientific and engineering input any congressional office may 108 american society of civil engineers report card on americas infrastructure at

societies111 universities and colleges universities colleges and other postsecondary educational institutions are also active in science and technology policy these organizations issue educational materials and position statements to support their points of view on variety of issues some universities have washington dc offices and others have washington representatives who monitor the status of congressional activities that might impact their institution examples include the university of california and the massachusetts institute of technology in addition there are about 50 organizations that represent postsecondary institutions112 these include the american council on education ace the association of american universities aau the national association of state universities and land grant colleges nasulgc the association of american colleges and universities aacu council of graduate schools cgs and the association of american medical colleges aamc ace serves as the umbrella organization by developing consensus amongst all these organizations on higher education policy issues aau represents the major research universities and nasulgc represents state universities and land grant colleges aacu focuses on liberal113 undergraduate education cgs on graduate education and aamc on medical education in addition some organizations may focus on specific topic for example the council on government relations cogr focuses on the financial and administrative aspects of federally funded research universities and colleges may be simultaneously active in many of these organizations advocacy special interest or action groups advocacy special interest or action groups are individuals or organizations whose goal is to influence public policy or decisionmaking on an

the union of concerned scientists federation of american scientists and the center for science in the public interest as well as issuespecific organizations such as research america that advocates for increased funding for health research and the natural resources defense council that advocates on environmental policy issues there are also coalitions where number of organizations work together on particular issue such as the task force on the future of american innovation where industry and academia advocate for increased federal support for research in the physical sciences and engineering many of these organizations have scientists and engineers on their staff who help the organization base their positions on their views of scientific evidence as opposed to rhetoric while some believe it is appropriate and critical for scientists and engineers to take positions on public policy issues others believe it is inappropriate and that scientists and engineers should be careful to separate their personal viewpoints from their professional obligations so they remain neutral and do not influence their research activities some professional organizations and disciplinary societies may take middle ground taking positions on particular issues but clearly separating their lobbying activities from their educational activities industry and trade associations to represent its point of view in washington dc an industrial company has several options it may represent its point of view individually either through washington office or in its congressional district or it may work with other industries in trade association or other organization focused on business trade association is an association of people or companies in particular business or trade or chamber of commerce organized to promote their common interests115 examples of trade associations that may speak on st issues include the us chamber of commerce the national association of manufacturers the biotechnology industry organization the electronic industries alliance the american petroleum institute and the american chemistry council labor labor groups may also influence st decisionmaking labor group may be professional association discussed above or labor union many of these groups are interested in safety issues for example how knowledgeintensive and manufacturing industries can enhance the safety of workers what scientific and technical research can tell workers about their safety and how science and technology can enhance worker safety an example of labor union active in this area is the american federation of labor and congress of industrial organizations aflcio voluntary federation of 55 national and international labor unions labor groups are also interested in influencing decisions that impact their job market and their ability to compete for employment such as immigration issues or 115 for more information on trade associations and their political activities see crs

professional organizations see earlier description are also active on these issues examples include the programmers guild the american engineering association and the ieee labor unions that are active include the washington alliance of technology workers and the communication workers of america faculty graduate students and postdoctoral scholars also advocate for their views in washington dc and on university campuses as part of labor groups or professional organizations for example the national postdoctoral association is professional organization that represents postdoctoral scholars and the

knowledge and policy analysis for policymakers in congress and the executive branch has not been smooth progression as noted earlier the first executivecreated organization psac was abolished then statutorily resurrected similarly the perceived need for technical assistance led to the statutory creation of two postworld war ii agencies that were effectively closed down due to lack of an appropriation for their operation in the 1990s the office of technology assessment ota congressionalsupport agency and the administrative conference of the united states acus an independent agency of the federal government also charged with providing advice to congress congress established ota in 1972 to assess the consequences of applying technology by preparing comprehensive reports that discussed the pros and cons of policy options about an issue the law created support agency to provide objective and authoritative analysis of complex scientific and technical issues to aid in policymaking it was intended to facilitate congressional access to expertise and permit legislators to consider objectively information presented by the executive branch interest groups and other stakeholders to controversial policy questions ota was effectively eliminated when congress did not appropriate funds for fy1996 for its continued operation and appropriated funds to close down the office congress established acus in 1964 to promote improvements in the efficiency adequacy and fairness of procedures by which federal agencies conduct regulatory programs administer grants and benefits and perform related governmental functions the conference conducted research and issued reports on st policy issues such as making statement on effective decisionmaking techniques for the evaluation of scientific studies based on an evaluation of the fdas public board of inquiry procedures when there are disputes regarding scientific studies as with ota the conference was terminated in fy1996 when funds were appropriated for its closure although reauthorized in 2004 funds were appropriated and this authorization expired on september 30 2007 there are recurring congressional discussions regarding the revival of these organizations in the 110th congress s 1602 proposes to authorize appropriations for ota and hr 3564 proposes to authorize appropriations for acus hr 3564

technology policy decisionmaking process this primer on st policy decisionmaking provides an overview how science and technology influences policy and how policy influences st policy the report also describes the major sources of knowledge and advice for policymakers in surveying this landscape it is perhaps worthwhile to also reflect on the opportunities and challenges facing the current st policy decisionmaking process science and technology policy decisionmaking is both democratic and decentralized in other words many organizations and individuals representing wide array of ideas and opinions participate in st policy decisionmaking one organization or individual is viewed as speaking on behalf of the entire scientific and technical community either inside or outside the federal government each freely offers sources of knowledge and advice this provides policymakers with an overwhelming amount of information and it can be challenging to sort through it all to determine which information is the most germane to particular issue or decision communication between policymakers and the science and engineering community can also be challenge due to fundamentally different perspectives regardless of the issue in addition the science and engineering community may find it challenging to recognize that the information they provide is only one factor in policymakers decision process which can include cultural economic and other values another challenge is that many federal government agencies can simultaneously influence st policy issue agencies often have overlapping roles that can influence assessments of risk allocation of responsibility problemsolving and patterns of participation117 for example federal decisionmaking regarding nuclear power includes nuclear regulatory commission safety and design federal power commission rate bases and authority occupational safety health administration worker safety environmental protection agency environmental impact studies department of energy nuclear power research and development federal emergency management agency nuclear power plant emergency department of homeland security federal bureau of investigation federal aviation administration us coast guard and others nuclear power plant security and department of transportation shipment of radioactive materials118 117 richard barke science technology and public policy washington dc congressional quarterly 1986 118 ibid modified based on information at the nuclear regulatory commission website at continued crs44 critics of the current st policy decisionmaking process say it can be challenging to make logical and consistent policies as each of these federal agencies may assess the risk of given policy from different perspective without unified assessment119 there are many organizations and individuals in congress the judicial branch state and local governments and outside of government such as industry advocacy groups think tanks and others who also offer their thoughts on any given st policy as result this diversity leads some experts to believe that st policy decisions can not be made coherently and consistently further some critics say that public policies do not always reflect what is known about science and technology and neither policymakers nor the public have sufficient understanding to make appropriate decisions120 reliance on experts may help policymakers make decisions but some express concerns that the experts themselves are unable to separate their personal biases sufficiently to provide an independent analysis of the situation for example on climate change some have expressed concerns that some scientists are unable to separate their personal beliefs regarding public policy when providing the results of their research to policymakers121 in addition experts do not always agree with one another due to the inherent uncertainty in science as result policymakers may find it challenging to obtain sufficiently clear answer for decisionmaking policymakers must often decide whether to make choice on current assessment of the costs and benefits of taking action based on imperfect information or to await additional scientific and technical information moreover while scientific knowledge and technological development is changing constantly the same is not always true of public policy as result policies developed number of years ago may not reflect the latest scientific and technological knowledge finally critics say that accountability for political decisions can also be challenge122 the decentralized nature of st policy decisionmaking can make it challenging to separate sources of advice and make those providing advice accountable for example member of congress may rely on presidential appointee who in turn relies on his or her science and engineering staff that staff may develop their opinion based on federal advisory committees and experts outside the federal government who in turn rely on peer reviews of the work of individual scientists and engineers who are not able to be held accountable to the public for public policies based on their knowledge and guidance 118 continued httpwwwnrcgov 119 ibid 120 ibid 121 see for example edward j wegman david w scott and yasmin h said ad hoc committee report on the hockey stick global climate reconstruction at httpwwwclimateauditorgpdfothers07142006_wegman_reportpdf p 65 122 richard barke science technology and public policy washington dc congressional quarterly 1986 crs45 despite these challenges scientific and technical knowledge and advice has the potential of being useful in making decisions related to public policy policymakers have an opportunity to make their decisions based on the best knowledge and guidance available along with the other factors they must take into account perhaps one way to recognize the value of scientific and technical knowledge and guidance in the policymaking process is to think of the many countries in which policymakers must make decisions with limited scientific and technical advice an intuitive sense can only go so far in such situations while scientific and technical knowledge and guidance can help policymakers assess the potential risk and benefits of decision they make so that societal and economic benefits are enhanced and losses are mitigated for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34454
