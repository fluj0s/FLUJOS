rules adopted by senate committees publications on procedure from committees and offices of the senate eg enactment of law document prepared by the senate parliamentarian and rules of the senates

applicable when using and evaluating information from these sources the report next takes up the senates official parliamentary reference sources these are documents that set forth authoritative statements of senate rules procedures and precedents senators often cite these official reference sources when raising point of order or defending against one this report discusses the following

the document and are annotated to indicate special features and components although some of these excerpts are not drawn from the most recent edition of the source in question they illustrate the same format and other features retained in the current editions number of additional publications of committees and other offices of the senate which do not themselves constitute parliamentary authorities

46128 crs staff 75700 also can assist with clarifying senate rules and procedures crs3 principles of senate parliamentary practice the senate applies the regulations set forth in its various parliamentary authorities in accordance with several principles that remain generally applicable across the entire range of parliamentary situations among these principles may be listed the following 1 senate procedures derive from multiple sources 2 the senate has the constitutional power to make its own rules of procedure 3 senators often must initiate enforcement of their rules 4 the senate conducts much of its business by unanimous consent 5 the senate usually follows its precedents and 6 the senate adheres to many informal practices each of these principles is discussed below multiple sources of senate procedure the standing rules of the senate may be the most obvious source of senate parliamentary procedure but they are by means the only one other sources of senate procedures include requirements imposed by the constitution particularly those in article i section 5 standing orders of the senate precedents of the senate statutory provisions that establish procedural requirements hereafter referred to as rulemaking statutes rules of procedure adopted by each committee rules of the senates party conferences procedural agreements entered into by unanimous consent and informal practices that the senate adheres to by custom in order to answer question about senate procedure it often is necessary to take account of several of these sources for example rule xix of the senates standing rules provides that the presiding officer shall recognize the senator who shall first address him1 when several senators seek recognition at the same time however there is precedent that priority of recognition shall be accorded to the majority leader and minority leader the majority manager and minority manager in that order2 this precedential principle sometimes can have significant consequences on the senate floor for example it gives the majority leader the opportunity to offer the debateending motion to table or to propose seconddegree amendments to unfriendly firstdegree amendments 1 rule xix in us congress senate senate manual s doc 1071 107th cong 1st sess prepared by committee on rules and administration washington gpo 2002 sec 19 2 floyd m riddick and alan s frumin riddicks senate procedure precedents and practices sdoc 10128 101st cong 2nd sess washington gpo 1992 p 1098 crs4 constitutional rulemaking authority of the senate article i of the constitution gives the senate the authority to determine its rules of procedure there are two dimensions to the senates constitutional rulemaking authority first the senate can decide what rules should govern its procedures the senate exercises this rulemaking power when it adopts an amendment to the standing rules or creates new standing rule by majority vote the senate also uses its rulemaking power when it creates standing orders and when it enacts rule making provisions of statutes such as the congressional budget and impoundment act of 1974 standing orders and rulemaking provisions of law have the same standing and effect as the senates standing rules because all are created through an exercise of the senates constitutional rulemaking authority the second dimension to the senates rulemaking authority is that the chamber can decide when its rules of procedure should not govern in practical terms this means the senate can waive its rules by unanimous consent under provision of senate rule v the body can also suspend its rules by twothirds vote although this course is procedurally difficult and rarely taken the senate has established means to supersede its rules by majority vote an option that is available to the house through the adoption of special rule3 the senate can achieve the effect of waiving rule if majority votes to overrule decision of the presiding officer to sustain point of order or not to sustain point of order that the presiding officer has submitted to the full body for decision4 action of this kind however not only sets the rule aside for the immediate situation but thereby establishes precedent that will govern subsequent rulings of the presiding officer interpreting the meaning and applicability of that rule in some cases decisions of the senate on points of order have had the effect of rendering rule unenforceable in its previous generally accepted sense enforcing the senate rules and precedents the senates presiding officer whether it is the vice president or senator of the majority party does not always call to the chambers attention that violation of senate rules is taking place5 the senate often can violate its procedures unless senator makes point of order at the right moment that the proposed action violates the standing rules or precedents constitutional provision or source of procedure 3 special rules are resolutions reported by the house rules committee that usually specify how measure is to be considered on the floor once the house adopts special rule by majority vote it governs consideration of the measure special rules often waive procedural requirements imposed by the rules of the house or rulemaking statutes 4 section 904 of the congressional budget act establishes procedure by which the senate can vote to waive certain budgetrelated prohibitions and requirements in an individual case by majority vote or by threefifths vote of all senators 5 an important exception occurs when the senate is operating under cloture when this happens the precedents provide that the presiding officer has the authority to rule all dilatory motions out of order on his own initiative see senate rule xxii paragraph 2 in senate manual sec 222 crs5 that has the same authority as standing rule ie standing order rulemaking statute or unanimous consent agreement when point of order is raised the presiding officer usually makes ruling without debate under rule xx the presiding officer has the option of submitting any question of order for the decision of the senate he rarely does this but may do so if the existing rules and precedents do not speak clearly on the parliamentary question at hand in such cases the presiding officer will often invite debate on the question of order the presiding officer must submit two types of questions of order to the senate for it to decide first under rule xvi paragraph 4 the senate decides questions concerning the germaneness or relevance of most amendments to appropriations bills and does so without debate second according to the senates precedents the senate is to decide all constitutional questions with debate usually allowed6 this practice rests on the principle that the presiding officer possesses authority only over the interpretation of procedures established by the senate and only the senate itself possesses any such authority in relation to the constitution any senator can appeal the ruling of the presiding officer on question of order the senate then decides usually by majority vote to uphold or overturn the presiding officers decision this vote usually establishes precedent that guides the presiding officer in deciding future questions of order unless and until this precedent is overturned by another decision of the senate or by rules change some rulemaking statutes require supermajority vote to overturn on appeal the presiding officers ruling on point of order7 senators are much more likely than representatives to appeal decisions of their presiding officer this difference in the practices of the two chambers arises largely because the officer who presides over the proceedings of the house of representatives is either the speaker of the house who is the elected leader of the majority party or her designee an appeal of the decision of the chair on point of order could thus be viewed as vote against the speakers leadership this situation does not arise in the senate because the constitutional presiding officer of the senate is the vice president who is not elected as leader of senate majority parliamentary actions taken on the basis of an informal practice or rule of one of the senates party conferences are not enforceable on the senate floor while informal practices and party conference rules can affect senate committee and floor action they are not invoked through an exercise of the senates constitutional rule making authority hence they do not have the same authority as senate rules and procedures informal practices evolve over the years as custom and party conference rules are adopted and enforced by each party 6 riddicks senate procedure pp 989 and 14911492 7 for examples of provisions that would require such supermajority see section 904d of the congressional budget act pl 93344 as amended 2 usc 621 note crs6 the senates reliance on unanimous consent the senates standing rules emphasize the rights of individual senators in particular by affording each senator the right to debate at length and the right to offer amendments even if they are not relevant to the bill under consideration it would be impossible for the senate to act on legislation in timely fashion if senators always exercised these two powerful rights for this and other reasons the senate often agrees by unanimous consent to operate outside its standing rules in practice senate business is frequently conducted under unanimous consent agreements known as time agreements when they include limits on the time for debating measures amendments motions or other questions these agreements also may structure the amendment process and require the germaneness or relevance of amendments unanimous consent agreements may be used to bring up measure8 to define how the measure will be considered on the floor and to control how the senate will consider individual amendments given the fact that it takes only one senator to object to unanimous consent agreement each agreement is carefully crafted by the majority leader in consultation with the minority leader leaders of the committee that reported the bill in question and other senators who have indicated particular interest in the legislation the agreement is then formally propounded on the floor usually again by the majority leader and takes effect if senator objects once entered into consent agreement has the same authority as the senates standing rules and is enforceable on the senate floor consent agreements have the effect of changing all senate rules and precedents that are contrary to the terms of the agreement9 one could argue that these agreements are even stronger than the standing rules because once entered into they can be altered only by further unanimous consent this is more rigorous threshold than the majority vote requirement for changing the senates standing rules the importance of precedents the published precedents of the senate expound the ways in which the senate has interpreted and applied its rules the precedents both complement and supplement the rules of the senate as illustrated earlier by the example of according priority recognition to the majority leader the close interplay between the precedents and the standing rules often makes it necessary to consult the precedents for guidance on how rules are to be understood the brevity of the senates standing rules often makes the bodys precedents particularly important as determinant of proceedings precedents are analogous to case law in their effect just as attorneys in court will cite previous judicial decisions to support their arguments senators will cite 8 body of precedents has developed on how unanimous consent agreements are to be interpreted and applied in different procedural situations these precedents are covered in riddicks senate procedure pp 13111369 the majority leader often calls up measure by unanimous consent rather than by offering motion to proceed to consideration of the measure the motion to proceed is usually debatable and hence open to filibuster 9 riddicks senate procedure p 1311 crs7 precedents of the senate to support point of order or defend against one or to argue for or against an appeal of the presiding officers ruling on point of order similarly the presiding officer will often support his or her ruling by citing the precedents in this way precedents influence the manner in which current senate rules are applied by relating past decisions to the specific case before the chamber precedents usually are established when the senate votes on questions of order ie on point of order that the presiding officer has submitted to the body or on whether to uphold or overturn ruling of the presiding officer or when the presiding officer decides question of order and this ruling is not appealed historically the senate follows such precedents until the senate in its wisdom should reverse or modify that decision10 precedents also can be created when the presiding officer responds to parliamentary inquiry precedents do not carry equal weight inasmuch as the senate itself has the ultimate constitutional authority over its own rules precedents reflecting the judgment of the full senate are considered the most authoritative accordingly precedents based on vote of the senate have more weight than those based on rulings of the presiding officer responses of the presiding officer to parliamentary inquiries have even less weight because they are subject to process of appeal through which the full senate could confirm or contest them in addition more recent precedents generally have greater weight than earlier ones and precedent that reflects an established pattern of rulings will have more weight than precedent that is isolated in its effect all precedents also must be evaluated in the historical context of the senates rules and practices at the time the precedents were established senators seeking precedents to support or rebut an argument may consult the senate parliamentarians office 46128 the senates unofficial practices some senate procedural actions are based on unofficial practices that have evolved over the years and become accepted custom these practices do not have the same standing as the chambers rules nor are they compiled in any written source of authority although these unofficial practices cannot be enforced on the senate floor many of them are well established and customarily followed some contemporary examples of unofficial practices include respecting holds that individual senators sometimes place on consideration of specific measures and giving the majority leader or his designee the prerogative to offer motions to proceed to the consideration of bill to recess or to adjourn 10 riddicks senate procedure p 987 crs8 the senate manual and authorities it contains senate manual the senate manual compiles in single document many of the chief official parliamentary authorities of the senate several of which are not readily available in any other current publication11 the publication prepared under the auspices of the senate committee on rules and administration appears periodically in new edition as senate

sources in which the authority is also presented the manual also contains general table of contents and an index which are less detailed in their references to the respective components than are the special tables of contents and indexes when present individual provisions of each procedural authority are assigned section numbers that run throughout the manual in single sequence often with gaps between the end of one section and the start of the next and that always appear in bold type the section numbers assigned to the standing rules correspond to the numbers of the rules themselves for

code of standing rules at the beginning of each new congress but instead has always regarded its rules as continuing in effect without having to be readopted13 the senate follows this practice on grounds that it is continuing body inasmuch as only onethird of its membership enters on new terms of office after every biennial election so that quorum is continuous changes to the standing rules are proposed in the form of senate resolutions which can be adopted by majority vote at the start of the 110th congress there were 44 standing rules of the senate the standing rules of the senate are

on its rules and customary practices as well as its precedents it is organized around procedural topics which are presented in alphabetical order for each procedural topic the volume first presents summary of the general principles governing that topic followed by the text of relevant standing rules constitutional provisions or rulemaking provisions of statute summaries of the principles established by individual precedents are then presented under subject headings organized in alphabetical order the summaries rarely exceed one sentence many of the subject headings are further divided

after cloture which is further divided into 18 topics such as drafted improperly and filing of amendments footnotes provide citations to the date the congress and the session when each precedent was established and to the congressional record or senate journal pages where readers can locate the pertinent proceedings eg july 28 1916 641 record pp 1174850 footnote citations beginning with the word

httpwwwgpoaccessgovriddickindexhtml crs21 crs22 crs23 crs24 crs25 rulemaking statutes and budget resolutions as already noted the constitutional grant to each chamber of congress of authority over its own rules permits the senate to establish procedural regulations through simple resolutions which are adopted through action of the originating chamber alone in certain cases nevertheless the senate institutes procedures through provisions included in statutory measures bills and joint resolutions which can become effective only through agreement between both houses and presentation to the president or through concurrent resolutions which require agreement between both houses given that these procedures are created through an exercise of each chambers constitutional rulemaking authority they have the same standing as senate and house rules statute or concurrent resolution that contains rule making provisions in this sense usually also incorporates section titled exercise of rulemaking power which asserts the rulemaking authority of each chamber by declaring that the pertinent provisions shall be considered as part of the rules of each house and are subject to being changed in the same manner as in the case of any other rule of such house21 that is for example by adoption of simple resolution of the senate in the senate statutory rulemaking provisions are principally of three kinds 1 those derived from legislative reorganization acts 2 those establishing expedited procedures for consideration of specific classes of measure and 3 those derived from the congressional budget act and related statutes governing the budget process in addition provisions regulating action in the senate or house of representatives or both in the congressional budget process are often contained in congressional budget resolutions which are concurrent resolutions adopted pursuant to the congressional budget act rulemaking provisions of most of these kinds are not comprehensively compiled in any document of the senate and where such compilation exists the provisions applicable to the senate can most readily be found only by referring to the statutes or concurrent resolutions themselves legislative reorganization acts the legislative reorganization act of 1946 pl 79601 60 stat 812 and the legislative reorganization act of 1970 pl 91510 84 stat 1140 are important rulemaking statutes that affected legislative procedures many rulemaking provisions in these statutes were later incorporated into the senates standing rules and some others appear in the compilation of laws relating to the senate presented in the senate manual as discussed earlier expedited procedures the term rulemaking statute is most often used in connection with laws that include provisions specifying legislative procedures to be followed in the senate or the house or both in connection with the consideration of class of measure also specified by the statute this type of rulemaking statute commonly referred to as expedited procedures or fast track provisions defines special procedures for congressional approval or disapproval of specified actions proposed to be taken by the executive branch or independent 21 for example sec 904a1 and 904a2 of the congressional budget and impoundment act of 1974 pl 93344 crs26 agencies wellknown examples include 1 the trade authorities procedures for considering legislation approving trade agreements which were originally established by the trade act of 197422 2 the procedures for congressional consideration of the recommendations of base closure commission under the defense base closure and realignment act of 199023 and 3 the procedures for senate action on resolutions disapproving of agency regulations under the congressional review act24 many of these rulemaking provisions are set forth under the heading legislative procedures enacted in law in the house manual25 this house compilation however does not include certain statutes that establish procedures for the senate alone and presents some statutes in form that omits procedural provisions pertaining only to the senate budget process statutes three of the most important rulemaking statutes define specific procedures for considering budgetary legislation the congressional budget and impoundment act of 1974 commonly known as the congressional budget act the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act the socalled grammrudmanhollings act and the budget enforcement act of 1990 for example section 305b of the congressional budget act defines senate floor procedures for considering the annual congressional budget resolution an excerpt from section 305b appears on the following page in general rulemaking provisions of these statutes are set forth in budget process law annotated discussed below procedural provisions in budget resolutions the chief purpose of the concurrent resolution on the budget that the congressional budget act requires congress to adopt each year is to set spending revenue and deficit targets for the fiscal year and to allocate spending budget authority and outlays subject to those targets among budgetary functional categories in recent years however the senate has often also included in this congressional budget resolution supplementary procedural regulations to govern subsequent action on spending bills or other budget related measures the procedures established by these provisions may be made applicable only to the coming years budgetary action but are often established as permanent procedures and are subsequently altered or abolished only by further action in subsequent budget resolution nevertheless they are not comprehensively compiled in any single source and may best be identified by examining the texts of adopted congressional budget resolutions for successive years many of the procedural provisions in congressional budget resolutions institute new points of order that like those established by the budget act itself are available against budgetary measures or provisions contained in these measures for 22 19 usc 21912194 23 10 usc 2687 24 5 usc 801804 25 us congress house

senate also establishes standing orders by agreeing to unanimous consent requests these agreements usually make the standing orders effective only for the duration of congress or some other limited period it has come to be the practice of the senate to adopt an established package of these standing orders at the beginning of each successive congress standing orders of this kind are not included in the senate manual but appear only in the congressional record on the day they are adopted for example on the first day of the 110th congress in 2007 the senate adopted 12 unanimous consent

agreements establish conditions for floor consideration of specified measures which in relation to those measures override the regulations established by the standing rules and other senate parliamentary authorities commonly for example agreements of this kind may set the time for taking up or for voting on the measure limit the time available for debate in which case they are sometimes referred to as time agreements or specify what amendments and other motions are in order these consent agreements constitute parliamentary authorities of the senate because once propounded and
