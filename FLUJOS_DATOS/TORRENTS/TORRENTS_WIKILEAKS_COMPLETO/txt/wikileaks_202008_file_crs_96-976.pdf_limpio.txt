states are to receive larger portio n6 of funds appropriations law for many years has stipulated that 78 of funds be distributed to national organizations and 22 to states this has been longstanding issue in th 1978 reauthorization of the older americans act the senate labor and human resources committ ee expressed concern about thecircumvention by the appropriations committe of the authorizing committee formula in more recent action on the funding split for fy1997 the house appropriation s committee proposed to increase the amount of funding allocated to states to 35 of th total thereby reducing funds to n ational organizations to 65 this action was taken in part based on recognition that the house authorizing committee was moving toward transferring all title v funding to the states however in final action on fy1997 appropriations pl 104208 cong ress continued to stipulate the 7822 split for national organizations and states as it has done in the past the modifications to the program were debated during markup of the bills by the hous e7 eeo committee and the senate labor and human resources committee in the 104th congress with certain members of the committees voicing objections to the propose d restructuring some members were concerned about the bills approach to completely turn over the program to the states and that such transition could be disruptive to enrollees there was also concern that there would be loss of the national organizations expertis in administering the program an amendmen t to s 1643 to maintain direct award of funding to nationa l organizations by the federal government offered by senator mikulski during the labor and human resources committee markup was not approved senator mikulski stated that th continued22 to 50 in addition the bill would have required that funds to nationa l6 organizations be awarded on competitive basis this approach is in part based on goal of reducing the number of nationa l organizations that operate in each state and of giving states more control in th administration and coordination of the program national organizations receiv funds to administer the program in all but three states in many states multipl national org anizations administer programs in addition to designated state agency some state agencies have been concerned about the duplication of nationa l organiza tions activities that affect the distribution of employment positions withi n state in its report gao noted that there is inequitable distribution of fundin g within some states as well as duplica tion of effort among national and state sponsors proponents of the approach to equalize funds for national organizations an d states indicate that costs of program administration and duplication of effort within states would decrease since there would be fewer orga nizations that would administer the program in some states proponents also say that giving states more leverage in funding decisions would increase coordination of effort among all grantees in states the restructuring of the senior community service employment progra m generated substantial contr oversy during the 104 congress some existing nationalth grantees expressed concern that their continued existence would be threatened i f more program funding were to be shifted to states and if states rather than th federal government were to make decisions about which organizations would b grantees they were also concerned that restructuring could result in disruption f jobs for som existing enrollees number of organizations and some members of7httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96976crs9 continued7 restructuring of the title v program would be revisited when s 1643 reached the senat floor similar amendment was proposed by representative kildee during the markup f hr 2570 but was also rejected by the eeo committee congress indicated that the program has operated well under the nationa l organizations administration and that because of the longstanding association of some of the organizations with the program they have expertise to continu administering the majority of funds formu allocations to grantees tile v funding is distributed to nationa l organizat ions and states using combination of factors including hold harmless for employm ent positions held by national organizations in each state in 1978 an d formula ba sed on states relative share of persons aged 55 and over and per capita income in fy1998 57 of funds were distributed according to the hold harmless provision 252 million out of 4402 million for july 1 1998june 30 199 9 program year the balance is distribute d according to each states relative population of persons aged 55 and over and per capita income because the hold harmles s provision is based on 1978 statebystate distribution of positions held by national organizat ions it does not ensure equitable distribution of funds based on relativ measures of age and per capita income in its report on the program ga recommended that if congress wishes to ensure equitable distribution of funds i t should consider eliminating or amending the hold harmless provision the formul in hr 4099 builds upon the current methodology but it woul d have moved the hold harmless amount to 1998 the bill would have required tha t funds for fy1999fy2003 be distributed to states based on the share of funds they received in fy1998 any funds appropriated in excess of the fy1998 level woul d have been distributed on the basis of s tates relative share of persons age 55 and over and per capita income funds would have then been distributed to nationa l organizations and to state agencies as described above use of funds for enrollee wagesfringe benefits adm inistration and other enrollee costs currently fun ds are used for 1 enrollee wages and fringe benefits 2 administration and 3 other enrollee costs dol regulations require that at least 75 of funds be used for enrollee wages and fringe benefits the law specifies that grantees are allowed to use up to 135 of federal funds for administration and up to 15 in certain circumstances any remaining funds may be used for othe r enrollee costs that under current dol regulations may include recruitment an d orientation of enrollees and supportive services for enrollees among other things in its review gao found that most national organizations and some state sponsors had budgeted administrative costs in excess of the statutory limit by inappropriately classifying them as other enrollee costs hr 4099 would have established new minimum amount of grant funds that must be used for enrollee wages and fringe benefits specify limit on othe r enrollee costs and redefine such costs first it would have required that minimum of 85 of grantees funds be used for enrollee wages and fringe benefits compared to 75 in dol regul ations of these funds up to 5 could be used forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96976crs10 development of performance stan dards for the program was also discussed during the 1048 th congress during markup of the senate bill by the committee on labor and huma n resources senator mikulski introduced an amendment that would have established certain performance standards for the program there is usually twoyear time lag in availability of estimates of state population fro m9 the us census bureau therefore for example 1998 funding allotments relied on 199 6 state population estimates other enrollee costs the bill would have defined these as costs for employment related counseling supportive services and transportation this approach wa s designed to limit funds for administration by prohibiting funds categorized as other enrollee costs to be used for administration the bill would have retained the same limit on administrative costs as in current law that is up to 135 of grantees funds with waiver up to 15 if approved by the secretary under this approach grantees would have paid for enrolle assessments and training from their administrative costs performance standards hr 4099 would have required the secretary f labor to publish regulations establishing performance standards the standard s8 would have included requirements that at least 20 of participants are placed in unsubsidized employment and that they remain in unsubsidized jobs for at least 4 months after placement there be specific per centage reduction in participants dependency on public assistance as result of program participation specific percentage f participants receive employment and training through other federal state and local training programs and there be specific percentage increase in employment opportunities i n underserved areas the bill also specifies penalties and adjustment to grants if grantees fail to meet the standards interstate funding formula for supportive and nutrition service s the way in which aoa distributes nutrition and supportive funds to state s continued to be at issued during the 105 congress as it had during the 104th th congress current law requires the administration n aging aoa to distribute title iii funds for supportive and nutrition services to states based on their relative share of the popul ation aged 60 and older in addition to specifying certain minimu m funding amounts the law contains hol d harmless provision requiring that state receive less than it received in fy1987 aoa distributes funds for supportive and nutrition services in the followin g way first sta tes are allotted funds in an amount equal to their fy1987 allocations which were based on estimates of states relative share of the total us population in 1985 second the balance f the appropriation is allotted to states based on their9 relative share of the population aged 60 and over as derived from the most recentlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96976crs11 us general accounting office older americans act title iii funds not distributed10 according to statute gaohehs9437 january 1994 the senate committeeapproved bill would have taken different approach to changin g11 the formula it would have based allotments for supportive and nutrition services on tw factors composite measure that attempts to capture the relative size of states relativ elderly inneed ein percentage and measure of states relative total taxabl resources compared to the states relative einavailable estimates of state population and third state allotments are adjusted t assure that the minimum grant req uirements are met the effect of this methodology is that the majority of funds re distributed according to population estimates that do not reflect the most recent population trends for ex ample for fy1998 84 of total title iii funds were distributed according to the fy1987 hold harmless th remainder of f unds appropriated was distributed according to 1996 population data the method that aoa uses to meet the 1987 hold harmless provision s received some scrutiny in 1994 report gao concluded that title iii funds are not distributed according to the requirements of the statute gao concluded that the10 method employed by aoa does not distribute funds proportionately according t states relative share of the older population based on the most recent populatio n data and therefore negatively affects state s whose older population is growing faster than others gao recomme nded that aoa revise its method to allot funds to states first on the basis of the most current population estimates and then adjust th allotments to meet the hold harmless and statutory minimum requirements hr 4099 would have followed the gao recommendation by requiring tha t funds be distribu ted first according to the most recent data on states relative share of persons 60 years and older the bill then stipulated that state would receiv less than it received in fy1998 thereby creating 1998 hold harmless requirement the intent of this approach was to have more of total funding distributed according to the most rec ent population data as total funding increases over the fy1998 level but at the same time assuring that states allotme nts would not go below their fy1998 levels the actual effect of this approach in fy1999 would have been that state s would have generally received approximately the same amount as they received i n fy1998 because funding for nutrition and supportive services did not increas between those years hr 4099 differed from the 104 congress house committeereported bill th which would have gradually eliminated the 1987 hold harmless requirement over period of years some states were concerned about this approach indicating tha t without hold harmless provision they would have lost funds hr 4099s hol d harmless provision may have ameliorated concerns of some states that would hav lost funds under the 104 congress billth 11 targeting of services to lowincome minority older persons targeting of services to lowincome minority older persons continued to be subject of review during the 105th congress as it has during past reauthorization s of the act current law contains num erous requirements that state and area agencieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96976crs12 on aging target services to persons in greatest social and economic need wit h particular attention on lowincome minority older persons it also requires that the agencies set specific objectives for serving lowincome minority older persons an d that program development advocacy and outreach efforts be focused on thes groups service providers are required to meet specific objectives set by are agencies for providing services to lowincome minority older persons and are agencies are required to describe in their area plans how they have met thes objectives the house bill as introduced in the 104 congress would have retaine dth requirements that the title iii p rogram focus on older persons who have the greatest social and economic need but would hav deleted number of provisions on specific targeting on lowincome minority older persons that are in current law thes deletion s were debated during markup of the bill by the eeo committee n amendme nt to the bill that would have restored certain targeting requirement s contained in current law was rejected hr 4099 contains targeting provisions that are si milar to those contained in the 104 congress house committeereported bill but also co ntains other references thatth were not in the committeereported bill it would have required that 1 stat agencies develop formula to distribute funds within the state taking into accoun t the geographical distribution of older individuals with greatest social or economi c need 2 preference be given to providing services to older individuals with greatest social and economic need with particular attention to lowincome minority olde r individuals 3 state and area agencies evaluate the need for services by olde r individuals with the greatest social and economic need with particular attention t lowincome older individuals and 4 state and area agencies conduct outreach t older individuals with the greatest social and economic need and to lowincom older individuals the bill did not contain all references to lowincome minority older individuals that are in current law therefore the targeting issue continued to be debated during the 105 congressth costsharing for services by older persons one of the most frequent issues to arise in past reauthorization legislation s been whether the act should allow mandator cost sharing for certain social services under current law and regulations mandatory fees are prohibited but nutrition and supportive services providers are allowed to solicit voluntary contributions fro m older persons toward the costs of services older persons ma not be denied service because they will not or cannot make contribution funds collected throug h voluntary contributi ons are to be used to expand services in the past congress has resisted any attempts to allow older americans act programs to charge fees fo r services hr 4099 would have allowed states to apply cost sharing to most title ii i services on sliding scale basis it would have prohibited cost sharing for certai n services these are information and assistance outreach benefits counseling case management and ombudsman and other protective services it would hav prohibited states from imposing cost sharing on individuals with low income shttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96976crs13 defined by the state but lower than 125 of the federal poverty level and would have required that incomes of older persons be termined on selfdeclaration basis it would have prohibited states from denying older persons services because of n inability to pay an d would have continued to allow older persons to make voluntary contribut ions for services as under current law this costsharing provision is th same as t hat in the 104 house committeeapproved bill the administrations billth for the 104 congress also proposed new provision on costsharing it containedth some of the same elements as the house and senatecommittee approved
