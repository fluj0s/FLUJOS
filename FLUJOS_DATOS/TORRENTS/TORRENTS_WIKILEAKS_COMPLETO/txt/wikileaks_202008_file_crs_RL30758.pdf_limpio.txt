science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30758alternative transportati on fuels and vehicles energy environment and development issues summary the sharp increase in petroleum prices beginning in mid1999 experiences with tighter supply and international inst ability have renewed concern about our dependence on petroleum imports one of the strategies for reducing this dependence is to produce vehicles that run on alternatives to gasoline and diesel fuel these alternatives include alcohols gaseous fuels renewable fu els electricity and fuels derived from coal the push to deve lop alternative fuels although driven by energy security concerns has been aided by concerns over the environment because many alternative fuels lead to reductions in emissions of toxic chemicals ozone forming compounds and other polluta nts as well as greenhouse gases each fuel and associated vehicle has various advantages and drawbacks the key drawback of all alternative fuels is that because of higher fuel andor vehicle prices alternative fuel vehicles afvs are generally more expensive to own than conventional vehicles nd while many afvs have superior environmental performance compared to conventional vehicl their performance in terms of range cargo capacity and ease of fueling may not compare favorably with conventional vehicles furthermor because there is little fuelin g infrastructure as compared to gasoline and diesel fuel ling an afv can be inconvenient any policy to support afvs must addre ss the performance and cost concerns as well as the issue of fueling infrastructure within this context chicken and egg dilemma stands out the vehicles w ill not become popular without the fueling infrastructure and the fueling infrastructure will not expand if there are customers to serve three key laws the alternative moto r fuels act of 1988 pl 100494 the clean air act amendments of 1990 pl 101549 and the energy policy act of 1992 pl 102486 as well as three executiv orders support the development and commercialization of alternative fuels and alte rnative fuel vehicles these legislative acts and administrative actions provide tax incentives to purchase afvs promote the expansion of alternative fueling infrastru cture and require the use of afvs by various public and private entities the 108th congress considered comprehensive energy legislation but final bill was not submitted to the president for signature hr 6 would have promoted the development of renewable fuel s especially ethanol and hy drogen further it would have provided incentives for the developmen t and purchase of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles in addition to the energy b ill other bills were introduced to create vehicle purchase tax credits promote research and development of fuels and require the use of alternative fuels it is likely that similar legislation will be introduced in the 109th congress this report reviews these issues it will be updated as

transportation fuels and vehicles energy environment and development issues introduction is there any practical replacement for gasoline and diesel fuel in automobiles since the oil crises of the 1970s and the ri in the awareness of environmental and security issues policy makers have often c onsidered this question for many reasons the united states has searched for alternat ives to petroleum fuels these reasons include limiting dependence on imported petroleum controlling the emissions of pollutants into the air and limiting the emissions of greenhouse gases several fuels are considered alternative transportation fuels by the federal government these fuels are electricity na tural gas propane liquefied petroleum gas or lpg ethanol methanol biodiesel and hydrogen some of these fuels are similar to conventional fuels and can be used in conven tional vehicles with little or modification to the vehicle however some of these fuels are significantly different and require the use of completely different engi ne fuel and drive systems consequently cost as well as performance of the associated alternative fuel vehicles afvs must be part of the discussion key factors in the u ltimate success or failure of any alternative fuel include the relative cost of the fuel the ability to develop and expand fueling stations and the pe rformance and safety of the fuel for various reasons notably cost performance and availability alternative fuels have yet to play major transportati on role in the united states many argue that the government must step in congress recent administrations and state governments have instituted some key programs to promote the use of alternative fuels these programs include tax incentives for the purchase of alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles afvs purchas requirements for government and private fleets and research grants for the study of alternative fuels despite these efforts only about 480 million gallons1 of alternative fuels we re consumed in 2004 just 03 of motor fuel demand 136 billion gall ons of gasoline and 36 billion gallons of diesel2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30758crs2 legislative background the three most important statutes concerning alternative fuels are the alternative motor fuels act of 1988 mfa pl 100494 the clean air act amendments of 1990 caaa pl 101549 and the energy policy act of 1992 epact pl 102486 amfa promoted fe deral government use of alcohol and natural gasfueled vehicles epact requires that federal and state agencies as well as private firms that distribute alternative fuels must purchase for their fleets certain proportion of vehicles that are capable of being fueled by specific non petroleum fuels furthermore epact gran ts the department of energy doe the authority to make similar re quirements of local governme nts and private fleets in addition epact provides tax incentives for private purchases both individual and commercial of afvs caaa requires gove rnment and private fleets in cities with significant air quality problems to us lowemission clean fuel vehicles in addition to these laws recent executive orders have also shaped alternative fuels policy in the united states thes include eo 12844 which urged federal agencies to exceed epact purchase requi rements eo 13031 which required that federal agencies meet epact requireme nts regardless of budg et and eo 13149 which aims to drastically reduce federal government petroleum consumption through the use of afvs and hybrid vehicles the major alternative fuels legislation and relevant executive orders are summarized in table 1 and discussed further below table 1 history of us alternative fuel vehicle policies policy year key provisions alternative motor fuels act 42 usc

alternative fuels 7 pl 102486 sections 303 501 and 507the alternative motor fuels act of 1988 beginning in fy1990 the alternative mo tor fuels act called for the federal government to acquire the maximum prac ticable number of lig htduty alcohol and natural gas vehicles in addition amfa established an interagency commission on alternative motor fuels to develop national alternative fuels policy the act also established commercial dem onstration program to study the use of alcohol and natural gas in heavy duty trucks ce 1991 doe has supported projects in these areas making the data publicly available through its alternative fuels data center afdc3 the clean air act amendments of 1990 the clean air act amendments of 1990 established the clean fuel fleet program cffp4 this program requires cities with significant air quality problems to promote vehicles that meet clean fuel emissions standards in metropolitan areas in extreme severe or rious nonattainment for ozone5 or carbon monoxide fleets of 10 lightduty vehicles or more face purchase requirements s imilar to those for epact discussed below however under cffp conventional vehicles are admissible if they meet national low emi ssion vehicle lev standards another key difference between the cffp requireme nts and the epact requirements is that under cffp vehicle must always be opera ted on the fuel for which it was certified for example if dualfuel ethanol vehicle is certified lev using ethanol but not using gasoline the vehicle must be operate d solely on ethanol this provision avoids perceived loophole in epact the energy policy act of 1992 the energy policy act of 1992 was enacted to promote energy efficiency and energy independence in the united states it includes programs that require or promote alternative fuel vehicles as well as commercial and domestic energy efficiency natural gas imports and nucl ear power two key programs concerning alternative fuels are the afv purchase require ments for federal st ate and alternative fuel provider6 fleets and the afv tax incentives fleet requirements epact7 requires that certain percentage of new light duty vehicles passenger cars and light trucks purchased for certain fleets must behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30758crs4 8 epact defines an alternative fuel as any fuel the secretary of energy determines by rule is substantially not petroleum and would yield substantial energy security benefits and substantial environmental benefits 9 69 federal register 4219 10 some fuels may actually be covered by more than one category for example most ethanol an alcohol fuel is derived from corn or other agricultural products biological materials 11 dedicated operated solely on an alternative fuel 12 dualfuel capable of being operated on both conventional and alternative fuel there are two types of dualfuel vehicles bifuel nd flexible fuel bifuel vehicles can only be operated on one fuel at time while flexible fu vehicles can operate on any mixture of the two fuelsfueled by an alternative fuel8 covered fleets are those th at operate 50 or more light duty vehicles of which at least 20 operate primarily in metropolitan area furthermore the fleets must be capable of being fueled at central location such as the fleet motor pool law enforcement vehicles emergency vehicles combat vehicles nonroad vehicles and vehicles used for testing are exempted from the requirement federal state and alternative fuel provider fleets are currently required to purchase afvs the purchase require ments were phased in between 1997 and 2001 see table 2

law oxyfuel news april 7 2003 17 us general accounting office gao limited progress in acquiring alternative fuel vehicles and reac hing fuel goals february 2000 p 9 18 pl 102486 section 1913there have been mixed results from the program according to doe some federal and state agencies are exceeding their mandates while others are far below their quota as whole the federal g overnment is was compliance in 1998 mainly due to large purchases such as 10000 ethanol vehicles purchased by the us postal service in that year13 however according to co alition of environmental groups the government as whole has failed to comply with epact since then in suit filed by earthjustice14 in san francisco federal court 18 federal agencies are accused of failing to comply with the purchase requirements15 in july 2002 the court ruled that the federal government had vi olated epact further the court required the agencies to compile and make public by janua ry 31 2003 reports on their noncompliance recently the environmental groups filed mo tion that the court find the agencies in contempt earthjustice argues that some agencies have failed to submit reports entirely and that others have submitted unsubstantiated reports16 in addition questions have been raised about the ccess of the program since other covered fleets especially fuel provider fleets have not reported their purchases to doe17 key concern over the fleet requirement s is whether they actually support the goals of epact this is because epact does not require the use of alternative fuels only the purchase of afvs fleets can purchase dualfuel vehicles operate them solely on gasoline or diesel fuel and still meet the epact requirements the fleet program has been criticized because this use of dualfuel vehicles is seen by some as loophole this criticism is another elem ent of the lawsuit filed by earthjustice tax incentives another key provision of epact is set of tax incentives for the purchase of new afvs18 the act provides an electric vehicle ev tax credit of 10 of the purchase price up to maximum of 2000 in 2005 in addition it provides clean fuel vehicle any alte rnative fuel tax deduction of up to 1000 in 2005 for lightduty vehicles with larger ductions for heavier vehicles vehicles are not eligible for both incentives and vehicles purchased to meet mandated fleet requirements are ineligible for either incentive the ev tax credit and the clean fuel vehicle tax deduction are being phased out and are scheduled to reach zero after 2006httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30758crs6 executive orders three executive orders have also played key role in deve loping alternative fuels policies executive order 12844 i ssued on april 21 1993 urged federal agencies to make every effort to exceed the mandatory purchase requirements set in epact the order argued that the federa l government could provide impetus for the development and manufacture of alternative fuel vehicles and the expansion of fueling stations and other infrastruct ure to support privatelyowned afvs executive order 13031 issued december 13 1996 expanded the administrations policy on epact fleets the order required that federal agencies must comply with epact regardless of th eir budgets the order also required that agencies must submit yearly progress report to the office of management and budget omb along with their yearly budget s further it blished penalties for failing to meet the epact requirements if an agency reported to omb that it did not meet its epact requirements that agency must submit detailed plan for meeting the requirements the next year the order also established credits for the use of medium and heavyduty vehicles nd evs to meet the requirements most recently the administration issued executive order 13149 on april 21 2000 this order presents the goal of re ducing the federal fleet s annual petroleum consumption by 20 below the fy1999 leve l by the end of fy2005 it suggests several strategies for attaining this goal including using alternative fuel vehicles and highefficiency hybrids the order also requires that majority of epact vehicles must be fueled with alternative fuels by fy2005 this helps fix the loophole that allows dualfuel epact ve hicles to operate sole ly on conventional fuel alternative fuels as noted above several fuels are considered alternative fuels this section will address alternative fuels recognized by ep act many technical and market factors affect the usability and ultimate success of these fuels as alternatives to petroleum based fuels since many of these fuels require entirely new engines or extensive modifications to conventional vehicles th characteristics of both alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles must be discussed together fuel cost and fueling infrastructure vehicle cost fuel and vehicle performance and other factors for each fuel will be addressed in turn in the discussion below table 3 presents summary of

latter two supplied by quantum27 cost on geg basis fuel costs for lp g are approximately equal to those of gasoline and tend to fluctuate with gasolin prices although they can fluctuate more dramatically in response to high heating costs or other factors between april 2000 and october 2002 the price for lpg averaged approximately 116 to 19528 per geg while fuel costs are only slightly higher for lpg as compared to gasoline there is an incremental purchase cost fo r an lpg vehicle which ranges between 1000 and 200029 this additional cost covers modi fications to the fuel system and the addition of highpressure fuel tank some of this incremental cost currently may be defrayed by federal state local or manufacturer incentives that promote the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles infrastructure because of its many uses30 the refueling system for lpg is extensive there are approximately 3500 refueling sites in all 50 states31 which corresponds to roughly 3 of the appr oximately 124000 gasoline stations in the united states32 because of its wide use if the demand for lpg as an alternative fuel were to expand it is likely that the suppl infrastructure could expand proportionallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30758crs9 33 california energy commission liquified petroleum gas 34 in the case of passenger car the tank usually reduces available trunk space 35 in fact propane can ignite through sligh tly wider range of concentrations in air than gasoline however the lower flammability limit for lpg is higher than gasoline making it generally more difficult to

under pressure special equipment is required to transfer lpg to vehicle addition of new refueling equipment woul d lead to additional capital costs for retailers performance in terms of environmental performance lpg vehicles tend to produce significantly lower ozoneforming emissions although it can be difficult to quantify the differences according to the california energy commission lpg vehicles emit up to 33 fewer volatile organic compounds vocs 20 less nitrogen oxides nox and 60 less carbon monoxide33 key performance drawback to lpg is the somewhat decreased range as compared to gasoline however because lpg has the highest energy content by volume of the alternative fuels this range reduction is only about 26 further larger lpg vehicles can carry larger ta nk and tend to maintain range of between 300 and 400 miles however to allow longer range payload is diminished due to the size and weight of the lpg tank34 safety lpg has higher ignition temperature than gasoline making it safer in that respect furthermore lpg must be present in greater concentrations than gasoline to ignite35 because lpg is stored under pressure it must be stored in heavyduty tanks in order to prevent failure of the fuel tank lpg tanks must undergo rigorous testing further lpg is odorless so an odorant is added to make it detectable in air36 other issues there are few major issues involving lpg fuels and vehicles other than those issues relevant to all alte rnative fuel vehicles such as the need to expand fueling infrastructure however because lpg is often derived from petroleum refining it may do little to diminish petroleum dependence natural gas natural gas is fossil fuel produced from gas wells or as byproduct of petroleum production natura l gas is composed of hydrocarbons mainly

than for most alternative fuels ther are approximately 900 public cng refueling sites and 60 lng refueling sites in 44 states48 again this number is small compared to the number of gasoline refueling stations however with the extensive natural gas system in the united states the cng refu eling network could be greatly expanded furthermore since slowfill refueling systems are available for home installation consumers could fuel their vehicles overnight and would only need to access public stations on longer trips however becau the technology differs significantly from gasoline pump vehicle users or station ope rators would need to be trained in the use of natural gas pumps performance compared to gasoline vehicles the environmental performance of natural gas vehicles is exceptional particulate emissions are virtually eliminated carbon monoxide emissions are reduced by as much as 65 to 95voc emissions are reduced by up to 80 and nitrogen oxide nox emissions by as much as 3049 furthermore greenhouse gas emissions are also reduced compared with gasoline vehicles50 the key performance drawback to natural gas vehicles is their significantly shorter range most natural gas passe nger cars can only travel 100 to 200 miles on full tank of fuel51 this is significantly less than the range of 300 to 400 miles for most gasolinepowered passenger cars52 for this reason natural gas vehicles have been popular for use as delivery trucks or ot her fleets that operate in cities or other localized areas safety natural gas tends to be safer than gasoline for many reasons first the fuel is nontoxic although in high ga seous concentrations it could lead to asphyxiation second natural gas is more di fficult to ignite than gasoline and tends to dissipate faster due to its lower density however since natural gas is colorless and odorless like lpg an odorant is added to the fuel to make it detectable in air53httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30758crs12 53 continued updated march 10

such high pressure s the rupture of fuel tank would be extremely dangerous for this reason c ng tanks must undergo severe abuse tests such as collisions fires and even gunfire54 other issues besides the environmental bene fits of natural gas another benefit is the fact that over 80 of natural gas used in the united states comes from domestic sources55 therefore it has been argued that natural gas vehicles can help promote energy security in this country by lowering our reliance on imported fuel however because natural gas is used extensively in electricity pr oduction significant increases in its use for transportation coul d result in increased demand for other fuels for electricity biodiesel biodiesel is synthetic diesel fuel th at is produced from fatty feedstocks such as soybean oil and recycled cooking oil56 although more expensive than conventional diesel it has so important advantages the most notable advantage is that because biodiesel is very similar to conventional diesel the fuel can be used in existing diesel engines57 consumption currently us consumption is about 37 million gallons per year58 as compared to approximately 36 b illion gallons per year of conventional diesel59 because biodiesel can be used in existing diesel engines there are vehicles designed specifically for its use cost the most significant drawback to biodiesel is its increased cost as compared to conventional diesel dies pump prices averaged between 115 and 150 per gallon in 200360 at the same time median pump prices for b20 blend of 20 biodiesel in conventional diesel ranged between 129 and 16061 this price difference approximately 8 to 20 cen ts per gallon implies that pure biodiesel costs as much as 100 more per gallon to produce however wholesale biodiesel prices have been dropping due to proce ss improvements and in creases in productionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30758crs13 62 afdc refueling sites 63 afdc biodiesel general information httpwwweereenergygovcleanc

temperatur at which chemical can ignite under normal conditions 66 national biodiesel board general interestscale further in some places where recy cled oil is used wholesale prices of pure biodiesel may actually be lower than for conventional diesel relative to other alternative fuels there is one key cost advantage of biodiesel it can be used in existing diesel vehicl with little or m odification therefore covered epact fleets and others interested in reducing their petroleum consumption and improving their envir onmental performance may use biodiesel without the capital investments nece ssary for other alternative fuels infrastructure because biodiesel is chemica lly very similar to conventional diesel it could be placed in the existing diesel distribution system with only few modifications most importantly since biodiesel is more effective solvent than conventional diesel it can cau deterioration of rubber and polyurethane materials eg seals currently most biodiesel supply involves purchas contracts by fleet owners and delivery of biodiesel to fleet owned dispensing sites however 177 biodiesel refueling stations have opened in 37 states in the past five years62 performance biodiesel is generally mixed with conventional diesel at the 20 level the resulting fuel b20 can be used in existing diesel engines with few or engine modifications higher concen trations can be used however especially with newer equipment the use of biodies b20 or higher concentrations leads to substantial reductions in emissions of vocs carbon monoxide and particulate matter63 however nox emissions tend to increase with the use of biodiesel other than the changes in emissions there seems to be little if any difference in performance between biodiesel and conven tional diesel payl oad and range remain the same and maintenance costs may actually be decreased due to the lower sulfur content of the fuel some minor modifica tions may be necessary with concentrations above 20 due to fact that biodiesel is very effective solvent and can corrode engine seals64 safety there seem to be few additional safety concerns for biodiesel its safety properties are consistent with conve ntional diesel howe ver it does have one advantage over conventional diesel because biodiesel has higher flash point65 than conventional diesel it is more difficult to ignite reducing the risk of fire66 other issues biodiesel currently faces two key issues the first has to do with the tax structure for biodiesel because biodiesel is renewable fuel there hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30758crs14 67 pl 105388 section 312 68 committee backs biodiesel the oil daily august 6 1998 69 for more information on ethanol fuel see crs report rl30369 fuel ethanol

incentive this incentive supporters argue would allow biodi esel to compete and play larger role in our fuel supply in 2004 congress appr oved the american jobs creation act pl 108357 among other provisions the act established tax credit of 100 per gallon for the production and use of biodi esel made from agricultural products the second issue i nvolves 1998 amendment to epact this amendment67 grants credits to owners of covered fleets who purchase biodiesel these credits count toward the purchase requirements fo r alternative fuel vehicles every 450 gallons of biodiesel purchased earns one credit this allows fleet owners to meet their epact requirements without purchasin g new vehicles and without modifying their existing fueling infrastructure environmentalists have charged that because the fuel is then blended at the 20 level there is little impact on oil consumption or vehicle emissions68 ethanol69 ethanol or ethyl alcohol is an alcohol made by fermenting and distilling simple sugars70 ethyl alcohol is in alcoholic bevera ges and it is denatured made unfit for human consumption when used for fuel or industrial purposes although the broadest current use of fuel ethanol in the united states is as an additive in gasoline in purer forms it can also be used as an alternative to gasoline it is produced and consumed mostly in the midwest wher corn the main feedstock for ethanol production is produced when used as an alternative fuel ethanol is usually blended with gasoline at ratio of 85 ethanol to make e85 as with other alternative fuels there are many benefits but also drawbacks associated with its use consumption ethanol is the most commonly used alternative fuel although most of this is blended at the 10 level with 90 gasoline to make e10 or gasohol including its use in gasohol 2004 ethanol consumption was approximately 31 billion gallons or 20 billion geg this corresponds to approximately 1 of annual gasoline consumption however e10 is not recognized by epact as an alternative fuel because its widespread use does not significantly diminish gasoline consumption consumption of e85 which is recognized by epact is relatively low only about 22 million geg of e85 were consumed in 2004 although consumption has steadily increased since 199271httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30758crs15 72 eia alternatives to traditional transportation fuels

some components eg seals must be replaced 78 afdc refueling sitesas of 2004 there were approximately 146000 e85 vehicles being fueled primarily by ethanol in use in the united states72 this number has been growing but is still negligible against the total num ber of conventional vehicles on the road however many e85 vehicles can be fueled with e85 gasoline or any mixture of the two there are many more of these flexible fuel vehicles ffv than dedicated ethanol vehicles models of some popul ar production vehicles including the ford explorer and ford taurus now have e85gasoline flexible fuel capability standard other vehicles with the option of ffv capability include the dodge caravan the chevrolet silverado pickup and the mercedesbenz c240 sedan73 the energy information administration estimates th at approximately 41 million ethanol ffvs were on the road in 2003 it is expected that the vast majority of these vehicles will be fueled with gasoline however it is possible that the greater availability of ffvs will spur the market for ethanol fuel in 2002 the federal government operated approximately 53000 ethanol ffvs although most of these are fueled with gasoline cost one of the key drawbacks to the us of ethanol is its cost per gallon median e85 retail prices rang ed from approximately 084 to 14174 between april 2000 and october 2002 in terms of geg ethanol costs ranged between 116 and 19575 when blended with gasoline ethanol benefits from an exemption to the motor fuels excise tax76 this benefit makes ethanol competitive with gasoline as blending agent in fact when used to make e10 the exemption is nominal 52 cents per gallon of pure ethanol however for n eat fuels the exemption is much less only nominal 64 cents per gallon of pure ethanol for e85 while fuel costs are higher for e85 ther is little if any incremental vehicle cost77 further ownership and maintenance costs tend to be equal for ethanol and gasoline vehicles infrastructure most of the current infrastru cture for the delivery of ethanol is in the form of tanker trucks used to liver ethanol to terminals for blending with gasoline however there were 205 e85 re fueling sites nationa lly as of december 2004 mostly in the midwest where ethanol is produced78 since there is experience in storing and delivering ethanol and since the fueling systems are similar to gasoline the refueling infrastructure could expand to meet increased demand if the delivery costs were reducedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30758crs16 79 california energy commission ethanol powered vehicles updated november 3

kovski study defends fuel efficien cy of ethanol while another notes emissions of pollutants the oil daily march 9 1998 p 6performance because of its lower energy content the key performance drawback of ethanol is lower fuel economy fuel economy is reduced by approximately 29 resulting in reduced range however this reduction in range can be mitigated somewhat by increasing fuel tank size with the associated drawbacks of larger tank another problem with etha nol is that in cold weather an ethanol powered vehicle may be difficult to start for this reason most ethanol that is used in purer forms is e85 the 15 gasoline allows for easier ignition under coldstart conditions there are few other technical concerns over the performance of ethanol because of the relatively few modifications necessary to operate vehicle on ethanol there are key environmental advantages to ethanol as well as some drawbacks ethanolpowered vehicles tend to emit 30 to 50 percent less ozoneforming compounds than similar gasolinepowered ve hicles including significant reductions in carbon monoxide emissions79 in addition ethanol tends to have much lower content of toxic compounds such as benzen and toluene leading to lower emissions of most toxic compounds however etha nolpowered vehicles tend to emit more formaldehyde and acetaldehyde80 although these emissions can be largely controlled through the use of advan ced catalytic converters81 another key environmental advantage with ethanol is its relatively low life cycle greenhouse gas emissions82 ethanolpowered vehicles tend to emit lower levels of greenhouse gases than gasoline vehi cles also the growth process of the ethanol feedstock results in uptake of carbon dioxide further reducing net greenhouse gas emissions conversely when the raw materials and practices used to produce the feedstock and the fuel are taken into account emissions for both fuels are increased according to study by ar gonne national laboratory the use of e85 results in 14 to 19 reduction in lif ecycle greenhouse gas emissions and with advances in technology this reduction c ould be as high as 70 to 90 by 201083 however other studies cite lower efficiency in the ethanol fuel cycle leading to smaller reductions in greenhouse gas emissions84 safety fuel ethanol tends to be safer than gasoline at normal temperatures e85 is less flammable than

is less visible than gasoline flame it is still easily visible in daylight85 other issues the most significant issue surrounding ethanol is the exemption from the motor fuels excise ta x because few producers control majority of ethanol producti on capacity in the united states the exemption has been called corporate welfare by its opponents proponents of the exemption argue that it helps support farmers through increased demand for their product and helps compensate for added economic value from benefits to the environment and to energy security because ethanol is produced from domestic crops86 because of concerns over the fact that the exemption lowers receipts to the highway trust fund an income tax credit for ethanol blending was inserted into the american jobs creation act pl 108357 the act replaces th existing exemption with tax credit paid from the general treasury as opposed to the highway trust fund another key issue is the possible deve lopment of renewable fuels standard rfs an rfs would require the use of set amount or percentage of renewable fuel in gasoline although there are severa l potential fuels that could be used to meet the standard including biodiesel it is lik ely that most of the requirement would be met with ethanol blended at th 10 level or lower it has been argued that an rfs would promote agricultural production and ssen the need for imported oil critics argue that the standard would increase gasoline prices with little effect on oil imports legislative proposals on an rfs are discussed below in the section on congressional action methanol methanol the simplest alcohol is also called wood alcohol87 it is usually derived from natural gas but can also be rived from coal or biomass as fuel methanol is most often used as ble nd with gasoline called m85 85 methanol 15 gasoline although the fuel can also be used in an almost pure neat form called m100 in addition to general tran sportation indianapolistype race cars use methanol exclusively as motor fuel it has many benefits but also many drawbacks consumption because of its drawbacks methanol consumption is relatively low in 2004 03 million geg of methanol were consumed88 this corresponds to roughly 11000th of 1 of the approximately 133 billion gallons of gasoline demand methanol consumption peaked in 1996 and has decreased

because of methanols limited use current price data are not readily available 92 based on 177 gallons of m85 per geg 93 afdc refueling sites 94 in contrast gasoline is usually shipped in pipelines from the refinery to distribution terminal where tanker trucks transport the fuel to the fueling stations this distribution network is considerably more cost effec tive than relying solely on tanker trucksthere are few methanolpowered vehicles operating in the united states consistent with the decline in metha nol consumption after peak in 1996 the number of m85 and m100 vehicles has d eclined there were approximately 4600 methanol vehicles in 2004 the federa l government operate d only 70 methanol fueled vehicles in 200389 the major automobile manufacturers have not sold methanolpowered production cars since model year 200190 cost notable concern with methanol is its cost per geg methanol tends to be more expensive than gasoline as of january 1 2000 the price for methanol was between 095 and 120 per gallon91 however due to the lower energy content of methanol the fuel cost roughly 173 to 210 per geg92 in addition to the fuel cost incremental vehicle cost is higher with the use of methanol the incremental cost for the purchase of methanolfueled vehicle or the conversion of an existing gasolinefuel ed vehicle can range from 500 to 2000 though some of this incremental cost currently may be defrayed by purchase incentives the most notable part of the incremental cost is replacing parts such as certain seals that may be corroded by alcohol infrastructure another barrier to the wide use of methanol as motor fuel is the lack of fueling infrastructure while there were few public methanol refueling stations these stations have closed in recent years currently the department of energy does not list any public refueling sites for methanol93 this lack of infrastructure makes it difficult for the methanol vehicle market to expand in fact due to lack of mand methanol infrastructure s declined in the past few years however existing gasoline tanks and pumping equipment could be readily converted to store and liver methanol and vehicl users would experience little difference between methanol pump and gasoline pump because methanol can be produced fro m natural gas and petroleum raw material shortage would be unlikely if methanol cons umption increased however in terms of delivery to stations most methanol is transported by tanker truck from the methanol plant94 this delivery method tends to be less flexible and more costly compared to the existing gasoline infrastructure which relies primarily on pipeline delivery methanol cannot travel through pipelines due to its physical propertieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30758crs19 95 california energy

hybr id electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles see crs report rl30484 advanced vehicle technologies energy environment and development issuesperformance one of the key benefits of methanol vehicles is improved environmental performance over gasoline vehicles m85 vehicles tend to emit 30 to 50 less ozoneforming compounds and while formaldehyde emissions tend to be higher with methanol than gasoline m85 vehicles would likely be able to meet new emissions standards95 key performance drawback with methanol vehicles is reduction in vehicle range since it requires 177 gallons of meth anol to equal the energy in 1 gallon of gasoline range per gallon is decreased by approximately 40 by increasing the size of the fuel tank the loss of range can be significantly improved or even eliminated however larger fuel tank would decrease fuel economy and cargo space safety on the whole methanol fuel is safer than gasoline since methanol vapor is only slightly heavier than air vapors disperse quickly compared to gasoline furthermore methanol vapors must be more concentrated than gasoline to ignite and methanol fires release less heat since thanol burns with light blue flame one key drawback is that in bright daylight it may be difficult to see methanol fire although it may be possible to add colorants to the fuel96 fuel cells methanol has been touted as potential step from gasoline to hydrogen in fuel cell vehicles because the fueling infrastructure is similar to gasoline while the fuel is much cleaner97 fuel cells are type of power system that generates electricity from hydrogen or hydrog enbearing compound without combustion the chemical process is highly efficient and drastically reduces vehicle emissions98 for more information on fuel cells see crs report rl30484 advanced vehicle technologies energy environm ent and development issues another potential advantage of methanol is that it can be derived from biomass waste products research is ongoing nd there have been few smallscale demonstration projects at ndfills if methanol is produced instead from fossil fuel resources it may be less likely to promote energy independence electricity99 an electric vehicle ev is powered by an electric motor as opposed to an internal combustion engine energy is supplied to the motor by set of rechargeable batteries when the vehicle is not be ing used

vehicle zev however there are emissions from electricity production associated with electric vehi cles when the entire fuel cycle is considered pollutant emissions from evs are still low relative to gasoline vehicles like other afvs however there are key cost and performance drawbacks associated with these vehicles consumption approximately 12 million geg of electric fuel were consumed in the united states in 2004 by approximately 56000 electric vehicles100 most of these vehicles were located in ca lifornia and several m odels were available exclusively in that state one of the most popular evs was the general motors gm ev1 although gm has discontinued pr oducti on of the vehicle and has r ecalled all of its leases due to limited consumer acceptance of the vehicles other manufacturers have also discontinued production of their electric vehicles101 the federal government opera ted approximately 1300 electric vehicles in 2003102 cost electric fuel is considerably less expensive than using gasoline about 25 to 33 cents per mile as opposed to 4 to 6 cents per mile for gasoline vehicle103 despite the fuel cost advantages major drawback with evs is the incrementalvehicle purchase cost which can be as much as 20000 most of this cost is related to the batteries which are very expensive to produce 104 infrastructure there are very few electric recharging sites in the united states currently there are about 700 r echarging sites mostly in california105 with the extensive nature of the electricity infrastructure in the united states there are few technical barriers to expanding ev recharging sites however with existing technology only few vehicl can access single charger in one day as opposed to gasoline pump which can serve new vehicle

ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30758crs21 106 the fuel mix plays key role in the overa ll fuelcycle emissions for electric vehicles because power plant emissions can vary greatly depending on the fuel

electric vehiclestoxic and ozoneforming pollutants106 depending on the fuel mix for local electric power generation overa ll emissions can be decreased by 90 or more as compared to gasoline vehicles107 major performance drawback of evs is their relatively short range on full charge an electric vehicl can travel between 50 and 130 miles as opposed to range of 300 to 400 miles with conventional vehicle108 another drawback is that fueling an electric ve hicle takes between 3 and 8 hours as opposed to few minutes for conventional vehicle109 safety few additional safety issues are associated with electric vehicles because chemicals are transferred during fu eling there is risk of spillage or inhalation and with existing recharging system s electric shocks are unlikely in the event of an accident there is combustible fuel so there is danger of fire or explosion however because of the acid c ontained in some type s of batteries there could be concern over acid leaks if batteries were to rupture in collision further because of the higher current in the electrical systems there is increased potential for shock to emergency responders in the case of collision fuel cell and hybrid vehicles while batterypowered electric vehicles tend to be very expensive and have many other drawback s there is growing interest in fuel cell and hybrid electric vehicles research into batteries electric drivetrains and lightweight materials will play key role in the development of evs as well as both hybrid and fuel cell vehicle technology for more detailed discussion of fuel cell and hybrid t echnologies see crs report rl30484 advanced vehicle technologies energy environm ent and development issues fuel cell vehicles unlike conventional vehicl fuel cell vehicle uses chemical reaction as opposed to combusti on to produce electricity to power an electric motor unlike batterypowered ev fuel cell vehicles have fuel tank eliminating the long recharging time these systems can be very efficient although the technology is far from commercializa tion few auto manufacturers have offered small number of fuel cell vehicles for lease in model year 2004 and several other manufacturers plan to introduce fuel cell vehicles in the next few years it is expected that these vehicles will be leased to corporations and that the lease costs will be relatively high compa red to conventional vehicles hybrid electric vehicles hybrid electric vehicle combines an electric motor with gasoline or diesel engine this combination leads to very high fuel efficiency and low emissions while avoidi ng some of the problems associated with pure electric vehicles most hybrids operate solely on conventional fuel with the engine providing power to the wheels and to an electric generator

purchase of hybrids although none of these b ills passed their respective comm ittees see section below on congressional action 112 the chemical formula for hydrogen gas is h2 113 the chemical formula for water is h2otherefore hybrids can be fueled as quickly and conveniently as conventional vehicles while achieving even longer ranges total of seven production ve hicles are expected to be available by early 2005 and most of the major car companies plan to have hybrid models available in the next few years110 although hybrid electric vehicl are not considered afvs for compliance with epact requirements because they utilize conventional fuel they do qualify for clean fuel vehicle tax deduction the environmental performance of hybrids has led to congre ssional interest in larger incentives to promote their commercialization111 hydrogen due to its presence in water hydrogen is abundant although it does not appear in pure form in any significant quantity112 the hydrogen in water can be separated from oxygen through process called hydrolysis113 other key hydrogen sources are fossil fuels and other hydrocarbons hydrogen fuel is of interest because it can be used in zeroemission fuel cell because hydrogen fuel can be stored in sufficient quantity onboard the vehicle fuel cellpower ed electric ve hicles do not face some of the range and fueling limitations as batterypowered electric vehicles currently production vehicles are pow ered by pure hydrogen although all of the major domestic and foreign automobile manufacturers are researching hydrogen fuel cells and few have introduced limited number of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles for lease in model year 2004 howe ver it is possible that the first publicly available fuel cell vehicles will be operated on liquid fuel such as gasoline or methanol because these fuels are much easier to deliver and are more readily available at present see above section on methanol in his january 28 2003 state of the union address president bush announced new fiveyear 720 million research and velopment initiative for hydrogen fuel this initiative is intended to complement the freedomcar initiative which focuses on the development of fuel cell vehicles the administrations plan would dedicate total of 18 billion over five years for hydrogen and fuel cells among other provisions the conference committee report on hr 6 the comprehensive energy bill in the 108th congress would have authorized total of 215 billion for the initiatives the administration requested 257 million in fy2004 for these initiatives however while congress approved an increase of 50 million overhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30758crs23 114 pl 108108 and pl 108137 for more information on these in itiatives see crs report rs21442 hydrogen and

appropriate d 261 million slightly below th administrations request115 consumption currently hydrogen fuel consumption is very low in fact the energy information administration does not report us hydrogen consumption in its alternatives to traditional transportation fuels cost storage and delivery of hydrogen are complicated because at standard temperatures and pressures hydrogen gas has very low density therefore the fuel must be compressed stored in liquid form or stored in some other manner eg bonded with other chemicals or stored in container with complex geometry currently each of these storage options has its drawbacks which can include safety cost and the ability to store nough hydrogen onboard the vehicle to provide acceptable range in addition to the increased cost of st oring hydrogen fuel on vehicle other system componets are currently prohibitively expensive it is estimated that fuel cell for passenger car applications is roughly 10 times more expensive than conventional engine at todays costs howe ver it is expected that with technological advances and the use of mass production the price of fuel cell system will decrease in the future currently because hydrogen is produced in very low quantities for fuel use it is used most as process chemical in petroleum refining it is considerably more expensive than gasoline at current prices further because the infrastructure to deliver hydrogen is vastly different from petroleum infrastructure expanding hydrogen delivery will also be complicated and likely expensive infrastructure there is very little infrastructure to deliver hydrogen fuel and most current facilities are in place to serve small demonstration nd test fleets as was stated above expanding hydrogen infrastructure will likely be expensive performance the potential environmental performance of hydrogen fuel could exceed all other alternative fuels fuel cells are significantly more efficient than gasoline engines and the only emissions from hydrogen fuel cells are heat and water vapor however the fuel cycle missions from the production of hydrogen fuel could diminish its environmental performance depending on the primary fuel used for example if produced from solar ener gy the total fuel cycle pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions could be very low or even zero but if fossil fuels are burned or reformed to generate hydrog depending on whether emissions are captured total emissions could equal or even exceed those of efficient gasoline and diesel vehicles therefore the ultima feedstock for hydrogen production has become significant policy concernhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30758crs24 116 in fact while the fuels themselves may result in lower vehicle emissions the processes for converting coal to liquid fuel tends to lead to high pollutant emissions 117 nicholas p chowey coal conv ersion keeps itself relevant chemical engineering september 1998 p 35safety there are some key safety concerns and some likely benefits from the use of hydrogen fuel because of its low density in air hydrogen fuel is likely to dissipate quickly in an open area reducing sa fety concerns further hydrogen rises which may make it less likely than other fuels to lead to asphyxiation if released in an enclosed area however when hydr ogen does burn the flame is transparent further hydrogen is highly reactive and in the presence of leak the fuel can be ignited with small spark of static electricity other concerns include the safety of highpressure or lowtemperature onboard fuel storage the safety of hydrogen stations in populated areas and the need to train first responders about hydrogen safety coalderived liquid fuels although epact recognizes coalderived fu els as alternative fuels these fuels have seen little commercial succe ss this is largely due to their high production costs and poor environmental performance116 however research to reduce costs and improve environmental performance is on going mostly through support of the department of energy117 potential advantage of coalderived fuels is that the feedstock is an abundant domestic resource conclusions alternative fuels have reached varying levels of commercia l success although currently none are able to compete with conventional fuels lpg and natural gas fuels and vehicles have been successfully commercialized and are widely used in both private and public fleets ethanol is common additive in gasoline but is used sparsely as an alternative fuel other fuels such as methanol nd electricity have had less commercial success but may play key role in the future of transportation the degree to which various alternative fu els have been used has been result of economic factors as well as governme nt tax policies and regulatory mandates further the performance characteristics of the fuels have also played major role in general there are potential energy security benefits to alternative fuels as most alternative fuels can be derived from domestic sources further possible benefits include lower emi ssions of toxic pollutants ozoneforming pollutants and greenhouse gases however performance nd cost are key barriers to consumer acceptance without considerable advances in alternative fuel and vehicle technology or significant petroleum price increases it is unlikely that any fuel or fuels will replace petroleumbase d fuels in the near futurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30758crs25 118 replacement fuels include blending agents such as ethanol in e10 that are used in gasoline but do not qualify as alternative fuels 119 source crs

alternative fuel vehicle tax incentives and the clear actcongressional action recent policy debate has focused on american energy security because of this discussion has turned to alternative fuels proponents argue that expanding alternative fuel tax credits and other incentives would promote improved air quality and energy security opponents argue that alternative fuel programs could lead to corporate welfare and that there are less expensive ways to reduce pollution and cut fuel consumption such as efficiency improvements and conservation for example an increase in fuel economy of one mile pe r gallon across all passenger vehicles in the united states could cu t petroleum consumption more than all alternative fuels and replacement fuels118 combined119 the bush administrations national energy policy120 supports an increased role for alternative fuels as did several bills in the 108th congress provisions in various bills would have provided tax credits for the purchase of alternative fuel and hybrid vehicles and would have expanded the exis ting electric vehicle tax credit further some bills would have expanded the existing tax credits and deductions for the installation of alternative fuel refueling infrastructure some bills also would have provided pergallon tax credits for the retail sale of alternative fuels and some bills would have allowed states to exempt alte rnative fuel andor hybrid vehicles from high occupancy vehicle hov restrictions finally some bills would have provided grants to schools municipa lities andor transit systems for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles refueling in frastructure andor fuel most notably the energy policy act of 2003 hr 6 contained several provisions on alternative fuels the c onference report
