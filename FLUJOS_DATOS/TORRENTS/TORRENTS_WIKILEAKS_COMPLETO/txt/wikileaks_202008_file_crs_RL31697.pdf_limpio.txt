over decade after the south african majority gained its independence from white minority rule under apartheid system of racial segregation the republic of south africa is firmly established as regional superpower with africas largest gross domestic product gdp diverse economy and government that has played an active role in the promotion of regional peace and stability south africa is poised to have substantial impact on the economic and political future of africa the country is twice the size of xas and has population of almost 50 million of which about 80 is african and 10 white its political system is regarded as stable but south africa faces serious longterm challenges arising from poverty unemployment and aids the september 2008 resignation of president thabo mbeki replaced by interim president kgalema motlanthe is not expected to result in major policy changes prior to the spring 2009 elections the african national congress anc which led the struggle against apartheid has dominated the political scene since the end of apartheid controlling the presidency over twothirds of the national assembly all nine provinces and five of the nations six largest cities jacob zuma elected as head of the anc in december 2007 is expected to be the partys choice for president after the 2009 national elections although outstanding corruption charges could still affect his eligibility while the anc continues to enjoy widespread support in south africa the partys dominance may be challenged in the upcoming elections by the emergence of breakaway party the congress of the people cope which was cr eated in response to the ancs interparty divisions that led to mbekis resignation south africa has the largest hivaids population in the world with almost six million south africans reportedly hiv positive the former mbeki administrations policy on hivaids was controversial the country has weathered series of corruption scandals and continues to struggle with high crime and unemployment rates mounting social tensions related to the competition for jobs resources and social services led to an eruption of xenophobic violence against immigrants in mid2008 south africa has benefitted from steady economic growth in recent years although economists predict weaker growth prospects for the near future south africa is considered to be one of the united states two strategic partners on the continent along with nigeria bilateral relations are cordial however the us and south african administrations have expressed differences with respect to the situations in

backgrounds most whites are afrikaans speakers of dutch german and french huguenot ancestry but there is substantial english speaking white minority the remainder of the population are asians largely of indian descent and people of mixed race widely referred to as coloureds south africas economy the largest on the continent is diverse as well south africa produces wine wool maize and other agricultural products for export although only about 12 of the countrys land is suitable for agriculture moreover south africa is the worlds leading producer of gold platinum and chromium major industrial sectors include automobile assembly chemicals textiles foodstuffs and iron and steel production south african cell phone companies and other firms are active throughout africa and sabmiller formerly south african breweries operates on global scale the service sector recently surpassed mineral and energy resources as south africas primary income earner according to the world bank the countrys stock exchange is among the 20 largest in the world and south africa is one of the few countries on the continent to rank as an upper middle income country despite its many economic strengths however the country ranks as one of the most unequal societies in the world in terms of income distribution the majority of black south africans live in poverty and south africas cities are surrounded by vast informal housing ttlements known as townships shortages of water electricity and other social services in the townships have contributed to growing tensions as evidenced by rise in township protests in recent years south africa is an influential actor in the international relations of africa in october 2006 south africa was elected as one of the 10 nonperman ent members of the united

september 2002 and the world conference on racism in 2001 in 2010 it will host the soccer world cup which is expected by some to have significant impact on the countrys overall economic growth and job creation civil war weak regimes and general instability in the region have historically had negative impact on south africa and the country continues to face large influx of illegal immigrants by some estimates more than two million zimbabweans currently reside illegally in south africa some south africans blame these immigrants for the countrys high crime and unemployment rates and rising food prices and in may 2008 tensions erupted in the townships sparking wave of xenophobic attacks that displaced over 25000 and left over 60 dead the attacks could have long term consequences for attendance of the world cup and for tourism in general in order to promote greater stability former president mbeki and south african officials have played prominent mediator roles in african conflicts and south african troops actively support peacekeeping missions throughout the continent in 2002 they helped to persuade the parties to the prolonged conflict in the democratic republic of the congo drc to sign peace agreement following negotiations in south africa mbeki was less successful in mediating the conflict in cote divoire over 1200 south african troops are currently participating as peacekeepers in the mission in the drc monuc and the country contributed almost 900 soldiers to the operation in burundi onub where former president nelson mandela played leading role in brokering peace agreement south african forces also played key role in the african union mission in darfur known by the acronym of am is and now contribute to the unafrican union mission in darfur unamid 1 in move believed by many to protest the sudanese governments policies toward darfur the mbeki government was instrumental in preventing sudan from attaining the chairmanship of the african union in 2006 it has however protested the imposition of tougher sanctions against sudan as counterproductive2 the country has supported democratic advances elsewhere on the continent providing millions of ballots in 2006 for elections in the drc in march 2007 the heads of state of the southern african development community sadc nominated thenpresident mbeki to serve as mediator between the zimbabwean government and the opposition in an effort to resolve that countrys political and economic crises mbekis role has been controversial

which had led the struggle against white minority rule and the apartheid system of stateenforced racial segr egation won control of the national assembly the assembly chose as president nelson mandela the anc leader who had been released from prison in 1990 after serving 27 years his release followed years of secret contacts between the anc and key white business and political figures these contacts had led both sides to conclude that settlement could be negotiated that would protect the interests of all south africans the negotiations themselves encountered many difficulties including several outbreaks of violence that threatened to destroy the peace process finally however in november 1993 allparty 1 south africas involvement in amis was not without cont roversy some opposition leaders criticized mbeki for not taking more assertive role in the crisis and some south african troops threatened to pull out of amis in late 2006 over pay dispute 2 sanctions threat on sudan

in final agreement on new constitution and free elections held in 1994 south africas second universal suffrage elections were held in june 1999 and the anc retained control of the national assembly deputy president thabo mbeki who had served in key anc posts overseas during the antiapartheid struggle was chosen by the assembly to succeed mandela mbeki retained his position as president following the april 2004 parliamentary elections in which the anc won almost 70 of the votes south africas politics continue to be dominated by the anc which has enjoyed support among many black south africans because of its role in spearheading the long struggle against white minority rule until december 2007 when he lost the party presidency to rival thabo mbeki served as president both of the party and the country3 he was expected to remain president of south africa until the next elections in 2009 but resigned from the position in september 2008 he has been replaced by an interim president former deputy anc leader kgalema motlanthe following mbekis resignation several prominent members of the party led breakaway faction now known as the congress of the people cop some observers suggest cope may provide the greatest challenge to the ancs power since the end of apartheid rule the anc holds 72 majority of the seats in the 400member national assembly where the countrys legislative power principally resides far ahead of its nearest rival the democratic alliance da which has 12 of the seats the inkatha freedom party ifp headed by mangosuthu buthelezi has about 6 of assembly seats buthelezi who has been active in south african politics for decades holds zulu chieftainship and the party is largely zulu in membership the ifp has experienced steady decline in parliamentary seats since the 1994 election while the anc and the da have gained electoral support other parties represented in parliament include the new national party nnp see below the united democratic movement udm the independent democrats id and th african christian democratic party acdp the anc also holds majorities in all of south africas nine provincial assemblies in addition to the national assembly there is higher legislative body the national council of provinces ncop with limited powers the members of ncop are chosen by the governments of the nine provinces all controlled by the anc

the national assembly the democratic alliance da was created in 2000 through merger of the democratic party dp and the new national party nnp to challenge anc dominance of the political system the merger surprised many analysts since the nnp was directly descended from the national party which had created apartheid and established the white minority regime that ruled south africa for more than 40 years in contrast the dp though also largely white advocated classical liberal platform and was heir to the progressive party which had strongly opposed apartheid and campaigned on human rights issues however by allying the two parties were able to ensure their control of the legislature of western cape province and of many local governments in the province including the government of cape town in the 2000 local elections 4 3 under the south african constitution the president is elected by the national assembly and consequently the next president is likely to be chosen from the majority

articulate critic of the anc with respect to the slow pace of privatization transparency and other issues became da leader with nnp head marthinus van schalkwyk as his deputy the alliance soon fragmented in way that has further enhanced the power of the anc in south african politics in october 2001 van schalkwyk announced that the nnp would leave the da and enter into coope rative agreement with the anc the nnp leader explained that the move would promote national unity and progress while critics suggested that he was primarily interested in securing government appointments for nnp leaders 5 van schalkwyks break with the da precipitated prolonged national debate over floor crossingthat is over whether elected nnp representatives in assemblies at the local provincial and national levels should be permitted to cross over from the da to the new ancnnp alliance representatives at all levels in south africa are elected not as individuals but because their names appear on lists selected by each party the proportion of the vote received by party in an election determines how many of those on its list will be given seats many argue that floor crossing in such system thwarts the will of the voters and it had not been permitted in south africa however in 2002 the constitutional court allowed floor crossing at the local level throwing control of cape town and number of other towns to the anc and its nnp allies the national assembly passed legislation in 2003 allowing mps to change their party affiliation during two week window periods as result of september 2005 window period the anc gained 14 seats including all seven nnp parliamentarians and four da mps who complained of racism within the party although the anc controls the provincial government of western cape the city of cape town remains the last major urban opposition bastion following close win by the da candidate helen zille in 2006 the anc began controversial bid to change the citys government from mayorallydominated system to one run by 10member committee which would have left the current mayor facto figurehead subsequent criticism by the other parties appears to have persuaded the anc to drop its proposed restructuring plan zille replaced tony leon as head of the da party when he stepped down in may 2007 6

maintained as an organization primarily of the workers and the poor we will never hand over this weapon built up with our blood sweat and tears to the other side on silver platter we will never let the anc be privatized by the rich it is working class formation and leftwing liberation movementit must remain ours 7 former president mbeki on the other hand has argued that the anc is broad church capable of representing socialists and nationalists and bridging class divisions cosatu was highly critical of mbekis stance on the aids epidemic and his approach toward the zimbabwe situation see below in june 2007 the countrys trade unions launched what is reported to have been the biggest strike since the end of apartheid costing the economy an estimated 418 million 8 the unions who were demanding 12 pay raise for public servants accepted the governments offer of 75 raise after four weeks of protest in 2006 cosatu had launched smaller general strike to protest the loss of 100000 jobs over the past three years primarily from the textile and mining industries that strike followed series of others held in 2005 and they have been considered significant acts of defiance against the policies of the mbeki government as the rift between cosatu its populist allies and mbeki supporters within the anc widened some analysts predicted that split was imminent 9 speculation regarding splintering of the anc grew in the wake of the resignations of mbeki and several of his allies

neared the end of his second term as president of the anc there was considerable speculation on whom the party might choose for the position at the ancs national congress in december 2007 mbeki had suggested that he would not run for third term his successor would be widely expected to succeed him as president of the country following the national elections in 2009 although the ancs party constitution allows for competitive leadership race party presidential candidacy had ever been contested mbekis dismissal of jacob zuma as the countrys deputy president in 2005 see below exposed

constitutional provision for expropriation of property for public purpose critics including the democratic alliance argued that the proposed law which would restrict property owners rights to judicial appeal and force sales at below market prices would undermine confidence in property rights and deter investment 32 they also suggest that while the rate of statefunded transfers has been slow

domestic product gdp averaged 3 per year in the first decade after apartheid and rose to an average of 5 from 2004 to 2007 the growth rate fell to an estimated 32 in 2008 due in part to the global

zimbabwean human rights activists after incidents of alleged police violence one cosa leader remarked we are not quiet diplomats and we will not keep mum when freedom does not lead to respect for workers and human rights 72 when the mbeki government issued terse initial statement following the march 11 2007 arrest of opposition and civil society activists cosatu criticized the government for disgraceful response in the face of such massive attacks on democracy and human rights especially coming from those who owed so much to international solidarity when south africans were fighting for democracy and human rights against the apartheid regime 73 anc leader jacob zuma has referred to the zimbabwean president as monster but has defended mbekis quiet diplomacy74 other anc heavyweights like cyril ramaphosa and tokyo sexwale have criticized mbekis policy sexwale has said when freedom fighter takes wrong step it is time for other freedom fighters to stand up and say we know you are great man but we cannot support what you are doing75 in 2007 he suggested that the zimbabwean government may be ignoring mbekis efforts and that it may be time to turn up the volume76 ramaphosa has expressed similar sentiments president mbekis reluctance to take more critical stance toward the mugabe administration led to increasing calls for the south african leader to be replaced as the sadc mediator on zimbabwe tsvangirai criticized mbeki for his quiet support for the dictatorship and has called for him to step down as mediator77 according to reports president mbeki recently wrote president bush letter warning the united states not to interfere in the zimbabwe situation78 but as the violence increased after the 2008 elections in zimbabwe public and internal anc pressure may have forced mbeki to take stronger position with president mugabe mbeki visited zimbabwe on several occasions after the elections and he dispatched six retired generals to investigate reports of attacks on the opposition the generals reportedly expressed shock at the level of violence 79 under mbekis mediation the zimbabwe parties reconvened for talks in south africa and on september 15 2008

largest trading partner in africa behind petroleumrich nigeria reaction to the fta proposal in the region was reportedly positive but there were concerns about the scope of the negotiations some

was not sensitive to the differing levels of development within sacu negotiations began in 2003 but were suspended in 2006 when us and sacu officials agreed on new work program that will aim to address broad range of trade and investment issues and may contribute in the long term toward possible fta analysts suggest that the momentum for sacu negotiators to complete the fta may have been

some time to come although some have expressed concerns regarding the upcoming elections there are tensions in rural areas over land but south africa seems far from rural upheaval over the issue as has been the case in zimbabwe social tensions over perceived inequalities in the distribution of wealth and inadequate service delivery which resulted in violent attacks on african immigrants in mid2008 are likely to continue in the near term as the government struggles to address the needs of its poorest citizens south africas longer term stability is linked to the success of the south african government and its partners in fighting poverty and reducing the toll of the aids pandemic the principal worry for some analysts has been that south africa would become facto one party state under the anc weakening checks and balances in the political system should this happen some fear that the regime could become increasingly authoritarian and unresponsive to the needs of its citizens anc leaders reject this view arguing that their party is national liberation movement committed to transforming south africa and fulfilling the aspirations of the poor 83 others have argued that the power of the ruling party is limited by the countrys free and very active press independent judiciary and bill of rights enshrined in the constitution the emergence of the new congress of the people may provide the best challenge to the ancs political dominance to date although its success in drawing support from the ruling party will remain unknown until the 2009 elections in any event anc leaders want their country to be seen as leader in africa and as spokesman for africa and developing countries generally in world affairs to play such roles south africa must continue to be recognized as successful democracy 83 see for example president mbekis december 16 2002 address to the anc national conference httpwwwancorgzaancdocshistorymbeki2002tm1216html
