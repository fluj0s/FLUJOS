6308c15 shspec295 the tone arm meter that only had tone arm would be useful to teach auditors to keep the tone arm moving it should have the same numbers it should probably also have onehanded electrode it should be very small and rugged ideally it should be able to go through the bottom with stop you could hang it on the pc with belt and keep him on it for cchs it would show discharge of charge the minimum ta you should get is 025 divisions per twenty minutes 075divisions per hour small amount of ta is enough for healing needle blowoff is enough r3t or r2t consist of putting in the itsa line and dating even 01 division per twenty minutes is enough to blow somatic that is enough for healing but not enough to make the pc feel better as result of auditing this explains the oddity that dianetics heals chronic somatics with the pc not realizing that auditing had done anything you would heal the illness but the person still doesnt believe in dianetics you havent helped the person that was what drove us out of healing not the medicos auditors found it frustrating without understanding the ta it is doubtful if the auditor will ever be able to predict his result if you know about the ta you will know that if the pc got ta in session 1 he is liable to throw the auditor curve at the end of the session 2 he is liable to have some sort of upset within twentyfour hours 3 you have restimulated charge because all auditing restimulates charge these phenomena are not inevitable the reason 0w is not being stressed is that not all auditors seem able to restimulate overts they accept critical thoughts and motivators and miss all the pcs withholds any auditing that requires extraordinary targeting and restimulation becomes more difficult to do difficult part of auditing is in selecting the significances of restimulation which the auditor must engage in with the pc the degree of restimulation restimulated in the significance becomes an even greater level of skill eg the question of how much gpm you have to restimulate to get the gpm run the skillful auditor restimulates only the number of items he wants to run the less skilled the auditor the more items and gpms he restimulates in order to get one pair to run the whatsit line regulates restimulation on the whatsit line you should 1 know what you are going for 2 know what you have to get to 3 have heart and dont overrestimulate 4 avoid q and auditing works by restimulation and blowing of charge you can blow charge on an early incident of chain and have the later charge blow off without registering on the meter that speeds things up if you dont put in the itsa line and let the charge blow off the pc stacks it up and arc breaks etc etc not restimulating charge at all or restimulating too little charge equally result in noauditing this will give an arc break because the expectation of auditing not fulfilled will itself bleed charge which is then bypassed and will blow up restimulating too little charge or charge is worse than restimulating too much charge for instance you will get in bad trouble if you fail to run the pc through an engram twice because he is in pain incidently thetan in good shape probably enjoyed pain you can pick this up by asking the pc to waste some pain repetitively he will cognite that he can have it sadism isnt peculiar it is lower harmonic of an actual fact any sensation is better than sensation anything is better than nothing that is different from only being able to enjoy pain as thetan goes upscale he can stand more effect most newspaper reporters are unauditable if you try to audit them all you get is lot of missed withholds the reporters attention is all out there he has attention on his case this guy has lot of arc breaks he is dramatizing overts indicating bpc gives the pc control over his charge when you run circuit with charge on it it gets spongelike character then it starts picking up charge whether you want it to or not out of the intention that auditing will occur it will still bleed charge out of the bank and the pc will still arc break ta measures the adequacy of restimulation it shows that an adequate amount of charge is being restimulated and that it is adequately dispelled with the itsa line there is really miles of margin for error on either side of the ideal amount of restimulation where you will still get ta and case gain you can have the pc swamped and still get ta or you can be running the pc pretty shallow and still get ta there is lot of tolerance too much or too little restimulation beyond this margin of error causes cessation of ta the meter doesnt tell you if you are getting too much or too little restimulation most standard processing is strong enough that you are not restimulating too little charge auditors therefore dont worry much as long as there is some ta motion just doing any auditing at all guarantees some restimulation what you are auditing regulates how much charge you are restimulating using upperlevel processes you are only going to err by getting overrestimulation since niagaras of charge are available if you are going through gpms without getting ta it is not because there is too little restimulation it is overrestimulation if there is too much charge the pc shuts it down and the ta locks up you can say that it is unreal to the pc but unreality consists of 1 force uncoordinated raw force 2 invalidation 3 disagreement on the thought level so to say that something is too unreal to the pc is to say that there is too much charge on it the auditors problem is delicately to put the whatsit line in the right place so as to bleed off charge where the pc can confront it if the discharge line gets overloaded the pc will explode in an arc break the problem of the auditor therefore is not how to restimulate more charge it is not the problem of how to empty the atlantic ocean but how to bleed few drops off of it the pc may beg you for oneshot clear process here you see the working of the effect scale what the pc needs is some small effect some line to bleed charge that is small enough not to be dangerous he is very careful because everything is live wire if you run any pc at too high level it can become too much for his body while still being ok for continuing to get ta eg person with cancer is in an almost continuous arc break however if you go above the charge tolerance then thats it for the ta lrh comments on wilhelm reichs character armor wilhelm reich had an esoteric form of charge that he called orgone this sort of charge was thought to be involved in the buildup of arthritic deposits charge is also what caused things to break around jung and it is what gives people odd somatics acute or chronic acute charge destimulates in three to ten days if it keeps on being restimulated with opportunity to be destimulated or bled off one gets chronic somatics even then it takes periodic restimulation at the end of each lifetime to keep thetan as unaware and charged up as he is there is preparation series of gpms that have thirty to forty wrong dates apiece with command to return sandwiched between each of about eighty gpms the goals make life the opposite terminal they are all derogatory goals like to be wrong or to get caught your first indication that the pc is nearing his limit of restimulation is lessening of ta action by this time the pc is already past the point of comfortable charge level audit as delicately as possible at this point as you go on be sure the itsa line is very in and dont let any more charge get restimulated until you have cleaned up what you have do not let the pc dive into earlier track matter how eager he may be to do so that is how you get stuck tas haul out of there start getting thorough you can ordinarily trace back any ceased ta to some action that stirred up more charge than got handled for instance say we run the center goal out of the bear implant then we start running the rest of the goals suddenly we lose ta action we have just restimulated three or four out of five goals ie we have three or four gpms on restimulation that amount of charge stirred up eliminated ta motion the overcharged case is always the high ta case it is the whatsit line that is responsible for this overrestimulation with resultant high or low ta even if it is life or the pc that put the whatsit line in the wrong thing to do is to get wore whatsit tell something you have been worried about is therefore not good process it is all whatsits for the pc to look at if you want to cure the overcharged case you could assess his problems to central one and ask what solutions have you had for this problem this allows the pc to itsa and thus permits the ta to come down the cures give you the itsa line get all the whatsits already in restimulation and get the solutions off that will give you itsa bring the ta down and get the ta into action when you finish one whatsit with itsas find another whatsit that is already there and finish it etc this is guaranteed to fix the ta find something small enough for the pc to let go of knowingness and reality dont increase unless you get charge off the case so the case knows that nothing has happened unless you increase his knowingness
