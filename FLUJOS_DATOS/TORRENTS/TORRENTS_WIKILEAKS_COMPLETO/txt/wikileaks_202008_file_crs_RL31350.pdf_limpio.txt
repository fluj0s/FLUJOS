congress office of technology assessment harmful nonindigenous species in the united states otaf565 washin gton dc us government printing office sept 1993updating animal health protection statutes comparison of current law with the senate farm bill and house proposals introduction background statutes authorizing the us department of agriculture usda to prevent the introduction or dissemination of livestock and poultry diseases date back to the act of may 29 1884 since then congress has passed and periodically amended laws giving the secretary through the departments animal and plant health inspection service aphis new authorities to deal with new or pressing animal health protection issues in all over 20 separate statutes authorize the secretarys actions in animal health protection current authorities allow aphis to order mandatory quarantine inspections for livestock imports to protect us export markets to restrict interstate livestock commerce during emergencies to seize and dispose of diseased livestock and property to declare extraordinary emergencies to compensate owners for their losses and to enforce laws and regulations through criminal and civil penalties broad consensus has developed over the last 25 years between producers industry groups and policymakers on the need to modernize and consolidate animal health protection laws early congressional discussions on modernizing and consolidating animal and plant health statutes began in the 1980s with hearings by the house committee on agriculture later in 1993 findings in an office of technology assessment report to congress confirmed the need to consolidate and modernize these authorities calling present plant and animal health protection authorities largely an uncoordinated patchwork of laws regulations policies and programs1 in 1994 legislation to modernize animal health statutes was first offered and later in 1995 similar proposal was introduced to modernize plant protection laws neither of these measures nor subsequent proposals in the 104th and 105th congresses was passed separate consideration of reforms to the animal health and plant health statutes continued between 1997 and 2000 in 1999 aphis released comprehensivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31350crs2 2 the report was prepared by the national plant board an organization of plant pest regulatory agencies from each state and the commonwealth of puerto rico that serves aphis in an advisory capacity 3 the new plant protection act was enacted as part of the agricultural risk protection act of 2000 pl 106224 114 stat 438 7 usc 7701 et seq 4 the national associati on of state departments of agriculture nasda is nonprofit association of public officials representing the commissioners secretaries and directors of agriculture in the fifty states and four territories stakeholder review of its plant protection laws and activities2 the report entitled safeguarding american plant resources included the input of broad audience of producers industry groups consumers and environmental groups consensus recommendations from this document and broad backing from producer and industry groups were key factors for the passage and enactment of the plant protection act in 20003 in october 2001 the national association of state departments of agriculture nasda 4 published the animal health safeguarding review similar to its counterpart report on plant health protection this document contains the consensus recommendations of broad array of stakeholders for strengthening criminal and civil penalties for animal health violations and reforming the statutes to make them consistent with the authorities given to the secretary under the plant protection act the animal health safeguarding review among other things identifies four key issues that stakeholders maintain should be addressed in any reform of animal health protection laws greater investigative powers current animal health statutes do not authorize the secretary to subpoena witnesses to assist in investigating suspected violations agency officials cite the lack of subpoena authority as frequent hindrance to prosecuting violations increased penalties under current law there is maximum civil penalty of 1000 per violation and up to 5000 and 1 year imprisonment for criminal violations industry and producer groups increasingly aware of the great potential for economic damage from diseases such as footandmouth disease or from acts of bioterrorism have called for stiffer penalties and fines as deterrent to prevent illegal smuggling of animals and animal products into the united states consistency with plant protection statutes the plant protection act of 2000 gave the secretary increased powers to recover the costs of remedial actions from negligent owners to preempt state actions in intrastate commerce to impose stiffer criminal and civil penalties and to use subpoena power to prosecute violations proponents of reform of the animal health statutes argue that similar legislation covering animals is needed to establish consistency between plant and animal authoritieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31350crs3 modernizing to meet challenge of new diseases and technologies traditionally usdas animal health protection actions were directed against known contagious and infectious diseases eg footandmouth disease today new disease threats have appeared which have new or poorly understood infectious agents often with long incubation periods eg mad cow disease and chronic wasting disease of deer and elk in addition proponents of statutory reform argue that clearer authority is needed to deal with any threats that might emerge from animals produced through biotechnology or used by terrorists to harm us agriculture current legislative proposals two animal health protection bills have been introduced in the 107th congress the first hr 2002 was introduced on may 24 2001 by representatives pombo and peterson and referred to the house agriculture and judiciary committees the measure has received further action but it is substantially similar to the second proposal s 1482 which was introduced by senator harkin on october 2 2001 this measure entitled the animal health protection act was incorporated as an amendment to the senatepassed version of hr 2646 the agriculture conservation and rural enhancement act of 2002 the 2002 farm bill which is currently in conference the housepassed farm bill does not include updates to animal health protection laws new authorities and key provisions both hr 2002 and hr 2646 title x subtitle c consolida and retain existing statutory authorities of usdas animal pest and disease protection activities the bills would establish substantial uniformity between aphiss animal health and plant health policies in addition the proposals contain number of new authorities pertaining to the issues described earlier in this report see the following paragraphs table 1 below presents sidebyside comparison of key provisions from hr 2646 and hr 2002 with current law definitions the house and senate proposals offer new definitions for the terms animal article disease enter export facility import interstate commerce livestock means of conveyance move pest and state key change from current statutes is the broadening of the definition of disease to include any noninfectious as well as infectious diseases of livestock the new definition also includes any condition detriment to production of livestock which would pertain to the secretarys authority to deal with new diseases like mad cow disease import and export authorities both proposals seek to consolidate current authorities on importing and exporting animals the secretary would keep existing authorities to 1 prohibit or regulate the import and export of any animal articles or movement of vehicles or facilities upon determination of disease provided that the action is needed to prevent entry or dissemination of pest or disease into or from the united states 2 prohibit or restrict animal imports or exports due to unsanitary condition s or for improper or inhumane treatment of
