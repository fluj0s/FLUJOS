president chooses not to sign bill1 and returns it instead to the chamber th at originated it the chamber shall enter the message of the president detailing the reasons for the veto in its journal and then proceed to reconsider the bill2 vetoed bill can become law if twothirds of the members voting in each chamber agree by recorded vote quorum being present to repass the bill and thereby override the veto of the president the chamber that originated the bill sent to the president acts first on the question of its reconsideration in other words the house acts fi rst on vetoed bills that carry an hr or hj res designation and the senate acts first on vetoed bills that carry an s or sj res designation if the chamber of origin votes to repass the bill then the bill with the veto message is transmitted to the second chamber which then also reconsiders it nothing in the constitution requires that either chamber vote directly on the question of repassing vetoed bill the chambers have for example referred vetoed bill to committee instead if either chamber fails to vote on the question then the measure dies both chambers will not necessarily even have chance to take up the question if twothirds of the members of the chamber of origin do not agree to override veto then the measure dies and the other chamber does not have an opportunity to vote on the question of repassing the bill the constitution does not otherwise address how cong ress should consider vetoed bill and it is therefore house and senate rules and practices that additionally govern the treatment of bills vetoed and returned by the president g10g152g158g156g142g561g18g155g152g140g142g141g158g155g142g561 g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561 the consideration of vetoed bill is matter of high privilege in the house and the chamber generally votes to override or sustain the veto shortly after the message is received from the president or the senate time for debate on the question is usually controlled and allocated by members of the committee of jurisdiction and majority of the house can vote to bring consideration to close to repass the bill over the veto of the president requires the support of twothirds of the members voting quorum being present

on the day vetoed bill and accompanying presidential message are received the speaker lays the message before the house the veto message is read and entered in the house journal it is not necessary for member to make motion to reconsider the vetoed bill if member seeks 1 in this report the word bill is used to refer to all m easures that are presented to the president which includes bills as well as joint resolutions that do not propose constitutional amendments 2 section 7 of constitution gives the president 10 days excluding sundays after the r eceipt of measure from congress to choose one of three options sign the measure into law veto it and return it to the congress or take action if the president takes action and congress is in session the bill becomes law without his signature if however the congress adjourns sine die before the 10 day period has expired and the president takes action then the bill is pocket vetoed for more information see crs report rs22188 regular vetoes

question of overriding the veto before the house by stating the pending question is whether the house will on reconsideration pass the bill the objections of the president to the contrary notwithstanding if members do not wish immediately to debate the question several preferential motions can be made before the speaker states it the house can agree by motion or unanimous consent to postpone the consideration of veto message to named day or to refer it to committee3 the house may also agree to nondebatable motion to lay the vetoed bill on the table while the motion to table usually permanently and adversely disposes of matter that is not true in the case of vetoed bill motion to remove the bill from the table could be made at any time g10g152g158g156g142g561g6g142g139g138g157g142g561g152g151g561g24g142g157g152g561g17g159g142g155g155g146g141g142g561 debate on the question of overriding veto takes place under the hour rule in practice the speaker recognizes the chair of the committee with jurisdiction over the vetoed b ill for an hour of debate and the chair in turn yields 30 minutes to the ranking minority member for purposes of the debate only4 the chair and ranking member of the committee serve as floor managers of the debate yielding portions of time to other members who wish to speak typically after the hour is consumed or yielded back the majority floor manager moves the previous question if majority of the house votes to order the previous question the vote immediately occurs on the question of overriding the veto g24g152g157g146g151g144g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g10g152g158g156g142g561 to override veto twothirds of the members voting quorum being present must agree to repass the bill over the presidents objections th constitution requires that the vote be by the yeas and nayswhich in the modern house means that members votes will be recorded through the electronic voting system the vote on the veto override is final because in contrast to votes on most other questions in the house motion to reconsider the vote on the question of overriding veto is not in order if the override vote on house or senate bill is unsuccessful then the house informs the senate of this fact and typically refers the bill and veto message to committee if the house votes to override veto of bill that originated in the house hr or hj res the bill and veto message are sent to the senate for action if the house succ essfully overrides veto of bill that originated in the senate s or sj res then the bill becomes law because twothirds of both chambers have agreed to override the veto 5 3 the motion to postpone consideration of veto message and the motion to refer veto message are debatable under the hour rule both motions can be adve rsely disposed of with little or debate by nondebatable motion to table 4 because time on the question is controlled by the majority floor manager other motions are typically not in order unless the majority floor manager makes the motions or yields to someone else for that purpose 5 for additional information on the house action on veto

g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561 if the senate wishes to reconsider vetoed bill senators generally enter into unanimous consent agreement that the message be considered as read printed in the congressional record and as required by the constitution entered in the senate journal senators often also agree by unanimous consent to limit time for debate on the question of overriding the veto when the senate receives vetoed measure from the president or the house it is quite common for it to be held at the desk for several days and considered only after unanimous consent has been reached on the terms of its consideration when the vote on the question occurs it must be taken by rollcall vote and receive support from twothirds of the senators voting quorum being present

agreement it is not necessary to secure the support of all 100 senators to consider vetoed bill in the senate absent an arrangement to hold the veto message at the desk it would be read and then entered into the journal after its receipt from the president or the house6 the presiding officer would then state shall the bill pass the objections of the president of the united states to the contrary notwithstanding several debatable motions are in order however that could displace consideration of the veto message the message could be referred to committee for example or postponed to specific time alternatively the majority leader might ma ke motion to proceed to another matter if the senate takes any of these actions then the question of overriding the veto can only be brought before the senate by unanimous consent or nondebatable motion to proceed finally once the veto message has been laid before the senate it could also be tabled or indefinitely postponed which would normally preclude any further action on the matter g21g142g151g138g157g142g561g6g142g139g138g157g142g561g152g151g561g24g142g157g152g561g17g159g142g155g155g146g141g142g561 the question of overriding veto is debatable under the regular rules of the senate the question could be debated as long as any senator sought recognition to discuss it debate on the question of overriding veto can be limited by unanimous consent or by invoking cloture to end debate through cloture motion re quires the support of threefifths of senators duly chosen and sworn or 60 senators if there are vacancies7 cloture
