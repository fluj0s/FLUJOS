to chemical facility security introduction federal officials policy analysts and homeland security experts express concern about the current state of che mical facility security referring to them as the single greatest danger of potential terrorist attack in our country today some experts fear these facilities are at risk of potentially catastr ophic terrorist attack1 t h department of homeland security dhs identifies chemical facilities as being one of the highest priority critical infrastructure sectors2 currently chemical facility security efforts include mixture of local state and federal laws industry trade association requirements vol untary actions and federal outreach programs the dhs has identified this composite as being insufficient in addressing security for the entire chemicals sector additionally various costs and requirements may act as disincentives to stakeholders attempting to create uniform effective security against terrorist attack many in the public and private sector call for federal legislation to address chemical facility security3 still disagreement exists over whether federal legislation is the best approach to securing chemi cal facilities and if legislation is deemed necessary what approaches best meet the security need since the population potentially affected by chemical release generally resides near specific facilities some experts may argue that chemical fac ility security concerns should be dealt with by state or local authorities other ex perts claim the potentially catastrophic nature of terrorist attack and the widespread distribution of chemical facilities make chemical facility security an issue of national concern policymakers may decide that chemical facility security is matter of national homeland security and is best addressed at the federal rather than state levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33043crs2 critical issues surrounding chemical facility security legislation include determining which chemical facilities should be protecte d which involves analyzing and prioritizing chemical facility security risks identifying which chemical facilities pose the most risk and establishing what activities could enhance facility security to an acceptable level because of the widespread use of che micals in us society determining which chemical facilities to protect is challenge selection might be based on relative risk but it is not clear how this risk might be determined mechanisms for assessing security risk might include weighing the known or theoretical terrorist threat f aced by particular facility the chemical hazards held at facility the quantities of those chemicals and the location of those chemicals relative to the surrounding population security regulation of some chemical facilities is blished under certain statutes including the maritime transpor tation security act mtsa pl 107295 and the safe drinking water act sdw as amended by the bioterrorism preparedness act pl 107188 several states have tablished homeland security statutes and three new jersey mary land and new york have state laws or regulations specifically addressing chemical facility security potential chemical facility security enhancement might be achieved through range of policy approaches providing grants to increase security at high risk facilities mandating site vulnerability assessments compelling vulnerability remediation establishing federal security standards or requiring the consideration or use of specific technologies proposed legislation may aim to complement existing law or to override it in the 109th congress legislation has been introduced in both chambers addressing concerns regarding chemical f acility security in the senate s 2145 the chemical facility antiterrorism act of 2005

secretary for information analysis and infrastructure protection department of homeland security before the house homeland security committee subcommittee on economic security infrastructure protection and cybersecurity on june 15 2005current efforts to secure chemical facilities many organizations are undertaking effort s to secure chemical facilities some efforts are voluntary in nature involving security best practi ces or semivoluntary such as requirements for membership in trade associations other efforts arise from state or local chemical facility security regu lation finally federal security legislation affecting some chemical facilities was enacted in previous congresses federal agency outreach activities continue voluntary efforts industry trade associa tions have developed and publicized security best practices for their member companies4 these practices vary but many recommend or require vulnerability assessments of chemical facilities generation of security plans to address the largest vulnerab ilities implementation of these security plans and in some cases external auditing of these secu rity plans or their implementation one of the most often discussed trade association security requirements is the american chemistry councils acc re sponsible ca re program5 the dhs officially recognizes the responsible care security code as an alternative security program for the purposes of compliance with mtsa6 the acc companies comprise almost 90 of basic industrial che mical production although thei r members are only small fraction of the total number of chemical manufacturers while many other chemical manufacturers and distributor s participate in other trade associations the dhs testified that approximately 20 of the ch emical facilities that dhs identifies as high risk do not participate in an voluntary security program7 some argue that voluntary security program is insufficient to meet the risk of significant terrorist attack one security expert testified that it is fallacy to think that profitmaximizing corporations engaged in trade as inherently dangerous as the manufacture and shipment of tih

jersey domestic security preparedness act was signed into law on october 4 2001inhalation hazard chemicals will ever voluntarily provide level of security that is appropriate given the larger exte rnal risk to society as whole8 others challenge the voluntary security pl ans as vague inappropriately focused on physical security and difficult to verify9 some analysts likewise believe that current security at chemical facilities would not stop determined armed attacker10 supporters of voluntary effort s cite the large investment made in site security since 2001 and other efforts to reduce risk as signs of their effectiveness the acc for example notes that its member companies invested over 2 billion in security enhancements since 200111 additionally some facilities voluntarily switched chemicals changed manufacturing processes or reduced the amount of chemicals on site12 as one industry trade association re presentative testified our efforts show that industry does not need to be prodded by government mandates to take aggressive and effective steps to secure its facilities13 state efforts several states have safety or environmental laws applying to chemical facilities but three new jersey maryland and new york have enacted security laws that specifically target chemical facilities under new jerseys domestic security preparedness act of 2001 the new jersey domestic security preparedness task force is authorized to adopt and enforce security standards on the public and private sector following review nd approval by the governor14 in november 2005 the task force mandated chemical facilities to comply with previously voluntary best practices including reviewing existing processes for inherently safer alternatives athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33043crs5 15 office of the acting governor state of new jersey new jersey becomes first state to require chemical plant security measures to protect against terrorist attack press release november 29 2005 16 maryland house bill 493 hazardous material security was signed into law on may 26 2004 17 new york senate bill 7685 the antiterrorism preparedness act of 2004 was signed into law on july 23 2004specific facilities facilities must report to the new jersey department of environmental protection15 under marylands hazardous material security act facilities that are required to file environmental protection agency epa risk management plans rmps must perform vulnerability assessments and implement plans to address those vulnerabilities the hazardous material security act ex cludes agricultural fertilizer retailers from this requirement the facilities must report to the maryland department of the environmen t and the maryland state police16 under new yorks antiterrorism pr eparedness act of 2004 the new york office of homeland security is charged with reviewing the vulnerability of chemical plants following which it can recommend security improvements at particular plants the antiterrorism preparedness act of 2004 also allows the state office of homeland security in consultation with stakeholders to identify chemical facilities covered by the law it excludes facilities holding fuel for retail sale and facilities that are water suppliers the department of environmental conservation enforces the law17 policymakers who believe that states are better suited to assess local threats and vulnerabilities may prefer chemi cal facility security measures to be developed locally potential concern of industry about such state laws is that patchwork of regulations could develop w ith different standards appl ying to facilities located in different states consequently facilities in some states might be more secure than in others or facilitys outofs tate competitors might face ve ry different security costs policymakers who believe such an approach does not provide sufficient security to the population at large or places an uneve n burden on industry ma prefer national standard also some chemical facilities located near state borders may pose risks across state lines supporting effo rts for national standard federal efforts congress has passed many nvironmental and safety statutes which may provide ancillary security benefits congress has also enacted legislation providing security requirements for some specific types of chemical facilities but these requirements vary among different statutes also the federal govern ment through the department of homeland security and other agencies engages the private sector in publicprivate partnership

governing environmen tal releases public health and worker safety have been developed and applied to chemical facilities some activities undertaken to meet these regulatory oblig ations may have an auxiliary security benefit either by lowering the conseque nces of chemical release or through reduction of particular vulnerability also federal security regulations exist for some specific chemical or chemicalrelated facilities in general these security regulations were developed to protect facilities against criminal activities such as vandalism or theft rather than terrorist attack examples of such security regulations include the protection of liquified natural gas storage facilities 49 cfr 193 hazardous liquids pipeline pumping stati ons 49 cfr 195436 and storage sites for hazardous

68understanding chemical facilities establishing definition of the phrase chemical facility is key component of potential legislation as the dhs acting under secretary for information analysis and infrastructure pr otection testified the very first thing were going to have to do is come to an adequate agreed upon definition of what the chemical sector actually is because without that we will be going all over the place31 some people include only facilities i nvolved in chemical manufacture and distribution others include any site c ontaining chemicals the narrowness or breadth of this definition will likely influe nce the practicability of security regulations and determine the degree of security risk reduction this section discusses three possible mechanisms for selecting chemical facilities for security regu lation based on list of chemicals the potential consequences of terrorist attack or an industrial classification considering the breadth of us chemical sites that could be attractive targets for terrorists it is likely that comprehensive definition will require combination of approaches defining by chemical environmental and safety legislation often list or direct an agency to list ch emicals for regulation and then require regulation of those facilities that contain them usually at levels above certain threshold quantities examples of such legislation include th emergency planning and community right to know act epcra passed as pa rt of the superfund amendments and reauthorization act pl 99499 and the clean air act amendments of 1990 pl 101549 which established both the envir onmental protection agency epa risk management program and the occupational safety and health administration osha process safety management program one challenge in using this approach may be determining which chemicals to include when considering chemical facility security existing federal chemical lists are generally developed for other reasons and therefore may not be appropriate for security purposes for example the depar tment of transportation list for regulation of transport of hazardous ma terials contains several t housand chemicals not all of which are security risk32 the osha process safety st andard applies to group of highly hazardous chemicals selected becau of their potential hazard to workers33 the epcra lists several hundred chemicals in order to ensure the safety of first responders in the event of chemical accident34httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33043crs10 35 the list of 140 chemicals 77 toxic chemic als and 63 flammable chemicals and their threshold quantities are found at 40 cfr 68130 36 the criteria and guidelines for determinin g the worstcase scenario release are found at 40 cfr 6825 the criteria for determining the distance worstcase scenario release might travel are found at 40 cfr 6822 37 63 fed reg 640645 january 6 1998 38 40 cfr 683 39 the latter category was exempted through th passage of pl 10640 the chemical safety information site security and fuels regulatory relief act of 1999 40 testimony of gerald poje former board member us chemical safety and hazard investigation board before the senate ho meland security and governmental affairs committee on july 13 2005the clean air act section 112r require s risk management plan rmp for facilities possessing more than threshold quantities of any of 140 chemicals35 these chemicals are included because of their pot ential for acute offsite consequences to human health or the environment in the ev ent of sudden large accidental release the risk management progra m requires these facilities to estimate the population that might be affected under wo rstcase scenario release calculating the population that resides within circle surrounding the facility with the radius of the circle determined by the distance the worstcase scenario release might travel36 while these estimates are not intended to model potential terrorist release the potentially affected population in wors tcase scenario is often c ited in discussing chemical facility security risks such hazardous chemical lists generally identify chemicals based on an inherent hazard such as toxicity or flammability one potential drawback to defining facilities by referring to these lists is that they exclude potentially hazardous chemicals for reasons other th an risk for example the rmp list often referred to in discussions of chemical facility security does not include explosives37 it also exempts material already regula ted under 49 cfr 192 193 and 195 such as liquified natural gas which is c overed by other sa fety regulations38 the list of rmp facilities was further reduced by statute to exclude facilities where flammables are stored on site as fuel or fo r retail distribution as fuel39 congress may or may not want to include such exempted materials when considering chemicals in terrorism context of course any of the above lists or an other chemical list might be edited to meet the security need to better focus federal resources much shorter list of chemicals might be desirable alternatively an appropriate federal agency might develop new chemical list specifically for security purposes avoiding focus on previous lists one safety expert testified that i would not want the depa rtment of homeland security to think that somehow it can pull out of another agency the named list of chemicals and talk to the industry and say these are the only ones were going to worry about40httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33043crs11 41 such an approach was taken with the risk management program the epa was authorized to develop and maintain list of chemicals and directed to include specific ones 42 as quoted in lara jakes jordan chertoff states foot transit safety bill associated press july 15 2005 43 oral testimony of carol andress econom ic development specialist environmental defense before the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee on continuedpolicymakers might require federal agency such as epa or dhs to develop and maintain such list if congress wants chemical facility security efforts to address particular chemical threats it might list specific chemicals in statute while allowing the federal agency to modify the list41 defining by consequence another potential criterion for determining which chemical fac ilities to address is the likeli hood and severity of adverse consequences in the case of terrorist att ack such consequences might include the possibility or probability of injury loss of life financial harm environmental damage or loss of critical chemical pr oduction experts disagree on how best to determine the likelihood and severity of these cons equences their relative importance and whether these different consequences lend themselves to comparison should be considered independe ntly or can be ppropriately ranked because federal resources are limited pr ioritizing chemical facilities by risk may be an effective approach to maximizing the benefits from security spending dhs secretary chertoff implying such an approach stated when you start to think about your priorities youre going to think about making re you dont have catastrophic thing first42 riskprioritization approach may allow the development of thresholds defining risk characteristics for chemical facilities and thereby determine which chemical facilities should receive fede ral resources or require federal attention the magn itude of the threshold used would likely determine several characteristics of the chemical facility universe including the inclusion or exclusion of different types of chemical facilities the regional distribution of facilities the degree of potential increased security and the program cost an additional factor in defining by c onsequence involves the type of data that might be used to determine risk threshold what metric is most appropriate and how should it be determined for example in considering human casualties should one consider worstcase scenario or more probable release the degree of complexity and accuracy required to model these scenarios might be an area of contention for example dhs uses different methodol ogy to determine potentially affected people following terrorismrelated chemical release than epa uses when assessing potential risks from accidental releases the potentially affected residential population in the epa rmp programs worstcase scenario is often cited in the debate about chemical facility security these predictions are known to be very cons ervative and are intended to be used for planning purposes by emergency response organizations and government agencies some analysts assert that these rmp figures are viable starting point for prioritizing chemical facility risk43 other analysts assert that rmp figures overestimate thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33043crs12 43 continued july 13 2005 44 testimony of colonel robert b stepha n

affected was much lower than projected from regulatory calculations44 still others contend that the rmp figu res may underestimate the casualties from terrorist attack as the scenarios are modeled on release from single chemical process since many chemical processes may be located in chemical facility it is possible that greater amount of chemical might be rel eased during an intentional attack than during an accidental release45 determining the extent of likely casualties from release might require extensive m odeling of facility cation meteorological information surrounding population

sectors may be composed of similar industries or of industries with common elements for example hspd7 identifies an energy sector and chemical and hazardous materials sector the latter sector is defined to include chemical manufacturers and processors the range of facilities that policymakers may wish to include in chemical facility legislation may not lign cleanly however with eith er particular industrial classification or with single critical infrastructure sector for example users of large amounts of chemicals such as water or wastewater treatme nt facilities may fall into critical infrastructure sector other than chemical and hazardous materials the department of labor uses the rth american industrial classification system naics to classify employ ment and economic

indicating that this sel fclassification scheme may be acceptable defining chemical facilities according to industry classification might lead to the one size fits all approach to che mical facility security criticized by various industry groups48 such an approach may require facilities that are not security risk to increase their security solely because of their industry cla ssification rather than their actual risk such security efforts might not reduce the national risk and might be viewed as counterproductive potentially impairing economic efficiency without increasing security moreover due to fiscal constraints smaller facilities might be unable to meet requirements designed for larger facilities potentially damaging companys ability to operate49 50 effects of thresholds on chemical facilities the relative representation of the diffe rent chemicalusing industries will depend on the choice of legisla tive definition some security experts argue that any chemical facility that coul d endanger the surrounding residential population should be considered under chemical facility security legislation51 others advocate tiering system based on c onsequence metric depending on the legislative definition different infrastructure sectors will be included as chemical facilities the types of infrastructure sectors included as chemical facilities might be reduced by using consequence threshold as this would further refine the number of affected facilities this section will use the epa rmp data as case study to discuss the types of infrastructure sectors found in the rmp program and to illustrate the impacts of applying consequence threshold types of facilities potential difficulty of focu sing on particular industry sector or of using industria l classification

chemical facility universe may not be addressed by sectorspecifi c legislation on the other hand as the threshold for inclusion in chemical facility security framework is lowered additional infrastructure sectors grow in relative re presentation as is seen by the food and agriculture sectors in figure 1 because of the increased representation of these industry sectors chemical facility security regulations will likely need to be more flexible to account for different operatin g environments and business needs number of facilities as the consequence threshold is lowered chemical

scenarios do not take into account emergency response measures that might be taken by operators of the facilities or others to mitigate harm chemical facility security legislation that incorporates low threshold may affect additional smaller facilities not generally considered as chemical facilities such as agricultural retailers or small water treatment systems whether these industries are the intended targets of any ch emical facility security regulation is topic facing policymakers the large contribution of the water sector to the rmp chemical facility universe also raises the question of whether exis ting security efforts taken under the sdwa are sufficient to secure this sector for example from figure 1 the water sector consisting of both drinking water treatment and wastewater treatment facilities is 18 of all facilities under the 100000 aff ected threshold but comprises 34 of facilities under the 10000 affected threshold wastewater treatment facilities which comprise roughly half of the water sector at both thresholds used in figure 1 are not addressed under the sdwa should polic ymakers accept that drinking water facilities are adequately secu red through prior legisla tion it still would leave many water sector contributors to the rmp chemical facility universe however including all chemical facilities equally in security program may create an unmanageable burden on lowrisk chemical facilities high risk chemical facilities are likely larger possessing greater ability to meet security requirements smaller chemical facilities re quired to match the security measures put in place by larger chemical facilities ma not be able to do so because of fiscal limitations lead federal agency which federal agency should possess ch emical facility security oversight responsibilities is topic of bate some analysts asse rt that the epa possesses historic relationship with both the chemi cal industry and specifi c chemical

claim that the epa is knowledgeable about chemical facility operation and security that the epa would be well positioned to understand the potential impacts of security regulation and that the epa w ould be likely to create effective regulation this coupling of safety and security wa s supported by the us coast guard which testified that security uditing under mtsa often occurred while the us coast guard was present at the chemical facility for safety reasons52 other analysts claim that the epa is unlikely to be the correct oversight body for chemical facility security they cite the potentially contentious relationship that the epa which already oversees safety and facility emissions might develop with the chemical industry they assert that regulation of security may need to be met through collaborative process between the oversight agency and the facilities so it should be divorced from environmental regulation the dhs is the other federal agency most often cited as appropriate for overseeing chemical facility security advocates claim that good working relationship already exists between dhs and industry and that dhss expertise in security is dominant factor opponents of this view argue that security measures absent environmental protecti on and safety considerations may generate adverse side effects for example while burying storage tanks underground might increase the security of these tanks such an appro ach might pose an environmental risk from potential tank leakage consequently some analysts suggest an approach combining the skills of both dhs and epa in overseeing chemical facility security extent of security measures if legislation requires chemical facilities to implement new security measures the extent of these measures may also be an issue of contention consensus is lacking regarding whether there should be auditing of vulnerability assessments federal inspection of security measures and required considera tion of alternative approaches such as inhe rently safer technologies auditing of vulnerability assessments and security plans existing federal laws governing some chemical facilities have taken diverse approaches to vulnerability assessments for chemical facilities the maritime transportation security act mtsa requires both the deve lopment of site vulnerability assessments and the remediation of those vulnerabilities identified the safe drinking water act sdwa as amended requires drinking water facilities to develop site vulnerability assessments and emergency response plans but not to remediate vulnerabilities under both laws the appropriate federal regulatory agency receives the site vulnerability assessments under the mtsa the dhs has the authority to inspect port facilities assess their security plans and actions and determine whether the facilities meet dhs security standards the epa was not granted similar authorities under sdwa policymakers might decide to require that site vulnerability assessments be performed for all chemical f acilities and supplied to the fede ral government or othershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33043crs17 53 remarks by homeland security secretary

senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee on april 27 2005verification and validation of voluntary security plans is topic of continuing concern by advocacy groups so policymak ers might provide the federal oversight agency the authority to inspect and assess compliance with vulnerability assessments and any remediation requirements however in contrast to the limited number of chemical facilities covered by mtsa broad legislative definition of chemical facilities could include thousa nds of facilities the logi stical burden of inspecting these facilities on recurring basis could be quite high for federal agency current agency staffing may be insufficient to meet this requirement consequently requiring federal auditing and validation of chemical facility security may be difficult to implement in timely manner auditing res ponsibilities could be delegated to state or local officials to reduce the burden placed on federal agencies alternatively congress could authorize agencies to license thirdparty auditors and accept compliance reports they might submit on behalf of chemical facilities dhs secretary chertoff has expressed s upport for congressional consideration of such thirdparty validation53 fees from such program could offset auditing costs if such auditing were done by third parties or was enfor ced by different mechanism such as holding facility owners or operators liable for security measures at the chemical facilities costs might be somewhat reduced critics of outside auditing question the impartiality and rigor of such reviews citing breakdowns in analogous financial auditing approaches54 some experts suggest requiring owner or operator certification of security measure compliance with associated criminal liabilities for noncompliance55 such an approach coupled with inspections might provide incentives to businesses to maintain high security standards prescriptive versus perfo rmancebased requirements the basis for chemical facility security re quirements is another area of contention chemical trade associations and others have testified that chemical facility security requirements should be riskbased and provide clear gu

performance standards requiring chemical facilities to be able to repe l armed assault as required of the nuclear power industry60 others have cited the us coast guard s implementation of the mtsa as good model for performance based requirements existing security regulation for some chemical storage facilities such as liquified natural gas is prescriptive in nature federal regulation governs

standards should threats or vulnerabilities change policymakers may consider whether secur ity requirements should be prescriptive or performancebased and whether any such re quirements should be

chemical facility secu rity is also subject of debate the concept of inherently safer technology involves altering chemical process by substituting less hazardous ma terials minimizing the amount of hazardous material on hand altering the process conditions or designing operation so that it is more tolerant of error62 advocates of inherently safer t echnology state that its application would directly reduce security risks b ecause the hazard posing the security risk would be replaced or reduced63 while acknowledging that not all chemical processes have inherently safer alternativ advocates cite cases where inherently safer alternatives are know n and could be employed64 they claim that federal security legislation should require at leas t the consideration of these

inherently safer technology they state that decisions regardin g the use of inherently sa fer technology are weighed on process and facility basis and are regularly considered by process engineers when optimizing and assessing process change65 additionally they cite the potential to impact process safety negatively should i nherently safer technology approaches be incorrectly implemented for example if stockpiles of hazardous chemical are reduced more smaller shipments may be required more connections would be required to transfer the same amount of material from sma ller shipments this might lead to greater risk for workers making these transfers lastly industry trade associations express concern that if i nherently safer tec hnology implementation decisions are not made by process

potential to transfer risk from one chemical facility to another chemical facility67 process changes such as the c onversion of wastewater treatment from chlorine as disinfectant to sodium hypoc hlorite as disinfectant may lower the potential consequences at that facility reducing the risk to the surrounding area those process changes may however increase the risk at different point in the supply chain for example the facility c onverting chlorine into sodium hypochlorite may increase its chlorine stocks to address greater demand for the sodium hypochlorite end product increasing the potential consequences surrounding that manufacturing facility depe nding on the relative populati on at each facility fewer or more individuals may be put at risk by the facility process change experts in process engineering have testified that research in inherently safer technology is still nascent while some practical examples of inherently safer technology have been developed they assert

might benefit from security requirement to consider inherently safer technologies74 consequences of noncompliance if new chemical facility security requirements are established penalties for not meeting these standards might need to be determined civil or criminal penalties such as fines might be assessed against facility owners or operators whose security did not meet program standards if tiered system of security requirements were established penalties might be tiered as well some might argue though that the eff ect of tiering would be to lower penalties below what would be sufficient to ensure compliance while others might contend that penalties should be more directly related to the crite ria determining the tiering different approach to enforcing compliance would be to enable the federal agency implementing the chemical facility security program to prevent operation of facility if it is out of compliance with the program the us coast guard is granted this authority under mtsa such language could be veloped for any new program stakeholder concerns regardin g such an authority would likely revolve around details of its use such as the ability of facility to appeal such authority the authority to stop operation of chemical f acility due to insufficient security would directly affect the fiscal viability of facility providing strong incentive to maintain compliance with security requirements however for those facilities with fiscal challenges blocking their operation might significantly threaten the facilitys economic stability coordinating regulatory initiatives with existing efforts policymakers may wish to coordinate che mical facility security approaches with existing state and federal regulation developing equivalent criteria exempting facilities covered under other regulation and determining whether federal standards preempt or form the base for state regula tion are some of the options available to policymakers mtsa and sdwa the

guardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33043crs22 implements the mtsa while epa implements the sdwa the sdwa requires vulnerability assessment but not re mediation while mtsa requires both vulnerability assessment and remediation the mtsa grants the coast guard the ability to close facilities that lack appropr iate security while the sdwa does not legislation affecting all chemical facilities could bridge these regulations and attempt to reconcile their requirements chemical facility legislation might require the higher standard to be applied to all chemical facilities thereby requiring those water facilities that also qualify as chemical facility to increase their site security activities alternatively it might require all chemical facilities meet the sdwa standard leaving mtsaregulated facilities with higher security requirement as third option new chemical facility secu rity requirements mig ht exempt facilities regulated under the mtsa or sdwa state and local regulation states have passed chemical facility security legislation po licymakers may wish to decide how existing and proposed federal regulations might mesh with state requirements while all states contain chemical facilities depending on th facilities located in each state the perception of likelihood and consequence of terrorist ttack may vary significantly while some analysts assert that the potential consequences of an attack on chemical facility are such that it poses homeland security threat others may claim that these facilities and the population surrounding them generally reside within the boundaries of single state and would be best served by st ate rather than federal regulation should congress determine that chemical facility security is federal homeland security concern policymakers may need to address whether federal regulation will preempt state regulation or if it will form the base from which states may impose stricter security requirements industry associations suggest that any new federal legislation should supercede state laws an apparent concern is that allowing individual states to add security requi rements above fede ral minimum would lead to patchwork of state re gulation and potentially increas ed regulatory compliance costs on the other hand some federa l regulations such as environmental regulations on air emissions allow states to enact additional regulations should the state wish to devel op stricter standards voluntary efforts some chemical facilities engage in security activities absent regulation policymakers may d ecide whether these actions should be rewarded potential mechanisms for r ecognizing these activities include economic offsets for security costs granting exem ptions from the regulatory framework for facilities undertaking voluntary efforts and recognizing voluntary efforts with full or partial equivalency with regulatory requirements some analysts assert that voluntary efforts should not be reward ed since business incentive reduced liability already exists for chemical facilities to improve security furthermore even with this incentive current voluntary security activities may not rise to an acceptable level potential approaches to security legislation in light of the various policy issues four overarching legislative approaches emerge the approaches are maintaining the current approach to chemical

chertoff recognized the power of market forces stating we want to acknowledg and recognize that ultimately the marketplace itself creates very strong incentive through business selfinterest in

security measures are likely to be implemented at an appropriate and stainable level based on the risk perceived by the facility owners and operators remaining at the status quo would likel not address criticism of the adequacy of voluntary security actions nor the degree of risk that chemical facilities pose to their surrounding communities those facilities identified by the dhs as not participating in voluntary security activities would still be potentially vulnerable to attack the absence of federal legislation would not preclude state or local legislation the perception of chemical facility risk ma induce states to regulate such facilities as has occurred in some states states mig ht enact laws requiring security measures beyond the voluntary activities currently unde rway should they deem such laws in the state interest provide additional res ources under existing law another approach to increase chemical security might be to increase the available resources for

credits to induce chemical facilities to voluntarily increase security given that federal homeland security resources are limited determining what facilities should be elig ible for such grants incentives or credits might prove to be challenging equitable distribution may also become contentious topic even if an appropriate risk metric is developed for chemical facilities79 finally an increase in the availability of federal resources for che mical facil ities w ould not address the issue of uneven chemical facility security across industry sectors due to voluntary participation some mig ht continue to argue that the chemical facility security level would not be high enough to protect th surrounding population without federal mandate some analysts suggest that chemical f acilities should bear the costs of chemical facility security80 since chemical facilities are generally forprofit companies which choose to manufacture products using hazardous materials these analysts argue that the public should not bear the costs for reducing those risks instead chemical facilities should recoup the cost of security through business activities for example by passing on the costs of security to consumers however some chemical facilities such as drinking water and wastewater facilities may not be forprofit companies and may raise different issues in recouping security costs enhance existing law with additional authorities should policymakers decide that the st atus quo does not meet national security needs they could seek to strengthen current laws so that security needs are met for example while some suggest that the existing clean air act provisions could already allow the epa to regulate chemical facilities for security issues others suggest that the clean air act may not provide statutor authority allowing the development of such security regulation81 codifying security language into the clean air act for example could provide explicit statutory

have been introduced in the senate s 2145 and s 2486 have been introduced for comparison of legislation senate see crs report rl33447 senate proposals to enhance chemical facility security by lindajo schierowfacility security such language might build upon existing safety or environmental programs to increase security the epa and osha regulation of chemical facilities for environmental and safety purposes can be viewed in conflicting contexts the existing regulatory relationship may not be amenable to the protective coope rative relationship reportedly required for effective security because of historic disagreements over environmental impacts or worker safety however others identify close oversight and site visits for multiple purposes as effective in maintaining strong security augmenting existing law with additional authorities would likely not resolve concerns about an accurate calculation of the number of people potentially at risk from chemical facilities it might also not address concerns regarding the risks from chemicals not currently regulated under existing law facilities not currently included under these provisions would not be covered and any ranking or ordering of risk based on the worstcase scenarios might be viewed as unrealistic additionally concerns regarding epas or oshas experience in homeland security might lead some to question the skill with which those agencies might regulate chemical facility security for example assigning the epa security oversight of chemical facilities would be inconsistent with the national strategy for physical protection of critical infr astructure and key assets which assigned the dhs as lead agency for the chemicals sector on th other hand just as some are likely to question epa and osha homeland security expertise others are likely to question the background or readiness of dhs st aff to make complex chemical risk assessments finally this approach might result in facilities reporting to multiple federal agencies for example those f acilities that are regu lated under the mtsa might also report to epa or osha d uplicative and redundant security reporting requirements may be inefficient or ineffective create new security authorities another approach to increasing chemical security would be to create federal agency statutory authority to oversee chemical facility security legislation with this goal has been introduced in the current and previous congresses82 new security program might be structured like the mtsa or sdwa or might incorporate aspects of other types of programs such as epa or osha safety programs new security program might address concerns voiced by industry about the potential scope of chemical f acility security existing pr ograms and outreach efforts might be coordinated with ne w program requirements by clearly identifying the target chemical facility universe an assessment of the comprehensiveness of the defined facility universe of interest to legislators might determine any need to tier prospectivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33043crs26 security requirements such considerati ons might aid in avoiding overly burdensome regulation by identifying what facilities most require targeted security efforts in establishing new chemical facility security program congress could mandate security measures or leave details to the implementing agency mandating security measures would force the incl usion or exclusion of technologies or methodologies deemed n ecessary by congress establishing authority within the implementing agency to establish and adjust security requirements as necessary would allow the agency to address changing threats and vulnerabilities but might allow critics to assert that st atutory standards are too rigo rous or not rigorous enough if existing security legislation is used as the design basis for chemical facility security program coordinating requirements with those security programs may be easy on the other hand alignment of existing and new programs may ease coordination between regulato ry requirements policymakers may wish to decide whether one program has precedence over the other if the requirements of both programs are applicable to facility or if compliance with existing programs should exempt facility from the new program similar questions arise with respect to state and local laws or ordinances and whether federal program could preempt th em efforts to design any new federal chemical facility program could incorporate current state efforts as starting criteria or establish new standards creating new federal program with less stringent requirements than existing state programs and then preempting state programs might lead to criticism that federal legislation reduced rather than enhanced chemical facility security in those locales new program which did not preempt state regulation on the other hand might be c onstrued as allowing mixture of state regulatory standards to be promulgate d creating nonuniform regulatory and economic arena on the other hand fe deral program might dissuade other states from enacting additional potentially conflicting laws finally new chemical facility security program might incorporate current voluntary efforts as part of or in lieu of meeting the federal program requirements if policymakers accept current voluntary efforts in lieu of federal program requirements creating for example an exemption for facilities already engaged in security efforts critics may challenge the program as not establishing stringent enough standard alterna tively creating program with requirements at great variance with current voluntary security efforts essentially causing those efforts to not be applicable to the new regulatory program might be criticized as penalizing those facilities taking positive steps towards reducing vulnerability developing an assessment or audit methodology for voluntar security efforts might
