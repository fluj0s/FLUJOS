prior to the step or procedure to which they apply highlights an essential operating or maintenance procedure practice condition statement etc which if not strictly observed could result in injury to personnel or longterm health hazards highlights an essential operating or maintenance procedure practice condition statement etc which if not strictly observed could result in damage to or destruction of equipment or loss of mission effectiveness use of hazard icons hazard icons have been included in this manual to save space while still conveying clear message of the hazard to the technician using the manual since the icon presents visual image of the hazard rather than more abstract message recognition should be much faster than with worded warning in the text of the manual the caption warning will not be used such warnings will be identified by an icon the following lists the hazard icons and their meanings chemicals explosion eye protection fire poison vapordrops of liquid on hands shows that or irritation to human skin or tissuethe material will cause burns rapidly expanding symbol shows that the material may explode if subjected to high temperatures sources of ignition or high pressure person with goggles shows that the material will injure the eyes flame shows that material may ignite and cause burns skull and crossbones shows that material is poisonous or is danger to

the methods and degree of demilitarization of surplus military items as required by dod 416021m1 dod 416021m1 which contains the basic information on demilitarization shall be used in conjunction with this manual where this manual conflicts with dod 416021m1 the latter takes precedence additional data may be obtained from dod 416021m defense technical information center dtic defense disposition manual 12 authorlzatlon demilitarization of surplus military materiel shall be limited to that which the national inventory control points nicp have identified as requiring demilitarization demilitarization of those items which are not normally physically accepted by defense reutilization and marketing officer drmo will be accomplished by the activity having physical custody of the property upon completion of all required utilization and donation screening such action will be coordinated with drmo where appropriate demilitarization of this property may be accomplished as condition of sale provided that there are effective controls and surveillance to assure proper demilitarization where the drmo is the custodian of the property and is unable to perform required demilitarization the drmo may require demilitarization as condition of sale with proper inspection and surveillance or may obtain assistance from the activity turning in the property 13 certification certificate reading substantially as quoted below and signed by two qualified government representatives will be executed and placed in the applicable contract or properly disposal file for all items demilitarized i certify that indicate items were demilitarized in accordance with cite specific instructions which were complied with for example defense demilitarization manual dod 416021m1 tm 43000326 14 reporting demilitarization reporting of demilitarization is required beyond that specified by local directives 15 purpose of demilitarization the purpose of demilitarization of equipment is to alter its characteristics to the extent necessary to preclude its unauthorized use to destroy the military advantages inherent in the equipment to render innocuous those items that are dangerous to personnel and the environment to protect the national interest to preclude the compromise of security requirements and to protect technologically sensitive designs and manufacturing processes 16 hazard classificationstorage compatibility group tables 11 through 13 provide hazard classification and storage compatibility information for the various missile configurations the tables provide item name part number classificationcompatibility class hazardous material identification and amount of hazardous material the m36 training missile is inert and contains hazardous materials 17 how to use this manual chapter 1 provides an introduction to demilitarization chapter 2 describes the various methods of accomplishing demilitarization procedures for demilitarizing specific items are provided in chapter 3 items covered in this manual can be located using the table of contents or the index the table of contents is located at the front of the manual and lists all paragraphs in sequential order each primary end item is covered in separate section in chapter 3 the index is located at the rear of the manual items requiring demilitarization are listed in the index by both item nomenclature and part number if an item requiring demilitarization is not listed locate similar item and demilitarize as prescribed for the similar item 11tm 43000326 table 11 hazard

procedures and precautions and lists the equipment required to perform the operations prescribed in the following chapters alternate methods may be used when they will achieve equivalent results with equal efficiency and without added safety hazards 22 burning burning refers to destroying an item by fire clean burning flammable material such as excelsior should be used for burning burning should be accomplished in an approved area since fire alone may not achieve the damage expected the material being demilitarized should be inspected following the burn to ensure the adequacy of the operation this method is not recommended in the presence of high explosives explosive items will be removed from an assembly prior to burning 23 cutting cutting may refer to different types of operation acables and like items should be severed completely using wire cutter axe hacksaw or equivalent bcutting may also be accomplished using an acetylene torch arcwelding torch or other locally approved method the following safety precautions must be observed during torch cutting 1 2 3 4 5demilitarization by torch cutting is inherently hazardous highorder and loworder explosions may occur in torch cutting closed chambers such as tanks accumulators recoil mechanism components aircraft struts hollow rods or hollow valve stems even though the components are not under pressure or have had small holes drilled in them an explosive condition may result from the heat of the torch vaporizing oil paint or components inside the component in addition gases from the cutting torch may enter the hollow space either adding to or creating highly explosive condition in torch cutting it must be realized that components under pressure may become dangerous upon sudden release of the springholding construction safety precautions are also necessary where flammable materials such as sodium and magnesium are involved in the torch cutting operation precautions against the hazards of torch cutting should include isolation of the working area technical knowledge of the construction of the component to be torch cut and remote control of the cutting operation this method shall not be used on items containing explosives or flammables 24 detonating alocation requirements detonation should be performed in an approved demolition area located in accordance with the requirements outlined in ar 38564 and tm 91300206 21tm 43000326 bpersonnel requirements ammunition inspectors or specially trained class v personnel will be responsible for ensuring that qualified operating personnel are used for operations

preclude restoration or repair mutilation may be accomplished by the use of hammer sledgehammer crowbar torch crusher or other appropriate tool this applies to solid objects that cannot be smashed 26 smashing smashing refers to the complete crushing of relatively fragile item by the use of hammer sledgehammer or other appropriate tool 27 welding welding refers to the welding together of designated sections to render the equipment permanently inoperative or to the application of welded bead at key point to obtain the same result acetylene or arcwelding equipment may be used this method shall not be used on items containing explosives or flammables 22tm 43000326 chapter 3 detailed instructions for demilitarization section i agm114a agm114c and agm114f missile demilitarization the preferred demilitarization method for the agm114a agm114c and agm114f missiles consists of disassembling the missile and demilitarizing missile subassemblies if it is necessary to demilitarize an allup round
