from ships marpol and describes legisla tion congress is considering to control emissions from ships by amendi ng the clean air act caa as pollution from cars trucks and landba sed stationary sources has been more tightly controlled over the last 40 years the contribution of sh ips and port operations to air pollution in port cities has become mo re important in th same period foreign trade has grown dramatically thus po llution from shipping and port operations would be growing as percentage of to tal emissions even if the emissions were regulated to the same degree as other sectors in many cities ships are now among the largest sources of air pollution controlling these sources is complicated by the fact that most oceangoing ships are not registered in the united states and may not even purchase the fuel they are using here thus controlling such pollution would seem to lend itself to an international approach to date such efforts have been of little avail in 1997 the united states and most countries sign ed an international agreement known as marpol annex vi setting extremely modest controls on air pollution from ships the agreement did not enter into force until 2005 and the united states took until july 21 2008 to enact legislation to implement it hr 802 pl 110280 while awaiting congressi onal action the environmental protection agency epa port cities and states began to act on their own nd in congress other legislation has been introduced s 1499 h r 2548 to require epa to dramatically strengthen ship emission sta ndards under the clean air act negotiations to

control options introduction over the last 40 years air quality in the united states has improved substantially since the passage of th clean air act in 1970 annual emissions of the six most widespread criteria ai r pollutants have declined 160 million tons 53 despite major increases in popul ation motor vehicle miles traveled and economic activity1 emissions from shipping are major exception to these trends although emission controls have reduced pollution from new cars and trucks by more than 90 most oceangoing ships operate without any pollution controls at all new and remanufactured engines on tug boats ferries and other smaller ships will be subject to emission controls beginning in 2008 and 2009 but most existing engines in vessels of these type s remain uncontrolled pollution from ships is also affected by the fuel they use marine vessels other than oceangoing ships have been required to use cleaner fuels but oceangoing ships generally use bunker fuel fuel that cont ains high level of contaminants the average fuel used by oceangoing ships contains 27000 parts per million ppm sulfur for example almost 2000 times as much as would be allowed in trucks operating on us roads in the angeleslong beach area which is both the nations busiest port2 and the nations most polluted area3 the problem is particularly acute according to the south coast

of its nox inventory will come from shipping tra ffic transiting the california coast7 oceangoing ships are perhaps the largest source of port emissions but they are not the only source ports make use of tug boats to guide ships entering and leaving the harbor ports make c onnections to landbased tran sportation networks such as railroads and they generally ope rate large truck terminals ships at rest in the port need source of power which often comes from running auxiliary engines and in many cases harbor is served by substantial local boat or barge traffic sometimes including ferry service thus addressi ng the sources of pollution in port may require multifaceted approachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34548crs3 marpol annex vi pollution from ships not only air pollution but pollution of all kinds is governed by the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships first negotiated through the internationa l maritime organization imo in 1973 the convention known as marpol for mar ine pollution 7378 the dates referring to the 1973 convention and its 1978 amendments applies to all ships of the flag states that have ratified it about 150 countries representing over 987 of world shipping tonnage have done so th convention also applies to ships of non signatory states while they are operating in waters under the juri sdiction of parties to marpol six annexes to marpol 7378 cover various sources of pollution from ships oil noxious liquids sewage garb age etc and provide an overarching framework for implementation provisions of annex vi annex vi of the convention which was adopted in 1997 but did not enter into force until 2005 addresses the prevention of air pollution from ships the annex represents small first step toward c ontrolling such pollution particularly if one compares it to pollution controls that the united states and othe r developed countries impose on landbased sources annex vi limits the sulfur content of the fuel used in oceangoing ships bunker fuel to 45 45000 parts per million ppm by comparison highway diesel fuel in the united states is limited to 15 ppm allows special sulfur oxide sox emission control areas currently the baltic sea the north sea and the english channel where the sulfur content of fuel is limited to 15 15000 ppm or sox emissions are limited limits nox emissions from new engines and engines that have undergone major conversions to range of 98170 grams per kilowatthour gkwh by comparison power plants in the eastern united states are limited to 045073 gkwh allows the regulation of

of 2008 the senate gave its consent to ratifica tion of annex vi on april 7 20069 but congress needed to enact implementing legislation before the united states could submit the instrument of ratification the house passed hr 802 to imp lement the annex on march 26 2007 the senate pa ssed the bill with an amendment june 26 2008 and the house agreed to the senate amendment july 8 the president signed the bill july 21 2008 pl 110280 the united states has participated in negotiations to strengthen annex vi more stringent limits on both fuels and emissions were approved by an imo committee april 4 2008 and will be considered for final adoption at the next meeting october 610 2 008 the unite d states supports the strengthening amendments although it will not be able to vote at the meeting because of the delay in enacting legislation to implement annex vi epa believes that the strengthening amendments will be adopted by unanimous consent of the parties thus the inability of the united states to vote may not be of much significance epa has already promulgated regulations under the clean air act that are as stringent as annex vi and shipping companies are already generally meeting the standards these socalled tier 1 st andards were promul gated february 28 2003 and went into effect in 200410 in addition in october 1999 epa established voluntary certification program so that engi ne manufacturers could show that their engines are compliant with annex vi epa believes that all marine diesel engines sold in the us since january 1 2000 to which the annex applie s ie those rated above 130 kilowatts meet annex vi requirements the annex vi standards apply to any oceangoing vessel that is registered in the united states ships of any registry in ports shipyards terminals or the internal waters of the united states ships of any registry bound for or departing from the united states while they are located in the navigable waters of the united states or designated emission control areas and ships bearing the flag of any country that has ratified annex vi traveling through us wa ters or designated emission control areas even if they are not bound for or departin g from us destination to the extent consistent with international law the annex also applies to any other ship in the us exclusive economic zonehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34548crs5 11 the administrator may promulgate regulations that permit sulfur content as high as 2000 ppm for specified period if he determines that compliance with the 1000 ppm limit is not technically feasible by december 31 2010other legislation in addition to the bill to implement annex vi other legislation on ship emissions has seen committee action in th senate s 1499 reported by the environment and public works committee july 10 2008 srept 110413 would amend the clean air act to require oceangoing vessels entering or leaving us ports and offshore terminals to use fuel that contains more than 1000 parts

or gulf coast or the shoreline of the great lakes or st lawrence seaway as ep determines to be appropriate11 t h administrator would be allowed to provide an alternative mechanism of compliance if he determined that ve ssel employed control tec hnology that reduced emissions of sulfur oxides and particulate matter to at least the same degree as the reduction that would be achieved through complia nce with the sulfur content limitation in addition to the fuel standards the bill would require epa to promulgate emission control standards fo r main and auxiliary engines on oceangoing vessels that enter or leave us ports the standards would require the greatest achievable emission reduction for four pollutants nitrogen oxides particulate matter hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide effectiv january 1 2012 the standards could take into account the feasib ility benefits and costs of specific technologies could distinguish new from inuse engines and could vary depending on the age of the engine similar bill hr 2548 was introduced by representative solis in the house but action has been taken there federal state and local measures beyond annex vi and the pending sena and house bills potentially more stringent actions are being taken at the federal state and local level to address emissions from marine engines epa regulations epa has begun to regulate ship missions under existing clean air act authority thus far the regulations are relatively weak and it will be at least 2014 before the agencys regulations impose stri ngent requirements in most cases also when the more stringent requirements do take effect they will apply only to new and remanufactured engines so improvements resulting from the standards will be gradualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34548crs6 12 us epa

categorizes ship engines in three categories the largest of these engines the main engines on oceangoing ships are diesel engines with percylinder displacement at or above 30 liters these are referred to as category 3 engines as noted the agency has already promulgated regulations equivalent to annex vi for these engines unde r the clean air act but as the agency states on its website there is an opport unity to gain large additional publichealth benefits from category 3 marine diesel gines through the application of advanced technology emission controls including hi ghefficiency cataly tic aftertreatment12 the agency has begun the process of veloping more stringent regulations by issuing an advance notice of proposed rulemaking december 7 2007 it plans to finalize new category 3 re gulations by december 17 2009 whether or not the agency promulgate s more stringent category 3 emission standards they may have little effect on the overall level of pollution from category 3 ships since they will only apply to engines installed on vessels flagged or registered in the united states in 2007 only 67 of the world s ships and only 12 if measured by carrying capacity we re registered in the united states13 category 1 and 2 engines by contrast the category 1 and 2 engines those smaller than 7 liters per cylinder and those from 7 to 30 liters per cylinder respectively are used in boats or ships th at operate in us waters tugs ferries great lakes freighters fishing boats and recreational boats for example virtually all of which are registered in the united states and compared to category 3 epa is further along in regulating the emissions of these categories regulations that will reduce emissions of nox from new or remanufactured engines by 24 and emissions of particulates by 12 when fully implemented were promulgated in 1999 and began taking effect between 2004 nd 2007 more stringent standards were promulgated may 6 2008 and will ta ke effect between now and 201414 the final 2014 standards will require ultr low sulfur diesel fuel 15 ppm sulfur and high efficiency catalytic emission controls capable of reducing particulate matter emissions by 90 and nox emissions by 80 along with sizeable reductions of hydrocarbon carbon monoxide and air toxic emissions according to epa15 epa has also proposed new annex vi standards covering both fuel and engines at international ne gotiations under the auspices of imo as noted earlier the more stringent limits were approved by an imo committee april 4 2008 and will be considered for final adopti on at meeting october 610

will now be circulated among imo members for comment before final adoption at the next marine environment protection committee meeting in october acco rding to spokeswoman it is extremely unlikely any changes will be made at this point the imo spokeswoman added 17 pacific merchant marine assn v goldst ene 517 f3d 1108 9th cir 2008 the court held that the states marine vessel rules we re preempted by the federal clean air act because the regulations set emission standards for marine engines without california having received waiver from epa to do so california has since asked epa for waiver to enforce the original rules in addition to deve loping the rules applying only to fuels see california air board seeks federal waiver to enforce ship auxiliary engine rules daily environment report may 13 2008 p a1california emission reduction measures california being more adversely affected than most other areas has played leadership role in identifying and implementing emission reduction measures as well the state has focused on port activities in addition to fuel and emission standards californias measures fall into four categories 1 requiring the use of lower sulfur fuel 2 requi ring emission controls on rbor vessels and shoreside equipment 3 providing altern ative electric power to ships while they are docked at marine terminals and 4 providing grants for the repowering of harbor craft and shorthaul trucks with cleaner engines low sulfur fuels the california air resources board carb at july 24 2008 meeting approved regulations that would require both us and foreign flagged vessels sailing within 24 miles of its coast to use low sulfur fuels in both main and auxiliary engines beginning july 1 2009 compliant fuels are marine diesel oil with 5000 ppm or less sulfur or marine gas oil with 15000 ppm or less sulfur in january 2012 sulfur in both types of fuel would be limited to 1000 ppm the rules replace low sulfur fuel requireme nts that the state implemented in 2007 but which were overturned by the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit earlier this year17 the original rules would have set 1000 ppm limit two years earlier in 2010 emission controls california has in general led the nation in imposing more stringent requirements on diesel engine s in addition the ports of angeles and long beach have develope d procedures to require that trucks

prior to final approval19 alternative power in june 2004 the port of angeles opened the worlds first alternative maritime power amp terminal for container ships where cargo ships can plug in to power instead of operating auxiliary engines to generate electricity while at berth the electrification project was the result of lawsuit brought by the natural resources defens council and other groups who sued the city claiming it failed to fully weigh air quality and other environmental impacts of the new container terminal as result of the suit state appeals court halted work on the terminal in october 2002 and an geles subsequently agreed to electrify the terminal to cut diesel emissions while ships are at docks among other measures20 second terminal was out fitted with amp capability in 2005 to encourage shippers to use the amp facilities in december 2004 the angeles board of harbor commissioners passed policy resolution to help each existing port customer underwrite the cost of

as noted the ports will provide subsidies for truc k and engine replacement from fund generated by 35 per container fee the grants will cover up to 80 of new truck cost conclusion as pollution from cars trucks and landba sed stationary sources has been more tightly controlled over the last 40 years the contribution of sh ips and port operations to air pollution in port cities has become more important simultaneously foreign trade has grown dramatically adding to the burden of pollution from these sources thus pollution from ships and the port operati ons that serve them is now among the most important sources of sulfur oxides nitrogen oxides particulates and other pollutants in numerous us cities controlling these sources of pollution is complicated by the fact that most oceangoing ships are registered in foreign c ountries thus initial efforts at control were focused on international negotiations through the imo which established basic structure marpol annex vi that ma be the basis of more stringent future controls negotiating ratifying and implementing marpol agreements is time consuming however and thus far has not resulted in more than token levels of regulation thus epa and state and local ag encies particularly those in california have begun to address pollu tion from ships using the clean air act and comparable state authorities not all pollution from marine vessels comes from foreign ships smaller craft such as ferries tugboats and fishing boats do tend to be registered in the united states and are thus more amenable to control even for these smaller craft the technical issues can be complex as the vessels include wide variety of engine sizes and ship configurations sa fety also poses important c onsiderations as ships must be able to depend on their sources of power in what may be extreme weather conditions and while dealing with variety of navigational hazards because ships and port operations are now such significant sources of air pollution further regulatory and legislative efforts to control their emissions are likely in additi on ships are large and growing source of greenhouse gas emissions how and whether to regulate these emissions are the subject of imo discussions and may enter into the larger debate over legislation to address climate change congress has begun efforts to address these problems and enacted legislation to implement marpol annex vi in july 2008 but this is likely to be just the start of congressional attention to air pollution from ships action at the state level in the courts and at us epa will continue to bring the issue to congresss attention with numerous opportunities for ove rsight and legislation
