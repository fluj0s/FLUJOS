the s upreme court and some lower courts that have elucidated the meaning of the origination clause of the constitution and delineated the senates power to amend bills to raise revenue it does not address parliamentary precedents of the house and senate which generally have interpreted the clause more restrictively than the courts1 text and purpose of the origination clause section 7 clause 1 of ar ticle i of the united states constitution known as the origination clause provides that all bills for raising revenue shall orig inate in the house of representatives but the senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills the framers of the constitution drafted th is provision because they believed that the members of the house of representatives who are elected directly by the people for two year terms rather than six year terms like senators should be granted power to originate bills for raising revenue but that the senate s hould be able to amend them as on other bills james madison wrote in the federalist 58 that one branch of the legislature is representation of the citizens the other of the states the house of representatives cannot only refuse but they alone can propose the supplies requisite for the support of the government they alone in word hold the purse that powerful instrument by which we behold in the history of the british constitution an

overgrown prerogatives of the other branches of the government the power over the purse may in fact be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate repres entatives of the people for obtaining redress of every grievance and for carry ing into effect every just and salutary measure2 the constitution as originally drafted did not provide for direct election of senators until the seventeenth amendment was ratified in 1913 senators were selected by state legislatures court interpretations generally the supreme court in united states v munozflores 3 affirmed that revenue bills are those that levy taxes in the strict sense of the word and are not bills for other purposes which may incident ally create revenue4 the court added that it has interpreted this general rule to mean that statute which creates particular governmental program and ra ises revenue to support that program and not the government generally is not subj ect to the origination clause5 applying this rule the court held that provision of the victims of crime act of 1984 secti on 3013 of title 18 of the united states code which mandates that persons who are convicted of federal cr imes should pay special assessments was not revenue provision covered by the origina tion clause and consequently that the senate constitutionally could originate it6 although amounts collected in excess of an annual cap were deposited in the gene ral fund of the treasury the court upheld the constitutionality of the provision becau most of these assessments were deposited in the crime victims fund to co mpensate and assist victims of crime the court said that its conclusion was consistent with its earlier decisions which held that statute which imposed an assessment to be used to create currency and statute which levied property tax in th district of columbia to support railroad projects were not subject to the originati on clause because they raised revenue for specific programs as distinguished fro m general support of the government7 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33207crs3 7 continued us 429 1906 respectively 8 munozflores 495 us at 392 and 393 9 id at 401 10 id at 397 11 id at 392 n 4in the munozflores case the court appears to have clarified some issues that had been raised in other origination clause cases the court held that an origination clause challenge of statut is not political question that should be settled only by the political branches and not appropriate for judicial resolution ie it is justiciable although the court in ear lier cases implicitly rejected this assertion by virtue of reviewing these challenges the court in the munozflores case expressly affirmed that origination clause challenges are justiciable and explained the reason for rejecting it the united states argued that courts s hould decline to hear origination clause challenges because the house possesses the pow er to protect its institutional interests by refusing to pass bill if it believes that the clause has been violated the court responded although the house certainly can refuse to pass bill because it violates the origination clause that ability does not absolve this court of its responsibility to consider constitutional challenges to congressional enactments nor do the houses incentives to safeguard its origination prerogative obviate the need for judicial review in short the fact that one institution of government has mechanisms available to guard against in cursions into its power does not require that the judiciary remove itself from the controversy by labeling the issue political question8 the six member court majority did not accept theory espoused by justice stevens in concurring opinion joined by justice oconnor justice stevens expressed the view that bill which originated unconstitutionally nevertheless may become an enforceable law and should be upheld if it is passed by both houses of congress and signed by the president to support this view he noted that the clause does not specify what consequence should follow from an improper origination9 the majority responded that to survive supreme court scrutiny law must comply with all relevant constitutional limits law passed in violation of the origination clause would thus be more immune fro m judicial scrutiny because it was passed by both houses and signed by the presiden t than would be law passed in violation of the first amendment10 the court majority also appears to have rejected view expressed by justice scalia in an opinion concurring in the judgment of the court11 justice scalia argued that courts should apply what has been rmed the enrolled bill rule in which they rely on the designation of origin such as hr for house bill or s for senate bill that congress chooses to give to an enro lled bill rather than undertake an independenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33207crs4 12 id at 408 13 id at 400 14 id at 400 n 7 15 220 us 107 1911 overruled on other grounds new york v united states 326 us 572 1946 as stated in garcia v san antonio metropolitan transit authority 469 us 528 1985inquiry into which chamber orig inated particular provision12 in this case although the senate originated the special assessm ent provision it appeared in house joint resolution with the designation hjres if the supreme court had applied the enrolled bill rule the issue of where the provision originated would not have arisen the court would have presumed that it had originated in the house instead the court either looked behind th designation or accepted stat ements by the parties that the senate had originated the provision be fore addressing the merits of the case the court did not accept an assertion rais ed by mr munozflores that any bill which provides for collecting funds is revenue bill within the meaning of the origination clause unless it is designed to benefit the persons from whom the funds are collected the court said that some of its earlier cases twin city bank v nebeker and millard v roberts did not state that bill must benefit the payor to avoid classification as revenue bill consequently in those cases the beneficiaries of bill were not relevant13 observing that the case before it involved special assessments imposed on persons convicted of crime to be used to compensate and assist victims of crime the court said that different case might be presented if the program funded were entirely unrelated to the persons paying for the program whether bill would be for raisin g revenue where the connection between the payor and program is more atte nuated is not now before us14 court interpretations of the senates power to amend revenue legislation as noted above the text of the origina tion clause provides that all bills for raising revenue must originate in the h ouse but the senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills the supreme court and lower courts have heard some cases that questioned whet her senate amendments were within the scope of the senates power under the origination clause to amend revenue bills these cases have held that the origination clause authorizes the senate to attach an amendment to raise revenue to house bill that raises revenue but not to one that does not raise it in flint v stone tracy co15 the supreme court held that senate amendment which removed an inheritance tax that originated in the house and replaced it with corporation tax did not contravene the origination clause the court said that the bill having properly originated in the

amendment was germane to the subjectmatter of the bill and not beyond the power of the senate to propose16 in rainey v united states17 the court rejected an ssertion that provision of tariff act which imposed an excise tax on use of foreignbuilt pleasure yachts was invalid under the clause because it had been proposed by the senate as an amendment to tariff bill that originated in the house of representatives the court quoted with approval the following lang uage from the lower court i am also satisfied that the section in question is not void as bill for raising revenue originating in the senate and not in the hous of representatives it appears that the section was proposed by the senate as an amendment to bill for raising revenue which originated in the house that is sufficient18 lower courts also have considered ch allenges to senate amendment on the ground that it violated the origination clau in 1982 congress enacted the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act tefra pl 97248 96 stat 324 as introduced in the house the bill that eventually was enacted as tefra would have reduced total tax revenues by 1 billion between 1982 and 198619 the senate replaced the entire text of the house bill except for the enacting clause with version that as ultimately enacted increased total revenue by bout 100 billion between 1983 and 198520 in over 50 cases21 none of which was reviewed by the united states supreme court plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of tefra contending that the senate exceeded its authority under the origina tion clause to amend house bill for raising revenue when it struck the entire text of house bill to reduce revenue and replaced it with senate amendment that increased revenue under their interpretation of the clause the senate was restricted in its authority to amend house bills it could amend only house bills that increased revenue not those that related to or collected revenue but did not increase it the us court of appeals for the nint h circuit rejected this contention and elaborated on the reasons we cannot accept this restrictive and st rained reading of the origination clause the term bills for raising revenue does not refer only to laws increasing taxes but instead refers in general to all laws relating to taxes wardell v united states 757 f2d 203 205 8th cir 1985 per curiam blacks law dictionary rev 5th ed

by levying taxes see also 2 hinds precedents of the house of representatives of the united states 1489 at 94953 1907 recounting an 1872 debate between the house and senate concerning the proper interpretation of the origination clause under armstrongs interpretation bills or amendments raising taxes would have to originate in the house whereas bills or amendments lowering taxes could presumably be initiated in either the sena or house this interpretation raises several problems first it runs sharply c ontrary to past practice since the senate has never regarded itself as being empower ed to initiate any sort of revenue bill even one that lowers taxes see eg 2 hinds precedents of the house 1489 at 94953 second it may well be impossible to implement since members of congress may differ over whether proposed revenue bill or amendment will increase or decrease taxes overall and since the same revenue bill may have varying effects upon the total taxes assessed in different years finally armstrongs interpretation would negate or sharply restri ct the application of the final phrase of the origination clause which authorizes the senate to propose or concur with amendments as on other bills since it would prohibit the senate from proposing amendments to revenue bills if their effe ct would be to transform revenue proposals lowering taxes into measures raising taxes the senate is not constrained from proposing amendments on any other types of legislation based upon the effect those amendments would have it would be incons istent and therefore contrary to the wording of the origination clause to limit the senates flexibility to greater extent in the revenue context we therefore reject armstrongs proposed interpretation of the origination clause and conclude instead that in adopting that clause the framers of the constitution intended that all legislation relating to taxes and not just bills raising taxes must be initiated in the house however we also conclude that once revenue bill has been initiated in the h ouse the senate is fully empowered to propose amendments even if their effect will be to transform proposal lowering taxes into one raising taxes we therefore conclude that the senate did not exceed its authority under the origination clause when it proposed the extensive amendment that ultimately became tefra22 in reaching its conclusion the court of appeals for the ninth circuit added that it joined courts in other judicial circuits that had rejected the contention of the plaintiffs23 and that its decision was strongly influenced if not controlled by the supreme courts decision in flint v stone tracy co 220 us 107 191124 the court noted that the supreme court in the flint case held that the senate did not violate the origination clause when it deleted an inheritance tax that the house had proposed and substituted corporate tax as senate amendment the lower court also said that the supreme court was not swayed by the fact that

origination clause suppose the existing law lays duty of 50 per cent upon iron bill repealing such law and providing that after certain day the duty upon iron shall be only 40 per cent is still bill for raising revenue because that is the end in contemplation less revenue will be raised than under the fo rmer law still it is intended to raise revenue and such bill could not constitutionally originate in the senate nor could such provisions be ingrafted by way of amendment upon any house bill which did not provide for raising that is collecting revenue26 conclusion this report has discussed opinions of the united stat supreme court and some lower federal courts that have elucidated the meaning of the origination clause of the constitution and delineated the scope of the senates power to amend revenue legislation the clause provide s that all bills for raising re venue shall originate in the house of representatives but the senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills the framers of the constitution believed that members of the house of representatives who are elected directly by the people for terms of two years should have the power to originate bills to raise re venue but that the sena should be able to amend them as on other bills until the seventeenth amendmen t was ratified in 1913 senators who serve six year rms were not elected direc tly by the people they were selected by state legislatures the supreme court and lower courts have interpreted bills for raising revenue to apply only to those that raise revenue to support the government generally and not to those that incidentally may ra ise revenue to fund specific prog rams they have held that the senate does not violate the origination clause when it originates bill to raise revenue for specific program even if portion of the proceeds is deposited in the general fund of the treasury moreover the senate does not c ontravene the clause when it amends house bill for raising reve nue under this restric tive interpretation with senate text that raises revenue these courts also have c oncluded that the originationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33207crs8 clause denies the senate power to amend house bill that does not raise revenue with senate text that raises revenue some lower courts have expressly interpreted the phrase bills for raising revenue which must originate in the house and which the sena may amend to encompass not only house bills that increase revenue but also those that relate to or collect revenue consequently they have held that senate does not violate the origination clause if it amends house bill to reduce revenue with senate text to increase revenue the supreme court does not appear expressly to have addressed this issue but it has upheld the constitutionality of senate amendment that raised more revenue than the house bill which it amended
