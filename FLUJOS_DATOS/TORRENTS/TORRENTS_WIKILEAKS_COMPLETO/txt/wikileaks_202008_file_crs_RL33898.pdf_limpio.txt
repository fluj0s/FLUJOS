change the role of the us agriculture sector summary the agriculture sector is source of greenhouse gas ghg emissions which many scientists agree are contributing to observed climate change agriculture is also sink for sequestering carbon which might offset ghg emissions by capturing and storing carbon in agricultu ral soils the two key types of ghg emissions associated with agricultural activities are methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o agricultural sources of ch4 emissions mostly occur as part of the natural digestive process of animals and manur management at livestock operations sources of n2o emissions are associated with soil management and fertilizer use on croplands this report scribes these emissions on carbonequivalent basis to illustrate agricultures contribution to to tal national ghg emissi ons and to contrast emissions against estimate s of sequestered carbon emissions from agricultural activities account for 68 of all ghg emissions in the united states carbon captured and st ored in us agricultural soils partially offsets these emissions sequestering about onetenth of the emissions generated by the agriculture sector but less than 1 of all us emissions annually emissions and sinks discussed in this report are those associated with agricultural production only emissions associated with onfarm ergy use or with food processing or distribution and carbon uptake on forested lands or open areas that might be affiliated with the farming sector are outside the scope of this report most land management nd farm conservation practices can help reduce ghg emissions andor sequester carbon including land retirem ent conservation tillage soil management and manure and animal feed management among other practices many of these practices are encouraged under most existing voluntary federal and state agricultural programs that provide costsharing and technical assistance to farmers predominantly for other producti on or environmental purposes however uncertainties are associated with implementing these types of practices depending on sitespecific conditions the type of practice how well it is implemented the length of time practice is undertak and available funding am ong other factors despite these considerations the potential to reduce emissions and sequester carbon on agricultural lands is reportedly much greater than current rates congress is considering range of climate change policy options including ghg emission reduction programs that w ould either mandate or authorize capandtrade program to reduce ghg emissions in general the current legislative proposals would not require emission reduc tions in the agriculture and forestry sectors many ghg proposals how ever would allow farmers and ndowners to receive emissions allowances or credits andor generate carbon offsets which could be sold to facilities covere d by capandtrade program in addition the enacted 2008 farm bill includes provisions that coul d expand the scope of existing landbased conservation and other farm bill programs by providing incentives to encourage farmers and landowners to sequester carbon and reduce missions associated with climate change

how ongoing or anticipated initiatives to promote us bioenergy production may effect efforts to reduce ghg emissions andor sequester carbon such as by prom oting more intensive feedstock production and by encouraging fewer crop rotations nd planting area setbacks which could both raise emissions and reduce carbon uptake2 agricultural emissions and sinks agriculture is both source and sink of greenhouse gases generating emissions that enter the atmosphe re and removing carbon dioxide co2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and stor ing it in vegetation and soils process known as

ghg emissions6 these gases are significant contributors to atmospheric warming and have greater effect warming than the same mass of co27 agricultural sources of ch4 emissions mostly occur as part of the natural digestive process of animals and manure management in us livestock operations sources of n2o emissions are mostly associated with soil management and commercial fertilizer and manure use on u s croplands as well as production of nitrogenfixing crops8 emissions of n2o from agricultural sources account for about twothirds of all reported agricu ltural emissions emissions of ch4 account for about onethird of all reported missions across all economic sectors the us agriculture sector was the leading source of n2o emissions 80 and major source of ch4 emissions 30 in 20059 other types

climate change by in fluencing tropospheric ozone which is greenhouse gas agricultural activities may also release other types of air emissions some of which are regulated under the fe deral clean air act including ammonia volatile organic compounds hydrogen sulfide and particulate matter11 these types of emissions are typically not incl uded in proposals to limit ghg emissions the sector also emits co2 and other gases through its onfarm energy use for example through the use of tractors and other farm machinery these emissions are generally aggregated along with other tran sportation and industria l emissions in the energy sources where they constitute very small share of the overall total therefore these emissions are not included in reported estimates for the us agriculture sector total ghg emissions in 2005 ghg emissions from us agricultural activities totaled nearly 540 mmtco2eq expressed in terms of co2equivalent units and accounted for about 7 of the total ghg emissions in the united states table 1 12 although the agriculture sector is leading economic sector contributing to national ghg emissions its share of total emissions is distant second compared to that for the energy sector fossil fu combustion is the leading source of ghg emissions in the united stat about 80 with the energy sector generating 85 of annual missions across all sectors13 recent trends in ghg emissions associat ed with the us agriculture sector suggest emissions reductions in recent ears in 2005 emissions from agricultural activities were lower compared to estima tes for 2000 and the most

share of total ghg emissions sources of ghg emissions epas inventory estimates of ch4 and n2o emissions from agricultural activities are measured across five categories agriculture soil management nitrous oxide emissions from farmland soils are associated with cropping practices that disturb soils and increase oxidation which can release emissions into the atmosphere the types of practi ces that contribute to emissions releases are fertilization irrigation drainage cultivationtillage shifts in land use application ndor deposition of livestock manure and other organic materials on cr opland pastures and rangelands production of nitrogenfixing crops and forages retention of crop residues and cultivation of soils with high organic content enteric fermentation methane emissions from livestock operations occur as part of the nor mal digestive process in ruminant animals17 and are produced by rumen fermentation in metabolism and digestion the extent of such emissions is often associated with the nutritional content and efficiency of feed utilized by the animal18 higher feed effectiveness is associated with lower emissions manure management methane and nitrous oxide emissions associated with manure management occur when livestock or poultry manure is stored or treated in systems that promote anaerobic decomposition such as lagoons ponds tanks or pits rice cultivation methane emissions from rice fields occur when fields are flooded and aerobic d ecomposition of organic material gradually depletes the oxygen in the soil and floodwater causing anaerobic conditions to develop in the soil which releases methanehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33898crs7 19 although carbon is released as well it is pr edominantly absorbed again within year as part of the cropping cycle and so is assumed to be net zero emissions unless some goes into longterm soil carbon content 20 previously estimates for the agriculture soil management category were lower current epa estimates reflect methodologic and input data changes agricultural residue burning methane and nitrous oxide emissions are released by burning residues or biomass19 the share of ghg emissions for each

lanearobicdigestionfactsheetpdfmostly through traditional tillage practices21 in contrast conservation tillage practices preserve soil carbon by mainta ining ground cover after planting and by reducing soil disturbance compared with traditional cultivation thereby reducing soil loss and energy use while maintaining crop yields and quality practices include till and minimum mulch and ridge tillage such tillage practices reduce soil disturbance which reduces oxidation and the release of carbon into the atmosphere therefore conservation tillage practices reduce emissions from cultivation and also enhance carbon sequestration in soils discusse d later in this report nearly 40 of us planted areas are under some ty pe of conservati on tillage practices22 improved manure and feed management methane emissions associated with livestock production can be redu ced through improved manure and feed management improved manure management is mostly associated with installing certain manure management sy stems and technologies that trap emissions such as an anaerobic digester23 or lagoon covers installing such systems generates other principal environmental be nefits installing an anaerobic digester to capture emissions from livestock operations for exampl would also trap other types of air emissions including air pollutants such as ammonia volatile organic compounds hydrogen sulfide nitrogen oxides and pa rticulate matter that are regulated under the federal clean air act other benefits include improved water quality through reduced nutrient runoff from farmlands which ma be regulated under the federal clean water act24 many manure management systems so control flies produce energy increase the fertilizer value of any remaining biosolids and destroy pathogens and weed seeds25 manure management systems however can be costly and difficult to maintain given the typically high startup costs nd high annual operating costs for example the initial capital cost of an

map resources 72007 from data reported by usepa agstar digest winter 2006 improved feed strategies may also lower methane emissions at livestock operations such strategies may involve adding supplements and nutrients to animal diets substituting forage crops for purchased feed grains or instituting multiphase feeding to improve digestive efficiency other options involve engineering genetic improvements in animals30 purchasing feed supplements and more intensely managing animal nutrition and feeding practices may add additional costs and management requirement s at the farm level agricultural carbon sinks carbon loss and uptake agriculture can sequester carbon which may offset ghg emissions by capturing and storing carbon in agricultural soils on agricultural lands carbon can enter the soil th rough roots litter harvest residues and animal manure and may be stored primarily as soil organic matter som see figure 331 soils can hold carbon both underground in the root structure and near the soil surface and in plant biomass loss of so il carbon may occur with shifts in land use with conventional cultivation which ma increase oxidation and through soil erosion carbon sequestration in agricultu ral soils can be an important component of climate change mitigati on strategy since the capture and storage of carbon may limit the release of carbon from the soil

typically associated with oil and gas production estimated emission offsets carbon sequestration in the us agriculture sector currently offsets only about 5 of the carbonequivalent of reported ghg emissions generated by the agriculture sector each year thus the sector remains net source of ghg emissions compared to total national ghg emissions the agriculture sector offsets well under 1 of emissions annually it should be noted that these estimates do not include estimates for the forestry sector or sequestration activities on forested lands or open areas that may be affiliated with the agriculture sector forests and trees account for majority about 95 of all estimated carbon uptake in the united states mostly thr ough forest restora tion and treeplanting34 carbon uptake in soils on us agricultural lands accounts for the bulk of the remainder uncertainty estimating carbon sinks epas inventory estimates of carbon uptake in agricultural soils are based on annual data and information on cropland conversion to permanent pastures and grasslands reduced summer fallow areas in semidry areas increased conservation tillage and increased organic fertilizer use eg manure on farmlands as well as info rmation on adoption rates and use of certain conservation nd land management practices however actual carbon uptake in agricu ltural soils depends on several site specific

of carbon in soils from implemen ting conservation tillage or other soil management techniques and growing time for cover crops or vegetative buffers the overall length of time the prac tice remains in place is critical especially regarding the sequestration benefits that accrue over the time period in which land is retired in addition not all conservation and land management practices are equally effective or appropriate in all types of physical settings for example the use and effectiveness of conservation tillage practices will vary depending on soil type and moisture regime which

conservation prac tices may not significantly enhance the sequestration potential of practices that might already be in place35 this raises questions about the costeffectiveness of seque stering carbon on farmlands relative to other climate change mitigation strategies in other industry sectors finally implementing conservation practices and installing new technologies may be contingent on

legislative proposals carbon offset is measurable avoidance reduction or sequestration of carbon dioxide co2 or other ghg emissions expr essed in carbonequivalent terms70 setaside allowance refers to set percentage of available allowances under the overall emissions cap that is allocat ed to nonregulated entities in this case domestic agriculture and forestry entities some bills also specify that the proceeds from auctioned allowances be used to prom ote certain objectives which could further encourage farmland conserva tion and bioenergy technol ogies and practices among other activities71

legi slation s 3036 by renée johnson the inclusion of these types of provi sions could provide opportunities to some farmers and landowners by allowing them to directly particip ate in and potentially gain significant part of this emerging carbon market the offset and allowance provisions could allow farmer s and landowners to participate in the emerging market by granting them the use of allowances nd credits for sequestra tion andor emission reduction activities these allowances and credits could be sold to regulated facilities eg power plants covered by capandtrade program to meet their emission reduction obligations proceeds from the sale of these allowances credits and auctions could be used to further pr omote and support activities in these sectors that reduce avoid or

inclusion of offsets from the agriculture and forestry sectors76 the eus ghg emission program the mission trading system ets which was established in 2005 does not provide for agricultural or forestry projects and activities among the reasons are 1 pragma tic concerns regarding measurement and verification given the sheer number of fa rmers and landowners and 2 ideological concerns about granting too much flexib ility in how emission reductions are met which could undermine overa ll program goals among the areas of concern regarding biological sequest ration offsets are those highlighted in two previous sections of this report uncertainty estimating emissions and uncertainty estimating carbon sinks in summary primary areas of concern include permanenceduration given that land uses can change over time eg forest lands to ur ban development other natural events such as fires or pests measurementaccounting given that biological sequestration measurement is difficult and estimates can vary actual emission reduction or sequestrati on depends on sitespecific factors eg location climate soil type cropvegetation tillage practices farm management etc effectiveness the success of the mitigation practice will depend on the type of practice how well implemented and managed by the farmer or landowner and the length of time the practice is undertaken additionality given that some of the activities generating offsets would have occurred anyway under preexisting program or practice and thus may not go beyond business as usual bau leakage given that reductions in one place could result in additional emissions elsewhere and double counting given that some reduc tions may be counted by another program eg attributable to othe r environmental goals under various farm conservation pr ograms or towards more than one ghg reduction target more detailed discussion of some of these issues is available in crs report rl34436 the role of offsets in greenhouse gas emissions capandtrade

at httpagriculturesenategovlandowners were discussed at subcommittee hearing of the senate agriculture committee in may 200877 farm bill legislation to help address some of the measurement and quanitification issues surr ounding agricultural and forestry carbon credits both the house and senate agriculture committees included specific provision in their respective versions of the new omnibus farm bill to address this issue this and other related provisions were included in the enacted 2008 farm b ill pl 110246 the food conservation and energy act of 2008 specifically the enacted bill contains new conservation provision that seeks to facilitate the pa rticipation of farm ers and landowners in environmental services markets includi ng carbon storage the bill also expands existing voluntary conservation and other farm bill programs providing incentives that could accelerate opportunities for agricu lture and forestry to reduce emissions associated with climate change adopt energy efficiency measures and produce renewable energy feedstocks in particular the new environmenta l services market provision seeks to establish technical guidelines that outlin sciencebased methods to measure the environmental services benefits from conservation and land management activities in order to facilitate the pa rticipation of farmers ranc hers and forest landowners in emerging environmental services markets the intended purpose of these technical guidelines is to develop 1 procedure to measure environmenta l services benefits 2 protocol to report envir onmental services benefits and 3 registry to collect record and maintain the benefits measur ed the provision also requires that usda provide guidelines for establishing verifi cation process as part of the protocol for reporting environmental services but it allows usda to consider the role of third parties in conducting i ndependent verification in carry ing out this directive usda is directed to work in consultation with other federal and state government agencies nongovernmental interests and other interested persons as determined by usda however the enacted bill does not specifi cally address funding for this provision nevertheless the inclusion of this provision in the farm bill will expand the scope of existing farm and forestry conservation programs in ways that will more broadly encompass certain aspects of the climate change debate for more detailed background info rmation see crs report rl34042 environmental services markets farm bill proposals by renée johnson considerations for congress following is list of questions that may be raised as congress considers the role of the agriculture and forestry sectors as part of the broader climate change debatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33898crs30 farm bill programs given the changes enacted in the 2008 farm bill are there opportunities to ex pand existing fede ral conservation and land management programs to achieve greater emissions reduction and carbon sequestration in the agriculture sector how might emissions reduction and car bon sequestration be integrated with the many other goals of conservation programs such as improved soil quality and productivity improved water and air quality and wildlife habitat which programs or practices are the most beneficial and costeffective are there ways to rank applications from farmers under exis ting programs to grant higher weight to proposals to address climate change goals are there existing state programs that effectively address climate change and could be adopted at the federal level emissions reductions should carbon sequestration efforts be balanced by incentives to obtain additional emissi ons reductions in the agriculture sector throug h improved conservation and farm management practices which could have more immediate direct and lasting effect on overall ghg emissions how might the existing regulatory framework for controlling air pollutants affect the climate change debate what are the potential options for reducing ghg emissions at us farming operations how might cost concerns be addre ssed that limit broader adoption of manure management systems and also feed management strategies at us livestock operations carbon sequestration what are the upper limits of carbon capture and storage initiatives in the agriculture sector for example are such carbon sinks temporary or longlasting and what limits exist on their storage value do they rely appropriately on the willingness of landowners to adopt or conti nue to implement particular conservation practice do they rely too heavily on the willingness of landowners to convert existing farmland to open space or prevent the conversion of existing farmland to nonfarm uses are they cost effective when compared to sinks in other sectors how might concerns regarding uncertainty be addressed when measuring and estimating the amount of carbon seque stered in agricultural soils carbon offset or credit markets what is the federal role in possibly expanding existing conser vation programs in conjunction with efforts to create new ma rket opportunities for farmers by developing carbon credit trading system how will usda implement the new 2008 farm bill provision directing the department to work with other agencies and organization to establish guidelines and standards for measuring agricultural and forestry environmental benefits including carbon storage what are the potential measurement monitoring enforcement and administrative issues of implementing carbon credit trading system involving the agriculture and fore stry sectors how would stored carbon be measured and verified how much compensation would behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33898crs31 available and for how long what are required management practices and which accounting methodologie s should be used would such system operate under voluntar or mandatory framework bioenergy promotion how might ongoing or anticipated initiatives to promote us bioenergy produc tion such as cornbased or cellulosic ethanol affect the options for land management or conservation strategies that could increase carbon uptake on agricultural lands and in agricultural soils might broader climate change goals be affected by increased agricultural production in response to cornbased ethanol for example might previously retired land be brought back into corn production or might this result in more intensive corn producti on including fewer crop rotations and planting area setbacks which could raise emissions and reduce the amount of carbon sequestered are there other competing commercial crops that might be used as feedstock for ethanol that could also affect emissi ons and carbon uptake potential energy efficiency what are the opportunities for improved onfarm energy efficiency and conservation how might these be integrated into the broader framework on climate change mitigation in the agriculture sector safeguarding us agricultural production among the possible effects of global c limate change on agricultural production are increased climate variability and increased incidence of global environmental hazards such as drought andor flooding pests weeds and diseases or location shifts in where agriculture is produced climate change in some locations increases the yields of some crops some us production re gions are likely to fare better than others are additional initiatives needed in the us agriculture sector to prepare for the potentially effects of global climate change that might impact us agricultural production and food security which regions and crops might be winners or losers and how can transitions be easedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33898crs32 appendix primer on agricultures role in the climate change debate question discussion what are the types of ghg emissions associated with us agriculture official estimates of greenhouse gas ghg emi ssions for the us agriculture sector are based on emissions of methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o associated with agricultural production only these estimates do not include carbon dioxide co2 emissions from on farm energy use and other emissions associat ed with forestry activities food processing or distribution or biofuel production see agricultural ghg emissions in this report for more information what are the sources of ghg emissions from agriculture agricultural sources of ch4 emissions are mostly associated with the natural digestive process of animals and with manure management on us livestock operations sources of n2o emissions are mostly associated with soil management and fertilizer use on us croplands figure 1 shows agricultural emissions by type and production category why are co2 energy emissions excluded co2 emissions from onfarm energy use ar aggregated with emissions for all transportation and industrial sectors and comprise small share of this total even if included in the estimates for the agriculture sector this would not substantially raise agricultures overall share of total ghg emissions what is agricultures share of annual national ghg emissions in 2005 ghg emissions from us agricultural activ ities totaled nearly 540 mmtco2eq million metric tons co2equivalent units accounting for about 7 of annual national ghg emissions table 1 fossil fuel combustion is the leading source of national ghg emissions about 80 with the energy sector generating about 85 of annual emissions across all us sectors how much carbon is sequestered in us agricultural soilsin 2005 agricultural soils sequestered about 30 mmtco2eq or roughly 5 of annual emissions generated from agricultural activities compared to total national ghg emissions the agriculture sector offsets well under 1 of emissions annually these estimates do not include uptake from forested lands or open areas that account for majority about 95 of total us sequestration figure 2 shows carbon sequestration in agricultural soils also see agricultural carbon sinks for more information is there any uncertainty associated with estimates of carbon uptake for the agriculture sectorreasons for uncertainty associated with upt ake estimates in us soils include actual uptake depends on site specific conditions eg location climate soil type crop type tillage practices crop rotations farm mana gement etc accoun ting methodology type of practice how well it is implemented and the length of time undertaken availability of federalstate costsharing or technical assistance and other competing factors including supply response for commercial crops and bioenergy crops actual ghg emissions may also vary according to many sitespecific conditions see uncertainty estimati ng carbon sinks for more information what is the potential to reduce emissions andor increase carbon uptake in the agriculture sectorthe potential for carbon uptake in us agriculture sector is much greater than current rates usda estimates net increases in carbon sequestration ranging from 40 to 590 mmtco2eq per year table 2 or 2 to 20 times above current rates this could offset total current national ghg emissions by as much as 8 other studies show an even greater carbon uptake potential in the agriculture sector practices that may reduce emissions andor sequester carbon on us farmlands include land retirement pastureland and crop conversion restorati on improved soil management and conservation tillage and improved manure management and feeding strategies at livestock operations see sections potential for additional uptake and potential for additional reductions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33898crs33 question discussion how costly are the types of farming practices that help address climate change issuesthe estimated value or cost of sequestered carbon will vary by practice usdas forecast of an additional sequestration potential of 40 to 590 mmtco2eq per year is associated with an estimated perunit value ranging from 334mt of permanently sequestered carbon dioxide the lowend of this range reflects the sequestration potential associated with cropland management practices higherend values are associated with afforestation and land retirement see table 2 for more information see potential mitigation costs for more information how can emissions from production be reduced how can carbon uptake in agricultural soils be increasedmost land management and agriculture conservation practices might both reduce ghg emissions andor sequester

practices that may help address climate changeexisting federal and state farm conservation programs promote the types of land management and conservation practices that can reduce ghg emissions andor sequester carbon also many existing vol untary programs in the current farm bill as well as under existing statelevel programs provide costsha ring and technical assi stance to encourage farmers to implement such practices thes are voluntary programs and are generally designed to address sitespecific improvements at an individual farming operation see federal programs and other listed program
