transcript of the role of earth tape portions marked are on the old reel but were omitted from the rd transcript these match the omissions previously posted and have been confirmed against the older reeltoreel version that was available in the early 1970s the role of earth dated nov 1952 in rd volumes and 30 oct 52 on old reels 5210c30a sop8a sop lectures number 8a 62 min and 10 sec long thetan can go over and take possession of the body of lets say we want to influence the priemier of buckwupistan so we boot this thetan out and make this thetan go over and knock out the thetan in the wife of the priemier of buckwupistan and then we are holding the body of the person that we send over there and they are still connected and in communication with this body at which moment sound of somebody entering the room pretty wild stuff to walk into suddenly laughter so we simply monitor now all of sudden we find we are able to monitor the wife of the priemier of buckwupistan with great ease and we get her into tremendous affair with court chamberlain you see and we just get things swirled up like fire drill and the next thing you know hes dispossessed they say his rents up on buckwupistan or something of this sort because of scandal because of this because of that its very neat political manuver and it is so neat that there is probably not member of the class present who is along the category of case level iv or v who hasnt done it and that is the reason why lot of vs and vis are completely unwilling to get out of their heads because its an overt act to send somebody out of his head and youve sent people out of their heads over to some vast distance and having sent these people over they run into body or something which is then injured or something happens to their body right where you are and you caused complete foul up and extinction of being and after that when somebody comes along and tells you to get out of your head youll find v is trying despritely to stay in his head because he furiously objects to being sent around here there and various points in the universe and because there is ded overt act of having sent people out of their heads and so on so you work this stuff back and forth and you get some of the most interesting stuff this is all early stuff by the way female voice has bit of an accent but ron you see what happened was when he eventually got into communication now in present time garbled sentence he developed round kind of pressure within his head there were 4 beings coming at him and i sprung him there and then and he had enough stability outside to energize these capsules and send them back but i also questioned him about body in pawn but there was nothing on the emeter ron it probably didnt register too well on him i want to call your attention to something of considerable interest to you it would be terribly interesting you see if all of this were just fairy tale on what is the state of the real universe but youre engaged with certain definite problems and these problems have to deal with three certainties and id hetter tell you something about these three certainties but before i do that there is certainty called the mest universe unless you can discover and unless you use certainty on the mest universe what is actually the series of agreements which we call the mest universe unless you are willing to use this data for what it is youll find yourself and your preclear in state of delusion in other words you are saying something that is the mest universe isnt the mest universe and that of course is method of getting everything upside down but royally if you went around for instance telling everybody that there were lorries going down holland park avenue and being quite upset and so on because lorries were going down holland park avenue and there they go down holland park avenue why you could do this silly trick of going out and saying well in view of the fact there are lorries go down this avenue it doesnt matter if i step under these big red things and so on just as idiotic as that is when you set some kind of planned setup condition of affairs you examine this condition of affairs very carefully you find out that it agrees to this extent as mest universe that is the definition of mest universe is of course the common denominator of agreement that is the mest universe its series of agreements and when youre examining the mest universe youre examining something solid its some agreement that you agreed on that other people agreed with you on and so on now what did you agree on and that is the mest universe now you take preclear after preclear after preclear after preclear you put them on emeters you try to run them you try to do this you try to do that straight on through and youll find in each and every case youre finding the phenomenon of entities bodies in pawn communications spaceships other planets locations beingness in other states and all of this and youll find this to be consistent condition you have fulfilled this definition of the mest universe its evidently agreed upon and its agreed upon because its actually true you couldnt go out and get somebody off the street and put an meter in their hands and start asking them questions on this without getting the same response as youd get from your classmates on it they would know nothing about this i took little girl one night during demonstration and put her on the emeter and this little kid i started to question her and i was going to ask her about something just to show the class what the series of questions would be about current life and the next thing you knew this little kid was shaking in such degree that the chair legs were rattling against the floor and she says you mustnt ask any questions you mustnt ask any questions you mustnt you mustnt you mustnt she was going all to pieces on the thing and i said well of course its perfectly all right for to ask you questions so on where are you and she said im sitting before big panel and she says its its i didnt used to sit there im sitting there right now thats i sit in front of this panel this is my job this is my job im not supposed to tell you what my job is but theres this panel and so forth i said its communicator switchboard nooo and she just starts going on i said well you wouldnt mind telling the codes that go across the panel and she passed right straight on out interesting isnt it shed never heard of bodies in pawn or other governments or invader forces or anything of the sort so i snapped her around and carried on with the rest of the questioning and was simply able to do so because i happen to know this is very funny thing to say but i happen to know her commanding officer and gave her silly isnt it and gave her the messages which had gone across herqanel an hour before at which moment she immediately quieted down and she says well iii probably be taken all to pieces in the morning and so i said you will not be and she wasnt but she was communicator who was running communications switchboard now another time just to give you consistency on this another time in front of class much as this one i picked up girl put the electrodes terminals in her hand and started to ask her about this and that and we find her sitting in front of communication switchboard girl knows nothing about electronics if you told her to describe to you how to answer telephone she would probably bog on it bit and yet she is communicator shes communicator in system known as the space stations the space stations exist out here in the solar system they use the asteroids its very peculiar system this solar system has planet which is broken up the asteroid belt it gives lowgravity platform for takeoff and so on and that broken planet is of considerable interest as space station that is to say galactic jump now there arent any planets up at this end of the galaxy which form good galactic entering spot for incoming transport and other ships but this beautiful brokenup planet here with lightgravity sun and so on makes very ideal spot and as result this area of the solar system got into prominence it got into little bit of prominence and its slightly bone of contention and there was the fourth invader force was here the fifth invader force came in to use this area and the name of this solar system is space station 33 they started to use this area without suspecting that the fourth invader force had been there for god knows how many skillion years had been sitting down and they have their installations up on mars and they have tremendous screened operation the martian operation is fascinating operation simply because it has gone into 100 percent holding force and it does everything it does with tremendous coversion its sitting behind defense screen of enormous size and nobody its practically impossible to penetrate that except as thetan and if you penetrate it as thetan you go through the martian screen and they got you well now the point is that the fifth invader force operated for some little time here in this system without suspecting the existence of the fourth invader force and all of sudden they started to lose crews and they didnt know where they were going and they got little more upset about it and little more upset about it and little more upset about it and battalion was sent down here to earth 8200 years ago the third battalion if you find somebody who is member of the third battalion why speak up because the whole battalion its officers staff and so forth was under the command of the expeditionary force commanding officer for this not for just this area all right now this sounds awfully wild it just sounds terrifically incredible but thats just incredible in the frame of reference of earth actually this isnt very incredible so 8200 years ago they came down in the himalayas the upper headlands up about oh id say about seventytwo miles northwest of khyber pass and put base in there and still not believing that there was anything like an invader force operating in this system failed to take any vaguest precautions with regard to their installations they put up defenses after all what was here nothing but homo sapiens that was just nothing danger menace and so on and they were in this installation just very short time when all of sudden with terrific crash the fourth invader force which was little more active then than it has become since knocked out this whole battalion battalion of that size is in the neighborhood of about three thousand beings and picked up all of its staff all of its staff officers and so forth and took them through to mars and then knocked them back into this human race here theyre still here there are saucer crews here theres all sorts of things on earth here from the fifth invader force very interesting this is directly and violently in opposition to the fourth invader force and the fifth invader force out of its own protection took over venus oh relatively in modern times took over venus and tried to stabilize the venusian if you called fifth invader though venusian he would probably shoot you out of hand because it would be horrible insult they merely monitor the government of venus and they leave mars strictly alone now this is really roughly rundown of the quote political situation in the solar system now thats very interesting because it gives you as preclears bodies in pawn of the fourth invader force it gives you tremendous volume of personnel that have been poured down here for various nefarious purposes all of them under some kind of covert direction typical game every goal theyve gotten they have reason why they cant reach the goal see i mean typical game sort of an implant these people are operating on theyre relatively inefficient but boy can they hold on to things do they accumulate mest and that sort of thing youve got your big holding operations and youve got running through this fifth invader force operation which is strictly really disinterested in earth not really interested in earth at all as such because earth is heavy gravity planet and who the hell wants heavy gravity planet earth would be much better off lying in chunks in an orbit around the sun but naturally thats pretty rough assignment blowing up something this size and putting it around so nobody would do that but completely aside from that fact earth has been used consistently as prison and it is prison and it is heavily screened there are installations in mongolia there are installations in the pyrenees here on earth and there are installations down in the mountains ot the moon in africa which pick up very often people on death and the thetan just doesnt know whats going on hes in state of deep hypnosis really and the moment he finds himself in association with dead body the thing keys and he reports to where hes supposed to go and hes changed and moved around here and there and comes back down really from death back to assumption of new body and so on is ordinarily time period of about fifteen minutes and he has three engrams in those fifteen minutes 1 the death 2 the wipeout and implant between lives and 3 the assumption knocking out the ge and taking over body at birth very interesting all right youll run into these things with pcs thats the only reason im talking to you about it not to romance with you body in pawn utilizes not the thetan but ridges heres some of the most fascinating things theyll take thetan and theyll build up ridges and these ridges will act like personalities and because their wavelength is known they can be monitored so youll very often run into entities and there are certain number of entities and theyre in certain order and so on and they act like beings in person but they are not beings and you want to know how to get rid of an entity couple of auditors here have run into this problem in the last week and thats why im going over this ground with you actually this is covered to very marked degree in the course books and its covered in what to audit history of man not perhaps with the frankness that im covering it with you now but its covered now how do you get rid of an entity you simply find where that entity is located geographically in the body you do this with an meter your next step is to find out where the entity is stuck on the time track and youll find out that its some sort of an incident having to do with body in pawn itll be betweenlives implant itll be something on this order it may be that you will find that the person during an operation has suddenly conceived that he is dead has reported back in he obviously was not dead and what they did was lay onto one of his ridges which he took right along with him of course lay onto one of his ridges the fact that he mustnt know and he mustnt tell very often when he appeared back in body with the violence of pain of an accident or something of this sort he killed the body in pawn to which he was very nebulously attached while he was here body in pawn something floating in fluid or under an electronic constant electronic bath youll find these described theyre lying on pallet or something of the sort the body is completely motionless and at the foot of this will be something that looks like window and its not window now heres big joke for you you can take preclear and coax him to knock off body in pawn make the body dive through one of those quote windows make him raise enough hubbub and hurrah so that hell be gunned down by guards or something of the sort its really not much of shock because you see hes not in that body hes just nebulously monitored by that body because somebody can walk in stir up the body give the body command and he himself will perceive the command this is relay system of ridges now if you get rid of one of those things run out the point where the ridge is stuck on the time track you just run it out as an incident you ask the preclear to move into that area of his body and push on through the incident as though it happened to him and he will tell you in moment or two but this didnt happen to this is just lying here up to that time he thought it happened to him it didnt really what it was was facsimile laid down on one of his ridges and you will find that as many as five or more bodies in pawn are being held here and there throughout the universe for one preclear all they do is take the phenomenon of ridge you see and they throw facsimile into play on that ridge and the person can be monitored now the most horrible of the entities is the stomacharea entity because its in conflict with the ge this entity is quite often responsible for nervous stomachs and so forth if you want to know something about coldblooded brutality and why people here on earth are so completely horribly fixated on lets be kind and lets get it organized one way or the other it is the utter brutal disregard for beingness which you find throughout the systems what you have here and consider humanitarian and so forth is very interestingly builtup system theres cast system which is exercised in other parts of the solar system which would appall the most viciously minded duke who ever lived here on earth theres slavery and what men are put to in that slavery how men are treated and so forth now for instance the body in pawn which will have something to do with this stomach entity the stomach entity has become so terrified they will actually go along and just kick it or shove needles into it or something to make pain shock come down and hit somebody here on earth theyre fed with forced quite often fed with sort of oh paste of some sort and its put in something that looks like grease gun you see you just stuff the nozzle of the grease gun down the throat and push this thing down that feeds thats feeding really very interesting but you can keep body alive for an awful long time under these condition youll find people whove had bodies in pawn for some ten thousand years they just go up and give this body just little bit of tremble of course and it just comes completely to pieces well now as far as reality of this stuff is concerned it has not generally been accepted here on earth that such things existed but i notice that we have whats known as science fiction here on earth i notice we have that and noticing it many many many years ago i thought this is good gag so i wrote lot of it you wouldnt dare write real science fiction not real science fiction nobodys guts could take it thats all there is to that so youre looking around for brutality and whats mauling your preclear around and why hes in apathy and so forth you better readjust your sights again as to what it takes to aberrate being it takes plenty takes terrific magnitude of incident to do anything to thetan up in the billion volt category all right now as i say this sounds sciencefictiony well dont let it sound sciencefictiony to you because the truth be told its not science fiction in the first place its not fiction and it really isnt very closely resembling what you read and call science fiction science fiction is just very chimerical sort of picture of it space is wild there arent any writers down here and theres audience down here that could take real stuff about space its wild and well let tell you little story this isnt just story one of the fifth invader force an officer came down here to take survey and this is very adventurous and in order to take decent survey of the place of course you understand the fifth invader force officer carries doll they dont carry bodies they carry dolls their identification is doll its very little flimsy mechanical affair that you can make talk and walk and so forth theyre cute theyre about meter tall theyre very light therefore you dont need you see you dont use oxygen in saucers and all of this stuff in science fiction is just rococo boy its rococo beyond rococo its just simple beyond simplicity you have this little doll and the thetan energy that fellow puts out is quite sufficient to monitor the control switchboard in the back of the doll thats all i mean simple and he tunes it up hes got his wavelength tuned to it and so on and its he can walk it around and he has at the same time in installations he has what you would classify as human beings i mean there are people in bodies who are doing work in various installations out through the system bodies exist but im talking about officers theyre pretty high order of thetan so heres doll hes monitoring this doll and he parked his doll and picked up one of the persons connected with the ruling house of hapsburg and went on survey of the domain and took notes on it and unfortunately he didnt have any foggy notion of how violently this particular prince was hated and this prince was assassinated and before this officer could disconnect and so forth the thetan charge which suddenly sprung up in the assassinated prince kaboom was sufficient to overwhelm and overpower this officer momentarily and he went through the screen im telling you this because its an average story not spectacular story not because its different but because its the same and he went through the screen kaboom and he landed on an installation well about few hundred miles north of the equator what you would consider north just trying to translate the words and directions on mars boom he went through and the martians oh boy what have we got here wonderful wonderful high volume thetan he must be space officer from some place or other so they took couple of standards put them down at the foot of the cell and so forth because they have good identification through body in pawn and so forth and they decided they were going to use him back here against earth he wouldnt transport so they just threw him in the clink you might say and kept him there just kept him there and kept him there an kept him there and kept him there and one fine day he took the body in pawn and threw it through the guard screen and blew it up was able to do this and himself got free on the backconcussion you see of this explosion and went out he went back down to station well call x and said where have i been for the last twentyseven years hmph something of on the order you should ask and he wrote out chit and they got couple of cruisers and they put together few commando forces and they took that installation to pieces but thoroughly to pieces and they took what martians were in that installation and so forth and put them in cans as far as anybody knows theyre still up there but blew this thing practically off the face of the map most martian stations are much tougher than this to crack thats an incident of the tiniest character in person operating now im telling you that incident because its fairly modern incident in the last few hundred years youll find lots of incidents like this in your preclears and lots of background like this and they cant understand why their values are this way and why their values are that way and theyre trying to fit the most outrageous set of earth values up against the values which they have had for god knows how long and they just wont mesh and this assists in the oblivion that you find people in by the way this is matter of small interest within the next century that same officer had completed his survey back down here and is up on one of the space stations now but you see you cant be sure exactly what youve got your hands on and just because i have told you this story and just because ive mentioned such stories to you as somebody with body in pawn for ten thousand years and being monitored and sent all over the place and that sort of thing is reason why you should tell it to your preclear but it gives you line on what to ask just slight lead of question you say where did it happen he could say kentucky or sussex but he normally wont hell say mars venus or hell give you some planetary name you never heard of youve got to audit these ridges through to get rid of these ridges if youre going to treat the body but you understand that when were working with this sort of thing we are to large degree treating the body and this is question of who the hell cares youre treating body bodies are nickel million if you only knew it any one of you here any one of you could pick himself up the line and go out and pick up any body you see go by this person is going to die someday pull him out pat him on the head and say tsk mars whhit they go i mean it sounds very horrible to you doesnt it it sounds like terrible violation of private rights thats because youve decided upon much higher level of action and yet what do you know it happens every once in while it happens you could do this now if you are out of your body and stable and if your preclear is out of his body and stable the point im trying to make is that you have escaped from and stepped sideways from the liability of sudden body shock if you have done this all by itself so that the body can be hurt and so on regardless of the state of knowingness regardless of the ability to put out energy regardless of any other of these abilities you have achieved knowing immortality for your preclear or for yourself you have stepped actually out of the line of stimulus response and being the victim on all of this sort of thing and of course it makes tremendous difference to person youd never realize how widely ones values change on such thing because it just doesnt matter how many bodies would kick the bucket it doesnt matter you would come up shining on the matter you want to perfect that skill because its the only thing that ever got you in trouble see you were unable to stay outside of bodies when they were given sudden shock or when they were hurt so get up through the command range on body dont stay down along the other level and actually what youve bought is an immortality so your body gets knocked off so what very few people have viewpoint even when theyve been out of their bodies developed up to the level that it should be im going to give you today some very vital data on this because ive seen that there are two or three points which have not been clearly grasped and in view of that why lets get the data to clearly grasp them now i dont care you can say im telling you fairy tales about this sort of thing or something we wont worry about the credulity or incredulity of the data dont force this data on your preclear because if you force it on your preclear youll throw something into violent restimulation that youll be sorry for but if you find your preclear is having an awful time over something or other in some zone of his body lets say some entity is stuck on the time track in that zone and it might be one of the reasons why he cant get out of his body and if youre going in for the business of cleaning up bodies youve got to be able to resolve the problem of entities and you resolve the problem of entity by finding out where this entity is located in the body and then finding out where its stuck on the time track and you will find death or transplant or something of the sort occurring at that point you ask the thetan the individual to sort of move into that area and move through that incident and bring that entity up to present time now he has tendency to give the entities complete credit for beingness and the entities dont have beingness they react to passing energy the energy goes out from the individual through the entity and the energy comes out from the environment and goes to the individual and passes through the entity so the environment can restimulate the entity the preclear can restimulate this entity you see and your preclear looks at this and wonders why in the name of common sense he acts that way its because when he puts out energy in that direction that entity stimulusresponsewise that ridge goes into effect and he has accounting for the fact because he didnt put anything into effect and when somebody scolds him suddenly or something of the sort hes perfectly willing to bite their head off but instead of that he feels scared to death why this is unaccountable so he begins to believe theres something wrong with him and the truth of the matter is there isnt anything wrong with him thats the truth the only thing you could say would be wrong with him is hes has lot of ridges around him which have facsimiles on them and these ridges can be thrown into restimulation and then he stands there and watches this so you see its mystery to him so he begins to think after while i must be nuts hes saying yeah ive got some there isnt any such thing as sane entity because theres such thing as sane stimulusresponse activity but dont think your entity cant think it can think it has certain low order of beingness not alive its running on the thetans energy you see but because of associative nature of energy and other things it can think it can act you can talk to an entity and have it talk back to you and so on you can throw the attention of the thetan around the body so as to restimulate the entities one after the other but you do this like this now you say all right now this right outboard entity now im talking to this right outboard entity soandso and soandso and so andso and soandso and this preclear will say it says soandso and soandso and you could say do you like ice cream and he says it says it doesnt like ice cream what youve done you see is take the thetans energy beam and youve thrown it out here onto this ridge because you said the right outside didnt you so thats direct stimulusresponse its just ridge and there it sits and you throw the thetans energy at it and your energy is going at it dont omit that point youre restimulating it youve got beam on it and hes got beam on it and so of course itll talk cute very very humorous mechanism actually but people seldom feel like laughing because they can make man feel like hes being torn to bits you talk about fear and you talk about agony and being pinned down and all the rest of this this is on these darn ridges now youre looking at what ive been describing here youre looking at the reactive mind youre not just looking at something thats vaguely like the reactive mind of the first book youre looking at the reactive mind the first book could be said to be description of ridges and the behavior of ridges if you want to know lot more about how outrageously ridges can behave and so forth just read about the reactive mind in book one and that is actually the ridge thats the ridges behavior so the reactive mind has geographical locations in the body is found to be energy ridges on which facsimiles have been affixed and the stimulusresponse character of them causes very very aberrated behavior they have an associative quality that is to say theyre this absurd logic thats one thing mirror another thing and so forth but theyre down closer to an identity aaaa than they are to thinking really and thats the way you tell what this thing is its reasoning on aaaa you can actually ask an entity certain questions and it will give you identity responses korzybski korzybski in his tremendous piece of work there was trying madly to differentiate over above around under alongside of and for gods sakes lets do something about this aaaa of an electronic ridge to which facsimiles are affixed now you want to know routes out of this trouble how you get away from this trouble he points out route his route however although hayakawag and some of the boys in general semantics believe theres therapy involved in it there isnt you can train and train and train and train and train when youre training into differentiation and all youre doing is training in secondary circuit response the fellow starts to identify and then he gets very carerful and differentiates well now hes got circuit set up that differentiates what he started to identify and of course all youre doing really is giving lot of credit to some ridge youre giving the ridge credit of beingness and the guy will get worse he wont get better so watch crediting ridges thats true isnt it female voice yes youve watched that happen female uoice preclear got worse when you audited ridges thats right so if you must be concerned with the body the thetan when he moves out will generally leave the bulk of these ridges in the body if he moves out knowingly he just leaves these ridges and these ridges are sitting in the body and so on but he has built them up and hes carried them around and hes pulled them in and hes done these various things with them hes finally fixed this body with great many ridges but these ridges have very strict pattern they have very strict behavior and this outrageous story i have been telling you about space stations and all that sort of thing is very muchly responsible for the state and action the weird insane character of these darn ridges today now youre going to find preclears once in while who will start giving you messages of course theyre on communication line why shouldnt they give you messages some guard has been walking past some cell where theres body in pawn and all of sudden this body stirs bodies are not supposed to do that so he says ohoh somebody just died but then it doesnt stir the way body stirs when it just died hell say ahahahahahah somebody is monkeying around probably few years ago they said oh some damn hypnotist nobody will believe him anyway they didnt do too much about it but thats not been the case here in the last year or so theyve been fascinated and theyre just about as helpless as babies in diapers because theyve got holding operation theyre guilty of tremendous overt acts themselves they have method of attack they have been influencing via the mind for so long that theyve actually lost their initiative to do anything else and if anybody was going to do anything to earth on violent side or anybody was going to do anything to people on violent side it would be somebody like the fifth force but the fifth force has completely opposite interest in earth it does not want to do anything to earth if anything is protecting earth at this time its the fifth force people but isnt it strange that you will find the fifth force people occasionally have body in pawn here youll find an occasional body in pawn from the fifth force and when you do when you do itll be different proposition because its monitored by consent the guy is here with comm line set up and hes almost in state of knowingness concerning exactly where he came from and what hes doing its different proposition entirely you have the difference between young ambitious race you might say and an old decayed cavedin race and the two just dont mesh they dont fight on the same battleground or anything so theres active concept involved here of battle or action beyond this insidious action through the mind we all of sudden find russia and the united states going to war why silly huh everything would militate in favor of peace and yet the most insane things will suddenly happen some joker in the us will suddenv order all the ships into port at pearl harbor suddenly inexplicably and then fix it up so that none of the messages to warn pearl harbor get there insists on putting them all in topsecret code here are telephones lying all over the place pick up the telephone and say hey we just got word there were couple of japanese aircraft carriers standing right off pearl harbor and i know we told you all to go into port there in the last three days and secure for an admirals inspection and take all the ammunition out of your magazine and put it below with the ready boxes and that sort of thing but you know theres little danger here of fight starting and just few hours ago you sunk japanese submarine right outside the harbor and how about snapping and popping and getting on the ball there and you probably ought to be able to put the ammunition back in the ready boxes and maybe few of those ships get out of port just in case just in case oh haha well go and find the admirals and the generals and well find theyre all at parties so well have conference with them tomorrow and then tomorrow tomorrow well put it all in code that takes about two hours to encode and then itll have to be two hours to decode and well get that word of warning to pearl harbor at 1000 am pearl harbor time sunday mmhm how do things like this happen the men that did those if stood up and asked bluntly where their loyalty and what their actions were and intentions you would find out that they were completely sincere in their jobs just completely sincere i mean they intended to do the very best they could for people and nations and everything else but all of sudden from some quarter in sails one of these wild ones one of these terrifically wild tidbits of business that you just say huh cant exist well the human race will shadowbox with this for long time if it remains the human race itll keep on doing this so dont expect that your preclear will be able to explain completely some of his actions during his lifetime little actions its wonderful what small minds can think of as worthy goals very small minds as far as the martian operation is concerned i mean lets all go out and play hopscotch something real serious bunch of old fat boobs sitting around in the dirt playing big important games but theyre playing an important game which runs an insidious line and therapist all of sudden encounters because hes trying to make somebody sane he finds as long and you will find as long as you dodge away from this and say it doesnt exist and that sort of thing that youre going to find certain number of cases that you arent going to be able to do anything for thats just inevitable now if you want to do something for those extra cases those additional cases why just remember some of this data which you had in the course books and remember some of the data im giving you now and you might say to yourself oh my god not that and solve the case well i didnt mean to talk very longwindedly on that subject im sorry it happens to be something in which im interested as curiosa of course strictly and its something if youve got good sense you wont talk about much out in public female uoice weve really lost nearly all our friends anyway audience laughter oh yes you have huh thats all right our real refuge as far as friends and communication is concerned is really us i mean our refuge is us now oh by the way lot of speculation goes around every once in blue moon i11 pull some kind of gag off i pulled one little while ago i didnt pull it intentionally i say yes i knew her commanding officer that happens to be true but it doesnt mean that i have let make my position very clear that i have any ax to grind with regard to this i dont have im not part of this fight its just something that you take look at and you say oh and then you get interested and you get rather partisan about the thing as far as your sentiments are concerned but its the partisan of watching bright new operation and watching an old dead operation and watching an awful lot of beings being terribly unhappy and awfully mucked up and all fouled up like fire drill for what reason its weird beautiful reason so that planet which could get along very nicely is just running off the rails all the time i mean nobody can get anything going on this planet 1 mean not nobodys supposed to get together and so on what benefit is it to anybody the funny part of it is it has benefit it is in the line of terrible habit as far as the fourth invader force is concerned now as you go around you will find theres machinery stuck out here lot of it just chase your pc around in various directions and the next thing you know hes going to say theres lines going here and theres lines going there and theres big machine sitting over here and theres other machines sitting there and theres and so on well dont let him monkey with them too much those are fourth invader force machines this whole area of this end of the galaxy is boobytrapped and those machines are bearcats some of them to turn off and although they may look like theyre very easy to turn off its something like the picture the germans used to use this as booby trap theyd put picture slightly askew over fireplace or something in bombed cottage or something you see and your own troops would come in and somebody couldnt resist straightening up the picture and of course it was trapped and it would blow up and blow everybody up in the room they had to straighten up the picture now actually you have great interest in these machines because they cant do very much one way or the other and the truth of the matter was if you were to hand map to the fifth invader of some of these machines that youd found and that sort of thing hed be only too happy to send cruiser something of the sort and blow them off the map but itd take few megamegamegavolts to do very much to these machines now youll find occasionally sickness will set in on preclear very short time after hes been on one of these excursions thats because hes hit an antipathetic wave which is rigged to be nice wave so dont let your preclear sit around and listen to beautiful music or something of the sort thats theta trap dont let him go around he says oh you know theres the most gorgeous looking temple or something i keep going over there and looking at this beautiful temple and and you say wait minute whats it look like oh its just gorgeous the most beautiful architecture you say come home now and he well i let let come home now because all of sudden your preclear is going to be in appetite over tin cup into theta trap theta traps are trapped ordinarily with aesthetics the other type of trap is mechanical trap which has matching wavelength in its construction its post or something and the thetan throws beam hes just passing through the area and all of sudden something echos at his wavelength and the next thing you know he thinks somebody he knows is over there and he goes over to look and then the second he tries to get off of it the more energy he puts out the more active the trap becomes theres energy in the trap but the energy the thetan himself is putting into it and hell stay on these things for god knows how long those are types of traps as far as thetan being very badly implanted is concerned how can you implant an energy unit thats an interesting question how can you implant an energy unit its question in which you should be awfully interested because you cant you can give it some ridges but it can always move out from amongst these ridges you have to get it to agree and change its mind about something and once its agreed on something of the sort why then its possible for it to be in state which keeps on holding on to ridges so the most important thing you can do with thetan is postulate processing not ridgethrowingaround and the rest of it ive said this before and i wish to point it up and punch it up now postulates postulates you can take any preclear you know and take run from bottom to top of scale that scale i gave you many weeks ago just to change ones postulates and if you keep this up you just keep this up you go on this way hell get better and better and better and better and better but we have in all of these wild pitches terrific amount of coversion its very covert all of this overtness toward beings it hasto be because you cannot actually aberrate permanently an energy unit you cannot kill it all you can get it to do is change its mind that is to say alter its postulates its concept of beingness you can get it to alter its concept of beingness really and if you can get it to alter its concept of beingness then itll keep on holding these silly ridges all around itself with facsimiles on them and the ridges keep going into stimulusresponse and because your thetan did not know the mechanism he actually lacked knowledge of it he couldnt beat it he couldnt beat this game so hed stay at low level now possessing knowledge of this is not really the same thing as being theta clear i wish to impress that upon you let give you the example of my boy nibs l ron hubbard junior interesting thing hes rather nice kid rather standard hot rod american kid perfect sense of irresponsibility nice kid his friends all liked him thats what you judge kid by he got along well with people and that sort of thing but he had practically goals nothing to look forward to or anything standard young american today being picked up by the draft and shoved here and shoved there alright he had 7 hours total processing up to stable outside of his body and so forth that was in the course of about 36 hours he completely change his attitudes personality and so forth he got terrific sense of responsibility he was reaching back and picking up pieces of knowledge of this sort and that sort and fitting them together and getting himself an education off the track he was going around trying to help other guys out he was doing this and doing that he was guy you really would care to know all of sudden not just this kid fantastic change he went along for little while and he thought he was very savy now he was perfectly satisfied that he had reached state of knowingness where he could cope with things i looked upon him not too long ago and boy that boy had been having to burn the midnight oil and the morning oil and the afternoon oil in trying to catch up with the knowledge of book one dmsmh the course books science of survival self analysis and so forth just so he could live you get the idea just so he could stay up in state this knowledge is vital its an education which one has to have to remain this wise see because if you dont know about this and you dont know about that and dont know about something or other it was not knowing about this and about that and about something or other that made it possible for any of you to be tricked into something in the first place see its just not knowing this data which is fascinating to you you should say yes if you get guy up to high state of knowingness he should know all of this i refer you to science of survival the theory of enturbulation of theta with mest and then its disenturbulation again that is data of the mest universe which is being gained your potentiality of knowingness goes way high but this does not mean that data goes that high to remain stable nibs is doing terrific job right now by the way he is just starting in to teach theta clearing course in phoenix as of today and hes using the tapes which you heard and stuff ive written him in letters and so forth and everybody was having very hard time with it in the states one way or the other and theyre making it the hard way and he was very interested in getting the show on the road he wanted to come over here very desperately very badly and he was all booked and he had his boat passage and his passport and then time was running short and he was going to pick up an airplane and come over here and he was going to do anything and he finally phoned up on the telephone and he says arent you going to let come over there and i kept telling him that the operation in phoenix was in very very great need of his services and he finally buckeled down and hes running that operation hes eighteen and of all the guys anywhere in that vicinity theres just two people that i would trust great deal one of them is old alphia heart who is the hardest boiled softhearted character you ever saw laughter great guy and the other ones nibs just fantastic you dont know american youth but you know how irresponsible some british youth is just as strata of irresponsibility well now if you multiply it by about hundred youve got american youth today and all of sudden weve got man very responsible man quite interesting by the way his attitude toward is very very interesting it might be an interesting little datum you might like to know about he used to look on rather resentfully and so on because you see during the years he was growing up and so on i was off to the wars and off on expiditions and here and there and i wasnt home and his home life blew up pretty much and so on so he recording ends abruptly
