operations as part of global usled anti terrorism effort operation enduring freedom in afghanistan has realized major successes with the vital assist ance of neighboring pakistan yet resurgent taliban today operates in southern and easte rn afghanistan with the benefit of apparent sanctuary in parts of western pakistan the united states is increasingly concerned that members of qaeda its taliban supporters and other islamist militants find safe haven in pakistani cities such as quetta and peshawar as well as in the rugged pakistanafghanistan border region this latter area is inhabited by ethni c pashtuns who express solidarity with anti us forces qaeda militants also repor tedly have ma alliances with indigenous pakistani terrorist groups that have been implicated in both antiwestern attacks in pakistan and terrorism in india these gr oups seek to oust the islamabad government of president gen pervez musharraf and have been implicated in assassination attempts that were only

them set up new safe haven in free iraq yet many observers warn that an american preoccupation with iraq has contributed to allowing the emergence of new qaeda safe havens in western pakistan us policy and concerns south asia is viewed as key arena in the fight against militant religious extremism most especially in pakistan and as relate d to afghan stability in november 2006 the state departments under secretary for political affairs nicholas burns said it is in south asia where our future success in the struggle against global terrorism will likely be decided in afghanistan and pakistan2 the 911 commission report emphasized that mounting largescale international terrorist attacks appears to require sanctuaries in which terrorist groups can plan and operate with im punity it further claimed that pakistans vast unpoliced regions remained attrac tive to extremist groups the commission identified the government of president musha rraf as the best hope for stability in pakistan and afghanistan and recommended that the united states make longterm commitment to provide comprehensive suppor t for islamabad so long as pakistan itself is committed to combating extremism and to policy of enlightened moderation3 in january 2007 senate testim ony assessing global threats the outgoing director of national intelligence john negroponte capture d in two sentences the dilemma pakistan now poses for us policy makers pakistan is frontline partner in the war on terror nevertheless it remains major source of islamic extremism and the home for some top terrorist leaders in what were surely wellcalculated remarks he went on to identify qaeda as posing the single greatest terrorist threat to the united states and its interests and warned that the organizations core ements maintain active connections and relationships that radiate out ward from their leaders s ecure hideouts in pakistan4 this latter reference was considered the strongest such statement to date by highranking bush administration official throughout the opening months of 2007 administration officials us military commanders and senior us senators issued further incriminating statements about pakistans assumed status as terrori st base and the allegedly insufficient response of th islamabad government the united states also remains concer ned with indigenous extremist groups in pakistan and with the ongoing crossbor der infiltration of islamist militants who traverse the kashmiri line of c ontrol and other borders to engage in terrorist acts in india and indian kashmir many analysts consider such activities conceptually inseparable from the problem of islamist militancy in western pakistan and in afghanistan domestic terrorism in pakistan much of it associated with islamist sectarianism has become an increasingly serious problem affecting major pakistani cities separatist violence in indias muslimmajority ja mmu and kashmir state has continued unabated since

determination sincerity and effectiveness of pakistani gove rnment efforts to combat relig ious extremists doubts are widely held by western experts many of whom express concerns about the implications of maintaining present us policies toward the region and about the efficacy of islamabads latest strategy which appears to seek reconciliation with protaliban militants5 islamabad is adamant in asserting that it serves its own selfinterests through closer relations with the united states since 2001 that there should be doubts about the sincerity of its antiterrorism policies with corollary that any failings in this area are rooted in pakistans capabilities rather than in its intentions and that solely military efforts to combat religious militancy are bound to fail instead pakistani officials aver the socalled war on terrorism must empha size socioeconomic uplift and resolution of outstanding disputes in the muslim world including in kashmir palestine and iraq6 the outcomes of us policies toward pa kistan since 911 while not devoid of meaningful successes have neither neutralized antiwestern militants and reduced religious extremism in that country nor ve they contributed sufficiently to the stabilization of neighboring afgh anistan many observers thus urge broad reevaluation of such policies including questioning of seeming us reliance on the institution of the pakistani military and on the person of president musharraf along with shifting of considerable us assistance funds toward pr ograms that might better engender longterm stability in pakistan7

strategy for engaging pakistan and making statement of policy that further waivers of couprelated aid sanctions should be informed by the pace of democratic reform ex tension of the rule of law and the conduct of the parliamentary elections scheduled to take place in late 2007 perhaps most notably the section includes provision that would end us military assistance and arms sales licensing to that country in fy2008 unle ss the president certifie s that the islamabad government is making all possible efforts to end taliban activities on pakistani soil many analysts view section 1442 as sign that democra ticcontrolled congress may pressure the bush adminis tration to review its pakist an policy although many also warn that such overt conditionality is count erproductive to the goal of closer us pakistan relations the bush administratio n explicitly opposes the certification provision on such grounds and it instead urges that th certification be replaced with reporting requirement8 senate version of the house bill s 4 was passed in march but contains pakistanspecific language in response to us congressional signals of possible shift in us policy toward islamabad the pakistani

security efforts and have included u sfunded roadbuilding projects in western pakistan and the provision of nightvision equipment communica tions gear protective vests and transport helicopters and aircraft the united states also has undertaken to train and equip new pakistan army air assault units that can move quickly to find and target terrorist elements us security assistance to pakistans

special investigation group us effo rts may be hindered by pakist ani shortcomings that include poorly trained and poorly equipped pe rsonnel who generally are underpaid by ineffectively coordina ted and overburdened g overnment agencies possible adjustments to us assistance programs many commentators on us assistance programs for pakistan ve recommended making adjustments to the proportion of funds devoted to military versus economic aid andor to the objectives of such programs currently funds are split r oughly evenly between economic and security related aid programs with the great bulk of the former going to general economic budget support fund and most of the latter fi nancing big ticket defense articles such as airborne early warning aircraft and antiship and antiarmor missiles it may be useful to better target us assistance programs in such way that they more effectively benefit the countrys citizens one former seni or senate staffer s called for improving americas image in pakistan by making us aid more visible to ordinary pakistanis9 an idea commonly floated by analysts is the conditioning of aid to pakistan perhaps through the creation of benchmarks for example in 2003 task force of senior american south asia watchers issued report on us policy in the region which included recommendation that the extent of us support for islama bad should be linked to that governments own performance in ma king pakistan more modern progressive and democratic state as promised by pres ident musharraf in january 2002 specifically the task force urged directing twothirds of us aid to economic programs and onethird to security assistance and conditioning incr eases in aid amounts to progress in pakistans reform agenda10 more recent perspective is repr esentative of ongoing concerns about the emphases of us aid programs the united states has given musharraf considerable slack in meeting his commitments to deal with domestic extrem ism or his promises to restore authentic democracy the us partnership with paki stan would probably be on firmer footinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22632crs6 11 marvin weinbaum afghanistan and its neighbors us institute of peace

cohen the idea of pakistan brookings institution 2004 p 318through conditioned programs more dedicated to building the countrys political and social institutions than rewarding its leadership11 other analysts however including those ma king policy for the bush administration believe that conditioning us aid to pakistan has past record of failure and likely would be counterproductive some dd that putting additional pre ssure on an already besieged musharraf government might lead to significant political instability in islamabad the bush administration has come under fire from some quarters for overemphasizing its relationshi p with the person of pervez musharraf an army general who came to power through extraconstitutional means at the expense of democratization processe s in pakistan and further for maintaining singleminded focus on antiterrorism that has given pass to musharraf and the pakistani military in the areas of nuclear proliferation rule of law and human rights for several years veteran pakistan watchers have been calling attention to the potential problems inherent in us overreliance on president musharraf as an i ndividual at alleged cost to more positive development of pakistans democratic institutions and civil society12 in 2006 two former senior us diplomats jointly urged the bu sh administration to move beyond its fairly limited focus on the person of pervez musharraf by creating better links with wider array of prodemocracy civil society elements there13 more substantive militarytomilitary relations could be of significant benefit to overall uspakistan relations and the attainme nt of us goals in south asia related sanctions imposed on pakistan in 1990 were in some respects harmful to subsequent us interests in the region for example the spension of military training imet programs meant that for more than decade there wa s exchange between the pakistani and us militaries washingtonbased expert on the pakistani military has insisted that such exchanges are crucial in encouraging liber secular outlook among pakistans officer corps and provide the united states unique access to that countrys leading institution14 in apparent response to growing concerns bout the course of events in pakistan and in uspakistan relations assistant secret ary of state for south and central asian affairs richard boucher met with top pakistani leaders in islamabad in midmarch where he lauded pakistans role as vita l us ally and announced new fiveyear 750 million aid initiative for development programs in pakistans western tribal regions the
