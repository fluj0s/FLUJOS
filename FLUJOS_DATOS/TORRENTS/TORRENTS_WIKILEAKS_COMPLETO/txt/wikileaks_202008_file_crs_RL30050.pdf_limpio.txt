role was exclusively military in origin beginning in 1918 with the first air mail flights commercial aviation became growing focus of federal attention and assistance in the intervening 80 years the federa l government has spent 155 billion in support of aviation activities this report details and comments on federal assistance provided directly i n support of commercial aviation dire ct assistance in this view can take several forms for example the physical components of the air traffic control system can b regarded as infrastructure direct payments to airlines can be regarded as subsidies and the operating expenses of the federal aviation administration faa and it s predecessor agencies can be construed as operational support indirect assistance such as that provided through military research and development rd and b rd provided by agencies other than the department of transportation and it s predecessor agencies is not detailed in this report in the early years of federal support for aviation most assistance came in th form of designated subsidies to foster the growth of what has become th commercia l aviation industry this was in keeping with the aviation sector s embryonic nat ure as the industry has matured the level and expense of the federal effort has expan ded and spending for capital infrastructure and operational activities have become specific components of annual federal budgets the debate today is not so much about whether federal role in aviation i s appropriate rather the debate is about how to pay for federal programs and who should pay for it in the first half of this century almost all aviation expenses cam from us treasury general funds in the trust fund era this contribution s diminished as designated user fees h ave provided

direct federal spending 1918 1998 the dawn of human flight occurred less than century ago yet in that shor t period flight has gone from novelt to utility air travel in the eyes of many is now nothing more than ho hum reality notable mostly for its mystery meals and t luggage in fact the benefits of aviation permeate our society in ways that are both visible to us such as airline travel and largely invisible to most of us such as th rapid transport of human organs for transplantation 1 the federal governmen t has played large role in the development of aviation in the ten years prior to 1918 this role was exclusively military in origin beginning in 1918 with the first air mail flights commercial aviation became growing focus of federal attention and assistance in the intervening 80 years

assistance in this view can take severa l forms for examp the physical components of the air traffic control system can be regarded as infrastructure direct payments to airlines are historically

carriers and the military corporate jets and crop dusters are examples of general aviationactivity not d etailed in this report there are however numerous overlaps between commercial and military aviation the air traffic control system for example s both civilian and military components and serves both types of aviation often using the same facilities the authors of this report exercise some judgement as to whether or not t include certain agency information costs that cannot be directly viewed as having direct impact on aviation activities are omitted the operating expenses for th now defunct civil aeronautics board cab for example have been omitted whereas assistance to airlines provided as result of cab actions is included the data in this report is presented using actual doll ars the period covered by this report examines wide range of federal activities that cannot be easily compared in fact or in moneta ry terms hence the use constant dollars is not viewed as being helpful for this analysis federal assistance to commercial aviation has taken numerous forms in some instances federal assistance is readily identifiable and can be detailed using federal budget documents however identifying spending in the era prior to the adoptio n of unified federal budget which occurred in 1969 is somewhat problematic it is often not possible to find original source data for the pre1969 period as result this analysis draws heavily on secondary sources for this information in addition it is often difficult to distinguish whether pre1969 data reflect s fiscal year data or calenda r year data this distinction does not affect the results and trends enumerated in this report however post 1970 data in this report is all fiscal year data the research for this report has identified number of data inconsistencies for federal accounting of aviation activities most of these inconsistencies exist because of choices mad by earlier research about what should or should not be counted as federal aid to adjust for these problems this report uses what crs feels are th most consistent data sources for the most part however data differences ar relatively small in numerical terms and would not have major affect on th spending trends presented in this report early history 19181938 the federal government has had direct financial involvement in th development and support of domestic air transportation since the aforementione d beginning of air mail service by the post office department in 1918 air mai l service remained mainly post office department endeavor until 1928

air mail service by 1928 this transfer was largely complete between 1926 and 1930 the federal government paid more than 31 million t contracto rs while collecting less than 15 million in postal revenues for air mai l service as result the service was provided at deficit of slightly over 1 7 million5 in 1930 congress passed the wat res act which permitted higher compensation to air carriers by relating payments to the cost of operation rather than keying them to the act ual volume of mail carried during the period of airmail operation unde r the watres act 1931 to 1934 tota l postal expenditures exceeded postal revenues by approxim ately 536 million more importantly from the perspective of federa l6 policy the pos t office began requiring that air mail contractors carry passengers it was the hope of the post office that passenger traffic could eventually lead to reduction in the need for air mail subsidies in 1934 the post office terminated all air mail contracts on the grounds that contractors were colluding on pricing th fledgling us army air corps wa s pressed into mail delivery service with disastrous results numerous accidents and d eaths revealed an air corps with severe operating deficiencies in need of correction to rectify the situation congress passed the air mail act of 1934 pl 73 308 which contained several significant changes in government policy regardin g airmail operations the act reopened all airmail routes to competitive bidding an d authorized the postmaster general to contract with private firms to provide airmail service it also transferred economic regulation of aid to carriers and rates f compensa tion from the post office department to the interstate commerc commission icc and moved safety regulation from the post office department to the department of commerce from the enactment of the air mail act of 1934 until 1938 air passengermiles doubled and airmail poundmiles rose substantially during this time the federal government incurred deficit from airmail activitie s of 264 million7 the regulated era 1938 1978 airline subsidies 19391984 for many years the issue of subsidy payments to airlines was among the most controversial of all transportation issues considered by congress the airlin industrys once major competition the passenger railroads railed at the unfai rhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30050crs4 op cit footnote 18 us civil aeronautics board subsidy for united states certified air carriers 9 washington us govt print off march 1974 appendix i this split was accomplished by executive order of the eisenhower administration 10 reorganization plan 10advantage which they believed accrued to the airline industry as result of subsid payments longterm argum ents about how to count subsidies and what they meant continued thr oughout the 1940s 1950s and into the 1960s some serious attempts were made by the federal government to put airline industry subsidies int perspective the results of these s tudies are reflected in the following discussion and table8 in 1938 congress passed the civil aeronautics act which created fiv member independent regulatory agency called the civil aeronautics authorit caa at the same time the act also created an air safety board which is th predecessor of todays national transportation safety board ntsb in 1940 an executive order reorganized the caa renamed it the civil aeronautics boar d cab and made it part of the department of commerce the cab had authority to fix airmail rates and hence subsidy levels prior to the 1938 act the payment of air mail subsidies to encourage airline passenger travel was implicit the 1938 act was explicit in its subsidy provisions federal subsidies to airlines from 1939 t 1953 totaled 310890000 9 during the regulated era 1938 197 8 airlines operated on routes prescribed by the cab the cab also regulated far market entry and other facets of the airline industrys activities the cab never reg ulated frequencies the number of flights per day between markets the regulated era is viewed as the maturation period of the airline industry which under the cabs watchful eye moved into the jet age an d became the nations principal common carrier of passenger service in 1953 airline subsidies were separated from airmail compensation an d provided independently after that date the post office paid airmail compensation10 and the cab made all airline subsidy payments for all practical purposes direc t subsidy to the largest airlines was phased out by the end of the 1950s after that date almost all remaining subsidy was focused on local air service and other specialize d services such as those provided in alaska and hawaii shortly after world war ii the cab participated in the creation of new class of air carriers the local service carriers whose primary purpose was to provid service to destinations lacking air service from the large trunkline air carriers most local service carriers originally started as small scale operations performing extensive shorthop type service over time these airlines evolved into significant servic providers us airways is direct descendent of one of the local service carriers the local service airlines were provided with designated assistance long after th subsidies to trunk lines ended in addition these air carriers were major recipient s of aid from the aircraft guaranteed loan program that will be discussed later in thi s report local service subsidies known over part of their life as the section 40 6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30050crs5 program terminated in the early 1980s but some residual subsidy was provided s late as 1984 subsidy payments by the cab from 1954 to 1983 totaling almost 19 billio n are detailed in table 1 table 1

costs would likely reduce the amount of subsidy paid to the carriers by th federal government these loan guarantees totaled 92 4 million over the years 1957 to 1983 as shown in table 2 funding for this program wa s subject to appropriations and is considered spending for the purposes of this report the absolute amount of assistance to airlines provided by the loan guarante program is not clear if the airline could have obtained credit on essentially similar terms without guarantee the subsidy issue would be essentially moot however if the airline could not have obtained the loan without government guarantee i t would have benefitted greatly from the program since there is little evidence t indicate whether the loans could have been obtained or on what terms in the absence of government guarantee the amount of subsidy to airlines cannot be accuratel determined however the federal government does bear the cost of the loan program i f airlines default the guarantee shifts

passengers wer specifically desig nated for airport and airway construction improvements although many observers considered t hese taxes partial offset to the expense of constructing and maintaining the airport and airway system they were paid into the general fund of the us treasury the airport and airway trust fund was created by the revenue title of the airport and airway development act of 1970 pl 91258 the aviation trust fund as it is also known was established to provide funding for capital improvements to the nations airport and airway system the scope of the aviation trust fund has bee n expanded over time the most recent full reauthorization of aviation program s occurred with passage of federal aviati on administration authorization act of 1996 pl 104264 sixmonth ex tension to

categories the increases in the om acco unt have been the most substantial on relative basis source of growth in spending has been the ongoing nd controversial upgrade of the air traffic control system which began in the early 1980s and is still many years fro m completion most of this spending shows up in the fe account but this spending has affected other accounts as well close examination of this table reveals some apparent anomalies in growt h trends in most instances these are the results of specific events such as the ai r traffic controllers strike of 1981 as result the anomalies should probably b regarded as transient effects on what has been and is likely to remain scenario of steady growth table 6 faa expenditures fiscal years 19711998 millions year m f r d aip total1 1971

aviation community about the usefulness andor des irability of user fees as mechanism for funding the faa in 1970 it was decided that user fee system was desirable for funding the aviation trust fund this was far from the end of the debate however the trust fun d has gone through several modificati ons over the years and on two occasions 19801982 and 1996 dispute s over funding andor programs led to lapses in the operation of the trust fund the existing tax system is certainly based on collections from users but thi s system is viewed by many observers as less than perfect proxy for user fe system the ticket tax for example is collected on the basis of wide range of fares charged by airlines for what is essentially standard product an airline seat th operating requirements of the air traffic control atc system however are base d on the movement of aircraft 200seat aircraft and 20seat aircraft operatin g under positive air traffic cont rol require similar level of atc services but pay into the trust fund at very different rates changes were made in 1997 to create a15 segment fee i n addition to the ticket tax that was intended to address the differential use issue these changes however have engendered at least as much discussion as the predecessor system it is unlikely given the bifurcated nature of the aviatio n industry and its various inte rests groups that any system could be devised that would satisfy all groups hence it is likely that there will be calls for congress to revisi t the user fee system in the future another longstanding issue surrounding the trust fund is the appropriatenes s of spending trust fund revenues for faa operating expenses the trust fund wa s originally established as means of paying for aviation capital needs ever presidential administration sinc the trust fund was established however has sought additional om f unding from the trust fund as can be seen in table 7 the general fund share of faa spending has varied over time but on the whole the trust fun d share of the overall faa budget has grown to the point that it now accounts fo r approximately 70 of spending in most recent years final and related issue is the question of the accumulation of unexpende d funds in the trust fund over time during most of its life the trust fund has had a16 large unexpended balance the unexpended balances have several origins but on of the most important is the annual accumulation of interest to the fund by virtue of the investment of the unexpended balance in us treasury financial instruments httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30050crs13 the temporary expiration of the trust fund in 1996 largely eliminated th unexpende d balance by all predictions however the trust funds unexpende d balance is expected to grow dramatically in the next few years unless additional trust fund spending is allocated for capital or operating expenses in the next fa reauthorization cycle this new expended balance is likely to provide the debating points for th ose who want more spending on aviation capital activities and for those who wish to see the general fund contribution to aviation reduced table 7
