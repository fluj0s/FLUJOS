the early 1960s to peer into denied regions of the soviet union and other secretive enemy states have from time to time been used by civilian agencies of the federal government to assist with mapping disaster relief and environmen tal concerns these uses ve been coordinated by the civil applications office at the us geol ogical survey component of the interior department post 911 the bush adminis tration has sought to encourage use of satellitederived data for homeland security and law enforcement purposes in addition to the civil applications that have been supported for years in 2007 it moved to transfer responsibility for coor dinating civilian use of satellites to the department of homeland security the initiative was launched however apparently without notification of key c ongressional oversight committees members of congress and outside groups have raised concerns that using satellites for law enforcement purposes may infringe on the privacy and fourth amendment rights

soviet uni on in early years film canisters were returned to earth and processed at ground st ations for further dissemination in the 1970s it became possible to forward data by electrical transmission directly to collection agencies the efforts of intelligence agencies are focused abroad and satellite passes were optimized to gather information on areas of interest mostly in europe and asia at the same time satellites also passed over us territory and collection on domestic targets could be obtained as free good in addition it was often necessary to undertake engineering passes by which technical specialists could compare imagery with data obtaine d directly from ground observa tion engineering passes provided detailed aeria l photography of domestic site s declassified documents published by the national security archive indicate that as early as 1968 consideration was being given to provide images captured by intelligence satellites to civilian agencies on issues such as hydrology and oceanography mapping and emergency preparedness1 in the mid1970s there was extensive cern about past efforts of the cia and other agencies to monitor us pe rsons and these concerns extended to reconnaissance satellites2 the 1975 rockefeller commission the commission on cia activities within the united states re viewed the issues involved in domestic overhead photography

existence and location of weapons of mass destruction wmd materi als or wmds themselves prepared or smuggled in by hostile individuals or groups the cap abilities that satellited erived information might add to homeland security and law enforcement efforts are inevitably classified but could be investigated and assessed by congressional committees the comparative advantages of intelligence satellites are that they can be targeted in an emergency assuming foreign intelligence requirements take precedence their pr oducts are costfree to the reques ting agency and their resolution is higher than what is otherwise availa ble on the other hand they may not be available for civil use at particular time prolonged international crisis or ongoing combat operations could significantly limit their availability for civilian uses they do not belong to the civilian agency on permanent basis furthermore the extreme resolution of thei r imagery may be superfluous for the tasks at hand it nevertheless remains uncertain exactly how much value added satellites would offer for homeland security and law enforcement purposes clearly additional imagery sources could be useful in many situations and sophisticated techniques for acquiring information about the presen ce of wmd materials would be highly valuable albeit in extremely unlikely ci rcumstances what other uses would be important remain uncertain and cannot be determined on the basis of unclassified public materials the independent study group the 911 attacks led to general rec onsideration of the relationships between law enforcement and intelligence agencies and in 2002 to the establishment of the department of homeland security dhs which has both law enforcement and intelligence respons ibilities concern with threats to homeland security and international terrorism generally led to perceived need for increased imaging of the united states in may 2002 the senate intelligence committee recognized the valuable role that the national imagery and mapping agency nima later renamed as the national geospatia lintelligence agency nga can play in supporting homeland security operations generally and the newly created us northern command specifically the committee ex pressed concern however about the process for authorizing imaging the united states the committee is concerned that the checks and

unnecessarily hinder urgent collection needs that may arise the committee directed the dci in coordination with nima and the national reconnaissance office nro the organi zation that builds nd

relationship with law enforcement one of the intelligence capabilities that appeared to have greater potential contribution to law enforcement and homeland security was the data collected by satellites further review of the potential contribution of satellite surveillance to the civil sector was undertaken in 2005 by an inde pendent study group isg established by the office of the dni and the interior partments geological survey usgs keith hall former director of the nro was designated as chairman of the isg nine civilian experts and three from government agencies completed the membership of the isg with staff support from th booz allen hamilton consulting firm the group reviewed the use of satellite information for scientific and environmental research including monitoring and recovery from natural disasters and related hazards and considered the pot ential for additional missions the isg concluded that far better use could be made of satellitederived data as the nation searches for methods to improve information and intelligence sharing for homeland security the isg believes that geospatial information often but not exclusively maps and ma p products are compelling tool for sharing information while localities nd police services may differ in their sophistication with remote sensing data and technology virtually everyone has familiarity with maps and map products as decision aids this is an area where both the intelligence community and the civil agencies have extensive experience providing information even information derived from sensitive sources12 the isg discussed at some length the past inability or unwillingness of law enforcement agencies to make use of information available from intelligence satellites it argued that the law enforcement community has virtually significant engagement with the ic intelligence community for the use of satellite collection resources they are viewed by the ic as major risk to sources and methods during the discovery process inherent in prosecutions and trials they are also constrained by extremely limited budgets and they generally focus on criminal ac tivity post event rather than preventing an

g up to prosecution or the prosecution is jeopardized by potential ic decisions to not allow their information to be so used this conflict of interests and objectives is classic prescription for dysfunction and has led the ic and law enforcement communities to generally treat each other with extreme caution13 the isg noted the opportunities for th domestic applications of satellite reconnaissance but argued that not nough was being done to take advantage of them the current system operates in riskaverse vice riskmanagement environment where protection of sources and methods and individual civil liberties while important concerns to be carefully considered and taken into account are the predominant concerns unreasonably operating to limit appropriate support to the defense of homeland14 the isg suggested that the disinclination to use information from intelligence satellites for law enforcement and homeland security purposes was another instance of the intelligencelaw enforcement wall that was extensively discussed in the aftermath of 91115 the protection of intelligence sources and met hods from the discovery process in judicial proceedin g was an ongoing concern of intelligence agencies while the desire to ensure that intelligence agencies are not used to gather information on us persons had led to th establishment of the cac in the 1970s16 the result of these deeply felt concerns in practice had meant that officials in all agencies believed they had sound reasons to avoid or at least minimize information sharing between intelligence and law enforcement agencies the drafters of the isg sought to blish venue through which information from intelligence satellites could be shared with dhs and law enforcement agencies they argued the root of the problem is lack of clearly articulated comprehensive policy on the use of ic intelligence community capabilities for domestic needs17 based on judgment that the cac had not effectively provided information to law enforcement agencies the commission suggested that dhs member of the intelligence community serve as the intermediary between the intelligence community and state local and tribal

the future of us satellite programs is uncertain at present intelligence and military satellite programs require multibillion dollar investments and some observers have argued that many of thei r functions could be performed by uavs or by greater reliance on commercial satellites the isg notes that enhancement of the current structure for using intelligence sate llites to support homela nd security and law enforcement would require major au gmentation of resources people budget authority and new charter to capture the new environment in which it would operate31 further the isg explicitly recommended that the domestic users be given seat at the table to influe nce policy rd and acquisition decisions32 some skeptics suggest that adding requirements for supporting homeland defense and law enforcement may be influenced by determination to provide broader justification for satellite prog rams that are currently under close scrutiny in both the executive branch and in

capabilities and operations and the absence of public information about ways that satellitederived information could be used by law enforcement agencies most frequently the proposed expansion of the use of satellite intelligence for domestic law enforcement purposes has been called into question on the basis of possible civ il liberties implications including concerns about privacy rights other commentators have also questi oned whether the proposed surveillance will violate the posse comitatus act postcivil war legislation that restricted the use of military forces for domestic law enforcement key consideration in this regard is the nature of the intelligence agencies that would be involved the cia is civilian institution to which some military personnel on active duty are

notwithstanding the fact that law enforcement officers had to commit trespass to come within viewing range48 unless perhaps particularly sophisticated sens ory enhancement technology is utilized49 the supreme court has not addressed whether satellite imagery constitutes search within the meaning of the fourth amendment however the court has applied the expectation of privacy test to aerial surveillance to conclude that search was conducted50 in california v ciraolo 51 the supreme court determined 54 that the aerial observation from an altit ude of 1000 feet of fencedin backyard within the curtilage of home conducte d without warrant did not constitute search the defendant was growing marijuana in small garden plot in his backyard protected by two fences from observation by casual passers by that the marijuana could be seen from public navigable airsp ace without the use of sensory enhancement equipment defeated the defendants claim to reasonable expectation of privacy even in the curtilage of his private home52 on the same day that ciraolo was handed down the supreme court issued its 54 opinion in dow chemical co v united states 53 which addressed aerial photography of an industrial compound from much greater heights but still within navigable airspace by government regulators using specialized mapping camera the surveillance here was likewise not search although the

that imagery taken from satellite might not be permissible it may well be as the government concedes that surveillance of private property by using highly sophisticated surveillance equipment not generally available to the public such as satellite technology might be constitutionally proscribed absent warrant56 the court did not explain whether the use of equipment with capabilities identical to those of the mapping equipment at issue would be less reasonable if such equipment were mounted on satellite rather than an ai rcraft the infrequency of private space travel might be factor tipping in favor of fourth amendment protection given the courts emphasi s on the reasonableness of government officials being at vantage point where any member of the public might plausibly be however any emphasis in the aerial surveillance cases as to the observing officers location in public navigable airs pace should probably be read as possible objection to the use of aircraft flying below navigable airspace which would be more physically intrusive than ordinary aerial overflights and might well encroach on property interests by cont rast satellites using passive surveillan ce technologies are arguably less physically intrusive possibl making an expectation of privacy from them less reasonable the supreme court addressed whether an observation made from lowflying helicopter

defendant had made effort to conceal the heat escaping the walls of his home and therefor had reasonable expectation that passersby would not take notice the supreme court disagreed 54 holding that the use of senseenhancing technology not in general public use in orde r to reveal details about the interior of private home that could not otherwise be ascertained without entering the home constitutes search the majority placed great emphasis on the fact that the technique was aimed at private dwelling yet it is not clear from the decision whether or why the use of such technolog against barn or private office should yield different result the threshold for determining when surveillance equipment can be said to have achieved usage co mmon enough to upend the legitimacy of residents expectation of privacy was left unresolved the dissent criticized the usage criterion as somewhat perverse as guarantor of fourth amendment protection because it seems likely that the threat to privacy will grow rather than recede as the use of intrusive equipm ent becomes more readily available60 the secrecy shrouding sate llite surve illance capabilities may amplify the difference between the average individuals subjective expectation of privacy and the real extent of their risk of observation by the government the use of surveillance techniques that are so narrowly focused that they can only reveal unlawful activity or contraband may not constitute search61 at least when it takes place outside of home and is not aimed at person in united states v place 62 the supreme

surveillance would not constitute search or similar activity under 10 usc 375 and thus would not violate the posse comitatus act on the other hand whether the activity is authorized at all may depend
