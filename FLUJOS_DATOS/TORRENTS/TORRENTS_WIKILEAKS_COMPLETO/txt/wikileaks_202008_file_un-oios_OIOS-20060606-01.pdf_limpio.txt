unies office of internal oversight services unhcr audit service audit of status of project staff in unhcr ar20051 6201 executive summary between october and december 2005 oios reviewed th current status of project staff to determine if this staffing arrangement had been phased out in accordance with iom812001fom792001 unhcr project staff dated 21 september 2001 oio s acknowledges the current work of the director of structural and management change in th course of which staffing and personnel arrangements will be reviewed in light of this oio s has limited the recommendations to the areas where action is required in oios opinion independ ent of the results of the overall change or directi on to be taken by unhcr oios commends the work done by unhcr to phaseout p roject staff for instance regular posts were created for some project staff and for many ot hers the contractual status was converted to that of unv additionally companies instead of indivi duals were contracted to provide security and cleaning services oios appreciates considering the nature of unhcr perations that there is need for ways to flexibly and economically recruit and separate pers onnel oios is also aware of the budgetary constraints and obstacles met by field offices to h ave the staffing levels required to manage an effective operation oios recommended in 2001 that the division of human resources management advise bureaux and field offices of the most appropriate contractual mechanism for project staff during the transitional period to void the risks associated with the use of irregular type agreements this recommendation was not implem ented which could be one of the reasons for the continuation by field offices of hiring add itional personnel on irregular contracts oios current review found that over 50 personnel re still employed by unhcr under staffing arrangements that could be defined as irregular und er the 2001 iomfom this figure does not include the 23 persons working under undp special service agreements or the 27 persons hired by minurso under individual contractor contracts as referred to under service contracts below dos disagreed with oios statistics and indicated th at only 4 project staff in syria remained dos referred to some of the other arrangements iden tified by oios as pseudo project staff and defacto consultants the above figure does not include contracts issued through unops or those under icmc surge irc and similar arrangements for which separate policy instruction has been or will be issued interpreters hired through various arrangements an other area where guidelines are currently being drafted are not included in this figure either it is clear that there is still central deposito ry for unhcrs ad hoc staffing arrangements this means that staffing numbers are still not properl represented service contracts oios identified 69 persons employed under service c ontracts 46 under unhcr service contracts and 23 under undp special service agreements in ad dition 27 individual contractors contracts were found in western sahara minurso after the dr aft of this report was issued unhcr does not currently have an established or guided specia l service contractagreement and the standard contract for individual contractors is still in dra ft form despite this some field offices are hirin g personnel under these contracts in some cases cont racted through undp using its service contract in others the contract had been drafted b unhcr locally sometimes using the undp service contract as basic framework dos stated that it regarded undp service contracts as regular contracts but agreed that the undp contrac ts reviewed by oios in for instance yemen are in fact irregular contracts oios review of the service contracts entered into by unhcr indicated that they varied considerably in nature and content the terms and c onditions of employment varied substantially sometimes even between staff performing the same fu nction at the same level in the same operation such an approach to employing personnel is an open invitation to discontent and dissatisfaction among staff and possibly even lega l repercussions other contractual arrangements oios is pleased to note the extensive work done by unhcr with regard to the use of volunteers further efforts are required to central ly coordinate and manage unv activities upto date information was not always available and the unvp bonn staffing table issued in december 2005 differed substantially from the number of unvs reported by the respective bureaux in the same period reliable information for monitoring an d disclosure purposes is necessary oios found that unops contracts have mainly been tablished in the africa region dos subsequently informed oios that there are 45 person s employed under unops contracts in malaysia oios appreciates this arrangement could b an alternative additional staff resource but would highlight that there is overall central or clear policy on the hiring of personnel through unops if such arrangements are to continue oios re commends that practical guidelines for implementation and monitoring of unops contracts be developed dos was of the opinion that the 1998 bilateral framework agreement was sufficie nt but agreed that it should be updated interpreters are working for various field operatio ns and although some operations have regularized interpreters posts the vast majority of interpreters are employed by unhcr under unhcr service declarations often their contractu status is vague and ambiguous oios is pleased to note that working group has been estab lished that has developed practical guidance for the field this work however still needs to be fina lized and disseminated june 2006

acknowledgement annex i annex ii 45 i introduction 1 between october and december 2005 as fol lowup of the audit conducted in 2001 ar20016015 oios reviewed the current status of project staff in unhcr the audit was conducted in accordance with the international stan dards for the professional practice of internal auditing 2 project staff were traditionally defined as individuals employed by an implementing partner or by unhcr but without standard unhcr letter of ppointment to carry out staff functions or functions normally carried out by an i mplementing partner who form part of the unhcr staffing table and work under the direct cont rol and supervision of unhcr staff to third party they would be perceived as unhcr staff 3 the 2001 audit found that unhcr field offic were hiring staff either directly or through implementing partners and in some instances by the creation of companies under various contracts to conduct core and other functions the project staff carried out the same or similar responsibilities as unhcr staff and were engaged i n various positions such as protection assistant logistics assistantclerk administrativ assistantclerk driver andor guard oios found that there was consistent approach or foca l point at unhcr headquarters to provide guidance or to oversee the sourcing and monitoring of this type of staff as consequence there was myriad of contractual arrangements entered in to by field offices oios issued eleven recommendations which included the recommendation that policy decision be made to phase out project staff but that at the same time guid elines andor instructions be issued for field offices to enable them to enter into flexible contr actual arrangements to hire personnel for short term functions andor responsibilities essential fo r operations but not normally approved under staffing table 4 the findings and recommendations contained in this report have been discussed with the officials responsible for the audited activities du ring the exit conference held on 10 february 2006 draft of the report was shared with the dir ector division of operational support in march 2006 the formal comments which were receive d in may 2006 are reflected where appropriate in the report ii audit objectives 5 the main objective of the review was to det ermine the effectiveness of unhcrs policy to phaseout project staff the review also aimed t assess the adequacy of the central procedures established for monitoring the additional workforce arrangements as well as the current contractual arrangements for the hiring of such per sonnel iii audit scope and methodology 6 the audit focused on the present status of the implementation of the policy for the phasing out of project staff as well as the administration and procedures adopted to achieve this oios followed up on the findings and recommendations mad in 2001 to ensure they had been adequately implemented and were still valid in the current working environment moreover although not within the initial scope of the audit we took the opportunity to briefly review unhcrs other staffing arrangements additional wo rkforce including united nations volunteers unvs and unops which seemed in the mo st part to have replaced project staff 2 7 the scope of the audit excluded personnel c ontracted by unhcr under icmc surge and irc arrangements as we understand that detailed review of this has been conducted by unhcr and an iomfom is currently being drafted oi interviewed various representatives of the bureaux the division of operational support programme coordination and operations support pcos the division of human resources ma nagement dhrm the financial resources service frs and the legal affairs sect ion oios reviewed documentation made available at those offices regarding project s taff and the other contractual arrangements entered into at the field level 8 there was detailed or comprehensive info rmation available centrally we had to rely therefore on the information requested through the bureauxdesks from the field iv audit findings and recommendations unhcr project staff and additional workforce 9 the information received by oios from the f ield through the bureaux and pcos indicated that there was an overall consensus that project staff as defined in the 2001 audit and following iom812001fom 792001 unhcr project sta ff dated 21 september 2001 had been phased out as at the end of october 2005 this was confirmed by unhcr in its general assembly report aac961011 unhcr annual progr amme budget 2006 dated 30 august 2005 which reads that unhcr had taken step s to regularize this category and that only limited number of staff had continued t work under this arrangement during 2005 10 oios noted however that the definition of project staff in the ga report is narrower than the 2001 iomfom definition and includes only per sons nominally employed by another organization and paid by funds placed at the dispos of organizations by unhcr by using this narrow definition oios would agree that project s taff have for the most part been phasedout our concurrence is based on the results of the stat istics presented to oios as part of this review as well as the fact that oios has identified fewer cases of such project staff in its regular audits f unhcr field operations in the period between 2003 nd 2005 the audited countries which oios found still using project staff extensively du ring this period were ethiopia and liberia oios was informed however that the 200 plus project staff found in those countries had either been phasedout or regularised as at october 2005 in the americas costa rica there were still five project staff maintaining the spanish website for unhcr ref oiosar200415102 for europe oios identified one project staff in moldov 11 the broader definition of project staff as outlined in the 2001 iomfom includes staff hired through an implementing partner to under take tasks which should normally be done by unhcr regular staff but also b staff hired directly by unhcr using an irregular rvice contract to carry out either staff functions or functions n ormally carried out by an implementing partner it is oios opinion that project staff in this wider definition has not yet been fully phasedout 12 from the information received in december 2005 at least 69 personnel were contracted under special service contractsagreements scss the majority of such service contracts 46 were issued and administered directly by the u nhcr field offices concerned whereas the 3 others 23 were undp special service agreements in addition recent audit of unhcrs operation in western sahara noted that 27 personnel were hired under minurso individual contractor contracts 13 the majority of personnel working under th contractual agreements are in oios opinion project staff as set out above as they re fulfilling unhcr core functions eg protection finance logistics they are working i n unhcr office they are supervised by unhcr staff and they are perceived to be unhcr sta ff members by third parties the costs associated with these staff were charged to progr amme in some cases and to the abod in others in addition some of the socalled undp tracts were in fact irregular contracts created on an ad hoc basis by unhcr dos was of the opinion that undp special service agreements cannot be regarded as irregular and would thus not qualify as project staffarrangements as defined in the 2001 iomfom dos agreed however tha t irregular undp contracts were issued in syria and yemen although they preferred to refer to the latter as pseudoproject staff as the standard undp ssa was used as model and s igned by unhcr oios would emphasize that many of the undp contracts referred to were assessed by oios as non regular undp contracts on the basis of the fact that some of these contracts were in fact ad hoc contracts created by unhcr field offices sometimes based on the undp ssa model and others were irregular in the sense that they were used for unhcr core functions such as protection which is not the purpose of the use of such contracts 14 in order to analyse the trend in how unhcr project staff were phasedout it was relevant to look at the movement in staff and the various ca tegories of staff defined as unhcrs additional workforce overall and as at december 2005 from the information received 943 persons were hired by unhcr under nonregular staff contracts they could be divided in the following categories unhcr additional workforce 2005 307 46 43 185 141 943 499 192 669 23 0100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 project staff nunv iunv total unvs ssaundp scunhcr total service contracts unops consultants others grand total chart 1 unhcrs additional workforce 2005 based n the statistics and information made available to oios by the respective bureaux and excluding the 45 additional unops identified by dos after the issuing of the d raft report 4 b project staff working group 20012002 recomm endations and current status 1 15 in 2001 working group was established by pcos to review project staff and to make recommendations on how to phase them out the worki ng group in its final report dated march 2002 established that as at the end of 2001 some 1 099 project staff were working for unhcr2 divided over the different regions of these 1099 project staff recommendations were m ade to regularize 264 24 per cent to discontinuetermin ate 516 47 per cent to convert 18 16 per cent to an individual contractor contract to hire services through companies security and cleaning3 which would equate to 264 24 per cent persons nd to convert 37 34 per cent to unopsundpunv contracts 16 oios reviewed the recommendations of the w orking group per region in conjunction with the present situation of unhcrs additional w orkforce4 considering the passage of time and the changing nature and complexity of unhcr ope rations and staffing requirements it was very difficult to compare the staffing table of 200 1 as recommended by the working group with that of 2005 it is however clear that significant changes have been made to the project staffing arrangements since 2001 17 oios commends the work done by unhcr init ially the active followup conducted by the pcos working group established in 20012002 an d at later stage by unhcrs field offices and bureaux and more recently by the audit focal point in pcos in saying this however further work is still required to ensure that all u nhcrs contractual arrangements are transparent and monitored on regular basis c service contracts 5 18 oios found that although unhcr has not dev eloped or issued any guidelines on hiring personnel under service contracts similar to those used in undp some field offices have proceeded in hiring staff under this type of ctual arrangement as at the end of december 2005 it has been determined that there were at lea st 69 persons employed by unhcr under various versions of special service contracts anne x ii chart 76 the service contracts reviewed by oios were irregular contracts both in nature and content some of those contracts were unhcr service contracts created on an ad hoc ba sis others were undp service agreements created by unhcr field offices using the undp ssa model while again others were irregular in the sense that they were used for hcr core functions such as protection which 1 see also annex i as attached 2 this figure does not include the afghanistan opera tion 3 please note that the service contracts as sugges ted by the 2002 working group are contracts with co mpanies mainly providing security and cleaning services nd not with individuals they thus differ from the individual service contracts as discussed in detail under sect ion c of this report and hereafter referred to as service contracts or special service agreements 4 the staffing situation per region in 2001 includi ng the pcos recommendations as well as the staffi ng situation per region in 2005 are included and discussed in tail in annex i 5 the findings in this section have been reflected i n annex ii chart 7 6 this figure does not include the 27 personnel hire d in western sahara under minurso individual ctor contracts as mentioned earlier and as established fter the issuing of the draft report the asia th pacific region is included in the table as service contracts have bee n identified in that region for instance in thaila nd but as the exact number of those contracts is unknown see under sia the pacific annex i it has not been refl ected nor included in the total amount of service contracts s et out in the chart 5 is not the purpose of the use of such contracts 19 oios questioned the validity of the servic contracts found as there is legal basis or policy instrument in unhcr providing guidance ando r standardization for hiring personnel under such arrangements dos regards the undp service contracts as regular nd sufficiently legally based moreover the contracts varied in nature quality nd content allowing for terms and conditions that are far from transparent or sistent also unlike regular additional personnel arrangements such as unvs and consultant s there is focal point for special service contracts in dhrm the bureaux or dos the use of s pecial service contracts is not monitored thus the staffing flows cannot be easily tracked or established this prevents unhcr from having comprehensive statistics and uptodate info rmation on its global additional workforce 20 to illustrate the anomalies arising over t he issuance of service contracts oios noticed that unhcr syria had entered into number of diffe rent contractual arrangements for the same position unhcr syria had seven eligibility assista nts three of whom had unhcr service contract one had special service agreement lso issued and administered by unhcr and another three had been hired under national unv c ontract such an approach to hiring personnel especially when the personnel concerned are all conducting the same function causes not only lack of consistency and transparency bu t also risk of legal repercussions dos concurred with oios and stated that this had been serious concern for both dos and the bureau oios is pleased to note that dos shares its concern 21 furthermore oios compared the contractual terms and conditions of the issued special service agreement ssa to that of the issued ser vice contracts sc in syria and found that they vary in nature and content considerably under the ssa the staff member receives lump sum payment per month an amount that is considera bly lower than those hired under sc ssas are not entitled to annual leave sick leave r holidays unlike scs none of these service staff is entitled to any other remuneration ben efits compensation except for service incurred injury or subsidies although the staff with scs c an take part in social security scheme the costs of which are added to the monthly payment th sc has termination clause comprising 30 days prior notice and reasonable compensation eq uivalent to one week of gross salary for each unexpired month of the contract remaining after t he date of termination unless of course caused by the staff the ssa has termination clause com prising oneweek prior notice in writing without compensation 22 other examples of personnel hired under sp ecial service contracts were identified in mazarisharif afghanistan in the pik encashment centre which has however been discontinued at the end of 2005 in yemen there were 10 personnel contracted under sp ecial service contract issued and administered by unhcr mainly for protection related activities in the case of yemen they were hired under unhcr ind ividual contractor contracts dos stated that the staff in yemen should be regarded as pseu doproject staff as the standard undp service agreement was irregularly used as framewo rk for issuing unhcr service contract 23 some unhcr offices were issuing undp speci service agreements the undp service agreements were found to be much more sound contracts they are more comprehensive in nature as they include for instance the basic titlements and benefits such as monthly salary medical insurance leave and holidays it could be argued from contractual point of view that these personnel are not project staff as they are not using an irregular service contract issued by unhcr as defined in iomfom 81792001 nonethele ss these contracts are still in most 6 cases issued to personnel performing unhcr core fun ctions that should not be subcontracted to undp and in that sense they may be regarded as irregular for example in lebanon and jordan there were 8 and 11 undp service contracts issued respectively in the case of lebanon they were issued to staff performing protection and resettlement functions oios understands that the bureau of caswaname has suggested to its field offices to submit proposal to regularize all undp service contracts issued to protection sta ff oios sees this as positive step forward 24 in oios opinion it is questionable wheth er undp special service agreements are an appropriate contractual arrangement for unhcr to us there are guidelines or directives from unhcr headquarters as to the validity of using such arrangements however if unhcr determines need to contract staff under undp serv ice agreements it should issue such agreements directly with the support of headquarter s and within the framework of appropriate standards and guidelines dos disagreed that the absence of such guidance sho uld prevent unhcr from using undp service agreements unhcr do not restrict the use of undp ssa recommendation head2right the unhcr should continue its efforts to fully phas out project staff by discontinuing the employment of personnel unde r irregular service contracts as there is currently legal b asis or policy instrument in unhcr providing guidance andor stand ardization for hiring personnel under such arrangements and by fu rther monitoring its field operations with view to prevent future recurrence of similar practices rec01 25 dos agreed with this recommendation but is of the opinion that there is legal basis for service contracts that could and should be used by unhcr to engage in such service contracts oios takes note of doss statement but would add t hat in as much as oios was able to establish the existence of regular for instance dp service contracts these contracts had not been issued by unhcr in regular way or fashion i ndicating need for guidance and standardization individual contractor contracts 26 another problem created by the special ser vice contracts found is that some of those contracts use the term individual contractor to d efine the status of the employee see for instance paragraph 22 and the case of yemen this is inconsistent with the meaning of contractors as set out in several unhcr instructi ons in oios opinion the term individual contractor should only be used in relation to comm ercial contracts with private or commercial companies firms or parastatal enterprises whose services are required to obtain technical expertise and professional assistance that are not available inhouse or from traditional governmental implementing partners such indepen dent contractor contracts have been issued and approved by unhcr headquarters on limited bas is and under specific conditions to accommodate field offices in need of large numbers of security guards cleaners and sometimes drivers the individual contractor service contracts as currently used in the field have been issued at the discretion of the field offices conce rned in an unlimited fashion and sometimes without consulting unhcr headquarters to individua ls who fulfil variety of positions 7 including protection and programme related function s 27 oios has understood that the division of h uman resources management is currently in the process of drafting an iomfom relating to the individual contractors contracts this iomfom is based on stai19997 and is meant to t out standards and policies as well as provide guidance for the use of such contracts oio s has obtained copy of the draft of this document and highly appreciates the work done to c reate some clarity and consistency in this matter it is noteworthy to add however that sectio n 82 of stai19997 distinguishes between special service contracts and contracts for indi vidual contractors clearly indicating the difference between the two as also highlighted by ios in the previous paragraph and emphasizing that the use of special service contrac ts will have to be discontinued with the entering into force of contracts for individual tractors the selfcreated combination of the two by unhcr field offices thus needs clarification and reconsideration recommendation head2right the unhcr division of human resources management should finalise and issue the guidelines for the hi ring of individual contractors at the same time the purpos of this type of contract including its limitation in terms of d uration should be reemphasised it should not be used for hiring personnel to augment field office staffing resources rec02 d united nations volunteers 7 28 unvs were generally referred to by the sta ff of the bureaux interviewed by oios for the purpose of this audit as the next best thing to pr oject staff both in terms of cost and in terms of the timeliness with which they can be recruited in their view this was particularly the case for national unvs who can be hired immediately in emerg encies at substantially lower cost than international unvs thereby allowing for the econom ical flexibility that unhcr needs unhcr can be content that unvs have established and fair contracts that clearly identify their status as nonunhcr staff members this valuable resource is reemphasized in the unhcr policy on the use of volunteers where it states that unhc r seeks to maximise the future deployment and service opportunities of unvs 29 oios did not conduct detailed review of unvs nonetheless as part of the audit it was disclosed that further efforts are required to cent rally coordinate and manage the activities of unvs as uptodate information was still not alway s available at headquarters for example for the purpose of discussion and comparison the most recent unvp bonn staffing table that was provided to oios dated 1 december 2005 showed com pletely different data from those obtained through the bureaux regarding the unvs at their respective field offices from discussion with dospcos it appears that the staff ing table of unvp bonn is not always updated and often contains unvs working for other i nternational organisations oios would emphasize that this issue be addressed with unvp bo nn to ensure that unhcr has uptodate and reliable information dos acknowledges unhcrs responsibility for monitor ing and review 7 the findings in this section have been reflected i n annex ii chart 8 8 of the data submitted by unvp bonn and indicated t hat unhcr is in the process of allowing the central focal point to concentrate on unv matte rs on full time basis as well as establishing supportbackup position in the cou rse of 20067 30 based on the information received from the field offices through the respective bureaux oios found that unhcr had employed 499 unvs as at t he end of december 2005 307 62 per cent of them were international unvs and 192 38 p er cent national unvs as set out in annex ii chart 8 31 it should be mentioned that instances have been noted where unvs are still performing core functions in the field reaching as far as eve n fulfilling head of office functions in the smalle r and remote unhcr offices this is contrary to the u nhcr policy on the use of volunteers recommendation head2right the unhcr division of operational support should sure that accurate complete and reliable data regarding unvs is available at unhcr headquarters centrally by addre ssing this issue with unvp bonn and stressing the importance f such accuracy for purposes of monitoring and review rec 3 32 dos stated that it is the role of the current unhcr focal point on unv matters to regularly liaise to obtain such data for internal u to verify them with user operations and to complement the work of unv bonn in maintaining 100 per cent accurate and updated data through undp country offices globally it added th at unhcr should not duplicate the work of unv bonn nor should it take over daytoday adm inistrative functions of another agency for which it pays 10 per cent overhead charges oios would reiterate that the data available were neither accurate nor up to date and would re emphasize that unhcr has the responsibility to verify and monitor the reliability of the data p rovided by unvp bonn unops 33 based on the information received from the respective bureaux oios established that unops contracts have mainly been issued in the afri ca region 8 in eritrea and 33 in kenya and to lesser extent in europe 2 unops contracts wer issued in azerbaijan though the asia bureau did not officially report the use of unops i n their region oios is aware that unops contracts have also been issued in malaysia oios w as further informed by dhrm that unops contracts have not been issued at unhcr headquarter s between 1 january 2005 and present dos noted in its response to the draft report that there are 45 unops in malaysia 8 46 in kenya and 7 in eritrea furthermore unops contracts h ave been issued in europe as per their information oios welcomes this information especially that re lated to malaysia but would like to highlight that oios figures reflect the informa tion provided verified and confirmed by the respective bureaux the fact that dos has different information confirms oios concern that up to date and reliable information regarding unhcrs additional workforce is not always readily and centrally available at unhcr headquarters 8 these 45 unops have been reflected under asia t he pacific in annex i chart 4 in this final rep ort 9 34 oios noted that there are overall cent ral or clear guidelines for the hiring of personnel through unops the hiring of personnel under this rrangement is left to the discretion of the field operations concerned and their particular nee ds in addition there is formal focal point in unhcr for unops personnel and there is monitorin g tool in place to keep track of these contracts dos was of the opinion that the 1998 formal bilater framework agreement between unhcr and unops guides the hiring unops personnel oios appreciates that this is an important agreement but would emphasize that there is significant difference between the existence of bilateral framework agreement betwee n unops and unhcr and the practical guidelines that are needed to direct and assist fie ld offices in hiring of unops personnel in consistent manner recommendation head2right the unhcr division of operational support should up date the existing unops framework agreement issue guide lines for the use of unops in the field and keep track of an d monitor unops staffing flows rec4 f other contractual arrangements 9 35 15 per cent 141 of the total additional work force consisted of other contractual arrangements divided over the various regions as set out in annex ii chart 9 this figure includes contracts with icmc surge and irc surge irc and icmc 36 it was suggested by internal memorandum dated 24 june 2005 following 2004 management recommendation from the external auditor s to exclude staff employed through surge irc and icmc from the definition of project staff as provided in the 2001 iomfom this deployment scheme was conceived as way to address unhcrs decreasing capacity to respond to the sudden but temporarily and rapidly xpanding staff in the field prior to deployment assessments are made together with bure aux and country offices confirming the temporary nature of the deployments and the need to look at alternative staffing arrangements after the deployments in response to this proposa l unhcr is currently preparing an iomfom that clearly distinguishes staff working under this scheme from the project staff 37 in light of this and the fact that the tot number of staff working under these schemes as well as their contractual duration remains limited oios acknowledges the special status thus provided oios would however like to emphasize the importance of monitoring and analysing statistics on staff needs and possible alternatives b cisamap and ip triangle 38 other contractual arrangements identified by oios were personnel working for cisamap the community integrated social and medica l assistance programme iran and ip triangle algeria cisamap is administered by co ntractor service provider company called 9 the findings in this section have been reflected i n annex ii chart 9 10 hefaz gostar ofogh that was contracted through process of competitive bidding to provide services for limited period cisamap personnel ar paid by on hold contracts with this contractor their contracts include remuneration an d all charges and fees foreseen in the iranian labour act as well as onemonth indemnity upon sepa ration the contract is charged to sub project budget 39 the cisamap personnel work in various unhc r offices in iran and according to the latest email oios received from the bureau the sta ff are recognised as part of separate unit and are supervised by the physician in charge and the c ontractor nonetheless according to section 3 of the contract between the contractor and unhcr go verning this arrangement the selection of the cisamap staff is the exclusive responsibility f unhcr and unhcr staff shall be responsible for the supervision and monitoring of t he staff performance 40 oios appreciates the efforts unhcr has mad to clearly separate the tasks of cisamap personnel from that of the more regular unhcr staff in the iran operation however oios recommended during the related committee on contrac ts meeting in may 2006 that unhcr review the proposed extension of the contract and r econsider its responsibility for the recruitment and selection as well as the direct supervision of the cisamap staff oios understands that the contractual terms and conditions will be revised nd oios will followup on this as part of its forthcoming audit of iran 41 as at the end of 2005 two guards refugee s were still working for triangle the implementing partner established by unhcr in algeri oios has been informed that triangle will be in position to take charge over the manag ement of the unhcr base in the dakhla refugee camp the two guards concerned will thus be fully administered by triangle c interpreters 42 specific problem seems to have appeared with the hiring of interpreters these interpreters often refugees do not have contracts with unhcr instead they sign declaration with unhcr entailing that they have accepted to ass ist unhcr with translation and interpretation and that they will abide by the offi ce rules they are not paid salaries but they receive monthly allowances and transportation cos ts in egypt for instance an implementing partner of unhcr caritas pays these allowances 43 in oios view the current contractual sta of interpreters in most regions is vague and ambiguous oios appreciates that the function of in terpreters may not always be equal to full time post and will often be based on ad hoc arrangements it is however important to standardi ze interpreter contracts 44 oios was pleased to note that gap analys is was undertaken by unhcr regarding the recruitment b conditions of service c train ing and d monitoring and oversight
