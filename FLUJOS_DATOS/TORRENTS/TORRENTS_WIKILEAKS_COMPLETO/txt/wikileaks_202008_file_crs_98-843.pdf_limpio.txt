1834 altho ugh expunged in 1837 and two actions of the house tyler in 1842 and buchanan in 1860 may be categorized in broad definition of congressiona l censure of president similar to censure of the

statement of disapprova l formally expressed by congress there have been found precedents for th congress to legislate or formally adopt resolution expressly directing specifie d individual who is not member of congress to pay fine or restitution to th government it may at least be theoret ically possible for an agreement to be reached between the president and the congress for the president to voluntarily accept congressional statement suggestion and or direction concerning particular restitution or other act of contrition and not to challenge the authori ty or constitutionality of any such legislative statement or act in such case as practical matter it may b difficult for anyone other than the individual actually aggrieved or harmed that is the preside nt to possess the requisite legal

modern parlance to mean the forma l resolution of legislative administrative or other body reprimanding person normally one of its own members for specified conduct in congress censure s1 are most typically known as simple resolutions of the house or senate formall adopted by vote of that body and expressing some form of disapproval or othe r term of rebuke or condemnation concerning members

5 clause 2 for eac h house of congress to punish one of its own members house senate or congressional censure of the president unlike congressional punishment of one of its own members or an impeachment and tria l of the president in the legislature does not have an express constitutional basis 3 although there is express constitutional provision regarding censure of n executive officer there is also express constitutional impediment for th congress or eithe r house of congress to adopt resolution expressing its opinion reproval disapprobation or censure of an individual in the government or of th conduct of the individual and in fact each house of congress has on infrequen t occasions adopted such resolutions in the past resolutions expressing the houses or senates

that effect the legislati ve assemblies are not authorized to impose fine by way f punishment35 in additio n to the general absence of authority and practice of legislativ institution in the united

congress and thus since not expressly authorized would fall within those legislative punishments prohibited by the bill of attainder clause it may be argued that the intent of such censure40 would appear to be clearly punitive and not remedial however it does not appear that censure adopted in its traditional form as simple or even concurrent resolution with binding effect and stating only an opinion qualifies as bill f attainder since it is not in the constitutional and congressional context bill as it does not becomes law nor is it measure that has the force or effect of law41 censure whic h would take less traditional form than simple or concurrent resolution nd would be included for example in joint resolution presented to the president would however clearly be bill since it is

determine if the punishment inflicted is one which has been traditionally considered punishment as either bill of attainder or bill of pains and penalties as succinctly summarized in lower federal court the historicall recognized punishments include the death sentence imprisonment banishment confiscation of property and barring individuals and groups from participating i n specifie d employment or vocations since the supreme court recognized th e43 possib ility that new burdens and deprivations might be legislatively fashioned i n the future two further and dditional tests were provided for

new legislative burdens imposed the motivational tes t45 inquires into whether the legislative record evinces congressional intent t punish46 mere censure of the president or other executive official in law enacte d by joint resolution would not appea r to meet the historical test as specified by the supreme court as it is neither death sentence imprisonment banishment confiscation of property nor barring of individuals and groups from participating in specified employment or vocations although the function and motivation fo r censure might in fact be able to be convincingly argued to be punitive in nature it is clear from the supreme courts explanation that the act of the legislature mus t as threshold mat ter place some sort of burden or deprivation upon the subject of the

and discussion enacting censure in nontraditional and unprecedented format of bill such as joint resolution would provide at the very least an opportunity for constitutional argument of bill of attainder that would not exist if censure were adopted in nonbill vehicle that is simple or concurrent sense of resolution as to fines and bills of attainder and ex post facto laws it may be noted that in some instances the courts have found that certain civil fines and forfeitures wer remedial measures and not punitive so as not to violate the ex post fact provision or the excessive fines clause it may be possible under this analysis to48 argue that certain fines or required restitutions of funds to the government ma also not be punitive under the bill of attainder clause as long as they merel reimburse the government for investigative and prosecutorial cost any argument49 of this nature in the instance at hand however would also face the seemingl difficult task of overcoming the motivational test considering the expres s statements by individual members concerning the appropriate punishment in thi s particular case as well as the inference that mandatory fine or required restitution that accompanies or is c oupled with an express censure or other explicit statement of disapproval directed at one specified individual would appear in that context to be indicative of

have legal standing to challenge the legislation as there was persona l injury but only loss of political power 117 sct at 2318it would appear to be within the realm of possibility although without apparent precedent that the president might voluntarily agree not to challenge the authorit and constitutionality of particular legislative action or statement and migh t voluntarily agree to pay suggested monetary amount as fine or restitution along with censure or to accept some other form of contrition or expiation suggested by congress in sense of congress resolution if the payment of restitution or fine is merely incorporated into legislative vehicle such as simple or concurren t resolution which is merely statement of opinion by or sense of the congress and which therefore is not binding and does not have force or effect of law it may b argued as discussed above that such legislative measure would not be bill f attainder since it is not bill law nor is it mandatory or enforceable51 in any event if th president agrees to abide by the suggestion or opinion or even if such formulation were incorporated into mandatory fine or other legislative vehicle with the force and effect of law with the presidents agreement the question could still be ultimately raised as to who if anyone would have legal standing t challenge the act as beyond the powers and authority of the legislature if the person affected or aggrieved by t he act does not challenge it this is not to suggest that the president or any subject of legislative act has the ability to waive constitutional incapacity of the legislature to act but rather it is practical question to be raised if such legislative act does in fact take place standing to challenge congressional act in the courts requires showing that the plaintiff has an injury in fact as result f the challenged action member of congress does not necessarily have an y52 additional standing beyond member of the public

cases concerning the simila r54 constitut ional limitations on the diminution of salary of federal judges during thei r tenure in office which have demonstrated that even some indirect lessening f judicial compensation such as by the imposition of new tax after judges have taken office may work to diminish the overall compensation of those federal judges s contemp lated by that provision of the constitution there is precedent whic h55 makes it clear or provides definitive ruling as to whether mandatory fine r required rest itution directed at particular officer would be diminution of salary under the constitution it may be noted that the fine or restitution to the government could be paid out of funds other than the presidents salary or compensation suc h as from private contributions or loans however it would be new financia l obligation to the united states government placed by the congress upon the funds available to the president during his term and not an application of preexistin g provision of law or regulation or merely an increase in current existing financia l obligations and would be reduction which is applied directly and solely to th president by the congress separation of powers and policy implications critics of congressional censure of the president or of other executiv officials often argue that such congressional action violates the principles f separation of powers within the constitutional framework of separated powers many of the arguments forwarded however appear in their nature to be polic arguments of w hy it would or would not be good policy practice or precedent for the house senate or congress to cen sure or for the president to agree to censure as important and significant as such policy arguments are they do not necessaril address the legal or constitutional capacity or incapacity as interpreted by th supreme court of the house or senate to adopt such resoluti ons very briefly those types of congressional actions which the supreme court has found to violate th principles of separation of powers within the constitution have been those which aggrandize the powers of one branch at the expense of the powers of the other or that independently interfere with or impermissibly undermine the powers of anothe r branch by preventing that branch from carrying out its constitutional duties as56 stated by th supreme court in determining whether the act disrupts the properhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98843crs15 nixon v administrator of general services 433 us supra at 44357 see story commentaries on the constitution of the united states vol 2 at 1486 pp 58 311312 1873 it is obvious that without due attention to the proper support of th president the separation of the executive from the legislative department would be merel nominal and nugatory the legislature with discretionary power over his salary an d emolume nt would soon render him obsequious to their will the legislature upon th appointment of president is once for all to declare what shall be the compensation for his services during the time for which he shall have been elected this done they will have power to alter it either by increase or diminution they can neither weaken his fortitude by operating upon his necessities nor corrupt his integrity by appealing to his avarice balance between the coordinate b ranches the proper inquiry focuses on the extent to which it prevents the executive branch from accomplishing its constitutionall assigned functions the issue may thus need to be framed as to whether statements57 of censure of the house or the senate or the congress concurrently would be found to impermissibly undermine the authority of the president by interfering an d preventing the carrying out of the executives constitutional duties and functions legal and constitutional issues and questions of legal standing aside there are also potentially important policy implications which the congress may wish t consider on the one hand an agreement or deal where the president of the united states volu ntarily accepts censure vote of the congress either through simple or concurrent resolution or through joint resolution which the president signs t indicate his acceptance or censure plus some other act of contrition migh t arguably provide for an appropriate public consequence to the acts of presiden t which while found either highly offensive or even illegal might not be considere d by congress to constitute treason bribery or other high crimes r misdemeanors it might be argued that censure andor other punishment recommen ded and agreed to by the president would allow for formal publi c statement by the representatives of the american p eople indicating strong disapproval of such conduct without subjecting the country to as wrenching and disruptive process as impeachment and an attempt to remove mocratically elected president if crimes were committed by the president the president would be subject to criminal indictment and prosecution in the normal judicial process after leaving office however on the other hand it might be argued that action of this nature even merely censure of president is an extraconstitutional measure t contemplated by the express provisions nor the design of the constitution the sole method in the constitution for dealing with serious executive wrongdoing is th impeachment provision as to legislative punishments outside of impeachments it may be noted that the bill of attainder clause was an intentional limitation n congressional powers to punish specified individuals based on due process an d separation of powers concerns additionally the diminution of salary provision was adopted within the constitutions separation of powers framework and among it s checks and balances to ensure the independence of the executive from th congress it has thus be argued that even if not technically bill of attainder nor58 diminuti on of salary andor even if unchallenged by the subject of the fine r similar congressional punishment such action might establish precedent fo r future actions threats of large monetary fines or agreements into which ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98843crs16 president may be pressured by the specter of impeachment proceedings which could tend to interfere with or upset to some degree the balance contemplated in th constitution in the relationship between the executive and the congress
