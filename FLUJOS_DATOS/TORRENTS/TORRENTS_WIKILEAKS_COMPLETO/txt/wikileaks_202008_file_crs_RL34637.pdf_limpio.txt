increasing number of uninsured individuals the declining number of employers offering insurance to their employees and the absence of federal action states and localities have experimented with certain measures to address the problems of health care financing and access one approach has been to enact fair share laws also referred to as pay or play statutes which generally require employers to choose between paying certain amount for health expenditures or coverage for their employees or contributing to the state or locality to offset the cost of medical expenses for their uninsured residents recently questions have been raised as to whether the employee retirement income security acts erisas express preemption provision section 514 prevents the application of fair share laws there have been legal challenges to fair share laws enacted in maryland san francisco and suffolk county new york with courts reaching varying conclusions in addition the state of massachusetts which has received great deal of attention for enacting comprehensive health care reform maintains fair share requirement as part of its health care reform package this report provides an overview of erisa preemption discusses legal challenges that have been brought against fair share laws and discusses the fair share requirements of the massachusetts health care reform act g7g20g11g21g3g561g18g155g142g142g150g153g157g146g152g151g561 erisa provides comprehensive federal scheme for the regulation of employee pension plans and somewhat less detailed scheme for regulating welfare benefit plans offered by private employers an employee welfare benefit plan is defined in relevant part as any plan fund or program established or maintained by an employer for the purpose of providing for its participants or their beneficiaries medical surgical or hospital care or benefits or benefits in the event of sickness accident disability death or unemployment 1 although erisa does not require an employer to offer pension or welfare benefits it does mandate compliance with its provisions if such benefits are offered congress enacted erisa to eliminate the conflicting and inconsistent regulation of pension and employee welfare benefit plans by state laws ac cordingly section 514a of erisa expressly preempts any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan 2 the us supreme court has interpreted this language as applying to any state law that has connection with or reference to such plan3 the court has explained that to determine whether state law has connection with an erisa plan court must consider the objectives of erisa as guide to the scope of the statute that congress understood would survive as well as the nature of the effect of the state law on erisa plans4 state law has 1 29 usc 10021 see 29 usc 10027 defining the term participant as any employee or former employee of an employer or any member or former member of an employee organization who is or may become eligible to receive benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan which covers employees of such employer or members of such organization or whose beneficiaries may be eligible to receive any such benefit 29 usc 10028 defining the term beneficiary as person designated by participant or by the terms of an employee benefit plan who is or may become entitled to benefit thereunder 2 29 usc 1144a erisa does exempt from preemption certain laws including generally applicable criminal laws the hawaii prepaid health care act and state insurance laws regulating multiple employer welfare arrangements 3 see shaw v delta air lines inc 463 us 85 97 1982 4 see california div of lab standards enforcement v dillingham

erisa plans or if the existence of such plan is essential to the laws operations5 state law that relates to an erisa plan may avoid preemption if it regulates insurance within the meaning of erisas saving clause section 514b2a saves from preemption any law of any state which regulates insurance banking or securities6 however an additional clause serves as an exception to erisas saving clause section 514b2b erisas deemer clause indicates that state law that purports to regulate insurance cannot deem an employee benefit plan to be an insurance company for purposes of regulation 7 until 1995 the courts decisions on erisa preemption suggested generally that the application of section 514a was limitless however with its decision in new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans v travelers ins co the court began to show greater willingness to uphold various state laws8 in travelers several commercial insurers challenged state law that required them but not blue cross and blue shield to pay surcharges on hospital services the commercial insurers argued that the law was preempted by erisa because it related to employersponsored health insurance plans in addressing the application of erisas preemption clause the court first noted that there is presumption that congress does not intend to supplant state law9 the court then considered whether congress intended to preempt state law by looking to the structure and purpose of erisa 10 the court concluded that nothing in the language of the act or the context of its passage indicates that congress chose to displace general health care regulation which historically has been matter of local concern11 although the court continued to uphold several other state laws following travelers 12 it nevertheless concluded in 2001 that washington state law was preempted by erisa despite the fact that it gave plans an option for avoiding its requirements the washington law at issue in egelhoff v egelhoff provided that the designation of s pouse as the beneficiary of nonprobate asset would be revoked automatically upon divorce 13 under the law plan administrators were required to alter the terms of plan to indicate that the plan would not follow the law it was argued that the law not only avoided the regulation of plan administration but also did not apply so long as the plan documents expressly provided otherwise 5 id at 325 6 29 usc 1144b2a 7 29 usc 1144b2b see metropolitan life ins co v massachuse tts 471 us 724 733 1984 discussing erisas saving clause and deemer clause 8 514 us 645 1995 9

the normal sense of the phrase if it has connection with or reference to such plan the latter altern ative at least can be ruled out the surcharge statutes cannot be said to make reference to erisa

connection with erisa plans because it interfered with nationally uniform plan administration the court explained that one of the principal goals of erisa is to enable employers to establish uniform administrative scheme that provides standard procedures for the processing of claims and disbursement of benefits the court maintained that uniformity is impossible if plans are subject to different legal obligations in different states moreover the court declined to find the law saved from preemption because of its opt out option it is not enough for plan administrators to opt out of this particular statute instead they must maintain familiarity with the laws of all 50 states so that they can update their plans as necessary to satisfy the optout requirements of other similar statutes this tailoring of plans and employer conduct to the peculiarities of the law of each jurisdiction is exactly the burden erisa seeks to eliminate 14 the fair share laws discussed in this report present similar questions about preemption and the impact of plan or plan sponsors ability to choose from various compliance options

varying results g15g138g155g162g149g138g151g141g561 in january 2006 maryland became the first state to adopt legislation that would have required forprofit employers with 10000 or more employees in the state to either spend at least 8 of their total payroll costs on employee health insurance costs or pay to the state the amount their spending fell short of that percentage15 shortly after the fair share health care fund act fair share act was enacted the retail industry leaders association rila retail trade association that includes walmart as member challenged the measure on the grounds that it was preempted by erisa 16 in january 2007 the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit affirmed the decision of federal district court that found the fair share act to be preempted by erisa17 prior to enactment of the fair share act the maryland general assembly heard extensive testimony about the rising costs of the maryland medical assistance program which provides access to health care services for the states lowincome residents 18 the general assembly also received information concerning walmarts failure to provide adequate health benefits to its 14 id at 151 quoting

and the state childrens health insurance program19 walmart would have been the only forprofit employer in maryland to be subject to the fair share act20 other forprofit employers with at least 10000 employees in maryland either satisfied the fair share acts 8 threshold or were exempted from the measure21 james d fielder jr marylands secretary of labor licensing and regulation and the defendant in the case made two arguments in favor of upholding the fair share act first the secretary contended that the fair share act was revenue statute of general application and not one that involved an employers provision of health care benefits he asserted that the revenue from the payroll tax imposed under the fair share act would fund the fair share health care fund established under the measure which would be used to offset the costs of the maryland medical assistance program 22 second the secretary argued that the fair share act did not have connection with employee benefit plans because an employer could act in ways that did not involve such plans23 for example an employer could increase health care spending by establishing onsite medical clinics or by contributing more money to employees he alth savings accounts an employer could also refuse to increase benefits under an erisa plan and simply pay the amount by which its spending fell short of the measures 8 threshold24 the fourth circuit rejected both of the secretarys arguments acknowledging the legislative history of the fair share act and what the maryland general assembly knew at the time of its consideration the court indicated that the measure could hardly be intended to function as revenue act of general application25 the court stated legislators and interested parties uniformly understood the act as requiring walmart to increase its healthcare spending if this is not the acts effect one would have to conclude which we do not that the maryland legislature misunderstood the nature of the bill that it carefully drafted and debated for these reasons the amount that the act prescribes for payment to the state is actually fee or penalty that gives the employer an irresistible incentive to provide its employees with greater level of health benefits 26 in response to the secretarys second argument the fourth circuit distinguished the fair share act from state laws that were found to not be preempted by erisa citing travelers the court noted that the supreme court upheld the state law in that case because it did not act directly upon employers or their plans but merely created an indirect economic influence on plans27 in 19 id at 184 20 id at 185 21 id 22 id at 190 23 id at 19495 24 id at 195 25 id at 194 26 id 27 id at 195 citing new york state conference of blue cross blue

regulates employers structuring of their employee health benefit plans28 the court indicated that the only rational choice employers have is to structure their erisa health care benefit plans so as to meet the minimum spending threshold29 the availability of alternatives to increase health care spending without affecting an erisa plan did not persuade the fourth circuit the court noted that from an employers perspective the categories of erisa and nonerisa health care sp ending would not be isolated unrelated costs decisions regarding one would affect the other and thereby violate erisas preemption provision 30 the dissent maintained that the fair share act was not preempted by erisa because it offered means of compliance that does not impact erisa plans31 the dissent explained that an employer could comply with the measure by paying an assessment or increasing spending on employee health insurance by not expressing preference for one method over the other the dissent concluded that the act is not preempted32 the dissent suggested that preemption would be more likely if the fair share act dictated plans system for processing claims paying benefits or determining beneficiaries33 however any burden imposed on erisa plans by the fair share act was simply too slight to trigger erisa preemption34 on april 16 2007 the maryland attorney general announced that his office would not seek review of the fourth circuits decision by the supreme court35 g21g158g143g143g152g149g148g561g5g152g158g151g157g162g561 under the suffolk county act covered employers would have been required to make specified minimum employee health care expenditures employers with health care expenditures below the specified level would have been required to pay penalty equal to the shortfall the suffolk county act defined the term health care expenditure to mean any amount paid by covered employer to its employees or to another party for the purpose of providing health care services or reimbursing the cost of such services for employees or their families including contributions to health savings accounts and expenditures to operate workplace health clinic 36 the suffolk county act defined covered employer as any person that operates at least one retail store located in suffolk county where groceries or other foods are sold for offsite consumption and that meets one of the following requirements 1 25000 square feet or more of the stores selling area floor space is used for the sale of groceries or other foods for offsite 28 fielder 475 f3d at 195 29 id at 193 30

billion or more in the most recent calendar year and the sale of groceries comprises more than 20 of the companys revenue37 the definition for covered employer appeared to reflect the suffolk county acts express legislative intent to protect small retailers from large employers that did not provide health care for employees 38 rila contended that the suffolk county act was preempted by erisa because it mandated certain level of health care benefits for employers interfered with the uniform national administration of benefit plans and imposed reporting requirements beyond those prescribed by erisa to bolster its position rila cited fielder and asserted that the suffolk county act should be found similarly preempted although the court noted that it was not bound by the fourth circuits decision it nevertheless indicated that the suffolk county act was substantially similar to the fair share act and that it was in accord with the fourth circuits well reasoned and comprehensive analysis39 the court rejected the countys claim that state law is not preempted by erisa where the existence of plan is not necessary to be in compliance with the state law the county had argued that the suffolk county act did not require the establishm ent or modification of an erisa plan and that company had various options for complying with the law quoting fielder the court maintained that the only rational choice for covered employers under the suffolk county act was to structure their erisa health care benefit plans to meet the minimum spending threshold40 because covered employers would have been forced to change how their employee benefit plans would be structured the court concluded that the suffolk county act had an obvious connection with employee benefit plans and thus was preempted by erisa 41 g21g138g151g561g8g155g138g151g140g146g156g140g152g561 like the suffolk county act the san francisco he alth care security ordinance requires covered employers to make minimum

not excluded from coverage by other provisions of the ordinance44 the san francisco ordinance identifies various qualifying health care expenditures including contributions to health savings accounts and payments to third party for the purpose of providing health care services for covered employees covered employers may also satisfy the ordinances spending requirement by making payments directly to the city regulations that implement the ordinance confirm that covered employer has discretion with regard to the type of health care expenditure it chooses to make for its covered employees 45 in golden gate restaurant association v city and county of san francisco california federal district court concluded that the san francisco ordinance was preempted by erisa because it related to employee benefit plans46 the court determined that the ordinance had an impermissible connection with employee welfare benefit plans and made unlawful reference to such plans the court observed by mandating employee health benefit structures and administration the health care expenditure requirements interfere with preserving employer autonomy over whether and how to provide employee health coverage and ensuring uniform national regulation of such coverage 47 the court maintained that the san francisco ordinance had an impermissible connection with employee benefit plans not only because it required certain level of benefits typically provided by erisa plans but because it affected the structure of existing plans 48 employers were required to either modify the administration of existing plans or make additional payments with reference to the amounts paid under such plans to comply with the ordinance the court also explained that the san francisco ordinance made unlawful reference to employee benefit plans in two ways first it specifically referenced the existence of erisa plans in its expenditure requirements provisions 49 second liability under the ordinance was determined exclusively with reference to employersponsored health benefits that were provided mostly under existing erisa plans50 in other words to determine liability the ordinance required an examination of how much an employer paid for employee health coverage under these existing plans in september 2008 the ninth circuit reversed the district courts decision and concluded that erisa does not preempt the san francisco ordinance on appeal the court addressed two arguments espoused by the golden gate restaurant association first the association contended that the socalled citypayment option which allows

plan thus the association maintained that the ordinance impermissibly rela tes to an erisa plan second the association argued that even if the citypayment option does not create an erisa plan the ordinance requires an employer to make health care expenditures that relate to the erisa plans of covered employers in violation of the statute the association believed that the citypayment option established an erisa plan because of the administrative obligations that are imposed on em ployers by the ordinance the ninth circuit however found that the ordinance imposed only mini mal administrative duties on employers that chose the citypayment option the court observed under the ordinance an employer has responsibility other than to make the required payments for covered employees and to retain records to show that it has done so51 in addition the ninth circuit declined to apply criteria that had been used previously to identify the existence of an erisa plan based on the notion that plan creation requires only that reasonable person can ascertain the intended benefits beneficiaries source of financing and procedures for receiving benefits52 the court noted that this criteria has been employed only in cases that involve some type of unwritten or informal promise made by an employer to its employees53 the court maintained that the criteria has never been used to evaluate arrangements required by state or local law the ninth circuit evaluated the associations argument that the san francisco ordinance impermissibly relates to the erisa plans of covered employers by examining whether the ordinance and its health expenditure requirements have connection with or reference to such plans after conducting this twopart inquiry the court concluded that the ordinance does not relate to an erisa plan and is thus not preempted by the statute the ninth circuit distinguished the san francisco ordinance from other laws that have been found to have connection with an erisa plan citing egelhoff for example the court noted that unlike the washington law at issue in that case the ordinance does not bind plan administrators to particular choice of rules fo r determining plan eligibility or entitlement to particular benefits54 the court further explained that the ordinance does not require employers to structure their employee benefit plans in particular manner or to provide specific benefits the ninth circuit also determined that the san francisco ordinance does not have an unlawful reference to an erisa plan the court found th at the ordinance does not act immediately and exclusively on erisa plans and that the existence of erisa plans is not essential to the operation of the ordinance the court observed the following the ordinance can have its full force and effect even if employer in the city has an erisa plan covered employers without erisa plans can discharge their obligation under the ordinance simply by making their required health care expenditures to the city 55 51 golden gate restaurant assn 2008 wl at 9 52 id at 1011 53 see id citing scott v gulf oil corp 754 f2d 1499 9th cir 1985 modzelewski v resolution trust corp 14 f3d

ordinance are based on the hours worked by its employees and not on the value or nature of benefits available to erisa plan participants finally the ninth circuit responded to the associations concern of circuit split with the fourth circuit if it upheld the san francisco or dinance the court emphasized that the ordinance does not require employers to structure their employee health care plans to provide certain level of benefits in contrast the court maintained the maryland fair share act did not provide meaningful alternatives to comply with the law covered employers were given an irresistible incentive to provide employees with greater level of health benefits 56

access to affordable quality accountable health care considered to be the most comprehensive health care reform legislation ever enacted by state 57 the act has received great deal of attention in part due to the fact that it is the first state law to require residents to obtain an d maintain health care coverage or be subject to adverse tax consequences58 the act establishes connector59 through which individuals and small groups may obtain health coverage and creates numerous requirements for private insurers as well as employers60 one of the employer requirements is fair share

help cover costs of health care provided to uninsured massachusetts residents63 regulations set forth two alternative tests to determine whether an employer has made fair and reasonable contribution under the primary test an employer has made fair and reasonable contribution if 25 or more of its employees who are employed at massachusetts locations are enrolled in the employers health plan64 under the secondary test an employer who fails the primary test but offers to pay at least 33 of the cost of premiums of group health plan offered to fulltime employees employed over certain time period meets the contribution requirements 65 if the employer cannot meet either of these tests the employer must make fairshare contribution which is required to be calculated annually and takes into account factors such as the cost of the statefunded care used by the employees of noncontributing employers66 however the fairshare contribution amount cannot exceed 295 per employee67 despite speculation that the massachusetts act would be subject to preemption challenge under erisa to date actions have been brought68 if the fair share provisions were to be challenged it is likely that reviewing court would look to the travelers case and its progeny in making its determination similar to those cases court may evaluate whether the massachusetts fair share requirements have connection with erisa plans by looking to erisas objectives eg establishing uniform nationwide regulation of employee benefit plans as guide to the scope of the state law that congress understood would survive preemption 69 reviewing court may also look to the nature of the laws effect on erisa plans ie whether the massachusetts fair share requirements mandate the structure or administration of employee benefit plans or have more of an indirect influence on erisa plans70 in addition reviewing court could examine whether the fair share requirements of the massachusetts act have reference to an employee benefit plan as stated by the supreme court where states law acts immediately and exclusively upon erisa plans or where the existence of erisa plans is essential to the laws operation that reference will result in preemption 71 further court could also rely on or distinguish the fair share requirements of the massachusetts act from the egelhoff case as the court held in egelhoff law that regulates the structure or administration of an erisa plan will not be saved from preemption just because there is way to opt out of its requirements continued or contributed to by an employer

reasoning used by courts in evaluating other fair share laws72 for example as discussed above in fielder the fourth circuit found the maryland fair share act was preempted because it effectively forced employers to restructure their employee health plans and as such interfered with erisas goal of providing uniform nationwide administration of these plans73 the fielder court opined that just because an employer had the option not to spend money on health care for their employees this option was not meaningful alternative and did not protect the law from preemption court evaluating the fair share requirements of the massachusetts act could make arguments similar to those articulated in the fielder case like marylands fair share law the massachusetts act provides that employers covered by the act must either make contribution towards employee health benefits or contribute to state trust fund and as argued in fielder any reasonable employer would choose not to pay money to state when it can in the alternative reap benefits from spending money on employee health care 74 some commentators have pointed out that compared to the maryland fair share act the massachusetts act requires relatively small amount ie more than 295 per employee to be paid to the state as penalty for not offering health coverage75 it may be argued that since the massachusetts fair share contribution amount is relatively small it does not bind the choices of employers as the court found in fielder 76 still despite this smaller penalty court may still see the massachusetts fair share scheme as means of coercing an employer to offer health coverage and thus not escape erisa preemption in addition it is possible to argue that the massachusetts fair share requirements may be more susceptible to preemption than the fielder and suffolk county cases this is because the massachusetts act requires employers to pay the fair and reasonable premium contribution amounts to group health plan which is likely regulated by erisa in order to avoid making fairshare contribution to the state under maryland and suffolk countys fair share laws employers had some choices as to how an empl oyer could make these expenditures eg under the marylands fair share law expenditures could be made towards an onsite medical clinic given that the fielder and suffolk county courts found that requiring an employer to pay these health care expenditures directly affected employers erisa plans it may be argued that requiring employers to contribute to group health plan versus contributing money to the state creates an impermissible reference to an employee benefit plan 77 72 it is important to point out that if the massachusetts act was to be challenged on preemptive grounds it would likely be in the first circuit if preemption challenge was brought in this circuit court would not be bound to follow any of the previous fair share cases discussed above but co uld still rely on these cases in support of its decision 73 the department of labor in an amicus brief had argued for this result it was argued that by setting an aggregate amount by percentage of payroll affected employers must spend on employee health benefits maryland is taking away employers fundamental authority over whether and on what terms to sponsor plan and potentially subjecting employers to the competing demands of multiplicity of state and local regulatory schemes brief of the secretary of labor as amicus curiae supra note 17 74 these benefits include employee retention and the ability to attract better employees see fielder 475 f3d at 193 75 see eg monahan 55 kan l rev at 1214 because of the modestor weakpenalty associated with the fair share contribution it will likely survive an erisa preemption challenge because it is mere indirect ec onomic incentive for plan administrator to make certain choices with respect to its health care plan 76 see golden gate restaurant assn 2008

could sustain the fair share requirements by applying the reasoning used by the ninth circuit in golden gate restaurant association as discussed above the ninth circuit in explaining why the ordinance had connection with an erisa plan pointed to the fact that the san francisco ordinance did not require an employer to adopt an erisa or other h ealth plan or provide specific benefits through such plans because an employer could discharge it s obligations in whole or in part to an erisa plan or in whole or in part to the city the ordinance preserved erisas uniform regulatory regime and was not preempted78 similar argument could be made for the massachusetts fair share requirement as an employer is not required to establish an erisa health plan or provide any health benefits to its employees79 the ninth circuit also found that the ordinance does not make reference to an erisa plan because among other things it does not act on erisa plans at all let alone immediately and exclusively and is fully functional in the absence of an erisa plan 80 again it may be argued that the massachusetts act does not solely apply to erisa plans and that the formation of plan is not essential for meeting the requirements of the massachusetts act81 g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 jon shimabukuro legislative
