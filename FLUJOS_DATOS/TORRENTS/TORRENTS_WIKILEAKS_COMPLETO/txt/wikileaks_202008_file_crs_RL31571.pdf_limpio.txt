divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31571military aviation safety summary military aviation safety is concern to policy makers in both the department of defense dod and congress dod is concerned about improving safety b ecause aviation accidents erode dods war figh ting capabilities in many tangible and intangible ways dod aviation accidents are classified by the severity of injury or property damage class accidents are the most severe events and the rate at which these accidents occur is the most frequently used yardstick for measuring aviation safety the office of the secretary of defense and the military services including the coast guard have differe nt roles and responsibilities in military aviation safety promotion and mishap investig ations generally speaking the services have the most active and involved role in promotin g aviation safety the services conduct two types of mishap investiga tions generally referred to as safety investigations and legal investigations in the commercial and civil sector the national transportation safety board ntsb conducts single investigation the status of military aviation safety depends heavily on ones viewpoint there is consensus on how well the services are doing in promoting and improving aviation safety some believe that the current mishap rate is acceptable others believe that it is unacceptable and can be improved others believe that dod should strive for and achieve zero mishap rate over the past 50 years data show that the total annual number of accidents and the rate at which they occur have significantly decreased however this improvement appears to have stagnated over the past 10 ears comparisons of safety between the military and the civilian world between the us military and foreign militaries between the different military services and between different aircraft types may offer some perspective on the state of aviation safety in the us military while it is easy to see the negative effects of aviation accidents determining and mitigating accident causes are often more di fficult many factors can contribute to single accident frequently conve ntional wisdom does not apply when identifying the leading causes of aviation mishaps aircraft age and increased operations tempo optempo are frequently claimed to cause accidents however the relationship between these factors and haps is unclear it does appear clear however that human error is leading cause of mishaps those who wish to promote safety and to improve upon todays military aviation safety record may consider variet of approaches focusing senior leaders in dod on the problem may help fencing off money in dods budget specifically for safety is another cited pproach tying aircraft proc urement funding to desired or acceptable class mishap rate may be considered as may more aggressive fielding of numerous flig ht safety technologies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31571contents introduction 1 c c i d n t i n v s t i g t i n p r c

policy makers in both the department of defense dod and congress dod is c oncerned about improving safety because aviation accidents erode dods war figh ting capabilities in many tangible and intangible ways accidents degrade opera tional readiness they reduce the number of aircraft readily available both because of damage and aircraft destruction and also because aircraft are often grounded while accidents are investigated accidents consume financial resources damaged aircraft must be repaired and destroyed aircraft replaced accident investigators must be traine d and investigations funded accidents are hard on personnel they hurt morale and cost lives according to dod records 3072 people died in military aviation accidents between 1980 and 20031 while it is easy to understand the ne gative effects of aviation accidents determining and mitigating accide nt causes are often more difficult many factors can contribute to accidents aircraft age pilot training weather or other environmental conditions human error mechanical failure and new aircraft designs are just some of the factors that may contribute to aviation accidents often more than one factor can contribute to an accident congress has consistently expressed concern for military aviation safety for instance at the request of house armed services committee hasc the general accounting office gao conducted re view of military aircraft accidents gaonsiad9669br military aircraft safety significant improvements since 1975 the hasc directed gao to update this study in 1998 gaonsiad98 95br military aircraft safety serious accidents remain at historically low levels congress has also tasked dod to conduc t high level studies on military aviation safety and recommend specific actions on ways to reduce accidents pl 104201 sec 2255 for example ex pressed congresss belief that dod should develop and manage joint service effort to address flight safety and called for the secretary of defense to study the feasibility of such program congress also directed dod to develop new approaches to reduce the incidence of recurring safety problems such as human error pl 10585 sec 1046 directed dod to conduct similar study this time on the advisability of revamping dods accident investigation processes to more closely parallel those of the national transporta tion safety boardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31571crs2 2 in addition to aircraft accidents dod also tracks explosives and chemical agents motor vehicles ground and i ndustrial offduty military unmanned aerial vehicles guided missiles maritime nuclear and space accidentstop dod leadership has recently taken steps that suggest it shares congressional concern over military aviati on safety in may 19 2003 memorandum secretary of defense donald rumsfeld challenged dods top leaders to reduce the number of mishaps and accident rates by at least 50 in the next two years secretary rumsfeld noted that dod accident rates were on the rise and were negatively affecting operational readiness under s ecretary of defense david chu is leading this departmentwide effort which has been labeled the defense safety oversight council dsoc accident investigati on processes and procedures terms and finitions an accident in aviation circles frequently and synonymously called mishap is an unplanned event or series of events that result in damage to dod property and result in occupational illness to dod military or civilian personnel injury to dod military pe rsonnel both onor offduty injury to on duty dod civilians damage to public or private property or injuryillness caused by dod operations battle damage is not an accident intentional vandalism or destruction of property is not an accident neither purposeful assault on personnel nor suicide are considered accidents dod divides aircraft accidents into three categories flight accidents flight related accidents and ground operations accidents2 an aircraft flight accident is an accident in which there is intent for flight and damage to the aircraft occurs explosives chemical agents or missile even ts that cause damage to an aircraft with intent for flight are categorized as flight accidents an aircraft flightrelated accident is an accident in which there is intent for flight and reportable damage to the aircraft itself but the accident involves fatality re portable injury or reportable property damage an aircraft ground operations accident nonflight rate producing is an accident in which there is not intent for flight and which results in damage to an aircraft death or injury this applies to aircraft both on land and onboard ships damage to an aircraft wh it is being handled as commodity or cargo is not reportable as an aircraft accident the department of defense keeps track of aviation flight mishaps by flying hour aircraft flight accident rates for ex ample are expressed in terms of how many occur for every 100000 flying hours as point of illustration in fy2001 the army experienced 24 class flight mishaps while flying 2067104 hours this equates to mishap rate of 116 dod aviation accidents are classified by the severity of injury or property damage property damage severity is calculated as the sum of the costs associated with dod and nondod property damaged in th accident if injury results mishap is reported even if the costs are less than the minimum dollar criteriahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31571crs3 3 mishap investigation reporting and record keeping curtis bow ling assistant deputy under secretary of defense safety occupational health february 28 2002 4 see appendix i for safety center contact informationclass accidents are the most severe events mishap is categorized as class if the total cost of damages to government and other property is 1 million or more dod aircraft is destroyed or an injury andor occupational illness results in fatality or permanent total disability class b accidents are those in which the resulting total damage cost is be tween 200000 and 999999 an injury andor occupational illness results in permanent partial disability or when three or more personnel are hospitalized for in patient care as result of single accident class c accidents are those in which the resulting total damage cost is between 20000 and 199000 nonfatal injury causes any loss of time from work beyond the day or shift on which it occurred or nonfatal occupational illn ess or disab ility causes loss of time from work or disability at any time the services have adopt ed these accident categorie s classification criteria reporting formats and procedures mandated by the office of the secretary of defense this does not however prevent the services from collecting classifying and maintaining additional data for their individual accident prevention needs the army for example also tracks accidents that they categorize as d and f in terms of severity dod safety roles and responsibilities the office of the secretary of defense and the military services including the coast guard have roles and responsibilities in military aviati on safety promotion and hap investigations the deputy undersecretary of defense for inst allations and environment dusd ie is the lead osd office for accident reporting and safety promotion this office sets policy guidance on safety promotion nd mishap investiga tions and provides oversight it collects and analyzes accident data provided by the military services updates measures of merit for assessing safety promotion and mishaps distributes analysis and communicates the status of accident prevention efforts osd and the joint staff do not generally have the expertise to participate in or conduct safety investigations so the servi ces have lead responsibility for establishing procedures and implementing safety promotion initiatives and mishap investigations3 specifically the services collect maintain analyze and report accident property andinjury data if the mishap cause is identifie d the services are responsible for ensuring that effective corrective action is taken each of the services operates safety center that is intended to be the locus of safety promotion and misha p investigation efforts 4 general offi cers independently review every safety investigation report of serious aviation accident this occurs both through the chain of command and th rough the independent efforts of the service safety centers the general officers that command the safety centers also serve as the service safety chiefs answerable directly to the service chiefs of staff dod policy provides the services with guidance but also discretion and flexibility in the execution of their res ponsibilities for example dod instructionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31571crs4 60557 accident i nvestigation reporting nd record keeping directs the services to establish procedures to use disinter ested third party to investigate class accidents whenever possible and produce i nvestigation reports yet osd does not prescribe what disinterested third party means therefore the navy for example determines whether mishap investigators come from the fleet or from the navy safety center if investigators come from the fleet the navy determines whether disinterested third parties can be found in the same squadron experiencing the mishap or whether impartiality can be onl found elsewhere in the air wing or outside the air wing the same is true for the air force and the army osd also gives the services the freedom of issuing policies and guidance for when investigation boards are to be used for safety and legal investigations the services develop qualification criteria for accident investigators based on the complexity or severity of the accidents involved and blish procedures to screen every fatality and determine whether or not it was accide ntal the services do not coordinate these policies nd procedures among themselves but tailor them to best satisfy their unique environments cultures and needs investigation types and procedures the services conduct two types of mishap investigations generally referred to s s f t i n v s tigations and legal investigations this contrasts to the process for investigating commercial and civil aviation accidents in the commercial and civil sector the national transportation safety board ntsb lead s single investigation the purpose of safety investigations is to prevent future accidents the services are required by osd to conduct safety investigation for all class mishaps and some class b mishaps safety investigat ors collect and analyze information to determine the causes of the accident and make recommendations for corrective action an important characteris tic of safety inve stigations is that personnel interviewed by i nvestigators can be grante d confidentiality and immunity from punitive action information provided under this grant of immunity is called privileged information the rationale behind conduc ting safety investiga tions and for allowing personnel to give privileged in formation is that unlike co mmercial or civil contexts national security demands that to the exte nt possible aircraft fleets not be grounded for indefinite periods of time gran ting immunity from prosecution and punitive action encourages personnel to provide fra nk and accurate information about aircraft mishaps and their causes dod officials believe that this in turn leads to the expeditious completion of mishap inves tigations and quick determination of whether fleetwide actions need to be taken in addition to privileged information safety investigations may also contain information that can be released to legal investigators or the general public there are many similarities in how services conduct sa fety investigations all four services include medical experts ma intenance experts nd pilots or operations experts all four services also include representatives from their respective safety center these representatives may be civilians with special safety expertise there are also differences in how the services conduct safety i nvestigations for example army safety investigations are led by representatives from the army safety centerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31571crs5 5 in 1954 dod operated many more aircraft th an it does today therefore comparing 2200 mishaps in 1955 to 70 in 1999 is not an apples toapples comparison dividing the number of mishaps by 100000 flight hours makes the comp arison of two different sized forces valid continuedthe air force and navy investigations ar led by officers from outside their safety centers also the senior officer of an air force investigation board must hold the rank of colonel o6 and be rated av iator the senior member of the navys aircraft mishap board can be commander o5 the purpose of legal investigations is to inquire into all the facts and circumstances surrounding accide nts as well as to obtain nd preserve all available evidence for use in litigation claims disc iplinary action or dverse administrative actions legal investigations are required for class mishaps and all suspected cases of friendly fire alt hough nonprivileged safety info rmation acquired by safety investigator may be made av ailable to the legal investig ation the legal investigation is otherwise conducted inde pendently from the safety investigation and under procedures prescribed by the services judge advocates general jags personnel assigned to conduct safety i nvestigations will not conduct gal investigations of the same accident personnel curren tly assigned to fulltime safety positions will not be appointed as member of legal investig ation board legal i nvestigation boards can be composed of both milita ry and civilian personnel osd also sets guidelines for how legal investigations are staffed to ensure an objective and effective inves tigation osd instructs the services to ensure that majority of investigators are selected from units outside the mishap unit or unit not subordinate to the mishap unit also at least one member of the board must be member of the armed forces or an officer or employee of the department of defense with specialized knowledge and exper tise pertaining to aircraft accident investigations these guidelines can be wa ived however if the services deem they are not practicable either due to remo accident location lack of available people or need to expediti ously begin the investigation observations mishap data and causes assessing accident data over time can be useful when trying to make observations on whether safety is improving worsening or holding steady making observations on aviation safety trends depends on perspec tive making observations is complicated by wide varia tions in accident rates over time and by the fact that the military services do not record accident da ta in coordinate d and uniform manner from one perspective it can appear that military aviation accidents are becoming less frequent suggesting that military aviation is becoming safer over the last 50 years for example the freque ncy of dod aviation accidents has dropped markedly see appendix ii in 1955 for example dod suffered over 2200 class aviation mishaps by 1999 this number had dropped to 70 perhaps more significantly the annual number of haps per 100000 flight hours has similarly dropped over this time period5 in 1975 the class mishap rate was over 4 perhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31571crs6 5 continued the dotted lines on the charts in appendix ii indicate this mishap rate over time 6 see appendix ii 7 captain kurt garbow deput special assistant for

implemented variety of measures that it says have contributed to lowering mishap rates the navy for example began fielding aircraft carriers with angled decks all the services initiated safety programs and opened safety centers during this time period from another perspective however it ppears that while accidents may be less frequent than in the past recent improveme nts in aviation safety may have slowed and the frequency of accidents has not appr eciably declined lately the defense science board noted that the previously declining dod accident rate 1950 to 1994 has now reached plateau8 review of dod mishaps indicates that between 1995 and 2001 aviation mishap rates ve remained relatively cons tant at or near 15 per 100000 flight hours in any given time span the number of accidents can vary considerably suggesting that improvements in safety may not be inevitable nor permanent the time period 1997 to 2003 is good ex ample of the apparent variab ility in aviation accidents on september 17 1997 secretary of defense william perry directed that all four military services c onduct mandatory 24 hour ce ssation of aviation training missions concerned about large numbe r of aircraft mishaps perry urged commanders to thoroughly examine our trai ning missions ensuring that our crews are appropriately tasked nd that missions are conducted as safely as possible9 just three years later in fy2000 dod reported th at it experienced its safest aviation year up to that time with only 123 accidents per 100000 flight hours10 by february 2002 however safety in the air force had again become cause for concern because the air force has had twice as many aircraft crashes this year as it had at the same time in 2000 and 2001 air force ch ief of staff general john jumper took the unusual step of ordering every unit wo rldwide to stop operations for day to focus on safety11 the commander of the air forces air combat command

statistics they do not record data in uniform manne r this lack of uniformity coupled with the wide variability in accidents over time makes comparisons between the services and different platforms difficult in th civil sector the national transportation safety board ntsb also keeps accident statistics but defin itions and classifications are different from dod defin itions and classifications conclusions should be made cautiously civilian versus military mishap rates national transportation safety board ntsb statistics are available fo r us commercial air carriers from 1982 to 2001 review of these statistics indicates that major accidents13 occurred during this time period 033 times pe r 100000 flight hours14 as table 1 shows class mishaps in the military during simila r time period 19802000 occurred 81 times more frequently per 100000 flight hours than major accidents occurred per 100000 commercial flight hours15 major accidents in general civil aviation are more prevalent than commercial accidents and ppear closer to dods experience for example from 1996 to 2001 civil trai ning aircraft reportedly suffered 42 major accidents per 100000 flight hours and 4seat fixed landing gear aircraft suffered 39 major accidents per 100000 flight hours16 table 1 dod aviation class mishaps 1980200017 total mishap rate fatalities fatalities mishap army 605 198 552 91 air force 1002 164

august 2002 19 the years 19802000 were used because data are available for all services and many different aircraft the time span reduces the ffects of single bad event or year the time span allows for aircraft maturation it is contemporary time period and should reflect recent attempts to improve safety us military versus forei gn military mishap rates it would likely be useful to compare safety and mishap rates between the us experience and that of foreign air forces unfortunately such co mparisons are difficult to make foreign governments do not always ma ke safety and mishap information publicly available when they do it often is not reported in ways that foster comparison for example often total number of misha ps is provided but not flig ht hours or mishaps are reported but severity classifications are not included or not comparable to us mishap classifications ie class class b the most valid safety comparisons that can be made with us air forces are likely with the air forces of other industrialized countries eg nato countri israel australia canada these countries tend to fly the same aircraft as the united states and they have the resources to train personnel and maintain equipment at comparable levels it is generally believed that u s mishap rates are superi or to those found in less industrialized countries and at least compar able to those of industrialized countries18 us coast guard versus us military mishap rates comparing dods safety record to coast guards may in many ways be more helpful than comparisons to the civil and commercial world the coast guard flies many of the same aircraft as dod eg c130 fixed wi ng aircraft and h60 helicopters and under conditions that may be closer to military c onditions than commercial aircraft experience also because the coast guard tr ains with and is closely associated with the military the coast guard may share some of the services aviation culture and operating procedures as the figure below indicates the coast guard safety record compares favorably with dods from 1987 to 2001 the coast guards class mishap rate averages 115100000 hours and for 11 of 15 years its annual class mishap rate was lower or as low as the best service mishap rate service comparisons between 1980 and 200019 the air force experienced the greatest number of class mishaps du to its very large number of flying hours between 2 and 35 million hours annually these mishaps translated into the lowest class mishap rate among the services with 16 per 100000 flying hours the marine corps experienced the fewest number of mishaps but because it flies comparatively less between 260000 and 460000 hours annua lly it showed the highest class mishap rate with 455 pe r 100000 flight hours almost three times the air force rate also of interest is the total number of fatalities suffered in aviation accidents during this time period the air force had the greatest number of fatalities during this time period but the marine corp s had the greatest num ber of fatalities per mishap with at rate of 131 fatalities per event the navy experienced the lowest fatality rate with 8 per mishaphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31571crs9 figure 1 aviation class mishap rates fixed wing versus rotary wing comparisons intuitively it may make sense to many observers for rotary wing ai rcraft helicopters to have higher mishap rates than fixed wing aircraft helicopters ar arguably more difficult to fly than fixed wing aircraft and they tend to operate in more complicated if not more hostile environments eg low altitude obstacles such as trees and power lines however accident statistics do not always support in tuition on the one hand it appears that air force helicopters have higher accident rates than air force fixed wing aircraft air force statistics indicate that be tween 1980 and 2001 air force helicopters suffered class mishap rate of 311 while fixed wing aircraft class mishaps were approximately half that at 160 on the other hand marine corps helicopt ers have experienced lower class mishap rates than marine corps fixed wi ng aircraft between 1991 and 2 001 data unavailable from 19801990 ma rine corps helicopters experienced class mishap rate of 284 while ma rine corps fixed wing ai rcraft experienced much higher rate of 438 two marine co rps fixed wing aircraft ea6b prowler and av 8b harrier had higher mishap rates than the helicopter with the highest mishap rate the ah1w super cobra also the kc130s total lack of mishaps during this time period significantly reduced the fixed wing aircraft average the average mishap rate for the remaining three fixed wing ai rcraft is double that 584 of the marine corps helicopters ove r this time period

the marine corps helicopter rate however the air force fixed wing class mishap rate was 128 much lower than the corresponding marine corps rate of 438 in this period fixed wing aircraft experienced both lower and higher class mishap rates than helicopters this suggests that whether an aircraft is fixed or rotary wing may not alone be the strong est determinant of aviation safety other factors such as the specific type of aircraft or by which service the aircraft is flown may have stronger influe nce on safety other scenar ios however may contradict this suggestion combat aircraft versus noncombat aircraft similar to the question of helicopter vs fixed wing aircraft accident rates many may believe that combat aircraft eg fighters and bombers suffe r from higher accident rates than noncombat aircraft eg airlift refu eling and surveillance howe ver an assessment of accident data suggests that the rate of class mishaps for combat aircraft may not be appreciably higher than for noncombat airc raft using the air force as case study and again examining the 19802000 time peri od the class mishap rates of combat aircraft 168 is only marginally higher than non combat aircraft 166 because some aircraft are relatively new and di dnt generate data fo r the entire period 1980 2000 several eg f117 b1 b2 c17 8 were not included the class mishap rate of these aircraft can be included by narrowing the time frame considered 19912000 again the class mishap rates of combat ai rcraft 22 is slightly higher than noncombat aircraft 19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31571crs11 20 first deployed

significant improvements since 1975 general accounting office gaonsiad9669br february 1996 p27 23 ibidaccident causes assessing the cause of mishaps is central to preventing them or reducing their likelihood in the future many factors can contribute to aviation mishaps human error mechanical failure weather and maintenance problems are some of the factors that can by themselves or in conjuncti on cause an aviation mishap often singling out the cause of given accident is difficult observers tend to argue that high operations tempo optempo aircraft age and human error have strongest correlations with increased mishaps optempo many observers warn that s imultaneous operational conflicts and reduced manpower and equipment may speed up optempo to degree that safety is compromised some fear that due to the demands of the war on terrorism less experienced people may be backfilling critical jobs the military may be taking more chances and an intensified training pace may result in increased aviation mishaps for example anytime you have an increase in the training cycle or in support of combat operations it raises the probability that more accidents will occur according to one observer21 others argue that deploying overseas and fighting wars are what the military is designed to do and that high optempo is business as usual thus mishap rate s shouldnt and dont increase during war they argue according to 1996 gao study while rvice studies have addressed the relationship of operating mpo to aviation mishaps direct correlation has been inconclusive22 the gao points out that the re latively low incidence of class flight mishaps make drawing inferences and statistical correlations of variables with mishap rates difficult23 in this report the gao described two seemingly contradictory air force studi one that found that there was not cause and effect relationship between optempo and aviation mishaps nd another that found that high optempo posed an obvious operational safety risk office of the secretary of defense osd records also suggest tenuous relationship between optempo and aviation mishaps as the chart below shows aviation mishap rates have

for the air force safety centers aviation division reportedly claimed that higher accident rates wessre caused by the hazardous missions flown in afghanistan and iraq26 yet the chief of air force safety commented none of the accidents we have investigated so far this year for which there is completed investigation have come up and said that training or ops tempo or things like that are contributing factors27 marine corps safety expert s also downplay the relationship operations and mishaps in depl oyments we are doing fa ntastic job its back here at home in training where we are not so focused that we are having problems with mishaps28 while correlation between high optem po and increased mishaps has been proved it also hasnt been disproved great degree of uncertainty remains

causing aviation mishaps there is little debate that average age of dod aircraft is increasing in the air force for instance some estimate that th average aircraft age in 2002 was 22 years up from 13 years in 199029 the congressional budget office cbo offered more conservative estimate the average age of air force aircraftwill exceed 15 years by 2002 but cbo cautioned that the average aircraft age will continue to increase into the next decade that average age will climb to peak of almost 20 years in 2011 before starting to decline as joint strike fighters become operational30 intuitively this line of reasoning that older aircraft are more prone to accidents makes sense and if true one would expect aviation mishaps to increase as the age of the militarys aircraft increased however mishap statistics and observations by military safety center officials bring into question cause and effect relationship between aircraft age and mishaps while the average age of air force aircraft for example s increased from 1990 to 2003 mishap statistics indicate that air force accidents have slow ly decreased over this sa time period see appendix ii chart 2 further air force officials are cited saying that there is indication of increased material failures leading to accidents31 it also appears that growing concern over navy and marine corps accidents comes during downward trend in material failures over the last 10 years the number of material failure s contributing to mishap has been 86 per 100000 flight hours over the past five years that rate has decreased to 71 per 100000 flight hours32 navy statistics indicate that be tween 1997 and 2001 material factors contributed to mishaps at rate of 68 per 100000 flying hours see table 4 below the class mishap rates for fy2002 and

httpsafetyarmymilhomehtmlhuman factors in many ways humans are more complicated and more difficult to predict and control than are machines therefore it may not surprise many that human error appears to be dominant factor in aviation mishaps the defense science board dod s premiere body of scientific and technical advisors found in 1997 that human performance is causal factor in over 70 of all class mishaps34 as the following table suggests human error at least for the navy and marine corps ma have had an even stronger influence on aviation mishaps in the time period 19972001 table 4

percent of navyusmc mishaps36 the army safety center stresses the impact of human error on aviation mishaps when accident causes are examined major issue in aviation safety remains human error although training and lead ership can often bear some of the responsibility it is generally the case that soldier indiscipline inattention or the willful neglect of published rules or safeguards is cited as contributing actor37 according to the army between fis cal years 1999 and 2001 the leading causes of army aviation accidents were ind iscipline 284 leadership 178 training 136 and standards

in 40 percent of mishaps in fy200140 congressional considerations policy makers concerned bout military aviation safety face two key questions the first is philosophical what level of av iation mishaps is tolerable the second question is more practical what can be done to reduce aviation mishaps to that tolerable level what level of aviation mishaps is tolerable there is consensus among analysts nor policy makers on the state of military aviation safety many argue that the current mishaps rate is acceptable they point out that 1 military aviati on operates under very trying circumstances 2 dod appears to make safety hi gh priority 3 mishap rates have steadily declined over the last 50 years and 4 contemporary misha p rates have been very low by historical standards others disagree saying that the current mishap rate an average of 17 class mishaps per 100000 flight hours from 19902003 is too high some observers say that dod should stri ve toward goal of zero aviation mishaps proponents of this perspective argue that there is acceptable accident rate and single accident or fatality is too high pe ople die in accidents often needlessly zeromishap proponents say nd by focusing on rates and statistics policy makers lose sight of this they poi nt out that although dods class mishap rate steadily improved between 1990 and 1996 for exampl 777 people died and 942 billion in equipment was destroyed in aviation accidents41 the fact that the aviation mishap rate was the lowest ever was little consolation to families who losthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31571crs17

iness are well documented by tolerating even one aviation accident we unnecessarily hamstring the military which is already facing serious challenges on the battlefield they argue others argue that while mishaps and especially mishap fatalities are unfortunate and to be avoided some number of accident s is inevitable those who believe that low mishap rates are tolerable point out that not even commercial airlines have achieved zero mishap rate spite considerably more benign flight conditions joining the military assumes so inherent risk low mishap rate proponents argue that the risk of accidents should be min imized but will remain nonetheless while striving for zero mishaps may be worthy goal it is unlikely to be achieved aviation safety can and shoul d be improved by striving toward an ambitious yet achievable goal some low mishap rate advocates point toward the commercial aviation major mishap rate of 033 pe r 100000 flight hours as one benchmark what can be done to reduce aviation mishaps if policy makers wish to attempt to reduce aviation mishaps below their current rate there appear to be four interrelated areas where action can be taken leadership organization budget and aggressive fielding of safety technologies leadership considering the numerous nd often overlapping causes of military aviation mishaps there is likely single silver bullet that can significantly improve safety however many observers believe increased leadership on this issue may affect more mishap cause areas than any other single measure congress could consider requi ring annual testimony on the status of military aviation safety to help motivate senior military leaders to take more active role in promoting safety the general officers42 who lead the service safety centers might be directed to assess for congress their services sa fety performance and make recommendations for improvements having the service ch iefs who are ultimate ly responsible for safety

do not have the organizational instruments to implement re vised policies and pro cedures currently two organizational issues stand out in the area of military aviation safety first the office of the secretary of defense osd is responsible for settin g safety policies and providing oversight however there is not one individual in osd whose sole responsibility is military aviation safety gao recognized this shortcoming in january 2002 report the office responsible for aviation safety currently occupies relatively low organizational position within the office of the secretary of defense osd as result of downsizing by osd several years ago five safety positions which shared responsibility for aviation safety issues were abolished and single staff member hired this staff members responsibilities include aviation safety and number of other responsibilities including compliance with the occupational safety and health act of 1970 osha as amended fire and emergency services range and weapons safety and traffic transportation45 according to former osd employees at one time up to eight people in osd worked exclusively on military aviation safety issues if the current state of staffing inhibits osds ability to effectively execute its re sponsibilities in aviati on safety that may suggest that osd leaders do not place high priority on this issue the second organizational issue pertains to the joint staff and the combatant commands46 currently none of these organizations play significant role in promoting aviation safety or investigatin g mishaps the services through their safety centers conduct inve stigations record and re port mishaps and generally promote aviation safety however dods guiding policy document on accident investigation reporting and record keeping dod instruction 60557 updated october 3 2000 applies to the joint staff and the cincs as well as the services section 2 applicability and scope this suggests that the joint staff and cincs have the authority and perhaps the res ponsibility to take more active role in aviation safety it is likely that the services and perhaps the joint staff and cincs themselves would resist increased

when planning specific operations and exercises in their aors could and should the joint staff take an active ro in investigating accidents that involve more than one service could and should the joint staff promote more standardized mishap recording and reporting among the safety centers budget policy makers who wish to promote aviation safety may review three interrelated aspects of dods budget first review of dods fy2004 budget request suggests that compared to the billions of dollars that are spent nnually to repair or replace aircraft damaged or st in mishaps dod requests little specifically for aviation safety the air force under the heading persona l safety and rescue equip requested 127 million in proc urement 53 million for night vision goggles and 74 million for items ss than 5000000 and the navy requested 105 million in om funding for aviation safe ty related activitie s there was request for research into aviation safety47 many may argue that money spent on aviation safety will pay for itself in savings from reduced accidents it may be difficult for safety proponents to argue that the services are spending too little on aviation safety however because of the second budget issue which is that safety related equipment and initiatives are spread throug hout the services budgets and at low levels of documenta tion aviation safety programs are not aggregated at level that facilitates th eir identification re view and assessment many more air force programs than those mentioned above may contribute to aviation safety but are lik ely buried in the budget aggregated under budget activities and line items such as aircraft procurement modification of aircraft or support equipment and facilities the third budget issue is that because of this disaggregation of aviation safety programs and efforts safety does not co mpete well with other programs in the annual budget process according to the defense science board it appears that because of budget procedures military services are not currently motivated to invest in safety technology that is likely to avoid downstream loss of life and equipment especially in noncombat aircraft the emphasis has been and continues to be on equipment directly related to combat missions along with minimizing initial unit cost48 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31571crs20 49 see crs report rl30685 military

httpwwwhqmcusmcmilsafetynsfaboutopenaboutthose wishing to promote aviation safety ma look for ways to help safety programs and initiatives compete with other programs and to help the services appreciate the long term benefit of spending near term dollars on safety in considering measures that might ameliorate these concerns possibility would be to fence off money in dod s budget specifically for aviation safety initiatives and programs there is precedent for this kind of action in their markup of dods fy2001 request appr opriations conferees adopt ed senate proposal to create the national defense airlift fund th purpose of this fund was to recognize airlift as an asset that benefits all the services and to protect airlift money from competition with other programs such as fighter aircraft in the air force budget49 congress might weigh creating military av iation safety fund to provide resources and focus for basic and applied resear ch on aviation safety on potentially high leverage topics such as better understanding of human performance and human error some would oppose creating fund in do ds budget specifically for aviation safety arguing that there are higher safety priorities they point out that there are more class accidents on the ground and more fatalities than there are in the air for fy2002 and fy2003 for example army aviation experienced 11 flight and non flight class mishaps nd 13 fatalities during that same time period the army experienced 99 ground class mishaps on and off duty resulting in 97 fatalities50 during fy03 the marine corps suffered 11 class flight mishaps resulting in 16 fatalities during this same time period 107 marines died in 97 ground mishaps 51 if any area should be singled out for sp ecial attention some argue it should be ground safety not aviation safety another option would be to tie the procur ement of new aircraft to the desired class mishap rate this ssumes that zero is not the desired rate the following fictional scenario illustrates how this m easure might work in their fy20xx budget the navy requests 40 new fa18ef aircraft ten of these requested aircraft would replace aircraft lost to class mishaps which occurred at rate of 20 per 100000 flight hours safety advocates believe that this mishap ra is too high and could be cut in half 10 per 100000 flig ht hours therefore funds would be provided for only half the replacement aircraft five to encourage the navy to reduce mishaps in the future an incentive option would be to transfer the funding requested for the remaining five replacement aircraft to the military aviation safety fund this option could also encounter resi stance some may oppose this approach because it appears to legitimize some leve l of mishaps in the fictitious scenario above cla ss mishap rate of 10 per 100000 flight hours is considered ok or even desirable this would be particul arly distasteful to zeromishap proponents others would oppose the strategy of linking aircraft procurement to low mishap ratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31571crs21 52 russell carollo 31 dead in military aviation accidents since oct 1 dayton daily news march 3 2002 53 aviation safety faa

believe that it would result in tangible loss of near term combat capability aircraft with guarantee of improved safety in the future application of such measures would likely be subject to comparison between the potential safety benefits gained and the operational capabilities lost or deferred safety technology many have argued that military aircraft do not tend to employ the same safety equipment as found in the civil sector and that the services tend to field safety equipment years after it is fielded in the civil world according to one aviation safety law professor military aviation lacks some of the essential safeguards of civil aviation52 the gao found that the faa mandated commercial aircraft employ two key safety tec hnologies ground proximity warning systems and traffic alert and collision avoidan ce systems decades before dod began employing similar systems53 both the defense science board nd governmentindustry commercial aviation safety team have drafted short lists of th safety technologies they believe would most improve safety in military and commercial aviation respectively the defense science board recommended dod more aggressively invest in ground collision avoidance systems flight data and cockpit video recorders tactile situational awareness system tsas nigh t vision devices and wind shear detection systems54 recently completed commercial aviation safety team study assessed 700 safety technologies over five years and recommended 16 high impact proposals in the areas where mishaps most frequently happen loss of control approach and landing and runway incursions55 the services offer several arguments for why military aircraft do not always field the same safety equipment as found on commercial aircraft lack of funds is one argument degradation of aircraft performance is nother however congress could evaluate the applicability of the new faa safety recommendations to military operations and weigh the soundness of service arguments with other issues discussed in this report for example can investments in safe ty today achieve cost savings in the futurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31571crs22 appendix i dod safety
