control however there has been recent debate about whether costinds influence while still considerable is in decline there are several factors that point to decrease in costinds authority since the early 1980s first as part of the overall trends of commercialization and decentralization in china costinds control over the defense industries has weakened dia note s that few of the larger defense production facilities and complexes have forme d their own corporations in recent years and apparently are seeking to operat somewhat independently of nationallevel organizations41 moreover some analysts believe that the state corporations retain their profits from civi lian sales and are not required to submit such revenues to costind it is uncertain what share of profits from military sales are returned to costind fo r defense research and development and production in any case chinese foreig n arms sales have dropped since the 1980s it can also be assumed that enterprises tend to underreport revenues to retain more of the profits and that different deals hav different profitsharing arrangements according to one study the pla is allowed to keep part of the profits from arms sales while costind and the general staf f department are supposed to direct how those funds will be spent the ministry of finance is also supposed to receive part of the revenue to add to chinas

can b expected to advocate the immediate needs of the pla for modern weapons perhaps over the needs of th defense industries to continue research and development of indigenous designs another indicator of caos priorities and chinas turn to greater use of foreign military technology is the decision announced in july 1997 to open the defens industrie s to foreign investors costind and the
