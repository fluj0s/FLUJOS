leadership conference seeking an injunction to delay the recall election until it could be conducted without the use of error prone punchcard balloting machines pl aintiffs argued that using error prone punchcard voting machines would vi olate the equal protection clause of the constitution because voters in counties that use punchcard machines would have comparatively lesser likelihood of having their votes counted than voters in counties that use other technologies on august 20 2003 the district court denied the injunction ninth circuit threejudge panel decision on september 15 2003 threejudge panel of the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed the district courts denial of preliminary injunction with respect to the california gubernatorial recall electi on and two ballot initiatives and ordered the election postponed in southwest voter registration ducation project v shelley the ninth circuit panel relying on the supreme courts decision in bush v gore2 found that california would face substantial risk that votes by fortyfour percent of the electorate would not be counted with the use of error prone punchcard voting machines in violation of the equal protection clause of the us constitution3 if the election took place as scheduled on october 7 20034 according to the court at least six california counties plan to employ punchcard voting technolog during the recall election angeles santa clara san diego sacr amento medocino and solano wh ich comprise 44 of the total electorate in the state in its decision the threejudge panel observe d that voting is fundamental right subject to equal protection guarant ees under the fourteenth amendment5 finding that the plaintiffs equal protection claim mirrors the claim that the supreme court analyzed in its 2000 decision in bush v gore the threejudge panel noted that the court in that case held that having once granted the right to vote on equal terms the state may not by later arbitrary and dispar ate treatment value one person s vote over that of another6 moreover the court found that the bush v gore decision was consiste nt with established supreme court precedent including its holding

that all qualified voters have constitutionally protected right to vote and to have their votes counted7 plaintiffs argued that the use of defective error prone voting systems creates substantial risk that votes will not be counted furthermore pl aintiffs maintained that the use of error prone voting systems in some counties while using more accurate systems in other counties denies equal protection of the laws by impermissibly diluting voting strength of the voters in counties using the fective systems persuaded by plaintiffs arguments the threejudge panel found that th weight afforded to votes in counties not using punchcard voting is greater than the we ight afforded to votes in counties using punchcard voting because higher proporti on of the votes from counties using punch card voting would not be counted therefore the court held the effect of using punchcard voting systems in some but not all counties is to discriminate on the basis of geographic residence creating classic voting rights equal protection claim8 invoking the supreme courts holding in bush that using different standards for counting votes in different counties throughout florida violated the equal protection clause the southwest voter registration threejudge court pane l concluded that using error prone voting equipment in some counties but not in others will result in votes being counted differently among the counties in california9 accordingly the court agreed with plaintiffs that the issuance of preliminary injunction was warranted and reversed the order of the district court ninth circuit banc decision shortly after the threejudge panel decisi on was issued the state of california and representatives from groups favoring the recall appealed on september 23 2003 an eleven member panel of the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit unanimously reversing the threejudge panel decision in southwest voter registration education project v shelley reinstated the october 7 2003 calif ornia gubernatorial recall election in the banc opinion the court found that if the ection were postponed because of the enormous resources already invested in the gubernatorial recall effort the state of california and its citizens would suffer material hardship10 specifically the court noted that funds had been expended for elec tion materials and that hundreds of thousands of absentee voters had already cast their ballots according to the court interference with impending elections is extraordinary and interference with an election after voting has begun is unprecedented furthermore investments of time money and the exercise of citizenship ri ghts cannot be returned in its opinion the banc court noted that it was required to grant substantial deference

that the district court did not buse its discretion or misinterpret the law in holding that plaintiffs had not established clear probability of success on the merits of their equal protection claim12 accordingly the elevenjudge panel exercised deference and did not address the substantive issues pres ented in this case such as whether the use of punchcard machines would violate the qual protection clause or the voting rights act13 acknowledging that the plaintiffs were l egitimately concerned that the use of the punchcard systems will deny the right to vote to some voters who must use that system and that there is doubt that the right to vote is fundamental the court nonetheless determined that at the current time it is merely speculative possibility that such denial of the right to vote will influence the result of the election14 according to the court there is significant dispute in the record as to the degree and significance of the disparity in error rates between the punch card machines and the types of equipment used in the other california counties cons equently the court c oncluded the plaintiffs had only shown possibility of success on the merits not strong likelihood which is the required standard for obtaining an injunction according to the court15 finally the court determined that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that plaintiffs will suffer hardship that outweighs the stake of the state of california and its citizens in having this election go forward as scheduled and as required by the california constitution16 shortly after the ninth circuit banc decision was issued plaintiffs issued statement indicating that they would not appeal the decision to the us supreme court because the recall election is only two weeks away and they want to avoid prolonging the uncertainty surrounding it some commentator s have predicted that there might be more litigation regarding this election following the october 7 2003 election if the vote on the recall and the two ballot initiatives is close17
