administration fda within th department of health and human services hhs regulates the safety of foods and the safety and effectiveness of drugs biologics eg vaccines and medical devices in order to help inform its activities fda solicits input from advisory committees which make recommendations on specific regulatory actions that the agency is contemplating1 typically the fda commissioner follows those recommendations but may choose to disregard them to be most credible and useful many say that committees need to minimize the possibility of or be free from conflicts of interest however others note that the most expert people in the field are often those involved directly or indirectly in the activities about which fda is seeking advice creating the potential for such conflicts in 2006 and 2007 the media reported that fda advisory committees were biased in favor of drug approval and that many committee members had conflicts of interest 2

term to include activities such as persons or their family members current or future employment trusteeship or directorship on its face it does not apply to activities such as stock ownership former employment or receipt of grant or contract however the scope of disqualifying financial interests under aapfi have been interpreted broadly in regulation regulations include any potential for gain or loss to the employee which would include interests such as stock ownership for example 5 cfr 2640103b

specifying their potential conflicts 5 cfr 2634903b3 the fdaaa re quires the secretary to review the reports when considering term appointment to an advisory committee the review is to be conducted so as to reduce the likelihood that general rules will have to be excepted via written determination written certification or waiversee exceptions to prohibitions below the fdaaa also requires that prior to an advisory committee meeting on particular matter each committee member disclose to the secretary financial interests in accordance with aapfi 208b section 208b articulates various exceptio ns to the general prohibition against acting with financial interest defined in 208a

eligibility as well as the potential for waivers and exemptions from the restrictions are defined in two locations one the fdaaa precludes member from participating on committee considering particular matter in which the member or their immediate family has financial interest that could be affected by the advice given to the secretary the second law aafpi applies broadly to government employees including fda advisory committee members it generally imposes criminal penalties on any person participating in an advisory committee who has conflicts based on certain financial interests such as current or future employment or on directorship role in an organization continued drugs and biologics 21 usc 355n

interest prohibitions one is aafpi 208b as note d above this section lists several exceptions to the financial interest restriction spelled out in 208a the fdaaa contains the second set of exceptions it specifies two exceptions to the general prohibition in addition because the fdaaa uses the aafpi 208a definition of financial interest it incorporates the 208b exceptions to the definition the following are the fdaaa and aafpi exceptions written determination that an interest is not substantial the aafpi 208b1 allows the government official responsible for committee members appointment to make in advance of the meeting written determination that an interest is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the members service to facilitate this member is required to advise the government official responsible for his or her appointment of the nature of the particular matter and make full disclosure of the financial interest written certification that the need for participation outweighs potential conflict the aafpi 208b3 provides that the official responsible for committee members appointment after review of the egarequired financial disclosure report certify in writing that the need for the individuals services outweighs the potential for conflict of interest waiver for essential expertise the fdaaa enables the secretary to grant waiver to permit member to participate despite financial interst if that persons expertise is essential to the committee the waiver may allow the person to participate as voting or nonvoting member interest exempted as too remote one additional exception is contained within the fdaaas general prohibition on waivers and participation it permits participation by person with an interest in particular matter if the interest has been exempted in regulations issued by the director of the office of government as too remote or inconsequential to affect the integrity of the members services this exemption is also articulated in aafpi 208b2 utilizing authority under this final exception aafpi 2082b2 the fda commissioner has issued blanket regulation making exemptions for category of interests as too remote because members representing particular interests eg representative of labor industry consumers or agriculture are included on advisory committees specifically for the purpose of representing these interests any financial interest covered by 18 usc 208a in the class which the member represents is irrelevant to the services which the government expects from them and thus is hereby exempted under 18 usc 208b as too remote and inconsequential to affect the integrity of their services 21 cfr 14802 in other words an industry representative on an advisory committee is allowed to have financial interest in that industry this exemption was made prior to the enactment of the fdaaa but should not be affected by the law

received one of three types of exceptions to the financial conflict prohibitions 1 fdaaa waivers for essen tial expertise 2 aafpi written determinations and 3 aafpi written certifications for fy2007 the secretary was required to determine the number and proportion of advisory members who received exceptions for fy2008 through fy2012 the secretary must reduce the proportion of excepted members by an additional 5 per year from the fy2007 number this limitation does not apply to financial interest exemptions made under 18 usc 208b2 or the parallel provisions in the fdaaa

certifications and waivers but not 208b2 exemptions except for those exempted from disclosure under the freedom of information act of 1974 5 usc 522 it requires the secretary to submit annual reports regarding advisory committee membership and conflictofinterest waivers it also requires the secretary to review and update fda conflictofinterest guidance not less than once every five years fda regulations that precede the fdaaa generally specify that the agency will make the fullest possible disclosure of records to the public consistent with the privacy rights of individuals the property rights of persons in trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information and the need for the agency to promote frank internal policy deliberations and to pursue its regulatory activities without disruption 21 cfr 2020 fda has articulated policy of disclosing copies of aafpi waiver determinations except where foreseeable harm would be caused by disclosure 6

fdaaa the fda took several actions to implement and in some cases exceed the terms of the fdaaa according to the agency its policies on advisory committees continue to be informed by new studies on conflicts of interest fda asked consultant eastern research group to study 16 recent advisory committees the report highlighted the difficulty of assembling highly qualified experts who were free of conflicts and found that those who had received waivers appeared to be significantly more qualified than those who had not received waivers 7 6 draft guidance on disclosure of conflicts of interest
