hansen jhansengissnasagov michael oppenheimer omichaelprincetonedu thanks kevin yes its matter of what question one is asking to argue that the observed global mean temperature anomalies of the past decade falsifies the model projections of global mean temperature change as contrarians have been fond of claiming is clearly wrong but that doesnt mean we can explain exactly whats going on there is always the danger of falling bit into the we dont know everything so we know nothing fallacy hence i wanted to try to clarify where we all agree and where there may be disagreement mike on oct 14 2009 at 1036 am kevin trenberth wrote mike here are some of the issues as i see them saying it is natural variability is not an explanation what are the physical processes where did the heat go we know there is build up of ocean heat prior to nino and discharge and sfc t warming during late stages of nino but is the observing system sufficient to track it quite aside from the changes in the ocean we know there are major changes in the storm tracks and teleconnections with enso and there is lot more rain on land during nina more drought in nino so how does the albedo change overall changes in cloud at the very least the extra rain on land means lot more heat goes into evaporation rather than raising temperatures and so that keeps land temps down and should generate cloud but the resulting evaporative cooling means the heat goes into atmosphere and should be radiated to space so we should be able to track it with ceres data the ceres data are unfortunately wonting and so too are the cloud data the ocean data are also lacking although some of that may be related to the ocean current changes and burying heat at depth where it is not picked up if it is sequestered at depth then it comes back to haunt us later and so we should know about it kevin michael mann wrote kevin thats an interesting point as the plot from gavin i sent shows we can easily account for the observed surface cooling in terms of the natural variability seen in the cmip3 ensemble ie the observed cold dip falls well within it so in that sense we can explain it but this raises the interesting question is there something going on here w the energy radiation budget which is inconsistent with the modes of internal variability that leads to similar temporary cooling periods within the models im not sure that this has been addressedhas it m on oct 14 2009 at 1017 am kevin trenberth wrote hi tom how come you do not agree with statement that says we are where close to knowing where energy is going or whether clouds are changing to make the planet brighter we are not close to balancing the energy budget the fact that we can not account for what is happening in the climate system makes any consideration of geoengineering quite hopeless as we will never be able to tell if it is successful or not it is travesty kevin tom wigley wrote dear all at the risk of overload here are some notes of mine on the recent lack of warming i look at this in two ways the first is to look at the difference between the observed and expected anthropogenic trend relative to the pdf for unforced variability the second is to remove enso volcanoes and tsi variations from the observed data both methods show that what we are seeing is not unusual the second method leaves significant warming over the past decade these sums complement kevins energy work kevin says the fact is that we cant account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is travesty that we cant i do not agree with this tom kevin trenberth wrote hi all well i have my own article on where the heck is global warming we are asking that here in boulder where we have broken records the past two days for the coldest days on record we had 4 inches of snow the high the last 2 days was below 30f and the normal is 69f and it smashed the previous records for these days by 10f the low was about 18f and also record low well below the previous record low this is january weather see the rockies baseball playoff game was canceled on saturday and then played last night in below freezing weather trenberth k 2009 an imperative for

moment and it is travesty that we cant the ceres data published in the august bams 09 supplement on 2008 shows there should be even more warming but the data are surely wrong our observing system is inadequate that said there is lot of nonsense about the pdo people like cpc are tracking pdo on monthly basis but it is highly correlated with enso most of what they are seeing is the change in enso not real pdo it surely isnt decadal the pdo is already reversing with the switch to nino the pdo index became positive in september for first time since sept 2007 see

since climate is usually richard blacks beat at bbc and he does great job from what i can tell this guy was formerly weather person at the met office we may do something about this on realclimate but meanwhile it might be appropriate for the met office to have say about this i might ask richard black whats up here mike on oct 12 2009 at 232 am stephen h schneider wrote hi all any of you want to explain decadal natural variability and signal to noise and sampling errors to this new ipcc lead author from the bbc as we enter an nino year and as soon as the sunspots get over their temporarypresumedvacation worth few tenths of watt per meter squared reduced forcing there will likely be another dramatic upward spike like 19922000 i heard someonemike schlesinger maybewas willing to bet alot of money on it happening in next 5 years meanwhile the past 10 years of global mean temperature trend stasis still saw what 9 of the warmest in reconstructed 1000 year record and greenland
