specialist in russian affairs foreign affairs and national defense division summary russian president yeltsins dismissal of premier kirienko and his nomination of former premier chernomyrdin mark an intensification of political turmoil this was triggered by financial crisis and underlying economic depression these political and economic developments have serious implications for russias stability the postyeltsin succession and us interests in and policy toward russia this report will be updated if warranted by developments in russia the issues1 yeltsins reshuffle of the government on august 23 1998 russian president boris yeltsin dismissed premier sergei kirienko and his government and designated former premier viktor chernomyrdin to succeed him the russian duma has one week to either confirm or reject chernomyrdins nomination chernomyrdin is negotiating with legislators and prospective cabinet ministers this political turmoil the latest in series of unsettling developments in russia heightens concerns about russias political economic and social stability and reform prospects russias financial crisis kirienkos dismissal was triggered by severe financial crisis which led his government to announce facto 50 devaluation of the ruble and temporary suspension of repayment of and restructuring of commercial and government debt which amounted to technical default on billions of dollars of foreign debts the devaluation and suspension of repayments were precipitated by the governments inability to service its rapidly growing domestic and foreign debt and by the immediate prospect of the collapse of the banking system despite 226 billion imfled bailout loan agreement in july 1998 the causes of russias financial crisis predate kirienkos brief tenure as head of 1

the library of congress crs2 government and can be traced to chernomyrdins premiership december 1992 to march 1998 and ultimately to yeltsin by many accounts the yeltsin team fears that devaluation of the ruble and the price inflation that is expected to follow will be seen by the public as negating the most significant economic achievements of the regime under whose stewardship the gdp has contracted by about 50 accompanied by economic distress worse than the great depression of the 1930s in the united states for most of the russian population to many observers dismissing kirienko appears to be an attempt to shift responsibility for the financial crisis to the expremier the kirienko government had been hailed by the clinton administration as the most competent and reformoriented russian government in years some observers expect chernomyrdin to take more statist approach possibly slowing russias economic transition to functioning market system usrussian summit2 in july 1998 the clinton administration agreed to clintonyeltsin summit meeting in moscow now scheduled for september 13 following kirienkos dismissal administration spokesmen announced that the summit would be held as scheduled some critics of the administration question the wisdom of proceeding with the summit amidst such political and economic uncertainty in moscow others argue that cancellation or postponement might be seen as us vote of noconfidence in the russian government further undermining its parlous economic situation yeltsins presidency and the prospects for reform economic issues will undoubtedly be high on the summit agenda political turmoil the yeltsin regime seems to lurch periodically from one political crisis to the next for example during the 1996 presidential election campaign yeltsins sudden alliance with gen aleksandr lebed helped bring victory yeltsins reelection was followed by his prolonged illness and an open succession struggle in october 1996 yeltsin fired lebed in march 1997 yeltsins appointment of the young reformers anatoly chubais and boris nemstov seemed to eclipse chernomyrdin in the winter of 19971998 yeltsin backed chernomyrdins downgrading of chubais and nemstov in march 1998 yeltsin amazed observers by dismissing chernomyrdin and the entire government and provoking bitter confrontation with the duma by insisting on the appointment of the littleknown 35yearold technocrat kirienko as premier five months later amid deepening financial and economic crisis yeltsin fired kirienko and reappointed chernomyrdin in firing chernomyrdin in march yeltsin cited chronic economic failure and the need for more dynamic team to accelerate economic reform and revival many however believe that yeltsin was troubled by chernomyrdins open assumption of the role of yeltsins successor and needed scapegoat for past economic failures3 yeltsin further humiliated 2 see crs report 98704 usrussia summit september 13 1998 preview august 24 1998 3 kremlin spokesmen pointedly left open the option of third term for yeltsin despite the constitutional limit of two terms for the president yeltsin supporters argued that since his first continued crs3 chernomyrdin by publicly criticizing the expremiers announcement of his candidacy for president in 2000 with political base of his own kirienko was expected to be dependent upon and obedient to yeltsin kirienko with yeltsins approval assembled westernoriented economic team and pursued economic policies supported by the clinton administration the g7 and the imf but economic conditions and the governments and yeltsins approval ratings continued to deteriorate strikes and labor protests including blocking major railway lines grew in frequency as did public calls for yeltsins resignation in june the duma began formal impeachment proceedings against yeltsin4 after four months in power russias financial crisis and the ruble devaluation and debt rescheduling that yeltsin approved brought kirienko down on friday august 14 yeltsin assured the public in televised statement that the ruble would not be devalued devaluation which few days earlier he had said would negate the regimes most hardwon economic accomplishments was not possibility on monday morning august 17 facto devaluation was announced the parliamentary opposition the news media and the public reacted with ridicule and scorn one popular refrain was that yeltsin and the government had devalued not only the ruble but themselves yeltsins public approval ratings as low as 4 before these events fell to near zero yeltsin said little in public for week then on august 23 he made terse announcement of kirienkos dismissal and chernomyrdins nomination some believe that in firing kirienko yeltsin sought to shift responsibility for the politically unpopular devaluation to the former premier such scapegoating has been common yeltsin tactic in the past variation on this theme has it that yeltsin is ill politically out of touch and was manipulated or forced into dumping kirienko by his kremlin coterie another theory is that kirienko was brought down by banking oligarchs who convinced yeltsin through his daughter and his chief of staff to sack the premier who was resisting their plan for government bailout of their endangered banks some see this pattern of recurrent crises as direct result of yeltsins leadership style distancing himself not only from daytoday governance but from major policy decisions becoming personally engaged only at times of crisis the constitution shaped by and for yeltsin tips the political balance overwhelmingly toward the president but yeltsin has repeatedly shown himself either unwilling or unable to exercise that authority on routine basis he has also consistently refused to allow the emergence of powerful subordinate who could wield power effectively he may view such development as threat to his power in this view yeltsin seems to be motivated above all by personal willtopower the result has been ineffective leadership characterized by rivalries among competing subordinates conflicting policies and sometimes political paralysis while some admire yeltsins tactical acumen his strategic position seems greatly eroded the great game 3 continued term began under the old soviet constitution it did not count under russias new constitution 4 the dumas action may be mainly symbolic yeltsins constitution makes impeaching the president extremely difficult crs4 there is another confusing dimension to russias political turmoil what appears on the surface to be normal competition among politicians and parties factions and movements of varying ideological hues is believed by some to mask deeper underlying contest the great game in this view party politics and the purported ideological differences among political rivals is largely charade concealing venal competition among rival elites to seize ownership of vast previously stateowned assets proponents of this interpretation see privatization as combination of outright theft and the biggest fire sale in history rival elites are seen as using political power to carve out economic empires for themselves the stakes are so immense that most ordinary political considerations even on national security issues are eclipsed by the great game chernomyrdin the former head of the giant still partly stateowned gas monopoly gazprom is widely believed to be major player in this game he is strongly and openly backed by one of the most aggressive and outspoken financial oligarchs boris berezovskii some suggest that the replacement of the technocrat kirienko by the player chernomyrdin may be partly manifestation of the great game economic and financial crises the russian financial crisis that triggered kirienkos dismissal has many causes its underlying sources are discussed elsewhere5 most analysts agree that the immediate crisis was precipitated by russias inability to collect sufficient tax revenue mountain of commercial and government debt that became literally unsustainable asias economic troubles and the drop in world oil prices many of these factors are interrelated most economic analysts agree that the persistent distress in many asian economies especially among prominent emerging markets caused investors to withdraw funds precipitously from other emerging markets including russia the russian securities market which had the worlds highest growth rate in 1997 has lost about 80 of its value in 1998 as foreign and domestic capital fled at the same time the price of oil and gas russias main exports and hardcurrency earners has fallen sharply russian oil was selling for less than 12 per barrel in august 1998 russian extraction costs are estimated to be about 15 per barrel asias economic problems reduced world demand for oil and helped drive down prices reduced oil and gas revenues in russia in turn had big negative impact on the russian securities market which is relatively small and heavily weighted toward the energy sector since the collapse of the soviet union russia has been plagued by chronic shortfalls in tax collection among the reasons for this are chaotic tax laws an inefficient and corrupt tax service culture of personal and corporate tax evasion the growth of barter and debt swaps in commercial exchanges and the decline in profits in the energy sector since the disastrous 2500 inflation in 1992 when prices were decontrolled moscow prodded by the g7 and the imf has generally followed monetarist course that emphasized stabilizing the ruble and controlling inflation which was down to about 8 by mid1998 these monetarist policies combined with continued subsidies to lossmaking enterprises 5 for detailed analysis of the russian economic situation see crs reports 971013 russian economic conditions and reform november 21 1997 and 98578 russian financial crisis an analysis of trends causes and implications updated july 27 1998 crs5 and inadequate tax collection help explain russias habitual problem of wage and pension arrears and made russia highly dependent on imf aid but the painful expedient of delaying wage and pension payments was not sufficient to close the budget deficit gap determined to avoid inflationary currency emissions the government relied heavily on borrowing especially domestic borrowing via shortterm treasury bills called gkos large budget deficits and political instability forced the government to offer high interest rates typically 3050 to attract buyers even for 90day gkos the government was able to pay off these notes with the help of funds acquired from the sale of new treasury bills supplemented by loans from the imf and other foreign governmental and commercial lenders as long as the government continued to meet its obligations the gkos were an attractive and for many russian bankers an irresistible investment as the asian economic crisis falling oil prices the russian stock markets decline and continued political instability fed investors anxiety gko rates shot up to 150 the july 21 announcement of 226 billion imfled loan package only calmed the markets for few weeks6 by august nearly 40 of budget expenditure went to debt service this alarming development drove interest rates still higher resulting in an unsustainable debt spiral that finally forced kirienko to resort to ruble devaluation and suspension of payment on government and commercial debts the financial crisis however is not over russian banks including many large commercial banks borrowed heavily to invest in gkos lot of this borrowing was from foreign lenders now incautious russian banks find themselves with large hard currency debts secured by devalued rubles most experts predict widespread bank failures absent big government bailout the deputy director of the russian central bank said that even some of russias largest commercial banks were likely to go under some fear wholesale collapse of the banking system averting this is one of chernomyrdins top priorities others say the government must use its scarce resources to meet foreign debt obligations or risk losing future foreign investment implications the political and economic turmoil in russia has serious implications for russia and the united states it is as yet unclear whether or under what conditions the duma will confirm chernomyrdin or what the makeup and policies of chernomyrdin government might be russian news media report that chernomyrdin has agreed to form coalition government representing the main duma factions communists and ultranationalists are in the majority this is an old duma demand that yeltsin has previously ignored recent political and economic turmoil casts shadow over yeltsins future the post yeltsin succession and beyond that over russias political stability many commentators argue that yeltsin is gravely wounded has chance of winning reelection in 2000 and may be forced to resign or to continue as figurhead others caution not to underestimate yeltsins willtopower or his ability to overcome seemingly hopeless odds yeltsins televised nomination of chernomyrdin on august 24 referred to the necessity of ensuring 6 the initial 48 billion infusion was almost entirely expended by the russian central bank in 23 weeks of defending the ruble crs6 the succession of power in 2000 while chernomyrdin may now be yeltsins chosen successor he is regarded as lackluster leader and poor campaigner who has never won an election other prominent presidential aspirants are yuri luzhkov the mayor of moscow aleksandr lebed now governor of the krasnoyarsk region and gennady zyuganov head of the communist party most observers agree that russias democratic reformers have been further discredited and weakened politically some critics of us policy toward russia charge that it is too closely linked to yeltsin and is seen by ordinary russians as endorsing yeltsin and the unpopular economic policies that they blame for leading the country to ruin defenders of us policy reply that yeltsin has steered russia on an essentially correct though painful course russias current turmoil raises anew the question of whether it serves us interests to have weakened president yeltsin remain in office at least through 2000 at the possible cost of prolonged political and economic instability the converse might be stronger and more stable though perhaps more authoritarian and nationalist russia with different hand on the helm these are not the only possible outcomes but it seems useful to look at some national security implications of these two commonly juxtaposed alternatives weak and unstable russia may be less likely to pose an aggressive military threat to its neighbors russian conventional military capability already greatly diminished might continue to deteriorate on the other hand instability probably heightens the risk of various loosenuke scenarios and increases the probability of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction wmd also continued political and economic instability increases the risk of some wrenching upheaval with possibly violent or radical outcomes more stable though more authoritarian and nationalistic russia might be more effective in countering wmd proliferation but it might also be inclined toward more assertive possibly imperialistic policies especially toward some of the other former soviet states its ability to do so effectively however and to revive its armed forces would depend in large part on its economic status most experts agree that any realistic plan for rapid russian economic recovery requires low defense burden hence even an authoritarian and nationalistic russia might not be able to rapidly reconstitute its armed forces7 long term threat of course would be distinct possibility finally foreign banks and governments have an immediate economic interest in what the new government will do about debt rescheduling and repayment on august 17 kirienko suspended repayment for 90 days on an estimated 40 billion in treasury bills and bonds of which 11 billion is held by foreigners coming due by the end of 1999 the new government plan which would reduce russias debt and shift some of the cost to foreign investors calls for creditors to exchange their notes for new obligations that will offer longer term of repayment andor substantially lower interest rates this threatens foreign investors in russian bonds with heavy losses german lenders are believed to be most heavily exposed factor that could weigh against the reelection of chancellor helmut kohl in the german national election on september 27 1998 7 crs report 97820 russian
