collected scan eagle live video feed imagery quality video quality fairtogood today however later in the evening it started freezing for about five minutes at time fairly regularly summary successes good fmv exploitation great teamwork with china lake resulted in positive outcome in strike serial for vips picte remains operational and recording 30second clips to local directory nice to have telemetry metadata particularly n arrow on the actual live feed thanks for pushing that lesson learned ias dont like to game reports particularly when everyone in the enterprise can see the fmv too we understand the requirements for this today although the confusion between the game the scenario and tf lancers sa was difficult to fight through where help is needed still need to discuss cgsraptor sensor m odel awaiting guidance from china lake via bill craig or sqn ldr reeves request clarification as to how individual platform and sensor nomenclatures can be easily identified on the cl cfe ipl we think it is difficult to understand request msr between cp101 and cp102 is changed on ge overlay from opal to topaz is it possible to have mgrs georef data available on ge additional comments overall good shift we feel our contribution has helped paint positiv picture of ec08 and has supported all the appropriate event objectives intend to burn astor nitf to cd for test ingest into jaric ipl awaiting feedback digby has stood down from the event ground truth data collection location echo range pocs kate hollister personnel 1 personnel with issues to report activities summary of planned activities instrumented 18 ec08 vehicles with comm ercial gps units that recorded data downloaded data and converted to file formats for plain text googleearth falconview dotmatrix mtix and matlab collected total traffic counts for 4 msr regions with metrocount traffic tubes logged significant radio traffic requested detailed weather data for the exercise period from the china lake weather group summary successes collected gps track data for all ec08 blufor and opfor vehicles collected traffic count data additional comments lincoln laboratory has recorded gps track data 3s interval for all ec08 vehicles on every mission date since 71408 these data will be available in august 2008 along with supporting documentation upon request ema il requests and contact information to kate

hangar on echo range cdr crissman and bill roeting of nps briefed capt hoppa on jbaiics ec08 efforts capt hoppa focused on the implications of the prc117g falcon iii radio and spoke with john wise of harris at length capt hoppa was pleased to see the prc117g was jtrs joint tactical radio system compliant capt hoppa also showed interest in the scan eagle uas an asset her was involved with while the n2 at c2f and was briefed by mark laville of boeing summary success successfully passed clipped imagestarget annotations from scan eagle fmv to the cfe ctp the images were available by clicking on t he googleearth icon as well as overlaid on the googleearth background this involved converting the cot image message to nitf 21 passing the nitf file through the rhsg to cfe reconstructing cot image ssage from the nitf file and then sending it to the googleearth and falconview ctp for display lesson learned today beginning at 1300 paci fic time shotspotter conducted livefire event at charlie airfield cop reno that ki cked off disparate isr sensor cueing event the vignette was intended to convert shots potter detection to link16 track and to track squirter from an opfor attack on charlie airfield engaging sigint gmti and eo fmv for iw wide area search and localization the vignette went south when there was available sigint platform on station and the available airborne gmti platform the sentinel r1astor checked off station after the vignette began late as result the jmsmtoc relied on scan eagle to locate and identify the target which was subsequently engaged by simulated 155mm artillery fire additionally for as yet unknown reasons the shotspotter detection did not show up in the cop as link16 track on more positive note boeings developmental multitarget track mtt was able to develop pixel track first during ec08 on the squirter but the system broke lock when the vehicle made sharp highspeed turn where help is needed confirmed sensor web sensor position messages are now passed through the rhsg to the cfe to achieve this jbaiic must correct the nsorweb cot message so it complies with the cot xml message format however nitfs generated from sensorweb images are not passing through the rhsg to cfe because the original xml message which is wr itten in the text segm ent of the nitf file is not compliant with the cot xml schema
