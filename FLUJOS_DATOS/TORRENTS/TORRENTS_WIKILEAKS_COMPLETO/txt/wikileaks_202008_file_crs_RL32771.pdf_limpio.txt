families and individuals through the medicaid and schi p programs the proposal would allow eligibility and benefit changes to be accomplished without the research and demonstration waiver approvals that are required under current law while specifics on the proposal are not available hhs st ates that the proposal will build on the schip success in providing acute care to families and current efforts through number of means including the use of public health programs such as medicaid and schip and tax credits to decrease the number of uninsured individuals neither hhs nor cbo included cost estimate for this proposal although the hhs description of the proposal states that additional federal funds would be required background one of the federal requirements for state medicaid programs is that generally all services must be provided to all enrollees in the program for example for many enrollees state cannot differentiate between the services provided based on class of eligibility or geography to reduce or expand certain benefits state must obtain waiver approved by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms limiting the impact of one or more of the federal requirements

in fy2006 and 755 million over the fy2006fy2010 period background currently all states except arizona have medicaid home and communitybased waivers under section 1915c of the social security act these waivers allow states to provide broad range of home and communitybased services to individuals who would otherwise be in certain types of institutions eg nursing facility for example services could include personal assistance respite and home modifications as part of the waiver states can define what services will be offered and can limit the number of individuals who can participate many states have waiting lists for these services though it varies by state on average the federal government covers 57 of the cost of medicaid home and communitybased services states cover the remaining expenditures this proposal intends to offe r states financial incentive to expand the number of individuals who can receive home and communitybased services by covering 100 of the service expenditure

would otherwise be in certain types of institutions including hospital nursing facility or intermediate care facility for individuals with mental retardation under current law section 1915c waivers can not be developed for children who would otherwise be in psychiatric residential treatment facilities as result states have limited ability to cover medicaid home and communitybased waiver services

an individual with significant disability can be timeintensive and highly stressful respite care reduces primary caregiver burnout that can lead to the in stitutionalization of the individual with the

the social security act provides continued medicaid coverage for recipients of the supplemental security income ssi program when their earnings become too high to allow for an ssi cash payment however the continued eligibility for medicaid does not extend to persons spouse since spouses earnings are considered in determining eligibility for medicaid an individual could lose eligibility for medicaid due to the earnings of his or her spouse this proposal would extend the medicaid eligibility for both the individual with disability and his or her spouse reports for additional information see crs report rl31413 medicaid eligibility for the aged and disabled by julie stoneaxelrad presumptive eligibility proposal the presidents fy2006 budget would allow states to provide presumptive eligibility for individuals who are discharged from hospitals and who would be eligible for care in nursing hom but who could also be served in the community with home care and other serv ices hhs estimates that the proposal would have cost impact in fy2006 or over the fy2006fy2010 period cbo did not estimate the cost of this proposal background current law allows presumptive eligibility for certain groups of children and women the federal and state governments share the cost of care provided to those persons f ound ineligible for medicaid as one means of decreasing nursing home admissions and improving access to home and communitybased services many policymakers state offi cials constituency groups and provider organizations have suggested that there is need to improve and expedite the way in which medicaids financial eligibility is determined currently almost half of medicaids nursing home residents are admitted directly after discharge from hospital5 once they apply medicaid rules require states to make financial eligibility determinations within 45 da ys of the medicaid applica tion date and within 90 dayshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32771crs6 6 medicaids home and communitybased services waiver program authorized under section 1915c of the social security act is the major way the federal government finances home and communitybased longterm care services for persons with disabilities section 1915c of the medicaid statute allows the secretar of the department of health and human services dhhs to waive certain requirements to allow states to cover wide range of home and communitybased services to persons who otherwise would need institutional care enacted in 1981 it was designed to alter the bias in the medicaid program that favored institutional care over care in homebased settingsfor persons needing disability determin ation once residing in nursing home individuals often find it difficult to reesta blish residency in home and community based setting in general nursing homes are likely to admit individuals discharged from hospitals while their medicaid applicati ons are pending for persons enrolled in medicare this initial stay is often covered by medicare medicare requires prior hospitalization of at least three days as the first condition of eligibility for its nursing home benefit once residing in nursing home staff genera lly conduct financial assessments of the resident to evaluate the ability to pay privately or need to apply to medicaid for coverage of the continuing longterm care needs in addition for persons determined to be medicaid eligible federal rules allow nursing homes to bill medicaid retroactively for costs incurred be tween the application date and the date of enrollment in the program for persons determined to be ineligible nursing homes may charge residents for these services either the resident or family would be expected to pay home and communitybased service pr oviders on the other hand may not be willing to take the financial risk that person they serve will ultimately be ineligible for medicaid in addition to an eligibility determination medicaid payment for home and communitybased services is also dependent on an individuals enrollment in home and communitybased waiver prog ram established unde r section 1915c of the social security act6 and many states have enrollment caps and waiting lists for these programs uncertainty about medicai d eligibility and waiv er enrollment often leads home and communitybased providers to refuse referrals for individuals with pending medicaid applications allowing for presumptive eligibility for persons discharged from hospitals who wish to go into home and communitybased services may make it easier for these providers to accept such referrals this might improve access to home and communitybased services and reduce reliance on nursing homes reports currently other crs re ports address this topic other medicaid legislative proposals the presidents fy2006 budget proposals fo r medicaid include expansions to the vaccines for children vfc program temporary medical assistance and medicare premium assistance in addition there are proposals to reduce the federal spending on medicaid through changes relate d to provider taxes imposed by stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32771crs7 claiming of administrative expenses by

tma th rough september of 2006 in addition it would simplify eligibility for tma benefits by giving states the option to offer 12 months of continuous tma coverage to eligible participan ts to waive income reporting requirements for benefi ciaries and to allow states that offer medicaid to children and families up to 185 of pove rty to waive the tma requirements altogether hhs estimates that this proposal would cost 560 million in fy2006 only cbo estimates that the proposal would cost 28 million in fy2005 542 million in fy2006 and 11 billion over the fy2005fy2010 period background states are required to offer tma to certain individuals receiving medicaid under section 1931 of the social security act the law permanently requires four months of tma for families losing medicaid eligibility due to increased child or spousal support co llections it also permanently requires four months of tma for families losing medicaid eligibility due to an increase in earned income or hours of employment in 1988 congress expanded tma so that states must continue providing medicaid for six months to families that were receiving medicaid under section 1931 in at l east three of the last six months the extended tma coverage is available to individuals and their families who would otherwise have lost such assistance due to increased work hours increased earnings of the caretaker relative or the loss of one of the timelimited earned income disregards in addition states are require d to extend medicaid coverage for second six months to families that were covered during the entire first sixmonth tma period and whose earnings are below 185 of poverty the provision authorizing tma receipt for up to 12 months is due to sunset at the end of june 2005 although this date has been repeatedly extended if the provision authorizing 12month tma is not extended beyond june 2005 states will still be required to provide four months of tma to families that lose medicaid eligibility due

grady longterm care insurance partnership program proposal the presidents fy2006 budget proposes to promote the purchase of longterm care ltc insurance by eliminating the federal legislative ban on new longterm care partnership programs to llow any state in the nation the option of implementing ltc insurance partnership program hhs estimates that the proposal would have cost impact in fy2006 or over the fy2006fy2010 period cbo estimates that the proposal would ve cost impact in fy2006 but would cost 15 million over the fy2006fy2010 periodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32771crs8 background under medicaids ltc insuran ce partnership program persons who have exhausted or used at least some of the benefits of private longterm care insurance policy may access medicaid without having to meet the same means testing requirements as other groups of medicaid eligibles medicaid law allows four states california connecticut indiana and new york to operate partnership programs these states disregard some or all the assets of applicants who apply to medicaid after using their private ltc insurance benefits and exempt these assets from estate recovery after the beneficiary has died there are federal requirements concerning the operation of these programs through the promise of medicaid asset protection the partnership program is designed to encourage people to purchase private ltc insurance when they might not otherwise do so it is also intende d to result in savings both to medicaid by delaying or preventing spenddown to medicaid eligibility and to individuals by having them rely on insurance policies to cover ltc expenditures that would otherwise be paid by personal income or savings only limited empirical data exists to demonstrate whether the asset protecti on promised under the partnership program is sufficient and necessary incentive to encourage the purchase of policies by persons who would not otherwise purchase them based on the available data it is reasonable to conclude that for some the promise of medicaid sset protection plays significant role in the decision to purchas partnership policy while for others it plays smaller role regardless the part nership program allows for asset protection for persons who eventually seek medica id after exhausting their private ltc insurance benefits and these assets are not available to defray medicaid expenditures owning ltc insurance policy likely prevents spenddown to medicaid eligibility for some persons who liv long enough to actually use longterm care services it likely delays eligibility for others and probably has little impact on still others reports for more information on the lt c insurance partnership including data on participati on and policies sold see crs report rl32610 medicaids

fy2006fy2010 period cbo did not estimate the proposal due to lack of details about the proposalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32771crs10 background under medicaid law the fede ral and state governments share in the cost of medicaid the statespecific matching rate for benefits is determined by formula set in law that establishes higher matching rates for states with low per capita income levels compared to the nati onal average and vice versa for states with high per capita income levels the fe deral government pays at least 50 of medicaid costs and the federal share can be as high as 83 statutory upper boundary states can finance up to 60 of the state share of medicaid costs with local government funds also the state share cannot be comprised of any federal dollars in some cases through what are called intergovernmental transfers igts states have required local government pr oviders eg countyrun nursing homes or municipal hospitals to transfer back to the state some or all of the federal medicaid funds originally paid to those providers that exceed the usual medicaid payment rate states may use these transferred funds for medicaid or for other purposes such as to fill state budget gaps for other programs or to draw down additi onal federal medicaid dollars the 108th congress held hearings on this issue and both gao and the oig have recommended that these state practices be halted see below for related discussion on upper payment limits reports intergovernmental transfers are discussed in various contexts in several crs reports including crs report rl31021

presidents fy2006 budget proposes to change the permissible upper payment limit for services delivered by local government providers eg countyrun nursing homes or municipal hospitals from the medicare payment rate to more than the cost of providing services the fy2006 budget documents do not provide specific definition for cost of providing services hhs estimates that the proposal would have cost impact in fy2006 and save 12 billion over the fy2006fy2010 period cbo did not estimate th proposal due to lack of details about the proposal background aggregate medicaid payments to specific groups of providers eg hospitals and nursing facilities cannot exceed reasonable estimate of what would have been paid under medicare pa yment principles this is called the medicaid upper payment limit upl rule in many states medicare payment rates for hospital and nursing home care are high er than corresponding medicaid payment rates the upl based on medicare payment principles has enabled some states to draw down additional federal dollars that exceed what they would have received based on medicaid payment rates these additional funds are paid to government providers which are sometimes required by states to transfer all or portion of the extra payments received ie some or all of the difference between the medicare and medicaid payment rates back to the state through an intergovernmental transfer see above instead of financing more or improved medicaid services in some caseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32771crs11 states have used the additi onal federal dollars for nonhea lth services or to make up part of the state share of medicaid costs to draw do wn another round of federal dollars during 20002002 congress and th clinton and bush administrations revised upl rules by changing permissibl accounting methods used to claim federal matching payments these changes significantly reduced the excess federal dollars states received under approved upl plans that involved igts however these reforms did not eliminate all such excess payments because changes were made to the medicaid upl standard which remains tied to the medicare payment rate nor to federal statute or re gulations

25 of the state or nonfederal share of medicaid expenditures and the state cannot provide guarantee to the providers that the taxes will be returned to them however there is safe harbor if the taxes returned to provider are less than 6 of the providers revenues the prohibition on guaranteeing the return of tax funds is not violated as resu lt state could impose provi der tax of 6 of revenues
