1239 propose extending the nmtc through 2013 and hr 3907 proposes permanent extension of the nmtc the following policy considerations could be pertinent to any consideration of these bills the nmtc is primarily intended to encourage priv ate capital investment in eligible lowincome communities however the source of the investment funds has implications for the effectiveness of the program in achieving its objective from an economic perspective the impact of the nmtc would be greatest in the case where the investment represents new investment in the us economy that would not have occurred in the abse nce of the program conversely the impact of the nmtc is diminished to the extent the tax cr edit is applied to investment that would have otherwise occurred or been funded by shift in investment from more productive alternatives 13 to date only one study has empirically assessed the question of whether nmtc investment is funded through shifted investment or whether it represents new investment finding mixed results 14 although important understanding the source of nm tc investments alone is not sufficient to determine the effectiveness of the nmtc comprehensive review of the program would require an accounting of both the social and economic costs and benefits of the nmtc an undertaking which may pose considerable challenges for example this would include examining the efficiency and opportunity costs of the nmtc investments while comprehensive accounting of the nmtc benefits would need to identify and value spillovers such as its effect on neighboring businesses and communities the cdfi fund is working with contractor on comprehensive review of the nmtc which may include an assessment of the effectiveness of the nmtc finally the nmtc is one of several programs designed to improve conditions in lowincome communities in 2004 assessment of the nmtc the office of management and budget noted that the goal of the nmtc overlaps that of several other tax credits and numerous programs administered by the departments of h ousing and urban development and commerce 15 given this overlap and the desire to target federal funds to their most productive uses it follows that 11 hr 2075 has been referred to the house committee on ways and means and s 1239 has been referred to the senate finance committee 12 hr 3907 has been referred to the house committee on ways and means 13 however from policy perspective the desire to minimize the distortion of investment choice caused by the nmtc is usually balanced against other objectives such as equity 14 us government accountability office tax policy new markets tax credit appears to increase investment by investors in lowin come communities but opportunities exist to better monitor compliance gao07296
