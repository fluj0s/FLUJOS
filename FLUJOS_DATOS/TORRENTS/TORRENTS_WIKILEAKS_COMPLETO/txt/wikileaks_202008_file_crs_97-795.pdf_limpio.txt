court on june 25 1997 held the1 religious freedom restoration act rfra to be unconstitutional as applied to the states congress enacted rfra in 1993 in response to an earlier supreme cour t decision employment division oregon department of human resources v smith2 which had construed the free exercise clause of the first amendment to prohibit only governm ent action which intentionally burdens the exercise of religion in rfr congress sought to broaden the legal protection afforded religious exercise b prohibiting government action that has the effect of substantially burdening religiou s practice as well but in boerne the court held that congress lacks the power under 5 of the fourteenth amendment to apply rfra to the states the clinton administration maintains that rfra continues to be valid for th federal govern ment and at least one federal appellate court has sustained that position in addition in the 105 congress bills were i ntroduced in both the house and the senateth to

rfras current legal status and congressional efforts to respond to boerne legislative and political history the smith decision as noted the genesis of rfra lay in the supreme court s decision in employment division oregon department of human resources v smith supra in that case decided in 1990 the court narrowed the scope of the free exercisehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97795crs2crs2 the free exercise clause has been held applicable not only to actions by the federa l3 governmen t but also to actions by state and local government see cantwell v connecticut 310 us 296 1940 congress in 1994

religion the specific issue before the court in smith3 was whether two native americans who had been fir ed from their jobs as drug counselors after they were discovered to have ingested peyote in ritual of the native america n church were eligible for state unemployment benefits that issue the court resolved in the negative 63 but in the process of reaching that co nclusion the court also altered the standard of review generally used for free exercise cases 54 for the prior quarter of century the court had generally applied strict scrutiny test to government action alleged to burden the exercise of religion that test require d the government to show that an action burdening religion served compelling publi c interest and that less burdensome course of action was feasible if the governmen t could not so demonstrate the test required that the religious practice be exempted from the government regulation or prohibition at issue in smith the court abandoned the strict scrutiny test except in few narro w categories it held that religiously neutral laws may be uniformly applied to all persons without regard to any burden or prohib ition placed on their exercise of religion the free exercise clause the court said never relieves an individual of the obligation to comply with valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground the law proscribes or prescribes conduct that his religi on prescribes or proscribes in the case at hand that new standard meant that the free exercise clause mandated religious exemption from oregons drug laws for native american use of peyote in sacramental ceremony and consequently eligibilit for unemployment benefits of two native americans who lost their jobs because of their participation in such ceremony more generally the cour t asserted that the question of whether religious practices ought to be accommodated b government was matter to be resolved by the political process and not by the courts although it admitted that leaving accommodation to the political process will place at relative disadvantage those religious practices that are not widely engaged in the congressional response the specific result in smith was upsetting to some4 but it was the courts virtual abandonment of strict scrutiny and relegation of fre exercise concerns to the political process that generated widespread alarm in the religious community and elsewhere that larm quickly coalesced into broadbased organization known as the coalition for the free exercise of religion its efforts quickly resulted in the introduction by bipartisan sponsors in both the house and the senate of proposed religious freedom restora tion act of 1990 hr 5377 s 3254 and 3 years later of the enactment of modified version of rfra into

that it might make it possible for women to seek exemptions from restrictive antiabortion statutes and to obtain abortions on religiou s grounds that it might allow challenges to the taxexempt status of church organizations and that it might endanger public grants to churchrelated programs and institutions reflecting thes concerns competing measure was introduced hr 4040 which embodied the same stric t scrutiny standard as h r 2797 but excluded three areas from the possibility of suit under the bill 1 the tax status of any person 2 the use or disposition of government funds or propert derived from or obtained with tax revenues and 3 any limitation or restriction on abortion on access to abortion services or on abortion funding 410 us 113 197310none of the versions of rfra considered by congress addressed any specific free exercise concern rather the intent was to restore the strict scrutiny test as the general standard governing the interaction of government and religious exercise because constitutional amendment would have been required to do that for the judicia l interpretation of the first amendment rfra was crafted to impose the strict scrutiny test as statut ory standard as enacted rfra provided that statute or regulation f general app licability can lawfully burden persons free exercise of religion only if it can be shown to be essential to further compelling governmental interest and to be th least restrictive means of f urthering that compelling governmental interest rfra made the standard applicable to governmental action at every level federal state and local and allowed aggrieved parties to bring suit if they believed their exercise of religio n had been restricted by government in violation of the statutory standard as noted it took 3 years to enact rfra in 1990 hearings were held on the house bill hr 5377 by subcommittee of the house judiciary committee but furthe r6 action was taken before the 101st congress adjourned

committee expects tha t the courts will continue the tradition of giving due deference to the xperience and expertise of prison administrators and that the strict scrutiny standard will not place

thereofthe case arose be cause of conflict between local catholic church and the city of boernes his toric preservation ordinance st peter the apostle catholic church wanted to raze much of its existing structure and build larger sa nctuary in order to accommodate its rapidly growing congregation but the city refused it permission to do so because i t said the ssion revival architecture of the church made it an historic structure tha t needed to be p reserved archbishop flores sued on behalf of the church arguing in part that the citys denial of building permit violated rfra the city responded b contending that rfra was unconstitutional the supreme court agreed wit h the city holding that as applied to the states rfra exceeds congress power justic kennedy writing for the majority agreed that under 5 of the 14th amendment congress has the power to force its provisions but he said that power is limited congress can not in the guise of enforcement he stated adop t legislati on that alters the meaning or the substance of the rights protected by th fourteenth amendment the design of the amendment and the text of 5 are inconsistent with the suggestion that congress has the power to decree the substance of the fourteenth amendment s restrictions on the states legislation which alters the meaning of the free exercis clause cannot be said to be enforcing the clause congress does not enforce constitutional right by changing what the right is both the legislative history of the amendment and most of the judicial decision s interpreting its provisions justice kennedy asserted made congress lack of power t define the rights protected by the amendment clear moreover he elaborated i n congress exercise of its remedial power under 5 there must be congruence an d proportionality between the inj ury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end but her he said congress had failed to develop legislative record showing extensive denials of religious liberty yet rfra intruded at every level of government displacing laws and proh ibiting official actions of almost every description and regardless of subject matter p articularly with respect to the states he asserted rfra constituted considerable congressional intrusion into the states traditional prerogatives an d general authority to regulate for the health and welfare of their citizens as consequ ence he concluded rfra reflects lack of proportionality or congruenc between the means adopte d and the legitimate end to be achieved and contradicts vital principles necessary to maintain separation of powers and the federal balance present status because of the boerne decision states and localities are longer bound by rfra but rfra may still be valid with respect to the federal government because for tha t application congress did not rely on 5 of the 14th amendment but on its substantiv powers under article i and the necessary and proper clause the clinto n21 administration has argued in support of rfras constitutionality as applied to the federal government and to date at least one federal appellate court has agreed on april 13

1997 the facts of the case involved an effort by trustee in bankruptcy to recapture couples23 good faith tithes to church made in the year prior to declaring bankruptcy the court held that rfra in effect amended the bankruptcy code and that recapture of their tithes would plac substantial burden on their religious practice without compelling justification as consequenc it held rfra to bar the recapture to be valid exercise of congress article i powers and not to violate the establishment clause of the first amendment dissenting judge contended th at boerne implied that even as applied to the federal government rfra violates the separation of powers doctrine by imposing on the courts standard of review for constitutional right beyond what the supreme court has held the constitution to
