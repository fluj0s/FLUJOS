health effects updated february 10 2006 michael simpson specialist in life sciences resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress global climate change federal research on possible human health effects summary the average global temperature has risen approximately 06oc 09of over the past century global mean temperatures are projected by recent computer models to increase by 18oc to as much as 71oc 27of to 107of over the next 100 years it appears likely that global mean temperature increases will continue and projections into the future predict variety of possible related impacts in general such as more volatile weather patterns increased incidence of hot spells and changing precipitation patterns that may include more intense rainfall patterns as well as changing and intensified drought patterns extensive research is underway concerning the links between climate and human health however much of this research is being done for reasons unrelated to climate change per this report does not address the underlying question of climate change itself details about which can be found in the crs issue brief ib89005 global climate change by john r justus and susan r fletcher this report identifies the array of climaterelevant human health research and discusses the interconnections approximately 57 million each year since fy2005 supports climate change research at the national institutes of health health effects research topics are very wideranging including studying skin and eye damage from increased ultraviolet radiation effects of damaged water infrastructure dynamics of recovering from disasters and ways to strengthen the capacity in developing countries to deal with infectious diseases three conclusions are common to several studies on possible health effects of climate change the infirm the elderly and the poor may be disproportionately impacted if climate change results in more severe andor more frequent episodes of heat waves and air pollution the risks of vector and waterborne diseases may increase with global warming but countries and regions with adequate sanitation surveillance and public health systems may not see significant increases in disease incidence or distribution and further research is needed to better understand the complex linkages between climate and health human health problems that may be linked to climate change are not created by changes in climate per rather they are problems independent of climate change that may be exacerbated or intensified by changing weather patterns climate longerterm phenomenon can be considered to be the average of shorterterm weather patterns most health research is being conducted for reasons unrelated to climate change but researchers are alert to ways in which environmental factors affecting health may be altered by climate change in its oversight responsibilities congress may wish to consider the priorities and

droughts1 at the same time local climate conditions may result in other temperature effects and related impacts the presence of sulfates from combusted sulfurcontaining fossil fuels for example may limit warming in some areas2 in 1988 the world meteorological organization and the united nations environment program established the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the task of the ipcc is to assess the scientific technical and socioeconomic information relevant to understanding the possible risk of human induced climate change its first assessment report was distributed in 1990 the third assessment report is titled climate change 2001 the finalized report was distributed on october 1 2001 in it the ipcc states that the link between climate and human activities is clearer than before the resultant potential warming may be greater than previously thought and overall climate change is projected to increase threats to human health particularly in lower income populations predominantly within tropicalsubtropical countries3 for more detailed discussion see crs issue brief ib89005 global climate change by john r justus and susan r fletcher and the environmental

climate change but researchers are alert to ways in which environmental factors affecting health may be altered by climate change this issue has drawn increasing attention during the past decade on july 10 1995 the united states global change research program usgcrp which coordinates federal climate change research discussed below held seminar on climate change and health this seminar included participation by the national institute for environmental health science and examined the roles of climate and climate change in the emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases in humans and animals another major meeting on health and climate the conference on human health and global climate change was held at the national academy of sciences on september 1112 1995 was organized and conducted collaboratively by the institute of medicine the national academy of sciences and the national science and technology council nstc with support from several member agencies of the nstc concerns about the potential risks to human health from changes in global climate raised at the conference led to several interagency discussions plans for followup study were developed within the national research councils committee on climate ecosystems infectious diseases and human health ceidh the ceidh released its report under the weather climate ecosystems and infectious disease in april 2001 the report found that many infectious diseases may be influenced by weather fluctuations and seasonaltointerannual climate variability affecting their evolution and emergence through complex sometimes causal often not fully understood relationships the report recommended further research to better understand and control the linkages among climate diseases epidemiological surveillance and public health infrastructure and measures the bush administration commissioned the national research council nrc on may 11 2001 to produce report on climate change climate change science an analysis of some key questions was released in june 2001 by special committee on the science of climate change of the nrc the report prepared by eleven of the nations leading climate scientists generally concurred with the latest conclusions of the ipcc and concluded that the climate changes observed in the past several decades likely were due to human activities although significant part of the climate changes could be from natural climate variability it also summarized information relating to major kinds of possible human health effects of climate change and identified related scientific research currently underway in particular under federal government auspices 4 climate longerterm phenomenon can be considered to be the average of shorterterm weather patterns crs3 scope of this report the research identified in this report includes possible human health effects of atmospheric change generally including health effects of stratospheric ozone depletion that allows greater exposure to ultraviolet uv radiation however ozone depletion is not per usually included in climate change while it is major factor in atmospheric change its effects are more direct and do not act through changes in climate while the agents that deplete stratospheric ozone are themselves greenhouse gases ozone depletion itself is regarded as problem separate from climate change in many cases air quality and water supply and quality may be affected by weather changes heavy or rapid rainfall for example can exceed the capacity of local physical infrastructure to handle such rain overflow and equipment overloads can occur and local water quality and supply may be adversely affected whether weather changes may or may not be related to global climate change and the relationship of weather as mediated through these and other factors to health is an issue involving complex web of interactions5 human health effects possibly related to climate change the range of human responses to temperature and other weather and climate conditions and changes is very broad age general health status and physiological resilience contribute to this breadth of responses given this breadth predicting human responses for climate change policy relies heavily on past observations and on experience the following observations are generally recognized from broad and general experience hot weather often accompanied by air with higher concentrations of pollutants tends to be associated with excess hospitalizations ie more people than would be expected are admitted to hospitals when the weather is hot these excess admissions are often because people are experiencing respiratory difficulties6 hot weather also tends to be associated with excess mortality ie more people than would be expected die during spells of hot weather7 5 for detailed discussion of both the direct and indirect relationships between health impacts of weather and climate and the difficulty of establishing cause and effect see human health and global climate change report released in december 2000 by the pew center on global climate change available at httpwwwpewclimateorg 6 httpwwwepagovglobalwarmingimpactshealthindexhtml 7 ibid crs4 warmer environmental conditions are associated with excess allergens and related substances by enhancing the growth potential of allergenproducing plants and with excess cases of people with allergic and asthmatic responses8 warmer environmental conditions are associated with various excess illnesses resulting from the enhancement of the range and life cycle of diseaseassociated insects and microbial life forms and viruses these illness vectors may have been water air contact andor food borne9 warmer conditions tend to be associated with more extreme weather events eg heavier precipitation which may result directly in health impacts from floods10 warmer conditions with heavier precipitation may result in indirect health effects eg public health may be threatened by overloaded wastewater infrastructure11 on the other hand the following observations also can be based on general experience while about 1000 people die from the cold each year in comparison about 2000 die from conditions related to heat12 warmer conditions may lead to reduction of deaths from the cold in general coldrelated deaths happen when relatively rare cold spells occur in areas where people are accustomed to mild winters situations that may or may not be affected by global climate change coldrelated deaths however are less sensitive to temperature changes than heatrelated deaths eg the mortality difference between 29oc and 26oc 20o f and 15o f is less than that observed between 35oc and 38oc 95o f and 100o f13 morbidity and mortality are not always observed to increase even if more extreme weather events occur appropriate infrastructure including building codes zoning and sanitation systems severe weather warning systems

technically advanced quick to adopt new technology regionally diverse and adapted to wide range of conditions intensively managed and market based as such as whole while the agricultural economy is argued by some to appear to be of low vulnerability to climate change local monitoring of diverse local conditions has been recommended15 trends of concern various trends ranging in scale from local through national may relate to the possible human health effects of climate change potentially augmenting morbidity or mortality effects the average age of americans is going up while 1 in 8 americans was 65 years or older in 1990 1 in 6 will be 65 or older in 202016 with this expected aging it is projected will come loss of physiological resilience on average more of the population is expected to be more susceptible to possible health effects from all environmental stresses including any related to climate change17 more americans are and will be living in urban settings which generally demonstrate urban heatisland effects higher average temperatures than surrounding nonurban areas owing to more heat generating activities and more heatretaining urban structures and higher levels of air pollution as such more americans are and will be exposed to potentially augmented climate change stresses and potential health effects18 advancing therapies allow people with compromised immune systems to live longer the increasing number of immunocompromised people means there may be more people with 14 united states department of state us climate action report 2002 washington dc may 2002 p

deaths because the poor are more likely to live in urban areas and are less likely to be able to afford airconditioning systems20 recent rise in one measure of poverty in the united states is argued by some to suggest that there may be more poor people who may be more vulnerable to possible climaterelated health effects by being less able to afford appropriate health care as well as air conditioning21 using national data gathered on regional level one study hypothesized that some regions or states may be more greatly affected by possible health effects of climate change than others not only because they are more prone to summer weatherclimaterelated diseases but also because they contain greater proportion of the sensitive subpopulations in the united states22 recognizing the current shortages of doseresponse data linking climate to health effects and reliable modeling of future regional climates the report says that the current state of research is sufficient to generate the hypothesis but not test it which constitutes part of the ongoing need for further research human health effects research related to climate change research on human health effects of environmental conditions that may result from global climate change is being conducted domestically while most of these efforts are not focused specifically on climate change they are examining health conditions that could be affected by change of climate such as skin cancers caused by solar radiation mediated through changes in weather patterns and variability some research may also relate to terrorism eg use of nuclear device by terrorist could result in increased cancer risks some cancer research could be useful in countering radiation exposures whether from climate change or nuclear device the multiplicity of benefits from basic research makes difficult the task of categorizing basic research funding for climate change or other reasons 19 united states global change research program op cit

health effects and for conducting assessments of national health impacts and development and implementation of methods for adaptation and mitigation26 these major areas of concern incorporate specific concerns such as the growing threat of spreading antibiotic resistance malaria for example has become immune to antibiotics in some countries and funding that may be inadequate to the task27 specific funding levels for united states support of whos climateassociated human health effects research were unavailable but were characterized as small28 conclusions the changing global climate likely will impact the complicated interrelated web of plant and animal life viruses water air and land the magnitude and beneficial or adverse direction of the impact will depend on specific locations and economic political social and environmental conditions studies on the subject have produced myriad conclusions only very basic conclusions find wide agreement at present29 the infirm the elderly and the poor may be disproportionately and negatively impacted should climate change result in more severe andor more frequent episodes of heat waves and air pollution the risks of vector and waterborne
