analyzes the impact of these lost export sales on the us agricultural sector and national economy the report summarizes legislative activity in the 105th congress and in the 106th congress relating to sanctions on us agricultural exports the clinton administration s july 1999 policy change exempting food and medicine from sanctions imposed on some countries and arguments made for and against exempting or treating food differently in carrying out us sanctions policy this report will be updated to reflect major congressional action or significant policy decisions announced by the administration on this issuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30108economic sanctions and us agricultural exports summary various statutes and regulations authorize the president to restrict or prohibit trade with targeted countries for national security or foreign policy reasons the exercise of these authorities has resulted in restrictions or prohibitions at times being placed on the export of us agricultural commodities and products the us government currently restricts exports of agricultural products as part of acrossthe board economic sanctions imposed on cuba and iraq exceptions are made for humanitarian reasons allowing food to be sold or donated to these two countries the clinton administration moved last year to lift prohibitio ns on us commercial sales of most agricultural commodities and food products to four other countries the us department of treasury on july 27 1999 issued export licensing regulations to implement the administrations policy decision to exempt sales of food and medical products from future and some current sanctions this will allow sales that meet specified conditions and safeguards to be made to iran libya and sudan since this policy went into effect treasury has approved licenses allowing for us exports of corn to iran and durum wheat to libya separate september 17th white house announcement on easing sanctions against north korea likely means that sales of agricultural products will be allowed under less restrictive licensing policy usda analysis estimates that us economic sanctions on these countries reduced us agricultural exports by roughly 500 million in 1996 the likely impacts according to crs analysis presented in this report suggest that these lost export sales may have in 1996 reduced farm income by 150 million those in favor of changing us sanctions policy to exempt agricultural exports argue that restricting exports only hurts us farmers and business undermines our reputation as reliable supplier and does not change targeted countries behavior those opposed to change argue that current law gives the president flexibility to permit food to be shipped for humanitarian reasons and that us food if sold could be misused by foreign governments andor not made available to those in need because of concern about declining farm exports congress in recent years has focused increased attention on exempting food from us sanctions in 1998 the 105th congress overrode nonproliferation sanctions to permit usda financing of us wheat sales to pakistan pl 105194 in 1999 the house and senate approved bills that differ in their approach to sanctions hr 17 adopted by the house june 15 1999 lays out congressional procedures to approve or disapprove future embargo on agricultural products that is not part of an

commercial sales of agricultural and medical products from all current us unilateral sanctions and from future unilateral sanctions proposed by the president unless congress first approves this provision was dropped in conference because of objections by those opposing any commercial sales to cuba and because it represented significant change in us sanctions policy the senate plans to

us trade when actions by targeted countrie s have endangered national security or have undermined foreign policy objectives or are needed because of short domestic supply on occasion congress has passed specific legislation to require the president to announce sanctions when foreign governments take certain actions and to limit his discretion in conducting sanctions policy with respect to specific country1 this at times has resulted in prohibitions or restrictions placed on us agricultural exports some embargoes have been selective in nature eg restricting sales of commodities and food products but not of other exports the most oftenmentioned example is the 198081 grain embargo imposed on the soviet union following its invasion of afghanistan in other cases exports of farm commodities have been or are currently prohibited or limited as part of an acrosstheboard embargo applicable to all us trade in implementing these statutes the executive branch has at times drawn distinctions in the type of agricultural shipments prohibited or curtailed for example commercial export sales might be prohibited while shipments of food for humanitarian reasons ie food aid are allowed under certain circumstanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30108crs2 2white house office of the press secretary fact sheet easing sanctions against north korea september 17 1999 3us firms are

exporters could sell to these closed markets us farm exports to the rest of the world in the immediate period would fall somewhat this would occur because other agricultural exporting countries as

production supply and distribution psd database faos faostat database for tobacco leaf imports survey conducted by the us international trade commission itc found the costs and effects of us unilateral economic sanctions on the us agricultural sector to be minimal because the affected six countries are small lowincome economies that import relatively small volumes of highervalue agricultural products respondents indicated that current sanctions have minimal impact on us producers of soybeans alcoholic beverages leaf tobacco seeds meat dairy fish and forest products but may affect trade in some products in some markets and during some time periods in responses to the itc survey the us wheat associates nonprofit trade promotion association estimated that sanctions have resulted in annual losses of 320 million in sales of wheat products over the last 10 years separately the north american export grain association trade association of grain trading companies estimated that sanctions have reduced us corn and wheat exports by about 200 million annually10 11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30108crs7 11continued estimate 12 the farm income loss estimate is based on ers finding that 45 of every dollar of bulk commodity exports and 26 of each dollar of all other agricultural exports returns to the farm as income the estimate of lower us economic activity is based on ers multiplier that 1 of bulk exports generates 85 cents of additional business activity and that each dollar of all other agricultural exports generates 135 elsewhere in the economy additional economic activity is generated as agricultural commod ities are transported processed and merchandised to buyers and includes activity associated with farm purchases of inputs and equipment needed for agricultural production the jobs estimate is based on ers finding that each billion dollars in agricultural exports generates about 14200 jobs the multipliers used by crs to develop these calculations are taken from us agricultural trade boosts overall economy by william edmondson in ers us agricultural trade update january 1998 13to place into context the 150 million in reduced farm income would have represented about onequarter of 1 of us farm income in calendar 1996 if added to farm income totaling 534 billion using ers definition or 669 billion using the department of commerce bureau of economic analysis definition the 12 billion in lower economic activity would have represented small fraction of 1 of gross domestic product gdp if added to the almost 77 trillion in 1996 gdp the 7600 fewer jobs estimate would have represented very small fraction of 1 of us total employment if added to us civilian employment of 1267 million in 1996economic impact of reduced agricultural exports it is difficult to quantify the impact of sanctions on the us economy and the agricultural sector in particular because of the complexity involved in weighing numerous market factors and the policies of affected countries that may change their agricultural output and redirect trade flows one approach to calculating the impact is to apply appropriate traderelated economic and employment multipliers developed by usdas economic research service ers to fas estimate of 500 million in lost sales in 1996 such an analysis would suggest that these lost sales in that year may have reduced farm income by about 150 million lowered overall us economic activity by an estimated 12 billion and reduced us job creation by about 7600 2600 less in the farm sector 5000 in all other sectors12 13 legislative actions in the 105th congress farm state members concerns that nonproliferation sanctions imposed on pakistan following its nuclear weapons test on may 30 1998 would result in that countrys loss of

agricultural appropriations the senate on july 15 1998 adopted by voice vote an amendment offered by senator dodd after motion to table it failed 3860 to exempt the sale of food fertilizer medicine and medical equipment from current and future unilateral sanctions because of concern that such policy change would loosen the us trade embargo with cuba and other countries senator torricelli offered an amendment preventing dodds amendment from applying to any country that supports international terrorism or that systematically denies access to food and medicine for political reasons or as means of coercion or punishment the senate adopted by voice vote this amendment after rejecting motion to table it on 3067 vote housesenate conferees later dropped both amendments largely over differences of opinion over the torricelli provisos most observers acknowledged that the torricelli text would have had the effect of not allowing food to be exempt from the sanctions currently imposed on the six countries because all are on the state departments list of terrorist states16 another amendment offered by senator lugar the same text as his bill s 1413 the sanctions policy reform act would have required that cost benefit analysis be prepared before any future sanction is imposed and placed 2year limit on any sanctions unless congress acted to renew them this was tabled on 53 46 vote after

somewhat more diffuse except for those that publicly favor continuing the comprehensive trade embargo on cuba which prohibits the sale of agricultural commodities and food products along with almost all other commercial trade involving cuban government entities41 advocates of the use of sanctions as legitimate and effective policy tool are scattered throughout the foreign policy and defense community most have financial stake in the debate and frequently draw little distinction between prohibiting sales of food and prohibiting exports of all other products those in favor of exempting us agricultural commodities and food products from economic sanctions imposed for foreign policy and national security reasons argue that sales lost because of these decisions have had disproportionate economic impact on the us agricultural sector which now depends more heavily on exports to generate income than before42 the agricultural community frequently expresses the view that the imposition of sanctions undermines the more marketoriented farm policy objectives laid out in the 1996 freedom to farm act that assumed continued and increased access to foreign markets these prohibitions undermine the credibility and reputation of the united states as reliable supplier to foreign customers proponents of change in us policy point out that agricultural exporting competitors argentina australia

export competitiveness in these markets food should not be used as an instrument of us foreign policy to influence the behavior of rogue nations because such policy is immoral some argue that withholding food results in malnutrition and possible starvation among the poor in the affected nations but generally does not affect the elites and leaderships standard of living those opposed to explicitly exempting food or granting the president discretion to exclude food from us economic sanctions policy argue that comprehensive sanctions are an essential tool in us efforts to bring about change in countrys policies and practices particularly when its actions conflict with us foreign policy and national security objectives ie fighting terrorism limiting nuclear proliferation thwarting aggressive action against neighboring countries that are us allies etc accordingly the president should have maximum flexibility to determine the most effective use of sanctions ie neither requirements for specific inclusions nor prohibitions against specific exemptions exempting food exports from sanctions coverage can result in the leadership of targeted country using food imported or received from the united states as political tool to reward those supportive of the policies that prompted the sanction or to coerce others to accept those policies us economic sanctions do not limit the ability of the president to permit food to be sold or donated for humanitarian reasons current statutory authorities have allowed the executive branch to approve us commodity sales to iraq under the uns oilforfood program the mailing of food parcels and the limited donation and sale of food and other agricultural products to cuba and us food aid shipments to north korea and sudan
