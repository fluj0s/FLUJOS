carrier access act acaa in 19861 with several goals first congress intended to address the unique difficulties faced by individuals with disabilities who often had way to predict the extent of given airline or flight crews accommodation2 second congress intended the acaa to overrule supreme court case department of transportation v paralyzed veterans of america pva 3 in which the court held that certain nondiscrimination regulations then in effect4 could not be enforced against commercial airlines5 finally congress also intended to balance protecting individuals with disabilities from discrimination on one hand and the need to ensure general passenger safety on the other6 the inquiry regarding the extent of protections under the acaa is timely given public concern in 2007 about man infected with xdrtb who traveled on several passenger airplanes before he was placed in isolation this report discusses acaa requirements and regulations including regulations regarding airplane passengers with communicable diseases 7 it will also briefly discuss s 2554 110th congress and hr 5129 110th congress which proposed to amend the acaa to provide aggrieved individuals with private

acaa prohibits discrimination by air carriers against otherwise qualified individuals on the basis of disability8 the statutory language regarding the scope of disability was the same under the acaa as under the americans with disabilities act ada9 prior to the enactment of the americans with disabilities amendment act on september 25 200810 specifically person 1 air carrier access act of 1986

discrimination by air carriers against individuals with disabilities 55 fed reg 8009 these regulations derived legal authority from section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 29 usc 794 which the

physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities 2 has record of such an impairment or 3 is regarded as having such an impairment11 under the regulations12 such individuals are qualified individuals with disabilities if they 1 take steps to avail themselves of services offered by air carriers 2 make good faith efforts to obtain tickets for air transportation or 3 purchase or possess valid tickets for air transportation and meet reasonable contracts of carriage 13 prior to enactment of the ada amendments act courts typically found that individuals met this qualified requirement if they also satisfied the individual with disability requirement14 the acaas statutory language is brief l eaving implementation to the department of transportation dot the department origina lly promulgated regulations to implement the acaa on march 6 199015 under the regulatory framework air carriers violate the acaas nondiscrimination provision if they discriminate against an individual with disability by reason of such disability in the provision of air transportation16 additionally air carriers may not require passengers to accept special services17 dots goal for this provision was to ensure that individuals with disabilities are not treated differently than other passengers18 in deterra v america west airlines federal district court noted that asking person utilizing wheelchair to advance to the front of ticket line when he had not requested special service could constitute discriminatory conduct under the regulations 19

major exceptions to the general nondiscrimination requirement first carriers may refuse to serve individuals with disabilities on the basis of safety20 second carriers may refuse to serve individuals

g6g146g156g142g138g156g142g156g561 the acaa contains statutory reference to communicable diseases however the regulatory text generally treats individuals with communicable diseases as falling within the definition of individual with disability32 similarly courts generally accept communicable diseases as falling within the scope of disability under the ada if the diseases meet the same parameters that other physical or mental impairments must satisfy 33 although federal court has reached the issue it follows that courts would li kely reach similar conclusions under the acaa the regulations prohibit various actions by carriers against individuals with communicable diseases namely carrier may not 1 refuse to provide transportation to the person 2 require the person to provide medical certificate or 3 impose on the person any condition restriction or requirement not imposed on other passengers 34 however an exception applies when an individual poses direct threat to the health or safety of others35 the regulations define direct threat as significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by modification of policies practices or procedures or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services36 carriers have discretion in determining whether given passenger poses direct threat the carrier must make an individualized assessment based on reasonable judgment to ascertain the nature duration and severity of the risk that the potential harm to the health and safety of others will actually occur and whether reasonable modifications of policies practices or procedures will mitigate the risk37 however note that within the scope of their discretion carriers must choose the least restrictive alternative from the passengers point of view38 for
