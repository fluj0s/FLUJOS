the case of foreign intelligence though the committee believes that some privacy protections may well be necessary for financial records sought during foreign intelligence investigation there are special problems in this area which make considerati on of such protections in other congressional forums more appropriate nevertheless the committee intends that this exemption be used only for legitimate foreign intelligence inves tigations investigations proceeding only under the rubric of national security do not qualify rather this exception is available only to those us government

address some of the concerns raised by critics and the courts6 as consequence the second circuit dismissed one of the lowe r court cases as moot and remanded the other for reconsideration in light of the amendments7 on reconsideration the district court opinion continued to be troubled by the first amendment implications of the nondisclosure features of 18 usc 2709 even as amended8 the opinion is now on appeal9 background the ancestor of the first nsl letter provision is statutory exception to privacy protections afforded by the right to financial privacy act rfpa10 its history is not particularly instructive and consists primarily of determination that the exception in its original form shou ld not be too broadly construed11 but the exception was just that an exception it wa s neither an affirmative grant of authority to request information nor command to financial institutions to provided information when asked it removed the restrictions on the release of customer information imposed on financial institutions by the right to financial privacy act but it left them free to decline to comply when asked to do so in certain significant instances fi nancial institutions had declined to grant the fbi access to financial records in res ponse to requests under sectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33320crs3 12 pl 99569 404 100 stat 3197 1986 12 usc 3414a5a1988 ed

particularly in states which have state constitutional privacy protection provisions or state banking privacy laws in those states fi nancial institutions decline to grant the fbi access because state law prohibits them from granting such access and the rfpa since it permits but does not mandate such access does not override state law in such situation the concerned financial institutions which might otherwise desire to grant the fbi access to customers record will not do so because state law does not allow such cooperati on and c ooperation might expose them to liability to the customer whose records the fbi sought access hrept 99690 at 156 1986 congress responded with passa ge of the first nsl stat ute as an amendment to the right to financial privacy act affirmatively giving the fbi access to financial institution records in certain foreign intelligence cases12 at the same time in the electronic communications privacy act it afforded the fbi comparable access to the telephone company and other comm unications service provider customer information13 together the two nsl provisions afforded the fbi access to communications and financial busine ss records under limited circumstances customer and customer transaction inform ation held by tele phone carriers and banks pertaining to foreign power or its agents relevant to fore ign counterintelligence investigation14 both the communications provider secti on and the right to financial privacy act section contained nondisclosure provisions15 and limitations on further dissemination except pursuant of guidelines promulgated by the attorney general16 neither had an express enforcement mechanism nor identified penalties for failureto comply with either the nsl or the nondisclosure instruction in the mid90s congress added two more nsl provisions one permits nsl use in connection with the investigation of government employee leaks of classified information under the national security act 17 and the other

showing that the effort to identify financial institutions in order to make use of fbi authority under the right to financial privacy act can not only be timeconsuming and res ourceintensive but can

valuable to national security investigations unfortunately however nsls were of limited utility prior to the patriot act while records held by third parties may generally be subpoenaed by grand jury in criminal investigation so long as those records are relevant the standard for obtaining such records through an nsl was much higher before october of 2001 the fbi had to have specific and articul able facts that the information requested pertained to foreign power or an agent of foreign power this requirement often prohibited the fbi from using nsls to develop evidence at the early stage of an investigation which is precisely when they are the most useful the prior standard mr chairman put the cart before the horse agents trying to determine whether or not there were specific nd articulable facts that certain individual was terrorist or spy were precluded from using an nsl in this inquiry because in order to use an nsl they first had to be in possession of such facts suppose for example investigators were tracking known alqaeda operative and saw him having lunch with th ree individuals responsible agent would want to conduct preliminary investigation of those individua ls and find out among other things with whom they had recently been in communication before the passage of the patriot act however the fbi could not have issued an nsl to obtain such information while inves tigators could have demonstrated that this information was relevant to an ongoing terrorism investigation they could not have demonstrated sufficient specific and articulable facts that the

congress doe v ashcroft37 and doe v gonzales38 suggested that the nsl statutes could not withstand constitutional scrutiny unless more explicit provisions were made for judicial review and permissible disclosure by recipients in essence doe v ashcroft found that the language of 18 usc 2709 and the practi ces surrounding its use offended 1 the fourth amendment because in all but the exceptional case it has the effect of authorizing coercive searches effectively immune from any judicial process 334 fsupp2d at 506 and 2 the first amendmen t because its sweeping permanent gag order provision applies in every case to ev ery person in perpetuity with vehicle for the ban to ever be lifted from the reci pient or other persons affected under any circumstances either by the fbi itself or pursuant to judicial process id at 476 the court concluded that the national security letters before it differed from administrative subpoenas by want of judicial review either before or after the seizure while the fourth amendment reasonableness standard is permissive in the context of the administrative subpoenas the constitutionality of the administrative subpoena is predicated on the availability of neutral tribunal to determine after subpoena issued wh ether the subpoena actually complies with the fourth amendments demands in contrast to an actual physical search which must be justified by the wa rrant and probable cause requirements occurring before the search an administrative subpoena is regulated by and its justification derives from judicial process available after the subpoena is issued accordingly the supreme court has held that an administrative subpoena may not be made and enforced by the administrative agency rather the subpoenaed party must be able to obtai n judicial

2709c the court poi nted to legislative proposals in the 108th congress that might serve as one of seve ral possible models for more narrowly tailored means of protecting the legitimate governmental interests upon which section 2709 rested bills pending in the house and senate would require the attorney general to certify before ordering secrecy that disclosure would present danger to the

in order to ascertain his rights and obligations nor whether it might ever be lifted it was this silence in the face of seemingly absolute permanent nondisclosure command that the doe courts found
