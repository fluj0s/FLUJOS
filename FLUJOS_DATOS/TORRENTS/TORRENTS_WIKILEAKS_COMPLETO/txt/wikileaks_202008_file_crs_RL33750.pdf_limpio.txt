under the wto decision this legislation was not acted upon in the 109th congress and has not been reintroduced in the 110th congress the system of compulsory licensing may have relatively modest effect on the availability of medicines in the developing world compulsory licenses have rarely been used by developing countries because many patent regimes did not protect pharmaceuticals before 2006 countries providing patent protection to pharmaceuticals have used the threat of compulsory licensing as method to negotiate lower drug prices although some countries have amended their national laws to allow compulsory licensing for pharmaceutical exports there may be little economic incentive for supplier to manufacture the product in the case of an ldc issuing compulsory license to date only rwanda has notified the wto of its intention to use the wto notification process to import hivaids medication from canada

and public health on november 14 20014 the declaration sought to alleviate developing country dissatisfaction with the trips regime it delayed the implementation of patent system provisions for pharmaceutical products for least developed countries ldcs until 2016 the declaration committed member states to interpret and implement the agreement to support public health and to promote access to medicines for all it also affirmed the right of wto members to use the flexibilities in the trips agreement to promote these goals the declaration reiterated that each member has the right to grant compulsory licenses and to determine the terms and circumstances in which they are issued each country also has the right to determine what constitutes national emergency or circumstances of extreme urgency defining these terms to incl ude public health crises such as hivaids malaria and tuberculosis and other epidemics g5g152g150g153g158g149g156g152g155g162g561g14g146g140g142g151g156g142g156g561 paragraph 6 of the declaration directed the wtos council on trips to formulate solution to the use of compulsory licensing by countries with insufficient or inadequate manufacturing capability by december 2002 compulsory licenses are issued by governments to authorize the use or production of patented item by domestic party other than patent holder they are authorized by article 31 of trips which generally limits their issuance to cases in which the government has made efforts to obtain authorization on reasonable commercial terms or in circumstance of extreme urgency or national emergency in addition article 31 limits the scope and duration of compulsory license to address the circumstances for which the license is authorized grants the rightsholder adequate remuneration for use of the patent covered by compulsory license and restricts production authorized by compulsory license predominantly to the domestic market it is this last provision that was the focus of the paragraph 6 negotiations because it in effect conveys the right of compulsory licensing only to countries with the capability to manufacture given product

previously was approved by all wto members save the united states which blocked its passage in december 2002 due to concerns of the us pharmaceutical industry about potential abuse of the system the decision did not amend the motta text but added chairmans statement to clarify certain aspects of it the decision provided for waiver of article 31f of the 1994 trips agreement the language which stipulates that compulsory licenses are to be used predominantly for the supply of the domestic market the decision waived 31f for exports of pharmaceutical products to least developed countries ldcs

legal document reflects what it terms several key shared understandings of members concerning the interpretation and implementation of the agreement disagreements persisted over how to permanently incorporate the decision and the chairmans statement into the trips agreement until the eve of the hong kong ministerial in december 2005 on december 6 wto members agreed to incorporate the 2003 decision as an amendment and an annex to trips the chairmans statement was reread but it was not incorporated into the text of the agreement which was seen as concession by the united states 6 the change would enter into force after being ratified by twothirds of the member states the waiver will continue in effect until the ratification period terminates on december 31 20097 the protocol has been ratified by 38 countries including the united states switzerland salvador south korea norway india the phillippines israel japan au stralia singapore and the european union 27 countries canada china india korea norway and the european union have incorporated into their domestic or community law although canada and china have not as yet ratified the agreement the european parliament approved the amendments on october 24 2007 and if approved by the european council of ministers the amendments can be ratified by the eu member states 8

licensing for medicines based on the scope of the language in the doha ministerial declaration hivaids malaria tuberculosis and other epidemics during the december 2002 debate developing countries accepted this wording as reflecting the intent of the doha ministerial declaration although they had sought even less restrictive language however the us considered this position too broad and countered with more restrictive language hivaids malaria tuberculosis or other infectious epidemics of comparable gravity or scale including those that may arise in the future 9 this language was too restrictive for the developing countries and debate over this language subsequently caused the united states to reject the motta text developing countries were adamant that the language in the ministerial declaration on the scope of diseases should form the basis for the agreement and this position eventually prevailed during negotiations in the spring and summer of 2003 the us position seemingly shifted from limiting the scope of diseases to restricting country eligibility 10 g7g149g146g144g146g139g149g142g561g5g152g158g151g157g155g146g142g156g561 the scope of developing country

like south korea and brazil who have their own manufacturing capacity as stated above trips grants each nation the ability to assign compulsory licenses to their domestic manufacturers however there is broad range of technical sophistication among the pharmaceutical industries of the developing countries country that can make aspirin may not be able to reengineer or reformulate sophisticated drugs in order to utilize the existing compulsory license language of the agreement the question became whether country that has some manufacturing capability but not necessarily specialized expertise would be able to use paragraph 6 mechanism to issue compulsory license to more sophisticated industry in another country to produce medicine the decision set out certain criteria for determining whether country lacks domestic manufacturing capacity but essentially countries would selfdeclare their eligibility by notification to the trips council this position reflected the rejection by developing countries of any restrictions on their ability to selfdetermine eligibility the decision clarified that eligibility notification would include information on the manner in which country determined it had manufacturing capability however formal reviewing mechanism to assess the self determination of eligibility by developing countries as the united states proposed was incorporated into the statement 11 the chairmans statement also contained language that the system not be used as an instrument to pursue industrial or commercial policy objectives this statement reflects industry concerns that the syst em could serve to aid the expansion of generic pharmaceutical industries in developing nations in addition several groups also indicated they would not avail themselves of the new compulsory license system the decision referred to 23 developed countries that would refrain from using the system as an importer the chairmans statement reported that the 10 nations joining the european union in 2004 would also opt out of usin g the mechanism as importers from the date of their accession until that time they pledged to use the mechanism only in situations of national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency in addition several other nations announced that they would only use the system as importers under this same formulation including hong kong israel korea kuwait macao china mexico qatar singapore taiwan turkey and the united arab emirates this list reflected us efforts in the negotiations to seek to persuade more advanced developing countries to refrain from using the waiver 12 g21g138g143g142g144g158g138g155g141g156g561 another concern was the issue of the use of safeguards to prevent diversion of these generically manufactured drugs from poor developed countries to developed country markets the decision called for the drugs to be specially marketed or packaged with identifiable characteristics such as distinguishable colors or shapes provided that such distinction is feasible and does not have significant impact on price 13 it also declared that importing countries should take measures within their means to prevent trade diversion14 11 us pushes for system to review trips compulsory license requests inside us trade august 8 2003 12 wto chair menon pushes to finalize agreement on tripsessential drugs international

compulsory licenses for exporting patented pharmaceutical products to certain countries under the wto decision this legislation was not acted upon in the 109th congress and it has not been reintroduced in the 110th congress the legislation would have authorized the director of the us patent and trademark office pto to issue compulsory licenses for the export of generic pharmaceuticals

distributing the medicines to the eligible country it stipulated the content for license applications established an office within pto to assist applicants in filing applications and placed certain conditions on the granted license among the latter the legislation specified that the licensed product be distinguishable from product manufactured by the patent holder in terms of size shape color

capability to obtain affordable medicines to treat their populations afflicted with hivaids and other ep idemics however system of compulsory licensing may have relatively modest effect on the availability of medicines in the developing world according to theneu trade negotiator pascal lamy we have solved about 10 of the problem of access to medicines by developing countries by the wtos action he cited other issues such as inadequate distribution systems for medicines in poor countries and the lack of trained personnel to administer the drugs as factors that could hinder the effectiveness of the new policy 18 compulsory licenses have rarely been used by developing countries this situation can be attributed to lack of patent protection in many countries developing countries were not required to enforce trips compliant patent system before 2005 and the compliance date for ldcs was extended until 2016 for pharmaceutical patents by the doha ministerial declaration however some developing countries do have patent regimes that cover some pharmaceuticals in these countries the threat of compulsory licensing can be used to negotiate better prices from developedworld pharmaceutical manufacturers braz il country with relatively sophisticated pharmaceutical industry with the ability to reverse engineer and innovate new drugs has threatened to use compulsory licensing to manufacture generic hivaids drugs domestically to extract price concessions from patentholders which it did most recently in 2005 19 subsequent to the decision several nations announced that they will use this mechanism in brazil presidential decree issued september 5 2003 granted the government the authority to import generic medicines without the consent of the patent holder in cases of national emergency or public interest mozambique zambia indonesia and malaysia announced the granting of compulsory licenses for aids drugs however they did not do so under the aegis of the wto notification system20 in december 2006 and january 2007 thailand issued compulsory licenses for the production of generic version of two hivaids medicines favirenz and kaletra and the heart disease medication plavix in india thailands public health minister maintained they undertook this action to provide this medication at an affordable price for its universal healthcare system21

avail itself of the wto notification system in its 2007 special 301 report ustr placed thailand on its priority watch list in part because of weakening respect for patents as result of the thailands compulsory licensing while ustr acknowledged countrys right to issue compulsory licenses it criticized what it considered the lack of transparency and due process exhibited in thailand22 in june 20 2007 letter house oversight committee chairman henry waxman criticized ustrs action and sought to have thailand removed from the priority watch list and to abandon any further retaliation for thailands public health efforts 23 meanwhile the senate approved language in the food and drug administration revitalization act s 1082 that expressed concern that certain countries have engaged in unfair price manipulation and abuse of compulsory licensing and called on ustr to use all tools at its disposal to address ipr concerns and violations sec 516 this language did not appear in the final version of the bill passed into law pl 11085 on the export side several countries are considering legislation to provide patent waivers to allow their generic pharmaceutical companies to manufacture drugs for compulsory license under the wto system as noted earlier canada china india korea norway have enacted legislation amending their patent laws and the european union has adopted regulations to this effect in june 2006 switzerland and france have also proposed regulations or legislation to comply with the agreement there may be little economic incentive for supplier to manufacture the product in the case of an ldc issuing compulsory license under th decision developing country with manufacturing capability may use compulsory license to obtain product for generic manufacturer in another country however the generic manufacturer in the second country may have incentive to do so especially in limited quantities to poor countries in addition under many of the proposals the product would have to use special packaging or distinctive shapes to avoid diversion under such restrictions it is not certain that generic producer would undertake the development and formulation costs for such limited market 24 thus even though compulsory license may be issued the drugs may never be manufactured according to some nongovernmental organizations and aids activists this is precisely the result being sought by patentholders one activist claimed that restrictions such as special packaging and notification requirements create watertight system so that generic drugs ever get through to the patients in developing countries who desperately need them25 however us officials have contended that these restrictions preventing diversion serve the interest of recipient nations by providing additional safeguards that the medicines will be used by the intended recipients 26 22 united states trade representative 2007 special 301 report p 27 23 letter from rep waxman to ustr
