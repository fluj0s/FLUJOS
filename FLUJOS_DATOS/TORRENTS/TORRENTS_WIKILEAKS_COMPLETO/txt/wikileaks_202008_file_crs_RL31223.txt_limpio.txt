financing domestic social policy division medicare supplementary medigap coverage summary medicare is nationwide health insurance program for the aged and certain disabled persons although the program provides broad protection against the costs of many primarily acute care services it covers only about onehalf of beneficiaries total health care expenses most individuals have some coverage in addition to basic medicare benefits some persons have additional benefits through managed care plan most other individuals have some supplementary coverage through private insurers or public programs such as medicaid private supplementary coverage can be obtained through an individually purchased policy commonly referred to as medigap policy it can also be obtained through current or former employer some persons have both types of coverage beneficiaries with medigap insurance typically have coverage for medicares deductibles and coinsurance they may also have coverage for some items and services not covered by medicare individuals generally select from one of 10 standardized plans though not all 10 plans are offered in all states the 10 plans are known as plans through plan j plan covers basic package of benefits each of the other nine plans includes the basic benefits plus different combination of additional benefits plan j is the most comprehensive the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma pl 10873 added new voluntary prescription drug benefit under new medicare part d it also made number of changes to the medigap requirements the first significant change was the addition of two new standardized plan types plan k and plan l there are two key differences between the benefits included under these options and those offered under plans ah first plans k and l eliminate firstdollar coverage for most medicare costsharing second both plans k and l include an annual outofpocket limit on medicare costsharing charges the second major mma change was the prohibition beginning january 1 2006 on the sale of medigap policies with prescription drug coverage individuals who had such policies could renew them provided they did not enroll in prescription drug plan under the new part d alternatively if they enrolled under part d they could continue to enroll in medigap plan but without drug coverage mma also required the secretary of the health and human services to request the national association of insurance commissioners naic to review and revise the medigap benefit packages taking into account changes made by the new law the naic announced its recommendations in march 2007 the childrens health and medicare protection act of 2007 champ as passed by the house on august 1 2007 incorporates these recommendations as well as making

overview medicare is nationwide health insurance program for the aged and certain disabled persons most medicare beneficiaries obtain covered health services through the original feeforservice program also known as original medicare under the feeforservice program beneficiaries obtain covered services through the providers of their choice and medicare pays for each service or package of services rendered the basic package of medicare services which includes range of institutional and noninstitutional services is the same throughout the country some beneficiaries are enrolled in medicare advantage plan these persons have elected to obtain all of their medicare services through managed care arrangement such as health maintenance organization hmo instead of through the feeforservice program at minimum these beneficiaries are entitled to the basic medicare benefit package some managed care enrollees may be entitled to additional benefits the scope of additional benefits varies by plan the basic medicare benefit package provides broad protection against the costs of many primarily acute health care services however beneficiaries may still be faced with significant additional costs medicare requires costsharing for most covered services provides only limited protection for some services such as long term care and includes protection against the costs of other services such as hearing aids and dentures further unlike most large group health insurance plans medicare contains upper catastrophic limit on outofpocket expenses as result the program covers only about half of beneficiaries total health costs most medicare beneficiaries have some form of public or private coverage to supplement their medicare benefits public coverage is provided primarily through medicaid private protection may be obtained through current or former employer it may also be obtained through an individually purchased policy commonly referred to as medigap policy federal law has established number of requirements governing the sale of these medigap policies the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma pl 10873 added new voluntary prescription drug benefit under new crs2 medicare part d1 it also made number of additional changes to the program including changes to the medigap requirements the most significant was the prohibition beginning january 1 2006 on the sale of medigap policies with prescription drug coverage individuals who previously had such policies could renew them provided they did not enroll in prescription drug plan under the new part d mma also provided for the establishment of two additional plan types which may be sold as medigap policies medicare coverage medicare consists of four distinct parts part hospital insurance hi part b supplementary medical insurance smi part c medicare advantage ma and part d the prescription drug benefit added by mma most beneficiaries get covered services through medicare parts and b also referred to as original medicare alternatively beneficiaries can choose to receive all their medicare services otherwise covered under parts and b through managed care plans under the ma program beginning january 1 2006 medicare beneficiaries have been able to purchase drug coverage through private plans offered by prescription drug plan pdp sponsors or through managed care organizations offering medicare advantage prescription drug mapd plans table 1 provides brief outline of the coverage offered under parts and b including associated costsharing charges table 1

2003 by jennifer osullivan hinda chaikind sibyl tilson jennifer boulanger and paulette morgan crs3 supplementary coverage most beneficiaries have some form of private or public coverage to supplement medicare in 2004 only 93 of communitybased beneficiaries relied solely on the traditional feeforservice program an additional 145 relied on coverage through their medicare managed care organization in 2004 607 of communitybased medicare enrollees had private supplemental coverage an additional 140 had coverage through medicaid and an additional 15 had other public sector coverage private insurance protection may be obtained through current or former employer 319 had such coverage in 2004 it may also be obtained through an individually purchased policy commonly referred to as medigap policy 288 had these plans in 20042 medigap medigap policies are intended to fill in some of the gaps in original medicare persons enrolled in medicare advantage plan generally do not need medigap plan because their ma plans generally cover some of the same benefits offered by medigap plans beneficiaries with medigap insurance typically have coverage for some or all of medicares deductibles and coinsurance when beneficiary receives care the medicare contractor pays first the contractor then forwards the claim directly to the medigap insurer which then pays its portion of the bill3 some medigap policies also cover some items and services not covered by medicare in this case the claim is sent directly to the medigap insurer the social security act contains certain requirements governing the sale of medigap policies4 policy choices standardized plans generally insurance companies can not sell medigap policies unless they conform to one of the standardized benefit packages individuals 2 medicare

naic these minimum standards known as the naic model standards are found in the naic model regulation the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the agency that administers medicare published notice in the federal register on march 25 2005 which recognized the latest version with clarifications adopted by the naic on september 8 2004 crs4 first purchasing medigap policy on or after july 30 1992 have been able to select from one of 10 standardized plans though not all 10 plans have been offered in all states the 10 plans are known as plans through j plan covers basic package of benefits each of the other nine plans includes the basic benefits plus different combination of additional benefits plan j is the most comprehensive see table 2 the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl10533 added two high deductible plans to the list of 10 standard plans with the exception of the high deductible feature the benefit package under the high deductible plan is the same as that under plan f or plan h the 2007 deductible under these plans is 1860 this approach removed firstdollar coverage which was expected to result in reduction in premiums reportedly few insurers have offered these high deductible plans as noted in table 2 plans h i and j include coverage for prescription drugs however effective january 1 2006 the effective date of the part d drug benefit new sales of policies with drug coverage are prohibited thus new h i and j policies sold on or after that date can not include drug coverage further medigap policy with an outpatient prescription drug rider can be sold individuals who purchased h i and j policies prior to january 1 2006 may keep and renew such policies provided they do not enroll in part d plan however there are potential consequences to this

waivered states the standardized plans do not apply to residents of massachusetts minnesota and wisconsin these states operated their own simplification programs prior to the enactment of the standardization requirements crs7 and were allowed to continue these programs they were however required to modify their regulatory programs to come into compliance with the mma requirements prestandardized plans beneficiaries first purchasing medigap policies prior to july 30 1992 may continue to renew such policies provided the insurer keeps offering them however the insurer may not sell these policies to any new enrollees there is considerable variation among the benefit packages offered by these pre standardized plans select medicare select is type of medigap policy which is available in some states select policy is one of the 10 standardized policies aj however purchasers of select policies are required except in an emergency to obtain care through specified hospitals and doctors in order to have the select plan pay its share of costs medicare always pays its share of costs regardless of whether or not the provider is or is not select provider policy selection interaction with medicare part d choices individuals purchase medigap policies based on decisions relating to health care needs and policy costs as result of the enactment of mma individuals who previously had medigap policies with drug coverage medigap rx policies had to make some decisions regarding their coverage after december 31 2005 medicare rx polices were defined as plans h i and j prestandardized policies with drug coverage and medigap policies with drug coverage riders mma established specific rules relating to medigap policies and drug coverage new medigap rx policies could longer be sold after december 31 2005 further drug coverage had to be eliminated from polices for persons who enrolled in drug plan under part d this included medigap policies with separate drug coverage rider medigap issuers had to provide written disclosure notice to each person who had medigap rx policy individuals receiving the notice had several choices they could enroll in drug plan under part d and keep their existing medigap policy with the drug coverage removed and an appropriate adjustment made to their premium if they enrolled in part d plan during the initial enrollment period which closed may 15 2006 they also had guaranteed right to buy another plan from the same issuer they could buy plan b c f k or l if these plans were offered by the issuer and available to new enrollees if an individual did not enroll in part d during the initial enrollment period he or she could keep their existing medigap rx policy however the individual lost the right to buy another medigap policy on guaranteed issue basis further there are consequences if the individual subsequently decides to enroll in part d first the individual can only enroll in part d during an annual open enrollment period november 15december 31for the following year second the individual will be subject to delayed enrollment penalty ie premium surcharge unless the medigap rx policy is considered to have creditable coverage ie meet the standard for actuarial equivalence that is having the same or greater dollar value as part d standard coverage crs8 cms stated that medigap issuers were responsible for determining if their policies met the requirements for creditable coverage it stated that it could not offer guidance for the likelihood that any particular prestandardized policy or policy in waivered state would meet the requirements however it determined that medigap policy h or i could qualify further it was possible but unlikely that plan j would qualify enrollment the law contains certain requirements relating to enrollment in medigap plans in certain cases beneficiaries are guaranteed the right to enroll in specified medigap plans under certain conditions these are known as guaranteed issue provisions sixmonth open enrollment federal law establishes an open enrollment period for the aged all insurers offering medigap policies are required to offer open enrollment for six months from the date person first enrolls in part b generally when the enrollee turns 655 during this time an insurer cannot deny the issuance or discriminate in the pricing of policy because of an individuals medical history health status or claims experience this requirement is known as guaranteed open enrollment if an individual applies for medigap policy after the open enrollment period the company is permitted to use medical underwriting this means that the company can use an individuals medical history to decide whether or not to accept the application and how much to charge for the policy there is guaranteed open enrollment period for the nonaged disabled population however when disabled person turns 65 that individual has the same open enrollment period as other aged persons guaranteed issue the law guarantees issuance of specified medigap policies without an exclusion based on preexisting condition for certain persons whose previous supplementary coverage was terminated guaranteed issue also applies to certain persons who elect to try out medicare advantage plan in these cases individuals are guaranteed issue of specific medigap plans generally b c f k or l that are sold to new enrollees by medigap insurers in the state6 the insurer is prohibited from discriminating in the pricing of such policy on the basis of the individuals health status claims experience receipt of health care or medical condition this right must be exercised within 63 days of termination of other enrollment table 4 summarizes the guarantee issue protections of the law under certain very specific conditions these protections apply to persons who lose coverage under employerbased plans medicare advantage plans or other medigap plans table 5 some persons who turn 65 and are still working may delay enrollment in part b the sixmonth enrollment period for these individuals would not begin until they actually enrolled in part b 6 note that plans b c f k or l may not be available in particular state crs9 4 highlights the event that triggers these protections the time period during which an affected individual can enroll in medigap plan and the types of medigap plans that are guaranteed crs10 table 4 guarantee issue protections last day to apply for medigap first day to apply for medigap current coverage trigger event under

allinclusive care for the elderly pace program for persons 65 or older that covers medicare benefits and certain longterm care services 2 medicare health maintenance organization cost contracts 3 medicare managed care demonstration projects and 4 medicare select plans if there is provision under applicable state law for continuation or conversion of coverage under such policy in general the guarantee only applies if the individual was never previously enrolled in ma or similar plan however special rules apply if an individual enrolls for the first time with ma organization and was in the plan less than one year before the plan left the program or stopped giving care in the area in this case the individual may enroll in another ma plan for up to one year and still keep the right to return to his or her old medigap policy also applies to enrollees in pace program crs12 preexisting condition exclusions for purposes of medigap pre existing conditions are defined as those diagnosed or treated during the six months immediately preceding the start of medigap policy at the time insurers sell medigap policy they are generally permitted to limit or exclude coverage for services related to preexisting health condition such preexisting condition exclusions cannot be imposed for more than six months however preexisting limitations may not be imposed at all in the following cases any individual who falls into one of the qualifying events categories discussed above under guaranteed issue these include persons whose previous coverage was involuntarily terminated or persons who elect to try out medicare advantage during the first sixmonth open enrollment period if on the date of application the individual had at least sixmonths of health insurance coverage meeting the definition of creditable coverage under the health insurance portability and accountability act if the individual has less than six months of creditable coverage the waiting period is reduced by the number of months of creditable coverage note that the insurer may impose preexisting exclusion limitation if the individual did not have such creditable coverage an individual who met the preexisting condition limitation in one medigap policy the individual does not have to meet the requirement under new policy for previously covered benefits however an insurer could impose exclusions for newly covered benefits ie for athome recovery if not covered under the previous policy the prohibition applies to persons who had coverage under prior policy for at least six months if the individual has less than six months prior coverage the policy must reduce the preexisting exclusion by the amount of the prior coverage implications of guaranteed issue protections the guaranteed issue provisions apply only to policies actually offered by insurers for example plans b c or f may not actually be available in particular state while beneficiaries leaving terminating ma plan may be able to obtain medigap coverage their outofpocket expenditures are likely to increase first they will have to pay the medigap premium second they may have to pay outofpocket for some services previously covered by the managed care plan but not covered under original medicare or their medigap policy finally it is possible that the drug coverage available through standalone part d drug plan may be more expensive than that available through the ma plan the guaranteed issue protections except for the one for persons who try ma upon turning 65 and disenroll within 12 months apply to both aged and disabled medicare enrollees however not all disabled persons will be able to take advantage of them because many medigap insurers do not market to the under65 population crs13 nor does federal law require these insurers to market to the disabled however number of states have instituted requirements guaranteeing access to medigap coverage for at least some of the disabled beneficiaries in these states may be able to take advantage of state rules7 policy renewal standardized policies are guaranteed renewable insurance companies in some states may refuse to renew prestandardized policies if company makes nonrenewal decision it must cancel all policies of the same type in the state the affected individuals have the right to purchase medigap plan b c f k or l sold in the state additional requirements the law and regulations contain number of additional provisions relating to the sale of medigap policies appendix provides an overview of these requirements including those relating to state regulatory programs medigap policies and policy issuers and policy sales medigap premiums there is wide variation in medigap premiums nationwide this reflects number of factors including differences in the benefits of plan through plan l as well as differences in nonstandardized policies differences in underwriting practices and the difference in pricing structures medigap insurers typically use one of three pricing mechanisms age at issue which bases the premium on the policyholders age when they first sign up attained age which bases the premium on the current age of the policyholder or community rating under which all policyholders pay the same rate attained age policies which are rapidly becoming the norm generally offer good rates to younger enrollees however premiums go up significantly as the policyholders age communityrated policies are not widely available the last available survey of medigap premiums is for 2005 the year before implementation of the part d drug benefit the survey conducted by weiss ratings inc found wide disparities in rates8 not only were there substantial variations between geographic regions but there were also dramatic differences for individuals purchasing identical plans in the same location there were significant differences between the minimum and maximum premium for each policy type for example for plan c one of the most popular plan types premiums ranged from 651 to 7 the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the agency that administers medicare reports that in 2007 the following states require insurance companies to offer at least one kind of medigap policy during special open enrollment period to people with medicare under age 65 california colorado connecticut hawaii kansas louisiana maine maryland massachusetts michigan minnesota mississippi missouri new jersey new york north carolina oklahoma oregon pennsylvania south dakota texas vermont and wisconsin 8 this survey is longer conducted crs14 9798 with an average premium of 1766 for plan f the other most popular plan type premiums ranged from 516 to 10799 with an average premium of 17569 current issues currently the major issues facing medigap are the types of policy options provided to medicare beneficiaries standardized plan options the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 obra 90 pl 101508 assigned the federal government responsibility for regulating medigap policies this legislation was enacted in response both to widespread marketing abuses in the sale of supplemental policies and consumer confusion with the wide array of policy choices among other things obra 90 provided for the standardization of medigap policies for number of years observers suggested that the existing standardized plans aj overemphasized firstdollar coverage namely coverage of medicares cost sharing charges which many beneficiaries could potentially budget for the plans included outofpocket protection for medicare costsharing charges further they provided limited or protection for services not covered by medicare such as longterm care services another consideration was the impact of private coverage on medicare spending some studies estimated that medicare spending for beneficiaries with supplemental coverage was significantly higher than expenditures for those without such coverage1011 higher medicare spending reflected higher overall use of services high service use among those with private supplementary coverage particularly medigap appeared to be direct consequence of having such insurance beneficiaries who faced little or outofpocket costs at the time they used services even though they paid an often substantial monthly premium for medigap may have perceived the services to be free comparison of service use between those with and without private supplementary coverage suggested that there may be some 9 httpwwwweissratingscomnewsins_medigap20050830medigappdf 10 review of 1995 data by the physician payment review commission pprc showed that medicare spending for medicare beneficiaries having medicare coverage only was less than 75 of that for beneficiaries with medigap medicare beneficiaries with employer provided benefits averaged 10 less than that for persons with medigap physician payment review commission annual report to congress 1997 washington 1997 11 study of 1994 data reported that medicare enrollees with medigap used 28 more services both inpatient and outpatient than those with supplementary coverage while those with employerbased coverage used 17 more the authors attributed the differences to the fact that medigap plans often covered all of medicares costsharing charges while employerbased plans typically did not sandra christensen and judy shinogle effects of supplemental coverage on use of services by medicare enrollees health care financing review vol 19 1 fall 1997 517 crs15 overutilization of services however some of the increase may represent appropriate service use these observations prompted number of recommendations for change some observers recommended that the standardized plans should be prohibited from offering firstdollar coverage for medicares costsharing charges medigap policies would begin paying only after the beneficiary had incurred some outofpocket costs12 this approach would be expected to make beneficiaries more cost conscious in their use of services and thereby hold down medicares expenditures proponents asserted that medigap premiums should drop and therefore become more affordable other observers noted that the elderly are risk adverse and may not want to be liable for any outofpocket costs further they argued that beneficiaries might forgo needed medical services because they would be unable to pay the costsharing charges mma changes mma provided for the establishment of two additional plan types which may be sold as medigap policies unlike plans ah these plans include significant beneficiary costsharing coupled with catastrophic limit on outofpocket costs the legislation did not however eliminate existing beneficiary choices they are still able to purchase plans ah with the requisite modifications in plans h i and j in theory insurers should be able to offer these policies for lower premiums thereby attracting some purchasers however the risk adverse nature of the elderly population may encourage them to continue purchasing plans that offer coverage for most outofpocket costs there are also questions relating to the interaction of part d with medigap purchase decisions it is possible that with the addition of drug coverage under part d and the accompanying premium some beneficiaries may elect to forgo medigap entirely data are not available to answer these questions naic recommendations mma required the secretary to request the naic to review and revise the medigap benefit packages taking into account changes made by the new law the naic announced its recommendations in march 2007 the recommendations as described by the naic would eliminate unnecessary and duplicative plans by eliminating plans h i and j which contained drug benefits and plan which becomes identical to another plan add 2 plan options with higher costsharing and lower estimated premiums 12 these outofpocket costs would however be considerably less than under the high deductible plans discussed earlier crs16 new plan m would include 50 coverage of the medicare part deductible and not cover the part b deductible new plan n would not cover the part b deductible and would add copayment of 10 for each physician visit and 50 for each emergency room visit waived upon admission to the hospital modernize certain benefits eliminate athome recovery benefit currently offered under plans d g i and j and substitute hospice benefit in all plans eliminate preventive care benefit in plans and j in recognition of additions to medicare over the years increase the 80 part b excess benefit under plan g to 100 the naic cautioned that these changes would require federal action before they could be implemented childrens health and medicare protection champ act champ hr 3162 passed by the house on august 1 2007 contains number of medicare provisions13 section 907 of the bill would require the secretary to accept the recommendations made by the naic in march 2007 as further modified by champ the section would require policy issuers to offer in addition to the core package at least policies classified as c or f the provision would also eliminate policies
