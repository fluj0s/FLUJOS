percentage is defined as all employer contributions divided by total compensation third test that at least 70 of nhces must be covered by the plan will automatically satisfy the first test listed abovespecial rule for small employers employers with 10 or fewer employees who earned 5000 or more during the prior year would be allowed to fund an ersa by contributing to custodial account similar to currentlaw ira provided that the employers contributions satisfy designbased safe harbor this would relieve firms with 10 or fewer employees from most of th fiduciary obligations reporting rules and disclosure requirements that apply to larger employers under the employee retirement income security act erisa as is the case under current law for the simple ira currentlaw requirements for empl oyersponsored re tirement savings plans taxqualified retirement plans cannot discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees hces with regard to coverage amount of benefits or availability of benefits highly compensated employee is defined in law as any employee who owns 5 or more of the company or whose compensation exceeds 90000 indexed to inflation an employer can elect to count as hces only employees who rank in the top 20 of compensation in th firm but it must include all 5 owners coverage and nondiscrimination to be taxqualifie d 401k plan must satisfy one of two tests either the proportion of nonhighly compensated employees nhces covered by the plan must be at least 70 of the proportion of highly compensated employees hces covered by the plan or the average contribution percentage for nhces must be at least 70 of the average contribution percentage for hces2 contributions to plan cannot discrimin ate in favor of hces plans that have aftertax contributions or matching contributions are subject to the actual contribution percentage acp test which measures the contribution ra to hces accounts relative to the contribution rate to nhces acc ounts some 403b plans are subject to nondiscrimination rules 457 plan s generally are not the act ual contribution percentage of hces in 401k plan generally cannot exceed the limits shown in table 1 table 1 maximum average 401k contributions for highly compensated employees nonhighly compensated employees nhces h ighly compensated employees hces maximum average deferral and match maximum average deferral and match 2 of pay or less nhce percentage x 2 2 to 8 of pay nhce percentage 2 8 of pay or more nhce percentage x 125 note deferral and match is the sum of employer and employee contributions any of three safeharbor designs are deemed to satisfy the acp test automatically for employer matching contributi ons up to 6 of compensation the employer matches 100 of empl oyee elective deferrals up to 3 of compensation and 50 of elective deferrals between 3 and 5 of compensation and all employer matchi ng contributions are fully vestedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21451crs4 3 the contribution percentage would be calculat ed for each employee as the sum of all employee and employer contributions divide d by the employees compensationemployer matching contributions can follow any other matching formula that results in total matching contri butions that are less than under the first design all employer matching contributions vest immediately the employer automatically contribut an amount equal to at least 3 of pay for all eligible nhces employer contributions vest immediately all 401k plans must satisfy an actual deferral percentage adp test which measures employees ectivedeferral rates the same numerical limits are used as under the acp test three safeharbor designs similar to the safeharbor designs for the acp test are deemed to satisfy the adp test auto matically in addition crosstesting allows definedcontribution plans to satisfy th nondiscrimination test s based on projected account balances at retirement age rather th an current contribution rates this permits bigger contributions for older workers because higherpaid employees receive proportionally smaller social security benefits relative to earnings than lowerpaid workers employers are permitted to make larger contributions on earnings in excess of the social security wage base 90000 fo r 2005 regulations limit the size of the permitted disparity in favor of workers whose earni ngs are above the wage base vesting topheavy plans employee contributions to an employersponsored plan are immediately and fully vested employer contributions must vest at least as quickly as mandated under law under cliff vesting employees must be fully vested in matching contributions after three years of service and fully vested in all other employer contributions after five ears of service under graded vesting employees must be 20 vested in matching contributions after two years of service and fully vested after six years of service with respect to all other em ployer contributions employees must be 20 vested after three years of service and fully ve sted after seven years of service additional requirements apply to plans in which more than 60 of the benefits accrue to key employees defined as 1 company fficers whose compensation exceeds 130000 2 those who own more than 5 of the compan and 3 those who own more than 1 and have compensation that exceeds 150000 top h eavy plans are subject to an accelerated vesting schedule and stricter requirements for minimum bene fits and contributions for nonkey employees administrations proposal the presidents proposed budget for fy2006 would substantially change several aspects of employmentbased retirement savings plans ersa nondiscrimination testing there would be single test for nondiscrimination with respect to contribu tions if the nonhighly compensated employees average contribution is 6 of pay or less the average contribution of highly compensated employees could be more th an twice the nhce percentage if the average contribution of the nonhighly comp ensated employees exceeds 6 there would be nondiscrimination test3 plans sponsored by state and local governments would be exempted plans sponsored by charitable or ganizations would be exempted unless they permit aftertax employee contributions or make matching contributions but all employees would have to be allowed to pa rticipate the acp and adp tests would be repealed safe harbor plan design would satisfy the nondiscrimination test forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21451crs5 ersas plan would qualify under the safe rbor if all nhces elig ible to participate in the plan are eligible to receive fully vested employer contributions equal to at least 3 of pay both matching and nonelective i automatic employer contributions would count toward satisfying the nondiscrimina tion test however if the employer contributions of 3 of compensation for nhces are matching contributions rather than nonelective contributions the match formula must be one of two qualifying formulas an employer match of 50 of empl oyee deferrals up to 6 of pay or any alternative formula in which the rate of the matching contribution does not increase as the employees elective contributions increase and b the aggregate amount of matching contributions at given rate of elective deferrals is at least equal to the aggregate amount of matching contributions that would be made if the match were ma on the basis of the percentages described in the first formula also the rate of matching contribution with respect to an hce at any rate of elective contribution could be greater than the matching rate for an nhce the date for aftertax r oth contributions to ersas would be january 1 2006 under current law participan ts in 401k and 403b plan s can elect roth treatment for their contributions on january 1 2006 r oth contributions would not be excluded from income but qualified dist ributions would be taxfree coverage topheavy plans permitted disparity crosstesting and highlycompensated employees plans would continue to be required to cover percentage of nonhighly compensated employees that is at least 70 of the percentage of highly compensated employees that are c overed this test woul d be applied in the same manner as under current law the averag deferral percentage adp test and the average contribution percentage acp test would be repealed the currentlaw topheavy rules would be retained the permitted disparity rules and crosstesting rules would continue as under current law both the definition of compensation and the definition of highlycompensated empl oyee would remain as in current law the treasury department s offered several reasons for the proposed changes to individual retirement accounts and employersponsor ed retirement plans they state that the many rules regarding eligibility contributions withdrawals and tax treatment to which savings accounts are subject create complexity and redundancy in the tax code taxpayers must periodically reevalu ate their eligibility for each type of account as their financia l circumstances change nonretirement withdrawals from iras weaken the focus on retirement saving restrictions on withdraw als and additional taxes on early distributions discourage many taxp ayers from making contributions consolidating the three types of ir as into one account and creating new account that could be used for any reason would simplify the taxpayers decisionmaking process while further encouraging savings simplifying the rules making savi ngs opportunities universally available and making it easier for people to t money aside through direct deposit would encourage financial edu cation and retirement planninghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21451crs6 4 administration announces r evised savings proposals aspa feb 2 2004 5 us congressional budget office an analysis of the presidents budgetary proposals for fiscal year 2004 mar 2003 p 25 6 bush to tinker with proposals to revamp savings plans congress daily jan 30 2004 7 j barry griswell chairman principa l financial group press release jan 28 2004policy issues one reason that small employer s sponsor retirement plans is that the business owners can participate in the plans which allow them to save more for retirement on taxdeferred basis than they c ould save in an ira the maximum annual salary deferral under 401k plan is 14000 in 2005 which is 6000 more than married couple can contribute to an ira in its budget for fy2004 the administration proposed maximum annual contributions to rsas and lsas of 7500 per account for each individual some pension specialists were concerned that small business owners would be less likely to sponsor retirement plan s for their workers if married couples could together contribute as much as 30000 per year to rsas and lsas in response to these concerns the administration reduced the proposed maximum annual contributions to both rsas and lsas from 7500 to 5000 each the proposal for fy2006 also would allow firms with 10 or fewer employees to establish custodial account ersa plans similar to simple iras this would relieve very small firms of many of the administrative tasks required of larger firms that sponsor retir ement plans as result of theses changes the american society of pension actuaries aspa believes the proposals will not negatively affect small business retirement plan coverage4 other analysts are concerned that the pr oposals would benefit ma inly higherincome individuals who do not need additional tax incen tives to save for retirement and that the plans will substantially reduce fu ture federal tax re venue without any net increase in total national saving in analyzing similar propos in the presidents budget for fy2004 the congressional budget office concluded that m ost taxpayers would simply save the same amount in one of the new accounts as they woul d have saved in one of their current tax free accounts and that people who currently have assets in ta xable accounts could reduce their tax liability by selling those assets and putting the cash from the sale into the tax preferred accounts an action that w ould have effect on private saving5 another concern is that lifetime saving s account would promote consumption over savings because account balances could be w ithdrawn at any time for any purpose the american council of life insurers has said that lsas will harm the retirement security of american families by siphoning longterm sa vings into shortterm vehicle where it would be accessed early and of ten for nonretirement purposes6 another financial institution has said that lsas target the wrong kind of savings because individual savers can withdraw money for any reason at any time with penalty investors will have little incentive to save longterm for financial security at retirement7 bills in the 109th congress hr 1162 and s 546 would establish retirement savings accounts hr 1163 and s 545 and would establish life time savings accounts congress took action on these bills in 2005
