quarter of century depositions in the legislative branch are often taken by committee staff but members sometimes are involved in the process depositions may be desirable alternative to committee hearing enabling panel to obtain the information that it needs quickly confidentially and without the attendance of members however concerns have been raised that staff depositions may compromise the rights of deponents and restrict the role of the minority in the investigative process on number of occasions authority for committee staff to take depositions has been granted pursuant to senate and house resolutions committees that have been granted deposition authority often adopt rules establishing procedures for depositions assuming arguendo that staff depositions are appropriately authorized the two main legal issues presented by these depositions are enforcement of subpoena for staff deposition and b sanctions for false statements in such deposition there are three methods of citing witness for contempt of congress statutory criminal contempt 2 usc 192 and 194 and the inherent contempt power may be utilized by either the senate or the house the statutory civil contempt mechanism 28 usc 1365 is by its terms available only to the senate it may be argued that any of these three methods could be utilized to enforce subpoena for staff deposition however in recent investigations in which the house has authorized staff depositions by standing committee the majority and minority have debated the propriety of citing deponent for contempt for failure to appear at such deposition or to answer questions in such proceeding if he subsequently respond s fully at committee hearing witness who makes false statement in deposition given before committee staff might be prosecuted under various statutory provisions including 18 usc 1001 false statements 1505 obstruction of investigation or 1621 perjury of course prosecution under the perjury statute would be possible only if the witness was placed under oath in resolutions adopted in recent years authorizing depositions the house and senate often have provided for the taking of such depositions under oath arguably indicating that in the view of congress statements at such depositions could be subject to perjury prosecution although judicial decisions afford an inadequate basis for definitive determination as to whether all of the elements of the perjury statute could be satisfied in prosecution of witness for statement made in staff deposition administration of an oath puts witness on notice of the significance attached by the committee to his depositionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95949abstract this report provides legal analysis of issues relating to staff depositions in congressional investigat ions depositions

the process in some circumstances depositions may be desirable alternative to hearing enabling panel to obtain the information that it needs quickly confidentially and without the attendance of members5 since depositions are conducted in private witnesses may be more willing to talk freely than in an open hearing and statements by witnesses that might defame or even tend to incriminate third parties can be verified before the statements are repeated in an open hearing deposition can help committee prepare for questioning witness at hearing or can eliminate the need to call some witnesses however concerns have been raised that staff depositions may circumvent the traditional committee process ie hearings and informal staff interviews and depending on the terms of the resolution authorizing such depositions and related committee procedural rules compromise the rights of deponents and restrict the role of the minority in the investigative process6 furthermore executive

investigatory power depositions need to be examined as tool that can be used in the exercise of congress constitutionallyrooted investigatory power the supreme court has considered that power to be inherent in the legislative process9 in the leading case of mcgrain v daugherty the court explained legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change and where the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite informationwhich not infrequently is truerecourse must be had to others who do possess it experience has taught that mere requests for such information often are unavailing and also that information which is volunteered is not always accurate or complete so some means of compulsion are essential to obtain what is neededhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95949crs4 10273 us 135 175 1927 see also barenblatt v united states 360 us 109 111 1959 11the courts have upheld

also decisional law the court in hvass ruled that the perjury statute applied to statement at judicial hearing held pursuant to local rule of federal district court which rule was clearly authorized by statutory provisions see also chrysler v brown 441 us 281 295 1979 properly promulgated substantive agency regulations have the force and effect of law continuedfalse statement willfully made as to facts material to the hearing69 there would appear to be particular difficulty in satisfying the third element in the context of congressional staff deposition and accordingly the focus here is on the first two elements70 authorization for oath it perhaps should be emphasized that perjury unlike the false statements statute and the obstruction provision would apply only where the statement in question is made under oath there appears to be statute which expressly authorizes the administration of an oath in the course of congressional staff depositions nevertheless at least three possible sources of the required authorization for the oath might be considered unfortunately case law provides an insufficient basis for definitive answers to various questions that might be raised in regard to these possible sources for the authorization 1 there is general statutory provision permitting local notary public to administer an oath for purposes authorized or required under federal law71 does this provision constitute sufficient authorization for administrat ion of an oath in staff depositions or does it only render local notary public competent to administer an oath72 2 the house and senate have authorized staff depositions in resolutions establishing select investigating committees or providing for particular investigations by standing committees73 would such resolution if it specifies that deposition is to be given under oath suffice as the authorization for the oath74 3 supreme courthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95949crs21 74continued is house or senate resolution rule within the meaning of hvass if so does congress rulemaking authority under art i 5 cl 2 of the constitution which is the supreme law of the land art iv 2 provide lawful authorization as required by hvass for the adoption of the rule notwithst anding the fact that there is statutory authorizat ion for such congressional rule would the court today find that house or senate resolution provides authorization for an oath notwithstanding its ruling in ins v chadha 462 us 919 952 1983 that changes in the legal rights and duties of persons outside the legislative branch must be enacted by statute would such resolution come within the exception to chadha id at 955 n21 which recognizes the right of each house by simple resolution to make rules governing its proceedings would such resolution establishing procedures to assure that information received by congress is truthful be deemed like congress subpoena power to compel the disclosure of information to be outside the bounds of the chadha holding see

committee did not constitute competent tribunal to take deposition pursuant to house resolution granting deposition authority because the deposition was not authorized in accordance with the procedure outlined in the continuedcompetent tribunal in christoffel v united states prosecution for perjury at committee hearing the supreme court held that for congressional committee to be competent tribunal within the meaning of the perjury statute quorum must be actually and physically present at the time perjurious statement is made77 the court in that case recognized congress authority to determine in its rules the competency of tribunal to take testimony78 and the house79 and senate80 both generally authorize committees to establish reduced quorum provisions for the taking of testimony at hearings attended by members can the house and senate under their rulemaking power render committee staff competent tribunal for purposes of the perjury statute in recent district court ruling it was determined that committee staff constituted competent tribunal where staff depositions had been authorized by senate resolution81 is there way of satisfying the competent tribunal requirement if committee staff are not deemed competent under 1621 as discussed above it may be possible to satisfy the quorum requirement under the criminal contempt statute by establishing procedure for questioning by staff alone but having member rule perhaps by telephone on any objections raised by the witness82 it is possible to have member present at critical time for purposes of contempt citation since the witness objection can alert committee staff to the need for members presence but witness on the verge of committing perjury is unlikely to provide similar warning that it is time to have member present to hear the false material statement83httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95949crs23 83continued committees rules united states v galifianakis crim 790179 ddc aug 3 1979 deposition authority

were found guilty of lying before investigating committees were imprisoned apparently as an exercise of the contempt power another issue that has arisen in regard to the competent tribunal requirement is whether that requirement is satisfied when committee to bolster potential prosecut ion recalls witness in an attempt to elicit testimony inconsistent with his prior testimony the courts have ruled that if committee questions witness for the purpose of establishing or solidifying the basis of perjury indictment rather than to obtain facts in aid of legislation then the committee is not acting as competent tribunal84 committee might also be held to be an incompetent tribunal if it were to call witness to testify at hearing for the purpose of highlighting inconsistencies with statements he had made in deposition thereby providing basis for perjury prosecution85 contempt it might perhaps be argued that making false statements amounts to refusal to answer and therefore could be punished as contempt false swearing before judicial tribunal has been held to be insufficient to constitute contempt86 except where the purpose of the false statement is to obstruct justice87 on the basis of such an obstruction theory it might be possible to punish false statement to congressional committee under the inherent contempt power88 or perhaps even under the criminal contempt of congress statute in

in case based on false sworn statements in congressional staff deposition the ruling does suggest that that statute may be employed by prosecutor in such casemisdemeanor charge of criminal contempt rather than stand trial for perjury making false statements or obstructing congressional investigation which are felonies89 conclusion staff depositions can play an important role in congressional investigation permitting witnesses to be interviewed at length without the need for members to devote substantial amounts of time to the gathering of information depositions have been authorized by the house and senate in number of major recent probes however questions may arise concerning the ability to enforce subpoena for staff deposition by means of contempt sanctions and the application to such deposition of statutes that prohibit false statements it appears that good argument could be made that the criminal contempt statute 2 usc 192 would be applicable to failure to comply with subpoena for staff deposition or failure to respond to questions at deposition at least if the committee has adopted rules of procedure providing for involvement of member if witness raises an objection and refuses to answer witness who makes false statement in deposition given before committee staff might be prosecuted under various statutory provisions including 18 usc 1001 false statements 1505 obstruction of investigation or 1621 perjury of course prosecution under the perjury statute would be possible only if the witness was placed under oath in resolutions adopted in recent years authorizing depositions the house and senate often have provided for the taking of such depositions under oath arguably indicating that in the view of congress statements at such depositions could be subject to perjury prosecution although judicial decisions afford an inadequate basis for definitive determination as to whether all of the elements of the perjury statute could be satisfied in prosecution of witness for statement made in staff deposition90 administration of an oath puts witness on notice of the significance attached by the committee to his deposition
