disability and the vete ran is also determined by va to have copayment responsibilities va will apply the payment collected from the insurer to satisfy the veterans copayment debt related to that treatment under the current copayment billing process in cases where the cost of veterans medical care for nonservicec onnected condition appears to qualify for billing under reimbursable insurance and c opayment va medical facilities sends the bill to the insurance provider the vete rans copayment obligation is placed on hold for 90 days pending payment from the thirdparty payer if payment is received from the thirdparty payer within 90 days then bill is sent to the veteran for the full copayment amount however when insure rs reimburse va after the 90day period va must absorb the cost of additional staff time for processing refund if the veteran has already paid the bill on all insura nce policies the entire amount of the claim payment is applied first to the copayment the veteran is then billed only for the portion of the copayment not covered by the insurance re imbursement and the portion of the copayment for services not covere d by the veterans insurance plan see figure
