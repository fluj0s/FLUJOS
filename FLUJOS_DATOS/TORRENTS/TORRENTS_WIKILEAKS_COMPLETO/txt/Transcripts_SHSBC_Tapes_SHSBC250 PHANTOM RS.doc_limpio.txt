phantom rs lecture given on 11 december 1962 okay and this is the second lecture saint hill special briefing course 11 december ad 12 and thethis lecture concerns 212 the first lecture here wasthis had to do with the basics of approaches to 212 some data on ot this lecture concerns special manifestation and some other odds and ends on 212 this special manifestation is called phantom rock slam sounds like something out of the lone ranger or something but thats so you wont forget it phantom slam its going to cause you more trouble than anything else youre going to get somebody all grooved in and they can go through all the notions of 212 and then theyre going to run into phantom slam and now theyre going to have trouble now i mentioned this phantom slam many many many lectures ago many many weeks ago and i said i was studying it theres more to it now i now have studied it i know what phantom slam isgiven great deal of lime to it and lot of auditing on it and lot of work with it now this is not rare manifestation to give you some sort of an idea staff staff auditor number one in one of the central organizations on the first three staff pcs found each one of them with phantom slam didnt now what it was and started burning the teletypes didnt know what this thing was the teletypes got burned for another reason and that was requesting permission to grab what was slamming in the rudiments and oppose it now this permission is about the same as asking permission to step off empire state building without parachute now this is first and the foremostthe first thing you must know about phantom slam is just this that you mustnt grab slams out of rudiments and mid ruds because you now know what the pc is slamming on you just mustnt do that you must get your rock slamming items off the record in other words get those things either by straight 212 or old security checks or something of the sortcase data that is fairly consistent and fairly straight because peculiarly enough the phantom slam will attach itself to anything and everything in the rudiments and today the pc is slamming on joe bill and pete and tomorrow is slamming on mistletoe only the pc never slammed on joe bill and pete and never slammed on mistletoe and you can wind yourself up with peculiar phenomenon the only touchy point in auditing of 212 is opposing something which isnt rock slamming item and when you do this you may get rock slam in your opposition list but itll be cyclic sort of proposition you will get rock slam and itll go out to dirty needle and then it will go clean and then you will get rock slam and dirty needle and itll go clean and you get rock slam and dirty needle and go clean sometimes the rock slam will even dwindle and then you get rock slam and dirty needle and then it goes clean and this im talking about is every two pages or every three pages worth of items you go through this cycle and you just keep going through this cycle and you go on and on and on through this cycle and this cycle never ends and you start after youve got three hundred items you say well thats pretty good id better try to null this andnot nullable you cant get the ruds in you cant do anything and so on pc perfectly willing to give you more items and pc perfectly willing you see to put things down youve got rock slams everything is fineapparently you see but you cant null the darn thing and you get three items four items null and then bangbang and everything is in and bangbang and the needle goes dirty and so forth and you add to the list and you try to null and you cant do it this is peculiar to the opposition list by the way you got this confounded cycle going ill tell you how to get list like this is lets carefully take an assessment of items the pc does not react to lets very carefully sort this out one of the ways of doing it would be to say what objects are in this room and make little list and then ignore all those that react on the needle and take one that doesnt pick one that youre sure doesnt react on the needle now insist the pc oppose it and oddly enough the pc very often will be very glib and oppose it and feel much better and youll get this confounded cycling thing and it may even rock slam but you will just about go daffy with this list because it never becomes nullable list that phenomenon does exist you have to know about that phenomenon because very often it is necessary to take list one that somebody said rock slammed last august during sec check run in upper lower bulawayothat they rock slammed on pabs now you wouldnt pay any attention to that until youd laid three dead horses on representsdead horses rock slams rock slams rock slams you cant seem to turn on rock slam during listing on this case well now you must assume that this case rock slammed at sometime ot another on list one one of the things thats going to be upsetting about 2 12 is people are going to go aroundrock slammers are going to go around theyre going to say you see the reason we use list one is just because ron is fixated on this idea of security see and hesof course you can understand how he wants to protect scientology and its organizations and scientologists and so forthbut hes just got this bug dont you see and actually you dont need to do list one at all you never have to have anything to do with that it doesnt matter scientology benefits anyway and you dont pay any attention to that because thats just nonsense and we will only use the auxiliary lists and then youre going to have somebody laying dead horses and being very unhappy and the longer they audit the more miserable theyre going to get and the case is not going to make any real progress and theyve just been let in for it man well the phenomenon is this and this is also very muchvery pertinent with the phantom slam that which is helping the person is the enemy of the person and so he never will accept the help hes got an enemy mixed up with the auditing session there it is right there in the session its right here right now in present time it isnt some esoteric thing like an auditor gypped him out of some money back in lower chicago see that had nothing to do with it its right here its right now and thats what you have to know about the phantom slamits right here its right now it isnt yesterday and it isnt the wife and it isnt this and it isnt that and it isnt prpt problem he has out of session that he came into session withits right here its right in this session now list one is where its right here its right in this session see its scientology that is being used on the person dont you see its the rules of various specific personnel that are being used on the pc dont you see theyre being run on an emeter theyre in session got that and if those things are neglected it just goes onthat slam is just theyre never located never never never never located now the most crude manifestation of this is the phantom slam and here it is you see it and now you dont see it and you see it and now dont see it so hereslet go into this little bit further somebodys going ojust to finish off this other thoughtsomebodys going to say well hats just security and thats just so those damn scientologists come out and us psychiatrists can really make something out of this you see all of sudden they start auditing themselves into hole it doesnt work nothing works for them it all goes by the boards plaghh understand it really is true that person cannot havei dont care if he analytically and intellectually can have the helphe cant have the help if hes rock slamming on it see if its mortal enemy of his he just cant have it because his attention on the help is what he gets fed back into the bank from an enemy and he just cant stand this and if you ignore this hell just go ondead horses dead horses hell feel little tiny bit better and hell feel little tiny bit better this is so much the case that sooner or later on just deadhorsing case you just have to assume that at some time or another he rock slammed on list one he does not now rock slam on list one we cannot now find the rock slam on list one it is submerged in some way and we dont know how to were just going to take three or four or five or six key points of list one and were going to tiger drill the things and get any one of them to tick and then were going to oppose it just for the hell of it and then all of sudden itll turn on rock slam and so forth yeah but it doesnt turn on cyclic slam it turns on slam that goes on out and produces reliable item see and bang gives you nullable list all of sudden these two things go together the case starts to fly at once you understand that phenomena all right now the most flagrant and the most baffling case of this is he phantom slam now you see the case i was just talking about it doesnt slam at all now theres quite the reverse theres the case that just slams slams and slams and slams the auditor sneezes and the case slams i can tell you an awful lot about this phantom slam it is really goofy it makes lists look like theyre slamming when they arent and eventually the auditor wont be able to tell whether hes got phantom slam or real slam hes just done list but every time the pc had the tiniest little withhold in he sessionmoved his foot and didnt tell the auditorhes got rock slam at that moment the auditor is saying pigs so he marks down on the list rs pigs rs see and then the withhold continues to have force till the pc changes his mind or something for the next few items so hes got rs rs rs this is nice you know rs and then its gone now he goes over the list again and although it is not always true thatits seldom true that something that rsed while being written down rses during nulling as matter of fact it doesnt mean thing if something that rsed when it was written down doesnt rs when youre nulling just forget it dont even expect it to your test is whether or not youve got itone rsing item while youre nulling thats the one thing youve got to have see but in this particular ease you just never getyou got these rses and as youre nulling the ones that had rs all marked with rs they longer rs but this onethis one willow wand which didnt rs while it was being listed rses only you now say willow wand and it doesnt rs man this is stuff for the nut house you know and you just get kind of baffled after while you say what the hell is going on here and if you keep on auditing this pc you will eventually realize that the rs has nothing to do with what youre doing with r212 the rs turns on incidentally and its likely to turn on more powerfully on charged list if the list is heavily charged list natively that has its own rs on now youll get far more rses because of the phantom slam see see youre busy listing something that does have some rock slams on it well the presence of the phantom slam makes practically everything on the list rock slam theres real enthusiasm and then you get right on down to the end of it and you say well theres my item pigs you know theres my item pigs and you get right on down there bang pigs it rock slammed the first time i went by it on pigs has anything been suppressed on pigs has anything been invalidated man theyre the deadest pigs you ever had anything to do with you were betting your bottom dollar on pigs because you saw it rock slam the first time through and you come back and it never rock slams again you just chased an rs all over the place it chases all over the list it chases over tiger drills it chases here and it chases there and thats the phantom rock slam and it can really louse up 212 now you see this is not very rare this is not very rare if i tell you the first three cases run by staff auditorstaff staff auditor number one in central organization on staff were all phantom rock slam eases so by george we had better know great deal about this so i have practically audited eyeballs out trying to find out everything i could find out about this confounded manifestation and the test is this does the pc rs in rudiments or mid ruds particularly in this new form of goal finders model session where youre putting in since mid ruds since big mid ruds to start the session withsince the last time i audited you in other words put your big mid ruds in and youll find out that needle will be awful smooth an awful lot of the time particularlyi dont care whether theyre put in that way for listing session but for nulling session they must have been put in that way since the last time i audited you or since the last time you were audited if its new pc has anything been you see and then you just move in your big mid ruds right straight across the boards all right that type of operation will get more rudiments in than you can shake stick at its actually more powerful rudimenting than old model session this is really really gunned up and if such rudiments are put in at the end of the session youre putting in more end ruds than youve ever put in before too particularly if youre careful with the room and havingness but thats beside the point because thats details that are coming up and its simply smoothout of model session you see these various changes of one kind or another but they have bearing and i mention that just in passing here only for this reason if youre using any type of mid rud which gets from the last session or covers any type or period of livingness at the beginning of session or during the session or something like this and you see rses turn on an rs turn on or if youre using oldtype model session you saw an rs turn onwatch it man because youre auditing phantom slam now sometimes the pc graduates upstairs to having one and you feel youre perfectly safe and everything is fine and so forth actually your pc was below rock slamming and you unburden the case and the ease is making good advances and one day you sit down and find yourself facing phantom slam in other words the pc can move upstairs into one now slam on case will go through cycle as you unburden case it can come into rock slamming see it didnt rock slam on certain subject or area before but it moves into rock slamming then the rock slam becomes very frantic and very intensethis is plotted against quantities of hours of auditing dont you see numbers of sessions id saylets say over period of couple of weeks of auditing youre liable to see one of these things which was very tame rs turn into very frantic one and then start to cool now were talking about phantom slam you see and then it gets cooler and cooler and finally is almost lazy rock slam its hardly rock slam at all you keep unburdening it and then one day you hit the actual item right on the button and all the characteristics of the slam come back for that item crashcrashcrash crashcrashcrashcrashcrashcrash because you hit it right straight on the button so it can appear to go away it can appear to get more frequent it can appear to get less frequent it can all of sudden develop on pc who is moving up scale by reason of finding packages it can tend to disappear because youre finding packages in other words the characteristics of this thing can change and theres particular way that you can spot and say that is the pcs phantom slam see thatit will be more or less the same width but different speeds and it can simply materialize out of the blue you know he never had phantom slam before in his life and youve found three consecutive sets of packages on him and one day you sit down and you say since the last time i audited you has anything been suppressed guess i left him stuck in the last item all right and it finally gets the suppressions off and it goes off you know m right since the last time i audited you has anything been invalidatedcrashcrashcrashcrashcrashcrashcrashcrashcrashaash crashcrashcrashcrashcrash and he gives you an answer and thats all heres theheres horrible mistake oh he says since the last time i audited you has anything been invalidated he says i invalidated what joe said about his pc and the slam turns on and you say joe and youll get the slam back because you havent got all of the rudiments in so you say joe joe and because youve changed it and he objects to it his withhold turns the slam back on and you say joe joe hey what do you know ive got slamming item here joe hohohoho god help you you have slamming item named joe now look ive kept records of these things ive taken goals lists and have spotted every type of goal the pc slammed on and they all bear relationship its all understandable it can be measured up you can figure it out within two or three dynamics i mean you can get close see its either the 2nd dynamic or the 3rd dynamic or mankind or god you can drive yourself halfway around the bend trying to figure one of these things out im not kidding you man i really had the old wits tuned up to high whine on this onewheels skidding all the way too now ive seen these things turn on they are just not related to one case here inexplicable how the devil how come how are we missing on this ease hows this going well its just this phantom slam makes everything look like it rock slams if the pc happens to have withhold and youre saying the item at the same time then you get wyou see but the more heavily charged the item is the more likely youre to get rock slam on the item so that item is charged today joe is charged today so all today weve got rock slam on joe soon as we clean up joe we havent got rock slam on joe we now have rock slam on peanuts not even the same dynamic area and you can hunt one of these things down and my whole message to you isdont what is phantom slam phantom slam is rock slam that turns on in the rudiments any rock slam that turns on in the rudiments any pc who consistently has rock slams turn on in the rudiments or running general ow thats marvelous one to get phantom slams in oh you can just drive yourself round the bend you see what have you done well ive uh been mean to joe today rock slam joe joe joe haha joe hey what do you know what have you withheld you see you eventually get back to that you know uhwell i didnt tell joe something or other and so on and you say joe jwhere the hell its gone what happened as long as he had slight withhold from joe joe rock slammed oh how cruel but its during the rudiments one that turns on during the rudiments now youre safe as long as you never get rock slams when running general ow and during the rudiments youre perfectly safe but you get any occasionaleven an occasionalrock slam while doing rudiments youve got case thatll phantom slam and that case will make liar and an idiot out of you in listing youll be listing away dont think you cant make any progress at all because you will every now and then you accidentally find real rock slam the rest of the time its just the fluke of whether or not the pc has tiny withhold from you or the remainder of the dynamics and that creates rock slam pc feels little bit chilly at the time youre going down the last part of the last five items oh man youve had it because you goevery one of thems in theyre all slamming beautifully and then you sayyou decide to put in the session mid ruds you see this is youve already said well four items are slamming on the list this was marvelous you know oh we had wonderful session you know and the pc looks like hell but you know i had wonderful session and so forth and youre putting in the end rudiments you know i mean youre putting in mid ruds for the end of the session you know pc says i was cold slam slam slam slam i was quite cold earlier in the session and you go back and you say tiger tiger waterbuck fireman there isnt slam in the lot disheartening every so often youll be patching up somebodys line plot thats been done in coaudit and youll be taking this line plot and youll find out that there are twentyfour listed items that have been found over period of eight and half years of auditing or something and youll find out that only one of them slams twentythree dont and you say well the charge all dissipated the poor auditor was bucking phantom slam the whole waywas making liar out of him so you see how important it is to know about this particular thing it is important now this would all be pretty desperate if i hadnt figured out the solution to the thing and got the thing taped but i wouldnt tell you of the ghastliness of the whole thing unless i had some resolution to the thing and the resolution is very very simple you get the rest of what phantom slam is phantom slam is turned on by something in immediate instant present time of the session by something immediately in or in the vicinity of the session you neednt memorize all that just remember im just trying to tell you its right here see it isnt the fact that they just had an argument with the d of p see the d of p is down the hall how the hell can they rock slam see the d of p isnt in the room its got to be right here man and the way you smoke one of these things out now ive altered your list one so it will contain practically anything but if you dont find slif youve got phantom slam and the pc doesnt slam in anything you find in list one do something and this is what you do you get with the pcs help very possible element of which session consisted you would make special list and on that list you would make damn sure that you included every part of the pc such as joe you yourself my mind george riloysius doakesfull name see you lay all this down here see and you et list of this thing youve got the meter you notice on the back of meter youve got hco so for gods sakes get hco down on it dont youyou see what i mean you get badges symbols tables chairs you know auditor menwith the pcs help you know the auditor can list as many f these things as he wants to this is one of these peculiar lists then he has get the pc to complete it we get everything in this session and youre going to find the phantom lam thats everything in this session that is right here right now and youll find the phantom slam oh yes he has overts on what it will be if it turns out to be the meter yes now for the first time you begin to get enough realization you see because he slams on it he cant recognize it he cant perceive it he doesnt even know its there therestheres beenalways been hole in the session called an emeter see and he wont give you any of thehe wont give you any any help on this really you have to say you know is it this and how about puttingputting table cloth see how about that wood roofs rooms airgot the idea thats the phantom slam now my bet is that the greatest number of these will turn out to be myselffirst dynamic my bet is that youll have majority of first dynamic things could be for instance but translated over into my mind dont you see or something its something right in the vicinity of the first dynamic its that close to home pc fighting himself that kind of thing see i think your greatest majority of them will be that but this onenow youre saved by the bell with this because you can fumble through and youll find out the phantom slam will get moreand you do find some items your itemsyouve got to be awful careful in auditing case like this but you do find some packages you do make some progress with the case see you grareally cant help it with 212 you push it ahead ne way or the other case isnt going to make as much progress because hes got ptp thats right present in the session all the time but you couldnt find it dont blow your brains out because just the processdont worry the pc about it eitherjust the process of going on and finding some packages and finding some packages will show you that this slam is changing in characteristic as you find it in the rudiments and it changes and it gets more and more to pt and it gets more and more sudden and it gets more and more constant and you theoretically could find packages till one day the pc blurted it out pc says its neckties there it is slams now the only test of whether or not youve gotten the phantom slamthis is the only testis it doesnt reoccur thats the only test so you really dont know for several sessions whether or not youve got the phantom slam but youll see one of these things and the only thing i could hope wont happen to you is halfway through auditing somebody he makes sufficient improvement one way or the other for the thing to turn on then you dont recognize that phantom slam has occurred and now you just find all kinds of rock slams and you find all kinds of slamming items but nothing ever stays in except now and then one slams consistently and you say isnt that nice but when you oppose it its still there theres way you can sort of wash this one out because everything youre finding is phantom slam see youre actually not finding its opposition at all hideous to contemplate isnt it the only thing that could be bad luck about this is you didnt notice that you were getting phantom slam in the rudiments thats the point that you could miss its liable to start on pc that it has not been happening on before so that is very very pertinent and thats the only place you should really look for one and dont plunge please dont plunge dont go diving overboard and grabbing these things which come up in the rudiments so that we can use them and oppose them uhuh hideous to contemplate that some poor auditor some poor auditor up in upper podunk he doesnt know anything about this and hes doing marvelous 212 and hes just getting packages and packages and packages and packages and packages and packages he just gets packages and packages and you look at his folders one day and hes got ten items compose list and hes just taking what slammed in other words every time he had withhold from the auditor the auditor had quote reliable item unquote dzz and every time he had withhold on anything that was opposing it he had another reliable item didnt he so that gives him package yeah this is real goofball proposition here real goofball thing to have but where youve got one of these things right in the session right here right now and so forthit would be very good thing to try to round it up without driving the pc matty andinto nattery heap just try to rindwind up the case that way because listen thats so close to present time and its so close to the environment of the session that the pc has such screaming ptp about it that hes always being audited in the presence of ptp and so therefore hes making real gain at all that is also the secret of list one because list one items are so close in to the session the pc is always being audited over the top of ptp and we know darn well that nobody makes any progressptp the way to test that datum by the way isnobody will make any progress in the presence of ptpon research basis wait till somebody had real good honest authentic present time problem then dont let him tell you about the problem dont really go into this problem at all and then insist on running touch assist on him or run an old communication to the parts of the body process honest you just wont make any progress at all see he wont be able to anshell answer the auditing commands and hell grind and hell grind and hell grind and hell grind and hell grind and itll go on and on and on and its all the same thing and maybe hell even get little benefit out of it something will stop hurting for while and then take the present time problem that hes come in with and run problems of comparable magnitude or some old process of some kind or another dispense with this problem get it cleaned up real good and go back and audit the same process you were auditing before and youll see all of sudden hell make very nice gainsthis is one of the silliest phenomena associated with auditingthat pcs dont make gains in the presence of present time problems now ive seen oh scores scores and scores and scores of graphs on this ithe data on this is very sound and these graphs all demonstrate that where the auditor didnt handle the pcs present time problem you didnt get any gain in the graph and then this kind of an action was taken you see that the auditor was then made to handle the pcs present time problem got hold of that problemitd be some nominal problem with the wife or something like thatget rid of that thing and then you might get graph change you didnt necessarily get graph change because the present time problem night have been more fundamental than the one you handled dont you see but where you handled the present time problem of the pc and the pcs told you that it had been handled and that sort of thing youd thereafter get graph change so i had to isolate what was keeping cases from advancing this was back n 1955 56 and i finally worked it down to the present time problem and therefore forover the years have studied present time problems pretty closely and then was eventually able to smoke out the whole of the gpm just on that data that comes up from that zone of research and the anatomy of the problem now the closer to present time and the closer to auditing the present time problem is the less gain can be expected from auditing its direct proportion and thats why list one is killer now list one has been made now to include all the dynamics now itsits rather stretching one but if we realize that matter energy space and time are all part of the auditing room and are all part of the session and that the word auditing room is also part of the sixth dynamic realize that there are couple of thetans resent in an auditing session some pcs think there are more but and when you realize that some pcs are totally sold on the omnipresence of godies everywhere you knowalso you see if hes real mad at mankind he can have an oblique ax out for scientology see its liable to help mankind and he hates mankind and youre member of mankind and hes sitting in mankind body dont you see so that becomes part of the session youre both living things and in some sessions even the second dynamic has been known raise its head now this situation then makes part of list one the dynamics but that ordinarily should take care of the phantom rock slam ordinarily just an assessment of list one and careful attention to did it turn on rock slamthat ordinarily would take care of your phantom rock slam youd i et itdo list one you get the phantom slam with your present amended list and youd sail right from there everything would be fine you might not have even noticed you had phantom rock slam youd have it off so soon well thatsthats all well but after youve done this and after youve cleaned up all the slamming items on list one you then have phantom rock slamwhat are you going to do you see you have to have the total security of an answer well you certainly better go over it with the pc and take up every single bit that the session consists of and just get long list of them we dont care how much of list one he repeats we dont care about any of these things because it might be something little bit off base he might call himself joey and it might be joey that he rock slams against but not mr jones see mr jones pcs name you seeyouall that sort of thing its joey quite weirdly enough this is the character he most despises in the whole worldjoeyhimself but pointing at him by the way this is an interesting thing the way you assess those things is you really shouldnt point at things in sessions on lists and that sort of thing but you can point at the pc when you say you can point at the pc and say and point at yourself and say and you can get this across now there aside from not being able to audit is the greatest trip rope that you will find in r212 that one can really throw you because it could throw veteran if you didnt know about it i mean fellow could know all about r212 making marvelous success with r212 tearing right down the track with r212 getting packages on pcs straightening out everything everything is going gorgeously and all of sudden he finds himself across the auditing table from phantom rock slam doesnt recognize it for what it is all of sudden picks off out of thin air joe haha guy rock slams on joe i guess wed better oppose joe oh this list is going place odd part of it is he could oppose joe and he could oppose pete and he could oppose the fellows wife and he could oppose this and he could oppose that and he could oppose something else and about he could do forty or fifty lists actually trying to trace this slam and oppose it he would lay an egg on that preclear thats for sure if you cant find it and if you cant turn it off well just to the best of your ability you see ive given you now three solutions to it your first solution is your expanded list one that normally should catch it if you notice after youve done list one and you think list one is pretty clean that you still have rock slam turning up in the fellows rudiments you know youve got phantom slam you know that guys got ptp right in that session right here its ptp with the emeter the auditor with wearing clothes with having to breathe air its ptp with something then your next action is just sort it outsort it out get new sort of list one but actually its the session list and its just everything that this session might possibly consist of and while youre listing this thing keep your eye like mad on that meter because he might think of something that turns on rock slam when hes concentrating on this session you might be able to steer him into telling you exactly what it is and its finally your hair got the idea see you could steer him into it if you saw the slam turn on so its listing against the meter as you always do but very pertinently all right thats your second remedy and your third remedy for this if all else fails is just go on finding items to the best of your belief and l buy items that just go flashflash and then disappear go on and find some item that tends to stay in because this above all else will tend to make you do incomplete lists youll say well it flashed you know ive got these last four items at the end of the list and they all rock slammed and then the rock slam turned off so naturally they packaged naturally and you dont put those extra twenty items on the list that gets the real item see it leads you to incomplete lists and so forth but do the best you can get your packages and so on and all of sudden youthats climbing uphill very hardbut youll notice that this slam will get more frequent turns on easier gets less frantic at the same time and then one day the pc youre doing some kind of list and the pc says heads head head see yeah yeah its this head see it slams like mad and youve got the phantom slam got the idea that would take care of it all but i would make special effort to do something about this as early as you noticed it now im sure that some of you right now are auditing pcs who have phantom slams and that you are just little bit puzzled as to what happens to this occasionally and how come you got down to the end of the list and then you had to say well actually there were two packages on the same list and they both blew up and there was item really which came out of it because everything packaged and they were all bonus packages thats for the birds you know thats just for the birds you should go back and take any list that well actually if you have phantom slam is you go ahead and find out what the devil its slamming onwhether from this new issue of list one or the second method of making up list of the sessionand find it get it out of the road and then go back and then go back and pick up all those lists that resulted in item really that all sort of went out suddenly and mysteriously that it was nullable but it all disappeared and you didnt really have anything and youthe last one in you guessed you know that kind of thing complete those lists null you dont have to null the whole list you just null the stuff that youve added to it youre going to find yourself some nice ris maybe at the expense of only listing few hundred items on half dozen lists maybe youll find yourself about six reliable items splang splang wouldnt that be nice bonus package thatd be good way to show up some hpa someplace by the way take this folder take the folder hes been working on on this pc for the last 195 hours you see and then you only audit the pc for something like three and half hours or something like this and you find twelve new items you see or something like this and you say you see its very easy what you do in 195 do in dirty dirty trick but now 212 should result in positive result you should have something to show for it dont think that everything goes up in smoke it doesnt you should have something to show for it now theres one little other phenomenon i want to talk about which is really not part of phantom slams but something i ought to mentionis indeterminate things opposing indeterminate things now youll find out that you can represent indeterminate things definition mass massless its n idea or condition and now you can represent these oh by all means represent them you see and youre going to get rock slamming items and youre going to get nice massy things you know and theyve got mass meaning and fixidity and everything is getting along fine and youre getting these rings and then one fine day you know thats from this indeterminatei mean its just doingness its significance let call it significance hat communicates to you better we already got word for it significance you represented significances and that was fine but when you start to oppose significances youre going to get in trouble now it isnt that you dont oppose significancesyou do if you find rock slamming significance why you oppose it we dont care what we oppose the only thing we have to know aboutif it rock slams oppose it see thats all we have to know but this peculiar thing this significance that is rock slamming will occasionally throw you now you do the zero list you assess the zero list and you get you get something about attack you know and youve assessed out attack and youre going to do represent youre looking for something to do represent list on to find something to get first list see and you hit attack and it says attack and it rock slams and you say attack and it rock slams you say attack and it rock slams well now the zero lists of course are made for representations to get first lists out of arent they but even that is junior to the law if it rock slams oppose it if its reliable item oppose it dont ever represent it oppose it but this significance produces an oddity because youre actually opposing nothing see youre opposing an idea and you find yourself sometime opposing attack who or what would oppose attack oh wait minute thats doingness theres mass at the other end of this thing well you can actually come up with an item but you have to oppose it right back to get package because attack versus defender is not package you understand its got mass so you dont have attack versus defender equals package you have to swing back on the trolley and oppose what youve just found now the easiest thing in the world is to oppose significance and wind up with vzzz where the significance doesnt read and you didnt find any item opposing it that is the easiest flub to make anybody ever made you just list hundred more opposition items to it and youre going to come up with great big juicy reliable item that you missed the first time in other words you could null that list down to nothing and it apparently took the charge out of attack but you didnt come up with an item to oppose attack now youve got to swing back and get the item that opposed attack by opposing what opposes attack do you see that otherwise youre just going to have ayoure going to have significance opposing an identity and that isnt package package isare opposed identities now you of course can have an idea opposing an idea and call it package because they both rock slammed now thats four items perfectly all right with but actually it isnt very much of the gpm its darn little but you get bricklayer opposing working hard and try to call that package its not package now you can get the bricklayer by opposing working hard but youve now got to oppose the bricklayer to find out what the package consisted got to get the zigzag of this this is old original 3d criss cross but this particularly applies to the significances significances very easily go blank so that it doesnt rock slam you dont find an item to rock slam against it and you say it evaporated couldnt evaporate you found an item with mass opposing doingness and of course that was package and it didnt evaporate anyhow its just submerged all youve got to do is keep on opposing it just get your list complete your list and youre going to find nice big slamming item and its going to stay there this time and boy when you find that item man itll really stay there it wont evaporate you couldnt hit it in the head with sledgehammer and do anything to it it just goes on slamming see now to do anything with that and get your package youve got to come around backwards and youve got to find out whether or not using your same opposition rules whether that produced pain or sen now if it produced pain or sen why you oppose it accordingly and youre going to come over here and youre going to get the nicest package you ever saw when you get those two packages theyre going to sit there right together and the pc knows all about it and then they might have chance of blowing now you see how items could get submerged in 212 and appear not to have anything there andand so forth and the only rule you have to follow is if the list is nullable you can find an item on it that will be good strong beefy itemif list is nullable it has to be rock slamming list in order to find an item on it of course and it has to be nullable it need only have one rock slam on it weve just had some lists start to rock slam after thousand items isnt that horrible its not giving this cyclic manifestation though that ive discussed and you have reason to suspect the source is wrong and it did rock slam now that list wont go down to nothing if it was nullable it wont go to nothing it will go to an item if it looks like its going to nothing and theres just four dirty needles left infour dirty reads you knowman that list isnt complete just because you could null it is reason its complete now theres another goofball one about invalidating the list invalidating items youre too prone to use invalidated items to dig up this and to dig up that and to dig up something else why dont you just forget it the pcs invalidating the items hes giving you and that sort of thingyes thats perfectly valid test but now why some students have begun to use that for other reasons and we have already found two pcs who already knew the rule who didnt want to complete the list who simply invalidated two or three items and then got out of it but when the list was completed produced an item ah my faith in pcs is deteriorating here the list were talking aboutthat is the freak list thatll give you troubleis the list you cant null so your basic rule you see is is the list nullable if the list is nullable itll have an item on it if it hasnt got an item on it by the time youve finished nulling it then complete the list how much should you pressure the pc into listing when he doesnt want to this all comes under basic auditing what are you doing as an auditor sitting there with the pc out of your control the usual phenomenon is something like this pc says i havent got any more but i tell you the list is complete iive said its complete ive said its complete four times and now you want to go on and on and on and on and on ive said the list is complete and you say well all right well all right okay you say surrender you know okay on this list has anything been suppressed and he says soandso and soandso another two items i didnt tell you and so forth and oh yes theres iceberg reindeer santa claus so forth and the other day we had very disgraceful scene very disgraceful scene the pc kept on listing and the auditor couldnt stop him to get in the mid ruds to finish him you know its just basics of auditing oddly enough after list is completely nulled completely finished and completely dead pc very often will be able to complete it and very often the pc is not really able to give you more items until youve finished nulling the list well thats one for you to know isnt it the pc says there are more items he actually cant think of any more items null the lot tiger drill the last two and all of sudden the pcs got twenty more items you havent got an item yet so just go on listing listing listing listing listing and list your needle out clean and just take that new section and justjust as though its brandnew list null it down this time youve got an item sometimes you havent sometimes it happens again if you can null list theres an item on it main trouble youre going to get intothe main trouble youre going to get into however comes under the heading of the basics of auditing not under the basics of 212 youll think there are endless rules to 212 youll think there are endless things to know about 212 in actual fact there arent these rules are pretty hard and fast about 212 the basics of auditing cover most of the difficulty that person will have he knows 212 pretty well basics of auditing is what hes probably light on the danger of 212 is that an auditor can get result on 212 that he is satisfied with and that the pc is satisfied with and the auditor has not yet completed his 212 has not yet got proper items on 212 and has not done it right at all and the residual gain there is about thousand percent worth thats the main danger peopleyoure going to findsomeday you go down to oklahoma here twenty thirty years from now and therell be somebody down there in oklahoma and theyll be busy auditing on the original 212 and that sort of thing and in all those years they have never found an item on pc never found reliable item except by accident and their pcs are all happy and theyre all happy and they think 212 is wonderful thats the main danger with 212 all right you know actually were very very happy with the way youre doing you get lot ofyou get lot of knocking about you know and you get lot of snarling but in actual fact why were very very proud of the way youre doing im very proud of the way the instructors are handling this weve gotten this thing off the launching pad at aat fantastic rate weve got people in here very new to the course who are doing very very nicely theyre doing fine somebody came from another organization from an organization one of theseother dayto ask about the trouble we were having with 212 and they were getting ready to get it trained and they were getting ready to get out checksheets and they were getting ready to get auditors to study it so that someday somebody could do it and they were quite surprised that we werent having any trouble getting 212 into action they were quite amazed as matter of fact rather insulted we should have been having more trouble than weve been having so i think youre doing fine with it and youre looking much better the number of items found are fantastic and youve got whole bunch of residual gains coming up now and the gains are right there because you go back and look at those unfinished lists where you didnt find the item finish the list and find the item and all of sudden the pc will take off okay thank you very much good night
