detainees in the war on terrorism and crs report rl31724 detention of american citizens as enemy combatants at the close of its 20032004 term the supreme court took up the war against terrorism issuing three decisions related to the detention of enemy combatants in rasul v bush the court held that aliens detained at the us naval station at guantanamo bay cuba have access to federa l courts to challenge their detention in hamdi v rumsfeld plurality held that us citizen allegedly captured during combat in afghanistan and incarcerated at navy brig in south carolina is entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard by neutral decisionmaker regarding the governments reasons for detaining him the court in rumsfeld v padilla overturned lower courts grant of habeas corpus to another us citizen in military custody in south carolina on jurisdictional grounds the decisions affirm the presidents powers to detain enemy combatants as part of the necessary force authorized by congress after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 however the court appears to ve limited the scope of individuals who may be treated as enemy combatants pursuant to that authority and clarified that such detainees have some due process righ ts under the us constitution the three decisions will likely have little immediate impact on the detainees none was ordered set free the defin ition of the term enemy combatant and the scope of legal process due to persons designated as such re main for lower courts to resolve however the detainees will have right to an atto rney and an opportunity to challenge their detention in federal court the defense department has announced plans to create combatant status review tribunals to implement the decision in guantanamo httpwwwdodmiltranscripts2004tr200407070981htmlhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21884crs2 the bush administration had argued that the president has the inherent power as commanderinchief to seize and detain pers ons as enemy combatants for the purpose of keeping them off the battlefield and in order to interrogate them for intelligence purposes and that aliens held abroad have access to federal courts even to challenge their status the administration conceded that us citizens have the right to petition for habeas corpus but argued that the role of the courts was merely to ascertain whether the government had provided some evidence to support the designation and not to provide the detainee an opportunity to rebut the evidence rasul v bush 72 uslw 4596 2004 this case involved two australians and twelve kuwaitis petition on behalf of two uk citizens was mooted by their release who were captured during hostilities in afghanistan and are being held in military custody at the guantanamo bay naval base cuba the administration argued and the court below agreed that unde r the 1950 supreme court case johnson v eisentrager 339 us 763 the privilege of litigation does not extend to liens in military custody who have presence in any territory over wh ich the united states is sovereign the government argued that the united states ccupies the base at guantanamo bay under treaty and lease that recognize cubas ultimate sovereignty over the territory and that therefore cuba rather than the united states exercises sovereignty there even though the treaty gives complete jurisdic tion and control over the leas ed area for so long as it remains in us hands noting that the wr it of habeas corpus writ has evolved as the primary means to challenge executive deten tions especially those without trial the court held that jurisdiction over habeas petitions does not turn on sovereignty over the territory where detainees are held even if the habeas statute were presumed not to extend extraterritorially as the gove rnment urged the court found that the complete jurisdiction and control the united states exercises under its lease with cuba would suffice to bring the detainees within the territorial and histor ical scope of the writ without expressly overruling eisentrager the court distinguished the cases at issue to find eisentrager inapplicable eisentrager listed six factors that precluded those petitioners from seeking habeas relief each petitioner is an enemy alien b has never been or resided in the united states c was captured outside of our territory and there held in military custody as prisoner of war d was tried and c onvicted by military commission sitting outside the united states for offenses against laws of war committed outside the united states f and is at all times imprisoned outsi the united states the present court noted that the guantanamo petitioners in cont rast are not nationals of countries at war with the united states and they deny that they have engaged in or plotted acts of aggression against the united states they have never been afforded access to any tribunal much less charged with and convicted of wr ongdoing and for more than two years they have been imprisoned in territory over which the united states exercises exclusive jurisdiction and control the majority stressed that the eisentrager opinion was concerned with the constitutional right to habeas corpus rather than the statutory right the rasul court found authority for federal cour t jurisdiction in 28 usc 2241 which grants courts the authority to hear applications for habeas corpus within their respective jurisdictions by any person who claims to be held in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states when eisentrager was decided in 1950 the rasul majority found the respective jurisdictions of federa l district courts was understood to extend farther than the geographical boundaries of the districts ahrens v clark 335 us 188 1948 according to the court that understanding was altered by line of caseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21884crs3 recognized in braden v 30th judicial circuit court of ky 410 us 484 1973 as overruling the statutory interpretation that d established the inflexible jurisdictional rule upon which eisentrager was implicitly based the court also declined to read the statute to vary its geographical scope according to the citizensh ip of the detainee justice kennedy in concurring opinion would ve found jurisdiction over the guantanamo detainees based on the facts that guantanamo is effectively us territory and is far removed from any hostilities and th at the detainees are being held indefinitely without the benefit of any legal proceeding to determine their status justice scalia with chief justice rehnquist and justice thomas dissented arguing that the habeas statute on its face requires federal district court with territorial jurisdiction over the detainee the dissenters would read braden as distinguishing ahrens rather than overruling it and take issue with the majoritys discussion of the special status of guantanamo bay as inconsistent with its analysis that court may entertain habeas petitions as long as jurisdiction is proper over the official with custody of detainee even if that detainee is located outside of the c ourts jurisdiction under this view whether the united states exercises jurisdiction and control over the territory where detainees are held is irrelevant and the door to the courts of any us federal district would also be open to detainees held anywhere outside the united states the dissenters objected to the courts irresponsible overt urning of settled law on which military commanders had relied in selecting guantanamo as the site for the detention facilities the courts opinion leaves many questions unanswered it is unclear which of the eisentrager or rasul factors would control under different set of facts for example if detainee at guantanamo is convicted by military commi ssion would petition for habeas corpus on his behalf then be foreclosed the opinion does not address whethe r persons detained by the us military abroad in locations where the united states does not exercise full jurisdiction and control would have access to u s courts the court did not decide the merits of the petitions although in footnote the majority opined that pe titioners allegations that although they have engage d neither in combat nor in acts of terrorism against the united states they have been held in executive detention for more than two years in territory subject to the longterm exclusive jurisdiction and control of the united states without access to counsel and wit hout being charged with any wrongdoing unquestionably describe c ustody in violation of the constitu tion or laws or treaties of the united states the opinion leaves to lower c ourts such issues as whether the detentions are authorized by congress who may be tained and what evidence might be adduced to determine whether person is an enemy combatant or whether the geneva conventions afford the detainees any protections however the hamdi decision may provide some guidance for those courts hamdi v rumsfeld 72 uslw 4607 2004 yaser esam hamdi was seized by members of the northern alliance in afghanistan and turned over to the united states military the government transferred him along with other detainees captured in afghanistan to the united states naval base in guantanamo bay later upon learning that hamdi is us citizen authorities transferred him to naval brig in norfolk virginia and then to brig in charleston south carolina hamdis father filed petition for habeas corpus on his behalf the gove rnment argued that the president has the constitutional and statutory aut hority to detain hamdi as an enemy combatant without recognizing the constitutional rights available to criminal defendants hamdis attorney argued that his detention was unlawful as violation of 18 usc 4001a which prohibits the detention of us citizens absent an act of congress and that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21884crs4 constitution entitles him to due process rights to challenge his detention the fourth circuit dismissed the petition on appeal finding that the congress had authorized the detention that declaration prepared by defense department offi cial was sufficient to justify hamdis conti nued detention and that hamdi did not have right to meet with counsel or present evidence to rebut the govern ments assertions majority of supreme court justices agreed to v acate the dismissal and remand th petition so that hamdi could have an opportunity to present evidence on hi s behalf however the justices could not reach consensus for the rationale justice oconnor joined by the chief justi ce as well as justices kennedy and breyer wrote the opinion for the court this plurality opinion found that congress authorization for use of military force the aumf 115 stat 224 2001 clearly and unmistakably authorizes the detention of captured persons who were part of or supporting forces hostile to the united states or coalition partners and engaged in an armed conflict against the united states as necessary incident to the military use of force having found the aumf satisfies th requirement under 18 usc 4001a for an act of congress authorizing detention the plurality did not address whether the president has the inherent authority to detain enemy combatants without congress authorization the opinion also assumed without deciding that 18 usc 4001a applies to detention under military as well as civilian authority the question of congressional authorization did not end the inquiry however as the plurality found that even war time detentions authorized by congress raise due process questions the plurality took it as given that absent suspension of the writ of habeas corpus any individual detained within the united states has the right to challenge his or her detention noting that the habeas statute 28 usc 2241 et seq makes clear both that congress envisioned that habeas petitioners would have some opportunity to present and rebut facts and that courts in cases like this retain some ability to vary the ways in which they do so as mandated by due process they rejected the governments contention that due process under these circum stances is met if the government shows some evidence to support detention or that more searching review would unconstitutionally impede the presidents war pow ers instead the plurality invoked the balancing test of mathews v eldridge 424 us 319 1976 which holds that the process due in any given instance is determined by weighing the private interest that will be affected by the official action against the governments asserted interest the plurality noted that substantial interests lie on both sides of the scale but that the circumstance of war does not tip the scale irre trievably in favor of the government the plurality also agreed that indefinite detention for the purpose of interrogation is not authorized and presumably could not serve as governmental interest under mathews the plurality determined that citizen tained as an enemy combatant must receive notice of the factual basis for his classifi cation and fair opportunity to rebut the governments factual asserti ons before neutral decisionmaker including the right to counsel they explained however that the exigencies of the ci rcumstances may allow for tailoring of enemy combatant proceedings to alleviate their uncommon potential to burden the executive at time of ongoing military conflict possibly allowing hearsay evidence and presumption in favor of the governments evidence as long as fair opportunity to rebut such evidence is provided they concluded thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21884crs5 once the government puts forth credible evidence that the habeas petitioner meets the enemycombatant criteria the onus c ould shift to the petitioner to rebut that evidence with more persuasive evidence that he falls outside the criteria burdenshifting scheme of this sort would meet the goal of ensuring that the errant tourist embedded journalist or local aid worker has chance to prove military error while giving due regard to the executive once it has put forth meaningful support for its conclusion that the detainee is in fact an enemy combatant the four justices suggested that military tr ibunal of some sort mig ht fulfill due process requirements but also explicitly rejected th contention that courts should have role in the process justice souter joined by justice ginsberg agreed that hamdi is entitled to due process including the right to counsel but without the qualifications suggested by justice oconnor and joined the plurality to provide sufficient votes to v acate the decision below however finding explicit authority in the aumf or other statutes to detain persons as enemy combatants they would have determined that 18 usc 4001a precludes the detention of american citizens as enemy combatants altogether they rejected the theory that the detention was authorized as necessary incident to the use of military force because the governments stat ed legal position in its campaign against the taliban is apparently at odds with its claim here to be acting in accordance with customary law of war and hence to be with in the terms of the force resolution in its detention of hamdi in other words the governments failure to accord the taliban detainees rights under the geneva conventi on or in accordance with army regulations vitiated its contention that hamdis detention was authorized pursuant to the aumf justice scalia joined by justice stevens dissented arguing that our constitutional tradition has been to prosecute us c itizens accused of waging war against the government in federal cour t for treason or some other crime unless congress has suspended the writ of habeas corpus pursu ant to the constitutions suspension clause art i 9 cl 2 they viewed as unthi nkable that the executive could render otherwise criminal grounds for detention nonc riminal merely by disclaimin g an intent to prosecute or by asserting that it wa s incapacitating dangerous offe nders rather than punishing wrongdoing under their view even if th aumf did authorize detention in sufficiently clear language to overcome the prohibition in 18 usc 4001a which in their view clearly it did not hamdis detention would be unconstitutiona l without proper suspension of the writ finally the two jus tices argued that the role of the court is limited to ordering the release of citizen unlawfully detained not creating its own set of rules to justify it the plurality seems to view it as its mission to make everything come out right rather than merely to decree the consequences as far as individual rights are concerned of the other two branches ac tions and omissions has the legislature failed to suspend the writ in the current di re emergency well we will remedy that failure by prescribing the reasonable conditions that suspension should have included and has the executive failed to live up to those reasonable conditions well we will ourselves make that failure g ood so that this dangerous fellow if he is dangerous need not be set free the problem with this approach is not only that it steps out of the courts modest and limited role in democratic society but that by repeatedly doing what it thinks the political branches ought to do it encourages their lassitude and saps the vitality of government by the peoplehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21884crs6 justice thomas also dissented essentially agreeing with the governments position that the detention of enemy combatants is an unreviewable aspect of the war powers constitutionally allocated to the political branches he agreed that the aumf provides sufficient authority to detain enemy combatants but suggested the president might have inherent authority even without such author ity while he would have found that the courts may properly review whether hamdis executive detention is lawful he would have given utmost deference to the executive bran ch he would not have applied the mathews v eldridge balancing approach opining at the same time that the test was misapplied in his view the national security interests assert ed by the government including the need to gather intelligence through interrogation w ould outweigh any individual liberties that might be affected finally he questioned whether other act s of war such as bombings and missile strikes would also be subject to due process inquiry rumsfeld v padilla 72 uslw 4584 2004 jose padilla like yaser hamdi is currently detained in military brig in south carolina as an enemy combatant the circumstances surrounding his arrest di ffered substantially how ever rather than being captured during hostilities in afghanistan padilla was arrested at ohare airport in chicago and held initially in new york under material witness warrant after the president determined that padilla was an enemy combatant and ordered him transferred to military custody his court appointed attorney filed petition for habeas corpus in federal district court in new york the district court found that the president was authorized to detain padilla as an enemy combatant pursuant to the aumf but asserted that padilla had due process right to communicate with his lawyer and present evidence to refute his designation as an enemy combatant on interlocutory crossappeals the second circuit granted the habeas petition finding that the aumf did not authorize detention under the circumstances alleged n one of the judges in the second circuit agreed with the government that the habeas statute mandates that padillas petition could only properly be brought against the commander of the military brig and only in the local federal district court it was on this ground that majority of the supreme court led by chief justice rehnquist reversed the cour t did not reach the issue of whether the president has the authority to detain padilla militarily padillas attorney has filed new petition in the fourth circuit justice stevens joined by justices souter ginsburg and breyer dissented arguing that the jurisdictional rule applied by the majority has many exceptions and that the court has duty to address the stions of profound importance to the nation padillas case raises he wrote executive detention of subversive citizens like detention of enemy soldiers to keep them off the battlefield may sometimes be justified to prevent persons from launching or becoming missiles of destruction it ma not however be justified by the naked interest in using unlawful procedures to extract information incommunicado detention for months on end is such proc edure whether the information so procured is more or less reliable than that acquired by more extreme forms of torture is of consequence for if this nation is to remain true to the ideals symbolized by its flag it must not wield the tools of tyrants even to resist an assault by the forces of tyranny the four dissenting judges appear to ag ree with the opinion of the second circuit the opinions in hamdi suggest that sufficient number of justices would reject the governments position that the president has the authority to detain us citizens who were taken into custody within the united states at least unless congress has specifically authorized such detentions
