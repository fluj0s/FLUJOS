parliamentary elections related crs product is crs report rl30371 serbia and montenegro current situation and us policy by steven woehrel background the political situation in serbia has been notable for high volatility at least since the end of the kosovo war in mid1999 in october 2000 wartime president slobodan milosevic was forced from power by prodemocracy forces including opposition parties and grassroots civic groups these forces mostly encompassed in the broadbased democratic opposition in serbia dos coalition came into office and launched new reforms but progress stalled in part because of interparty disagreements the rivalry between thenyugoslav president vojislav kostunica and his party the democratic party of serbia dss and thenserbian prime minister zoran djindjic of the democratic party ds became particularly divisive the tiny republic of montenegro continued to press for independence from serbia but acquiesced in 2002 to an eubrokered arrangement to realign the old federal republic of yugoslavia into loose state union of serbia and montenegro which came into force in february 2003 in march of that year serbian prime minister zoran djindjic was assassinated allegedly by organized criminal groups threatened by djindjics reform policies power was smoothly transferred to successor dsled government but early parliamentary elections held in december produced strong results for serbias nationalist parties with the extremist radical party winning the largest congressional research service the library of congress crs2 share of the vote and seats in parliament although not enough to form government after months of negotiations kostunica became prime minister of dssled minority coalition without the radical party in march 2004 while the ds opted to go into opposition milosevics socialist party supports the kostunica government in parliament in part because of ongoing political instability serbia has lagged in some aspects of reform and in its efforts to integrate with the international community and overcome serbias troubled recent history at the same time developments in serbia and montenegro can strongly influence regional stability and affect broader regional issues such as the unresolved conflict in kosovo the status of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty and eu enlargement plans in the western balkan region for these reasons the mid2004 serbian presidential election attracted great deal of attention within serbia and without while the actual powers of the republican presidency are not very extensive the election outcome was expected to loom large in serbian national politics and influence serbias relations with the international community serbian presidency httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21856 the limited powers of the serbian presidency derive from the serbia and montenegro constitutional charter that came into force in february 20031 and the serbian republic constitution which is currently under revision the serbian president is directly elected and has certain appointive and policyrelated powers at both the republic and union levels notably the two republic presidents serve on the supreme defense council along with the union president however most governing power lies with the republiclevel prime minister and cabinet moreover the state union remains single international entity and retains among its few powers the conduct of international relations therefore the serbian president representing constituent republic does not act as sovereign head of state in an international context the last person to hold the post of president of serbia on fulltime basis was milan milutinovic who is currently in custody at the hague and charged with war crimes relating to his decisionmaking authority during the 1999 kosovo conflict after milutinovics term expired at the end of 2002 serbia held three direct presidential elections prior to 2004 in october and december 2002 and in november 2003 each time the results were invalidated due to low voter turnout less than 502 in the 2003 vote serbian radical party candidate tomislav nikolic came in first with about 46 of the vote some parties boycotted that process and turnout was less than 40 in the absence of an elected president the president of the serbian parliament acted as caretaker serbian president from 2003 until july 2004 1 for more information see crs report rs21568 serbia and montenegro union prospects and policy implications by julie kim 2 in both 2002 presidential elections thenfederal president vojislav kostunica of the serbian democratic party dss won clear majority of the vote voter apathy which produced low turnouts that invalidated each process appeared to suit the interests of the government of then prime minister zoran djindjic given its ongoing bitter feud with kostunica after the fall of milosevic in october 2000 crs3 for the 2004 vote the serbian parliament abolished the 50 voter turnout threshold for both rounds of the election therefore candidate could claim victory either by winning over 50 of the vote in the first round or prevailing in the second round between the top two contenders low voter turnout could not invalidate the results candidates fifteen individuals were approved by the serbian electoral commission to run for president the leading candidates were tomislav nikolic leader of the extreme nationalist serbian radical party boris tadic candidate of the opposition democratic party and dragan marsicanin candidate of the governing coalition under prime minister kostunica nikolic is the acting head of the radical party in the absence of its leader vojislav seselj who is currently in custody at the hague on charges of war crimes during part of the 1990s the radical party shared power with slobodan milosevics socialist party tadic of the democratic party served as defense minister under djindjic and djindjics successor prime minister zivkovic and is widely credited for carrying out major reforms in the armed forces during his tenure at the defense ministry representing the current government marsicanin had the formal backing of the dss and its coalition httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21856 partners but was considered weaker representative of the government than either prime minister kostunica or deputy prime minister labus fourth prominent candidate was bogoljub karic an independent businessman and media mogul the inclusion of many additional candidates was thought by some to encourage greater turnout in the first round although others feared that the participation of many nonserious candidates could feed voter apathy most preelection opinion polls showed nikolic leading with about 30 or higher levels of support in many polls tadic came in second with about 20 or higher with marsicanin ranking third depending on the poll however large share of persons polled said they were undecided the level of turnout was considered to be another key factor in the final outcome3 notably absent from the 2004 list of candidates was vojislav kostunica who ran in both failed presidential elections in 2002 his absence reflected changed political circumstances in 2002 kostunica was serving as president of the federal republic of yugoslavia which longer exists in that form and the democratic party under prime minister djindjic controlled most levers of governing power after the december 2003 parliamentary elections kostunicas dss party became the leading party in the governing coalition and kostunica himself became serbian prime minister position of much greater power than the serbian presidency given this situation kostunica expressed greater interest in fulfilling his governing mandate as prime minister than in running for less significant office nevertheless many observers initially rued his choice not to run given that kostunica might have been best able to unite the badly fractured pro democratic bloc and present the strongest alternative to the radical partys nikolic 3 serb presidency poll could become tight race reuters may 19 2004 serbian poll suggests srss nikolic to win presidential vote bbc monitoring european june 1 2004 serbias presidential election likely to go to runoff agence france presse june 2 2004 crs4 campaign even before the official start of the election campaign it was apparent that the democratic bloc would remain fragmented by virtue of its inability to back single candidate before the vote government leaders argued that it would have been impossible to support tadic since his democratic party was in the opposition and they therefore put forward marsicanin as the coalition candidate the bigger question that was left open to speculation was whether all prodemocracy parties would unite behind nonnationalist candidate in the second round if the race came down to one of them against the radicals nikolic prior to the first round however such cooperation at least between the dss and ds appeared questionable officials from both parties exchanged sharp recriminations on range of issues prominently featured dispute involved the circumstances surrounding the 2003 djindjic assassination the ensuing enforcement actions of the successor ds government and the alleged complicity of both parties in the murder some media commentary observed that the bitter campaign disputes could negatively affect voter turnout among supporters of moderate candidates and thereby work to boost the proportional strength of the extremists httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21856 for his part nikolic attempted to build on the srs successful approach to the december 2003 parliamentary elections in which the party downplayed its ultra nationalist roots and emphasized populist concerns and voter discontent with social and economic conditions he campaigned on assurances that his victory would not lead to serbias isolation however eu officials warned that serbia under radical party leadership could not count on eu support eu members had already expressed concerns about political developments in serbia following the december parliamentary vote4 the outburst in midmarch 2004 of deadly ethnicallymotivated attacks against serb communities in kosovo returned the volatile and unresolved issue of kosovo to the serbian political scene5 in response the kostunica government put forward detailed plan to create autonomous units for kosovo serb residents as part of larger decentralization effort for the kosovo province while the plan itself has received mixed initial reactions abroad some observers believe that the serbian government has benefitted politically from its prompt and internationally engaged response to the recent violence moreover swift serbian governmental and parliamentary approval of the decentralization plan for kosovo helped to remove the hotbutton issue of kosovo as central theme and potential rallying point for nationalist forces in the presidential campaign in early may the serbian political scene was further shaken by the sudden appearance and voluntary surrender in belgrade of milorad legija lukovic the prime suspect for organizing the djindjic assassination and the former leader of the red berets special operations unit in the serbian police force lukovic disappeared after the march 2003 murder and remained in hiding for over year lukovic appeared in court 4 press conference by nato secretary general jaap hoop scheffer and javier solana eu high representative for cfsp may 24 2004 eu urges new

time in june and entered plea of not guilty his initial testimony included charges of links between former officials of the dsled government and organized crime results6 in the first round of voting on june 13 single candidate won majority of the vote nikolic received the highest share of votes 3060 and tadic came in second with 2737 both were assured of participation in the second round surprise third place showing with 1823 was media mogul bogoljub karic whose campaign message on job creation may have drawn off some of nikolics potential supporters marsicanin the governments candidate came in disappointing fourth with 1330 voter turnout in the first round was 4775 in the immediate aftermath of the first round there was widespread speculation that in response to marsicanins poor showing prime minister kostunica might resign and thereby bring down the government and trigger early parliamentary elections after kostunica issued formal denial to these rumors the next question was whether he would back tadic for the second round the three dss coalition partners g17 plus serbian httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21856 renewal movement and new serbia party immediately lent their support to tadic kostunica first met individually with both tadic and nikolic but after few days the dss formally endorsed tadic for the second round thirdplace candidate karic also backed tadic however it remained to be seen to what extent the voter base of these parties would abide by the endorsements of their party leaders or even participate in the process therefore another preoccupation for the reformist parties before the second round was to counter apathy and encourage greater voter participation among their supporters in the second round on june 27 tadic defeated nikolic by vote of 5353 to 4510 among the motivating factors favoring tadic according to some media analyses may have been concerns about the consequences of nikolic victory and perception among voters that tadic was better suited to lead the country out of isolation promote international support for serbia and improve economic prospects nikolic conceded defeat but upheld his call for early parliamentary elections with the apparent expectation of another strong radical party result with the backing of much broader base than the traditional democratic party supporters tadic nearly doubled his votes from the first round voter turnout in the second round was 4828 still an overall low figure but higher than some expected for second round of voting tadic is to be inaugurated in early july under fiveyear term for both rounds of voting international observers assessed that democratic standards for free and fair electoral process had been met the international response to tadics victory was one of congratulations and probably some relief eu foreign policy chief javier solana welcomed tadics victory and called him friend of europe7 6 results data summarized from various news agencies and international organizations including the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce 7 financial times june 29 2004 crs6 potential implications for us policy following the formation of the kostunica government in march 2004 us officials emphasized that the united states would judge the serbian government on its actions and that the administration stood ready to assist serbia on the path toward euroatlantic integration provided that serbia met its international obligations8 after djindjics murder in 2003 us and serbian officials sought to strengthen bilateral relations and cooperation despite some areas of progress cooperation in other areas became stalled primarily over assessments of still limited serbian cooperation with the war crimes tribunal this issue prompted the administration to suspend us bilateral assistance to serbia pursuant to section 572 of the fy2004 foreign operations appropriations act in march 2004 and remains significant barrier to us support for serbian efforts to become more closely associated with euroatlantic institutions the successful conduct of the june elections and defeat of the radical party candidate signaled improved prospects for serbianamerican cooperation major issues on the international agenda include serbias obligations with regard to the war crimes tribunal the situation in kosovo and serbias efforts to join natos partnership for peace program httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21856 at the least it appears that the worstcase scenario for bilateral usserbian relations has been averted many observers feared that multiple negative ramifications would result from presidential victory for nikolic and the radical party nikolic victory would have most likely immediately brought down the kostunica government and ushered in more unstable political environment and further fragmentation of the democratic bloc the ascendance of the radical party would likely have reduced prospects for constructive international dialogue on kosovo led to more problematic serbian relations with montenegro and added additional strains in relations with the international community including further isolation and limits on financial assistance nevertheless it may be too early to draw definitive conclusions about the impact of the tadic victory until the overall political situation in serbia becomes clearer as noted tadics position as currently mandated carries few governing powers while the presidential vote victory has boosted the democratic party tadic has stated that it will neither join the kostunica coalition government nor seek its fall where the kostunica government stands as result of the vote what the relationship will be between the prime minister and president and how cohabitation might work remain open questions the prospect of early general elections will likely overshadow most other issues on the policy agenda in the near term at the same time serbias leaders still need to meet the conditions of the international community especially on cooperation with the war crimes tribunal for the country to move forward on closer ties with and assistance from the united states and other western nations and institutions pursuing further reforms will likely again require the consolidated support of serbias democratic forces 8 testimony of us deputy assistant secretary of state kathleen stephens hearing on serbia us house of
