syr trgy subject iaea reports on iran and syria classified by isn c s eliot kang acting for reasons 14b and d 1 u this is an action request see paragraphs 69 summary 2 sbu international atomic energy agency iaea director general dg elbaradei released his latest reports on the status of the iaeas investigations into iran and syrias nuclear programs on 19 february 2009 both reports conformed to expectations in describing the absence of any meaningful steps by either country to address the serious issues that exist with respect to their nuclear programs 3 sbu with respect to iran dg elbaradeis description of the dichotomy between the stalled investigation and rapid pace of irans centrifuge advances is stark the report underscores the number of outstanding issues that need to be clarified regarding possible military dimensions to irans nuclear program the iaea simply notes that it has still not received positive reply from iran regarding its request for access to relevant information documentation locations or individuals consequently the agency has not made any substantive progress on these issues irans failure to cooperate with the iaea in this regard suggests iran continues to wish to hide the nature of these activities 4 sbu at the same time the iaea reported that far from having complied with its unsc obligation to suspend its uranium enrichment and heavy waterrelated activities iran has continued to expand its activities at the natanz fuel enrichment plant fep and arak heavy water research reactor approximately 5500 centrifuges are operating up from approximately 3800 in november 2008 of particular concern the iaea notes that since february 2007 iran has produced 1010 kilograms of low enriched uranium leu substantial increase over the 630 kilograms reported in november 2008 approximately 1300 kilograms of leu would be sufficient for one nuclear weapon if iran decided to go that route currently this material remains under iaea safeguards nevertheless the risk posed in an iranian breakout scenario either from diversion of safeguarded nuclear material or through the covert enrichment of undeclared nuclear material is higher than in the past morever iran continues to deny the iaea access to the arak reactor to conduct design information verification inspection which would provide the iaea assurances that the construction of the reactor does not serve as pathway to divert nuclear material for weapons purposes 5 sbu dg elbaradeis report on syria reinforces our conclusion that syria was engaged in clandestine effort to construct and operate nuclear reactor at kibar the report also helps to confirm that uranium found via environmental samples collected at the site is not naturally occurring lending credence to the fact that the facility in question was reactor although the report does not categorically dismiss syrias explanation that the uranium was from israeli missiles used in the attack on the reactor in september 2007 it suggests that this explanation is highly unlikely syria delivered an eleventhhour letter on 17 february 2009 attempting to demonstrate degree of cooperation immediately before the reports release the report notes that the responses in the syrian letter were only partial and did not address most of the questions raised in the agencys communications importantly the report also calls on syria to allow access to other locations and allow inspectors to take samples of the debris removed from kibar as soon as possible noting that these measures are essential for the iaea to be able complete its assessment action requests 6 sbu action request for all posts posts are requested to convey us views regarding the iaea reports to appropriate host governments posts should underscore that these reports demonstrate that neither iran nor syria have taken any meaningful steps to cooperate with the iaea in the past six months posts should stress that syrias refusal to do so only deepens concerns regarding the nature of its clandestine nuclear activities with respect to iran posts should emphasize that while iran has stalled the iaeas investigation and still refuses to provide the iaea with requested transparency its centrifuge program continues to make progress the net result is that in neither case can the international community have confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of these nuclear programs for iran the security council has imposed mandatory requirement that it suspend all proliferation sensitive nuclear activities and cooperate fully with the iaea on iran we should stress that with international rights come responsibilities iran needs to live up to those responsibilities we believe that irans continued failure to do so is another opportunity lost 7 sbu action request for all posts cont with respect to the upcoming 26 march 2009 iaea board of governors meeting posts should stress the need for the following from host governments strong national statements on iran and call on iran to impement its international nuclear obligations without delay statements should urge iran to take advantage of this critical opportunity for engagement by addressing the concerns of the international community and underscore the need for full transparency with the iaea including irans implementation of the additional protocol and cooperation with the iaeas investigation as well as suspension of all proliferationsensitive nuclear activities strong national statements on syria and demand that syria cooperate with the iaeas investigation strengthened statements on iran and syria from regional or other groups eg european union the group of 77 and china the nonaligned movement the group of latin america and the carribean the africa group etc to the extent possible posts should encourage host goverments to instruct their delegations not to accept statements from any group to which they are member that would downplay the factual reports of the iaea or undercut the agencys ability to obtain the necessary information and access needed to resolve these serious issues and board members should support by vote if necessary releasing the syria report to the public this is essential for the public to appreciate the serious nature of syrias failure to cooperate with the iaea this report will also demonstrate the level of transparency in iaea affairs that we believe syria should manifest in its approach to the iaea 8 s action request for unvie in addition to conveying these messages to local iaea missions unvie should continue working to promote support within the iaea secretariat and among iaea board members for continuing and expanding the investigation into both iran and syrias nuclear activities and pressuring both to cooperate with the respective investigations mission is requested to place maximum effort into securing strong national statements demanding iranian and syrian cooperation with the iaea by as many board members as possible particularly those in the eu mission should also work to support p51 statement on iran missions efforts to build support for such statements should begin as soon as possible and will be facilitated by technical briefings on iran and syrias nuclear efforts to board members in washington and vienna the week prior to the board meeting these briefings will be provided by state and ic nonproliferation experts mission is also requested to ensure that the iaea director generals forthcoming report on syria is made public including by laying the groundwork for vote in the board if necessary if possible politically and statutorily mission should seek the concurrent release of the november 2008 syria report which was denied public release by namarab intervention at the november 2008 board meeting mission should begin coordinating with likeminded board members at the earliest possible date 9 s action request for london paris moscow berlin and beijing in addition to conveying us views regarding the iran and syria reports posts should stress that the united states believes that the iran report reinforces the need for strong p51 statement demanding irans immediate and full cooperation with the iaea discussions regarding specific texts will be addressed in vienna and washington pocs and reporting deadline 10 sbu mission is requested to report on the status of its efforts in advance of the board richard nephew 2026477680 and matt goldstein 2026474196 are the departments pocs for this issue clinton
