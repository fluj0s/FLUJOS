reasons 14 b and d 1 c summaryintroduction more than two weeks have passed since argentinas ruling first couple lost badly in midterm congressional elections it has taken president cristina fernandez kirchner cfk and her husband nestor time to process the meaning of the debacle and respond though the goa has taken some significant steps over the past two weeks including cabinet shuffle the signals that the kirchners and their associates have sent have been decidedly mixed it may be another month before their new strategy is fully discernible 2 snf in the past two weeks mission personnel have talked to dozens of political analysts economists businesspersons and politicians about the kirchners likely course most analyses posit three possible scenarios radicalization reform or the status quo while there are serious smart people who believe that the government will lurch simply left or right over the coming months we and most of our contacts believe that the government will behave in the future much as it has in the past we think tepid move toward reform is more likely than radicalization because the countrys ascendant forces support the former not the latter at the same time we doubt that kirchnerled reform will be ambitious the best that can be expected from this weakened government is reformlite agenda that seeks to recapture political space without significant policy concessions this cable examines the three scenarios in depth identifies evidence in support of each one as well as indicators to watch for that might clarify the kirchners future intentions and evaluates the scenarios likelihood separate message will critically examine another possible political outcome that cfk will fail to reach the end of her term end summaryintroduction the radicalization scenario 3 c in the first and least likely scenario the kirchners react by turning hard left attempting to reverse their fortunes through radicalization of their regime that would propel them unambiguously into the bolivarian camp led by hugo chavez this approach is referred to locally as deepening the model key elements of this approach would include economy further nationalization of private companies andor intensified attempts to manage their behavior partial default on sovereign debt instruments and confirmation of internal commerce secretary guillermo moreno as the executor of nks dirigiste economic policy increased influence by labor unions governance abandonment of the peronist party in favor of transversality in which the kirchners consort with any and all who offer their fealty use of the government budget and other means to punish peronist governors and other politicians deemed disloyal pursuit of restrictive media legislation increased resort to executive decrees foreign policy closer identification with hugo chavez and his bolivarian allies increasing criticism of usg policies evidence of shift to the left 4 c there is significant group of observers including political analyst rosendo fraga and deutsche bank managing director marcelo blanco who subscribe to this school of thought they do not lack evidence erstwhile kirchner allies in the private sector including bank association chief jorge brito and argentine industrialist association head hector mendez tell us that they are disgruntled with the kirchners and lack influence on them their loss seems to be union boss hugo moyanos gain he flexed his muscles last week compelling the goa to withdraw subcabinet nomination in the health ministry that threatened his unions financial interests and installing the of his attorney as head of aerolineas argentinas septel 5 c on the political front nestor kirchner resigned his position as head of the peronist party the day after the june 28 election since then rumors have proliferated of new transversal approach that elevates kirchner loyalists and hardline ideologues like piquetero street activists and buenos air 00000827 002 of 005 the carta abierta intellectual group kirchner showed up last week at an openair meeting of carta abierta his first public appearance since his june 29 resignation as peronistinchief last weeks cabinet shuffle only strengthened the hands of the loyalists with new blood and the replacement of the reformoriented sergio massa with kirchnerista anibal fernandez as cabinet chief 6 c some of the goas postelection foreign policy moves can also be read to support the radicalization thesis the most obvious was cfks spurofthemoment trip to central america via the oas in washington in hastily conceived effort to restore manual zelaya to power in honduras only ecuadors rafael correa and paraguays fernando lugo accompanied cfk and oas secretary general insulza on the illfated mission wittingly or not she seemed to side with hasty bolivarian efforts to force the issue in honduras rather than to wait for mediation to take its course more careful leader uruguays tabare vazquez let it be known that he declined cfks invitation to join her aboard tango one 7 c there was one other foreign policyrelated event that may suggest leftward turn kirchner congressional ally patricia vaca narvaja recently wrote letter to us speaker of the house nancy pelosi asking for the usg to declassify all information at its disposal regarding the argentine military dictatorship the kirchner government has often seemed obsessed with refighting the dirty war of the 1970s and early 80s and the request could be construed as prelude to another rhetorical offensive against the usg for its support of military regimes in the region alternatively it could be routine request consistent with the governments longstanding interest in settling dirty warrelated human rights cases the verdict red dawn unlikely 8 c despite all of the above we view the radicalization scenario as the least likely of the three paths that the government will take with probability of less than five percent even if the kirchners prefer this approach in their heart of hearts circumstances in the wake of the election give them virtually margin to implement it immediately after the election many of the most powerful forces within the governing coalition began clamoring for more moderate policies more inclusive approach to governance and especially larger share of government finances these peronist governors and mayors fared far better than nestor did and they are in mood to take orders from the kirchners as source close to buenos aires governor daniel scioli told the cda there are captive politicians after these elections the private sector is similarly emboldened as industrialist association uia chief hector mendez told us that deepening the model wont happen we just wont allow it finally the antikirchner opposition is clearly ascendant these groups will fight goa efforts to march argentina further to the left given the current political climate they should have the votes to hold the kirchners at bay even before the new congress is seated in december 9 c nor do we believe that argentinas foreign policy is becoming more bolivarian the goa has become much less eager to criticize the usg directly since barack obama became president cfk wears her affection for our commanderinchief on her sleeve in addition as mentioned in the next section 16 there is new evidence of concrete goa efforts to support us foreign policy objectives in multilateral fora at least behind the scenes 10 c there is another external factor that makes argentinas embrace of bolivarian politics unlikely the growing influence of brazil here the local idb rep brazilian daniel oliveira told econoff recently that argentina has become as important to brazil as mexico is to the united states with us31 billion trade relationship and more than us10 billion in brazilian investment flowing into the argentina economy since 1997 brazil is strongly engaged here and is not shy about defending its interests the local press has reported that lula worked the phones in july 2008 to prevent the kirchners from abandoning power in the wake of their failed attempt to push tax increase on agricultural exports through congress lula and his associates will remain an important moderating influence on the kirchners 11 snf although we think this scenarios likelihood is buenos air 00000827 003 of 005 limited it bears mention that it is also the most likely to lead to political crisis confrontation escalating violence and cfks failure to reach the end of her term we explore how such downward spiral might play out and the likelihood of this calamitous scenario in separate report scenario two the kirchners embrace reform 12 c some observers expect and many more hope that the kirchners will reinvent themselves pursuing reformminded agenda that mollifies peronist governors defangs the opposition and wins over new foreign friends larger group believes that rebellious peronist establishment will put them on that course whether they like it or not key policy features of such an approach would include economy interventionistinchief guillermo moreno is dismissed clearing the way for normalization of the state statistical institute indec and thus return to methodological integrity in the national accounts goa makes deals with the paris club and private bondholders left out of the 2005 debt swap deal and normalizes its relationship with the imf starting with an article iv consultation progress on outstanding icsid judgments against argentina governance cfk rules more inclusively coordinating policies with governors and looking for common ground with the opposition in the current and next congress government rolls back agricultural export taxes as downpayment on its new conciliatory approach nk reduces his public profile foreign policy concrete steps benefiting the united states and nonbolivarian governments in the hemisphere coupled with distancing from chavez and his allies 13 c proponents of this scenarios likelihood have plenty of recent evidence to back them up there is clearly ferment in the governments approach to economic policy with new economy minister on board powerful and heretofore provenezuelan planning minister julio vido now reputed to be an advocate of pragmatic moderation and prestigious marketoriented advisors specifically former central banker and imf official mario blejer said to be poised to join the government the government sacked its statist corrupt transportation secretary ricardo jaime days after the election and rumors abound that moreno the icon of market repression economics has become such political liability that his days in the government are numbered wellplaced sources within the government confirm that change is in the air top kirchner aide carlos zannini indicated that the goa would focus almost exclusively on changes on the economic policy front this month and influential buenos aires province vicegovernor alberto balestrini told the cda last week that the goa would roll back agricultural export taxes on wheat and corn soon 14 c nor is there any doubt that the political center of gravity has shifted dramatically in argentina since the election most of the countrys 16 peronist governors have reportedly expressed their desire for marketoriented changes at least privately some former allies like ambitious chubut governor mario das neves have broken ranks with the kirchners and openly criticize them even loyalist governors like chacos jorge capitanich have publicly called for straightening out indec and other changes faced with this onslaught from ostensible allies cfk announced on july 9 as she has before that she would convoke the countrys main political and private sector leaders to process of dialogue the following week she modified the proposed process to accommodate opposition demands 15 c the goas political position is further weakened by the prospect that it will suffer defections from its ranks in the current congress of course the next congress that takes office december 10 will be more independent with the government losing majorities in both chambers this will make it easier for reformminded groups to push the kirchners into accepting elements of their agendas as balestrini told us the goa will need to renegotiate and compromise in order to rule 16 c the goa has taken few subtle foreign policy moves that could be construed as harbingers of closer relationship with the united states after he received call on the issue from secretary clinton fm jorge taiana convinced cfk to change the voting instructions of the argentine delegation to the international atomic energy agency which enabled ussupported candidate yukiya amano buenos air 00000827 004 of 005 to win election after monthlong impasse in more prosaic but perhaps symbolically important development the cda received warm note from cfk expressing regret for her failure to attend the missions independence day celebration and offering best wishes we had never before received such note from either kirchner the verdict dont bet on new leaf 17 c while the reform scenario has gained credence over the past week driven primarily by economic policy news and rumors we remain skeptical that nestor and cristina will turn into latterday incarnation of ozzie and harriet dispensing moderation and good sense wherever they turn neither kirchner seems inclined to admit error even tacitly by shifting course so abruptly senior official at the central bank told us that nestor will resist reformist policies because they would be interpreted as sign of his weakness and even irrelevance if changes come he argues they will come at time of his choosing reformist path may also strike the kirchners as politically risky distancing them from their most fervent supporters in the working class poor villas and intelligentsia in deference to sectors that are at best disloyal and at worst openly hostile to them 18 c the forced reform variant of this scenario seems somewhat more likely but not by much for it to work one of two things must happen either the peronist governors will need to set aside their rivalries and effectively advocate for more robust approach to reform than seems likely or the bickering often inept opposition will need to get its act together and engage the kirchners as united front much depends for example on whether dissident peronists coalesce behind senator carlos reutemann who has emerged as frontrunner for the peronist presidential nomination in 2011 and whether vice president julio cobos can gain some traction in pulling together support from the radicals civic coalition and socialists if either of these two groups works cooperatively over the coming two months it is possible that positive changes can come to argentina before cfk leaves office in 2011 we dont think that will happen however and estimate the two reform scenarios combined probability at more than twenty percent scenario three muddling through 19 c in the third scenario the kirchners do not definitively opt for reform or radicalization maintaining the shortterm focus that has characterized their six years in power they muddle through as best they can trying to salvage their political futures or at least to reach the end of cfks term in 2011 there may be some positive changes in this scenario one analyst dubs it reformlite but the electoral setback does not ultimately result in dramatic course correction in the words of economist nicolas dujovne the kirchners will pursue strategy of minimum reforms but without collapse under this scenario the following might happen economy lots of policy zigzagging without clear direction moreno stays or leaves and is replaced with another hardliner new reformminded economy minister boudou changes little like the cabinets previous reformist alsorans martin lousteau and sergio massa governance cooption of some peronist governors and mayors punishment of others considered to be disloyal stalemate on legislation in congress topdown dialogue process initiated without intention to compromise foreign policy some private gestures to the usg but little movement towards resolution of longterm sources of friction palpable distancing from chavezs camp or modification of the goas independent foreign policy for evidence that nothing has changed buy newspaper 20 c this statusquo scenario is the clear frontrunner among our contacts there is fresh evidence to support it in every days harvest of newspapers the two dominant news stories since the election cfks botched trip to honduras and the goas response to the h1n1 epidemic here both buenos air 00000827 005 of 005 suggest that the governments improvisational style and closed decisionmaking process remain intact this in turn will mean that goa policies are more likely to develop in response to the first couples whims than to coherent design it also means that the government bureaucracy is unlikely to save the kirchners from the consequences of their impulses for example cfk went ahead with her illadvised trip to washington and central america earlier this month against the advice of her foreign ministry she ended up achieving more than nestor did in december 2007 when he participated in the chavezorganized bungle in the jungle in colombia in which nestor and others sat helplessly in the jungle for days in the futile hope that the farc would deliver hostages to them 21 c the opacity of decisionmaking at the goas apex means that the government will continue to meander hither and yon regardless of whether or not it has definitively chosen particular direction the goas performance in dealing with h1n1 flu is case in point although many public health officials in the goa are working around the clock to contain the challenging problem the governments lack of internal communication made it look hapless for example upon alighting on argentine territory after her central american jaunt cfk denounced fearmongering media reports of 100000 flu cases in argentina information that had come from her own health ministry the 100000 number referred to all flu cases not just h1n1 flu the poor coordination continues over the past weekend the mission found itself in the middle of an unsightly nonpublic dispute between the federal ministry of health and its counterpart in the province of buenos aires governed by kirchner ally daniel scioli over the destination of cdcdonated tamiflu doses with each accusing the other of bad faith and subterfuge the verdict more of the same but good can happen 22 c like most of our contacts we think that this untidy scenario is the most likely outcome we dont expect the kirchners to change but given the magnitude of their defeat in the midterms we dont expect the peronist establishment or the opposition to back down either the kirchners may even be able to prevail if their rivals and opponents fail to unite prolonged stalemate on most of the big policy issues seems the most likely outcome of collision between closed reformadverse and politically weakened regime and disparate political groups that believe that they have mandate for reform 23 c this does not mean however that positive change in this scenario is possible the kirchners could take steps for ulterior motives that turn out to have beneficial consequences this has already happened in the post midterm era when transportation secretary ricardo jaime departed office soon after the election one of our contacts characterized the kirchners willingness to cut the notoriously corrupt official loose as the beginning of purge designed to distance them from the shadiest elements of their regime in an effort to reduce the likelihood that they themselves could end up in prison whatever the reason jaimes removal could lead to policy improvements in the transportation sector 24 c nor does it mean that the usg should ignore the kirchner regime or give up on it as hopeless cfk may not have grand scheme in mind for her remaining two years in power but she clearly would like to associate herself with president obamas star power the intensity of this desire opens all kinds of opportunities for us as it did in argentinas decisive iaea vote as the kirchners struggle for political relevance or at least survival they will be looking for success stories and we should be on guard for opportunities to induce them to do the right thing even if the kirchner government is unlikely to resolve every single outstanding bilateral issue to our satisfaction we think that cultivation of the goa cfk in particular can lead to beneficial outcomes for us interests bilaterally regionally and multilaterally kelly
