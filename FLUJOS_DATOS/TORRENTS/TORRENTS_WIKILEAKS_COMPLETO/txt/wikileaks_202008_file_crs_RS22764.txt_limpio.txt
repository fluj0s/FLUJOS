legislative attorney american law division summary on october 30 2007 the us district court for the western district of louisiana httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22764 issued ruling in kerrmcgee oil gas corp v allred that rebuffed efforts of the us department of the interior to collect royalties from offshore oil and gas production leases based on socalled price thresholds for previously granted royalty relief1 there has been considerable interest in the impact of this ruling on ongoing congressional efforts related to certain missing royalty payment requirements in leases issued by the minerals management service of the us department of the interior mms in 1998 and 1999 including the proposed royalty relief for american consumers act of 2007 as found at sections 75017505 of hr 3221 the house of representatives passed hr 3221 on august 4 2007 this report 1 provides background on the outer continental shelf deep water royalty relief act dwrra pursuant to which royaltyfree leases including the controversial 1998 and 1999 leases were issued 2 summarizes relevant portions of the proposed royalty relief for american consumers act2 which attempts to encourage the renegotiation of the controversial 1998 and 1999 leases 3 summarizes the recent ruling in the kerrmcgee matter and 4 analyzes the potential impact of that recent ruling on the proposed royalty relief for american consumers act and any similar legislative efforts3 1 kerrmcgee oil gas corp v allred 206cv0439 wd october 30 2007 memorandum ruling the court granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment in the case on the same day that it issued the memorandum ruling 2 hr 3221 title vii subtitle 3 this analysis is restricted to discussion of the potential impact of the recent ruling on section 7504 of hr 3221 which would place restrictions on holders of leases that lack price thresholds it does not address section 7503 of hr 3221 which seeks to clarify the authority of the secretary of the interior to include price thresholds on royalty relief in offshore leases pursuant to section 304 of the dwrra crs2 the deep water royalty relief act and the 19981999 leases most federal offshore oil and gas production leases contain royalty provisions that require the lessee to pay certain percentage of revenue on the value of oil and natural gas production to the federal government as the lessor in 1995 congress passed the dwrra4 which provides an incentive for exploration of oil and natural gas reserves in deep water which might otherwise be uneconomic by providing that certain initial volume of production from deep water wells would be exempt from royalty obligations section 302 of the dwrra provides mechanism by which holders of existing leases can apply for royalty relief which is to be granted by the secretary of the interior if the lease would otherwise be uneconomic however section 302 also provides that these lessees will not be eligible for royalty relief if the price of oil or natural gas exceeds certain threshold level while section 302 of the dwrra addresses royalty relief for holders of leases in existence at the time of the enactment of the act sections 303 and 304 address post enactment lease sales section 303 amends the bidding system to allow interior to offer leases going forward with royalty relief at the discretion of the department while section httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22764 304 carves out an exception to that royalty payment requirement for deep water leases that were entered into within five years of the date of enactment of the dwrra pursuant to section 304 the standard royalty requirement is to be suspended for lessees holding these leases until certain volume of oil or natural gas is produced by the lessee the volumetric limitation on royalty relief varies based on the water depth of the leased tract once the volumetric threshold is exceeded lessee may be required to make royalty payments section 304 sets statutory minimum for the volumetric threshold for royalty relief the secretary of the interior is authorized to grant higher volumetric threshold at his or her discretion in 1998 and 1999 mms issued deepwater offshore leases that were eligible for royalty suspension but did not include pricebased limitation on that eligibility as result holders of these 1998 and 1999 deepwater leases have obligations to make royalty payments up to the suspension volumes regardless of the market price of oil or natural gas the leases do not contain price threshold on royalty relief the royalty relief for american consumers act of 2007 on august 4 2007 the house passed hr 3221 included in this omnibus energy bill is the proposed royalty relief for american consumers act of 20075 one section of this proposed act bars the secretary of the interior from issuing any new leases to holders of covered leases unless said leaseholders either renegotiate their covered leases to include price thresholds or pay conservation of resources fee as established in the proposed act6 the statute defines covered lease as lease for oil or gas production in the gulf of mexico that is issued by the department of the interior under section 304 of the outer continental shelf deep water royalty relief act and not 4 pl 10458 title iii 5 hr 3221 title vii subtitle 6 id at section 7504 crs3 subject to limitations on royalty relief based on market prices that are equal to or less than the price thresholds described in the dwrra7 any holder of covered lease is forced to decide between three options 1 the lessee can keep the lease under its current terms ie without price threshold and lose the right to bid on future offshore lease sales in the gulf of mexico 2 the lessee can pay newly created conservation of resources fee as established elsewhere in the proposed act or 3 the lessee can renegotiate the covered lease to include royalty relief price thresholds many observers interpret the proposed act as legislative attempt to correct the perceived oversight in the 19981999 leases that lack price thresholds8 kerrmcgee oil gas corp v allred around the same time that the perceived oversight in the 1998 and 1999 leases described above was brought to the publics attention kerrmcgee oil gas corp kerrmcgee9 initiated litigation that challenged the authority of the department of the interior to impose price thresholds on leases sold between 1996 and 2000 ie the effective period of section 304 of the dwrra according to kerrmcgee section 304 of the dwrra which addresses lease sales during the fiveyear period between 1996 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22764 and 2000 barred the inclusion of royalty relief price thresholds to these leases and therefore the collection of royalties resulting from the imposition of price thresholds contradicted section 304 of the dwrra10 kerrmcgee brought its claim in the us district court for the western district of louisiana after the us department of the interior issued an order directing kerrmcgee to pay royalties on oil and natural gas produced in 2003 and 2004 under eight leases operated by kerrmcgee under the dwrra11 on october 30 2007 the court issued ruling that essentially confirmed kerr mcgees position and found that an order issued by the department of the interior directing kerrmcgee to pay royalties based on price threshold was in error the court based its ruling on decision issued by the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit in 2004 that interpreted the relevant sections of the dwrra12 according to the court the fifth circuit interpreted sections 303 and 304 of the dwrra as they pertain to new production requirements for mandatory royalty relief leases section 303 added new bidding system that gave the interior the authority to lease any water depth in 7 hr 3221 section 7504d1 8 for discussion of some of the potential legal challenges to this legislation see crs report rl33974 legal issues raised by provision in house energy bill hr 6 creating incentives for certain ocs leaseholders to accept price thresholds by robert meltz and adam vann as explained below at footnote 16 hr 6 contained language substantially similar to the provisions of the royalty relief for american consumers act of 2007 9 andarko petroleum corporation acquired the kerrmcgee corporation in june of 2006 10 see kerr mcgee oil and gas corporations memorandum in support of motion for summary judgment 206cv0439 wd filed may 24 2007 11 us department of the interior order to report and pay royalties and interest due under identified offshore federal oil and gas leases january 6 2006 12 santa fe snyder corp v norton 385 f 3d 884 5th cir 2004 crs4 any location with royalty relief fashioned according to the interiors discretion the fifth circuit found that this power however was tempered by the next section where congress replaced the interiors discretion to fashion royalty relief with fixed royalty suspension scheme based on volume and water depth thus the royalty relief for mandatory royalty relief leases is automatic and unconditional13 based on the fifth circuits previous ruling the district court found that section 304 mandates royalty relief up to certain minimum volume of production regardless of the market price of oil or natural gas14 therefore the court concluded that the department of the interior had exceeded its congressional authority when it sought to collect royalties on kerrmcgees oil and gas production that did not exceed these volumetric minimums regardless of whether the oil and gas produced could be sold at prices in excess of the price thresholds for royalty relief that had been included in the lease terms15 the impact of the kerrmcgee ruling on the proposed royalty relief for american consumers act of 2007 since the kerrmcgee ruling was issued on october 30 2007 there has been httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22764 extensive congressional interest in the impact of the ruling on the proposed royalty relief for american consumers act of 2007 as described above specifically there is confusion as to how the ruling might affect the restrictions that section 7504 seeks to impose on holders of covered leases as discussed above section 7504 requires that persons who hold covered leases either 1 renegotiate their leases to include price thresholds16 2 pay conservation of resources fee as set forth in the section or 3 forfeit eligibility for future oil or gas production leases in the gulf of mexico17 section 7504 and the legislative efforts that preceded it18 have generally been described as efforts to remedy perceived error or oversight in the 1998 and 1999 deep water leases by forcing renegotiation of those leases to include royalty relief price thresholds or by using the conservation of resources fee structure to recover from these leaseholders amounts that had previously been calculated to be roughly the same amount 13 kerrmcgee oil gas corp v allred 206cv0439 slip op at 78 wd october 30 2007 memorandum ruling 14 id at 89 15 id at 9 16 one concern that has been raised is whether the courts ruling if upheld on appeal would impact the authority of the department of the interior to renegotiate the covered leases because section 7504 if enacted would represent new congressional grant of authority to an administrative agency this authority would likely supercede any perceived limitations of authority under existing statutes however in order to avoid confusion on the matter congress might be well served to explicitly state that this new authority supercedes any limitations on the department of the interiors authority with respect to negotiating the terms of the covered leases that were previously in effect 17 hr 3221 at section 7504 18 section 204 of hr 6 as passed by the house on january 18 2007 contained substantially similar provision the senatepassed version of hr 6 does not contain similar provision crs5 as would be owed if price thresholds had been in place19 the recent ruling by the us district court for the western district of louisiana if upheld would effectively eliminate the distinction between the 1998 and 1999 deep water leases which do not include price thresholds and the 1996 1997 and 2000 deep water leases which contain price thresholds that are not enforceable because they are in violation of congressional intent in enacting section 304 of the dwrra if none of the leases issued pursuant to section 304 of the dwrra contains royalty relief provisions that are subject to price thresholds then it appears that all of these leases ie all deep water leases issued between 1996 and 2000 would be covered leases as that term is defined in the proposed act as noted above section 7504d1 defines covered lease as lease for oil or gas production in the gulf of mexico that is issued by the department of the interior under section 304 of the outer continental shelf deep water royalty relief act and not subject to limitations on royalty relief based on market prices that are equal to or less than the price thresholds described in the dwrra20 it is important to note that the definition of covered leases is not restricted to leases httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22764 without price thresholds in their terms or any other definition that would be contingent upon the language in the leases if this were the case then only the 1998 and 1999 leases would be covered leases because the 1996 1997 and 2000 leases contain price threshold language however the definition of covered leases in section 7504d1 encompasses any lease that is not subject to limitations on royalty relief based on oil or natural gas market prices thus if the western district of louisiana decision is affirmed on appeal then it appears that none of the leases issued between 1996 and 2000 would be subject to limitations on royalty relief based on market price and thus all of these leases may be covered leases under the proposed act as result any entity that holds deep water lease issued between 1996 and 2000 may be ineligible for future oil or natural gas production leases in the gulf of mexico pursuant to section 7504a of the proposed act until that entity either renegotiates the lease in question or pays conservation of resources fee if congress does wish to encourage recovery of royalties on all leases issued pursuant to section 304 of the dwrra between 1996 and 2000 that are limited by both price and volumetric thresholds it could likely do so by passage of the proposed royalty relief for american consumers act of 2007 as it is currently worded in sections 7501 7505 of hr 3221 this option could affect most companies operating in the deep water ocs area if congress wishes to restrict the scope of the proposed act to the 1998 and 1999 leases that did not contain price thresholds it might consider amending the definition of covered lease accordingly 19 the conservation of resources fee is set in the bill at 9 per barrel of oil and 125 per million btu of natural gas both in 2005 dollars for all production years in which the price threshold is exceeded 20 hr 3221 section 7504d1
