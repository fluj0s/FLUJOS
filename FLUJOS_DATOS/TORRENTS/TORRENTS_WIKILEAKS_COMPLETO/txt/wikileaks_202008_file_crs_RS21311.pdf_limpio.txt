preemptive use of military force is considered to be the taking of military action by the unite d states against another nation so as to prevent or mitigate presumed imminent military attack or use of force by that nation against the united states the deployment of us military forces in support of us foreign policy without their engaging in combat is not deemed to be preemptive use of military

report will be update d if significant events warrant background during the summer and fall of 2002 the ques tion of the possible use of preemptive military force by the united states to defend its security was raised by president bush and members of his administration including possibl use of such force against iraq in mid september 2002 the bush administration published the national security strategy of the united states which explicitly states that the united states is prepared to use preemptive military force to prevent us enemies from using weapons of mass destruction wmd against it or its friends or allies1 the following analysis reviews thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21311crs2 1 continued builders on june 6 2002 found at http wwwwhitehous egovvicepresidentnews

that containment is not possible when dict ators obtain weapons of mass destruc tion and are prepared to share them with terrorists who intend to inflict catastrophic casualties on the united states 2 it is important to note here the historic and traditional view of the united states government on what constitutes the legitimate use of preemptive military force in accordan ce with international law this view was best articulated by then secretary of state daniel webster in 1842 in diplomatic correspondence with the british government webster stated that it was an act of self defense permitting an intrusion into the territory of another state only in those cases in which the necessity of that selfdefense is instant overwhelming and leaving choice of means and moment for deliberation see letter from secretary of state daniel webster to lord ashburton of august 6 1842 reprin ted in moore john bassett digest of international law vol ii 1906 p 412 for detailed discussion of international law and preemptive use of military force see crs report rs21314 international law and the preemptive use of force against iraq by david m ackermanhistorical record regarding the uses of us military force in preemptive manner it examines and comments on military actions taken by the united states that could be reasonably interpreted as preemp tive in nature for purposes of this analysis preemptive use of military force is considered to be the taking of military action by the united states against another nation so as to prevent or mitigate presumed military attack or use of force by that nation against the united states the deployment of us military forces in support of us foreign policy without their engaging in combat is not deemed to be preemptive use of military force preemptive us of military force is also deemed to be an action addressed at specific and imminent military threat requiring timely action2 by contrast preventive war would be significant use of military force against nation as preventive acti on to forestall presumed military threat from that nation at some point in the future whether months or years such an action would be outside the traditional parameters of the concept of preem ptive use of military force it would be significant expansion of the customary understa nding of the elements that define such an action however such an expansive view of military preemption is contained in the bush administrations september 2002 us national strategy docum ent and in related public policy statements by senior bush administrati on officials thus various instances of the use of force that are examined herein coul d using less stringent definition be argued by some as examples of preemption by the united states the discussion below is based upon our review of all noteworthy uses of military force by the united states since establishment of the republic historical overview the historical record indicates that the united states has never to date engaged in preemptive military attack as traditionally defined against another nation and only once has the united st ates ever unilaterally attacked another nation militarily prior to its first having been attacked or prior to us citizens or interests first having been attacked that instance was the spanish american war of 1898 in that military conflict the principal goal of united states military action was to compel spainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21311crs3 3 joint resolution of apr il 20 1898 res 24 30 stat 738 4 there was direct military attack by spain ag ainst the united states prior to the exchange of declarations of war by the nations and initia tion of hostilities by the united states in 1898 see declarations of war and authorizations for th use of military force historical background and legal implications crs report rl31133 by david m ackerman and richard f grimmett notable event the sinking of the uss maine in havana harbor provided an additional argument for war against spain for t hose advocating it in the united states the actual cause of the sinking of the uss maine in havana harbor even today has not been definitively established more recent scholarship argues that it was most likely not due to an external attack on the ship such as the use of mine by an out side party but due to an internal explosion to grant cuba its political independence an act of congress passed in april 1898 just prior to the us declaration of war against spain explicitly declared cuba to be independent of spain demanded that spain withdraw its military forces from the island and authorized the president to use us military force to achieve these ends if necessary3 spain rejected these demands and an exchange of declara tions of war by both countries soon followed thereafter4 although us military actions against spain were based on special us foreign policy considerations th ey occurred after war was formally declared and cannot be fairly characterized as preemp tive in nature during the cuban missile crisis of 1962 preemptive use of military force to destroy soviet missiles that had been introduced into cuba was very seriously considered in the early days of the crisis but the matter was ultimately resolved diplomatically although the united states did not use military force preemptively it did deploy military forces as an adjunct to its diplomacy while reserving its right to take additional military actions as it deemed appropriate the circumstances surrounding the origins of the mexican war are somewhat controversial in naturebut the term preemptive attack by th united states does not apply to this conflict during and immediately following the first world war the united states as part of allied military operations sent military forces into parts of russia to protect its interests and to render limited aid to antibolshevik forces during the russian civil war in major military actions since th second world war the president has either obtained congressional authorization for use of military force against other nations in advance of using it or has directed military actions abroad on his own initiative in support of multinational operations such as those of the united nations or of mutual security arrangements like the north atlantic treaty organization nato examples of these actions include partic ipation in the korean war the 19901991 persian gulf war and the bosnian and kosovo operations in the 1990s the use of military force against iraq in 2003 while controversial within the international community was justified by the united states the united kingdom and others as an action necessary to enforce existing security council resolutions th at mandated iraqi disarmament yet in all of these varied instances of the use of military force by the united states such military action was response after the fact and was not preemptive in na ture as traditionally defined central american and caribbean interventions this is not to say that the united states has not used its military to in tervene in other nations in support of its foreign policy interests however us military interventions particularly number of unilateral uses of force in the central am erica and caribbean areas throughout the 20th century were not preemptive in nature what led the united states to intervene militarily in nations in these areas was not the view that the individual nations were likely to attackhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21311crs4 5 7 ust 196 6 8 ust 660 7 10 ust 379 8 for an excellent background discussion of us policy toward the caribbean and central american nations during the first half of the 20th century see samuel flagg bemis diplomatic history of the united states new york holt rinehart and winston inc 1965 pp 519538 for detailed historical study that provides valuable insights and commentary on us actions continuedthe united states militarily rather these us military interventions were grounded in the view that they would support the monroe doctrine which opposed interference in the western hemisphere by outside na tions us policy was driven by the belief that if stable governments existed in caribbean states and central america then it was less likely that foreign countries would attempt to protect their nationals or th eir economic interests through their use of military force against one or more of these nations consequently the united states in the early part of the 20th century established through treaties with the dominican republic in 19075 and with haiti in 19156 the right for the united states to collect and disperse customs income received by these nations as well as the right to protect the receiver general of customs and his assistants in the performance of his duties this eff ectively created us protectorates for these countries until these arrangements were termin ated during the administration of president franklin d roosevelt intermittent domestic insurrections against the national governments in both countries led the us to utilize american military forces to restore order in haiti from 19151934 and in the do minican republic from 19161924 but the purpose of these interventions buttressed by the treaties with the united states was to help maintain or restore political stability and thus eliminate the potential for foreign military intervention in contravention of the principles of the monroe doctrine similar concerns about foreign interventi on in politically unstable nicaragua led the united states in 1912 to accept the request of its then president adolfo diaz to intervene militarily to restore political order there through the bryanchamorro treaty with nicaragua in 1914 the united states obtai ned the right to prot ect the panama canal and its proprietary rights to any future canal through nicaragua as well as islands leased from nicaragua for use as military installations this treaty also granted to the united states the right to take any measure n eeded to carry out the treatys purposes7 this treaty had the effect of making nicaragua quasi protectorate of the united states since political turmoil in the country might threaten the panama canal or u s proprietary rights to build another canal the us employed that rationale to justify the intervention and longterm presence of american military forces in nicaragua to maintain political stability in the country us military forces were permanently withdrawn from nicaragua in 1933 apart from th above cases us military interventions in the dominican republic in 1965 grenada in 1983 and in pana ma in 1989 were based upon concerns that us citizens or other us interests were being harmed by the political instability in these countries at the time us interventi on occurred while us military interventions in central america and caribbean nations were controversial after reviewing the context in which they occurred it is fair to sa that none of them involved the use of preemptive military force by the united states8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21311crs5 8 continued taken toward caribbean and central american countries see chapters 9 11 and 12 in samuel flagg bemis the latin american policy of the united states new york harcourt brace world 1943 reprinted in paperback in new rk by ww norton company inc 1967 9 section 503e of the national security act of 1947 as amended defines covert action as an activity or activities of the united states govern ment to influence political economic or military conditions abroad where it is intended that the ro of the united states government will not be apparent or acknowledged publiclycovert action although the use of preemptive force by the united states is generally associated with the overt use of us military forces it is important to note that the united states has also utilized covert acti on by us government personnel in efforts to influence political and military outcomes in other nations the pub lic record indicates that the united states has used this form of intervention to prevent some groups or political figures from gaining or maintainin g political power to the detriment of us interests and those of friendly nations for example the use of covert action was widely reported to have been successfully employed to effect changes in the governments of iran in 1953 and in guatemala in 1954 its use failed in the case of cuba in 1961 the general approach in the use of covert acti on is reportedly to support local political and militaryparamilitary forces in ga ining or maintaining political control in nation so that us or its allies interests will not be threat ened none of these activities has reportedly involved significant numbers of us military fo rces because by their very nature covert actions are efforts to advance an outcome without drawing di rect attention to the united states in the process of doing so9 such previous clandestin operations by us personnel could arguably have constituted efforts at preemptive action to fo restall unwanted political or military developments in other nations but given their presumptive limited scale compared to those of major conventional milita ry operations and also that they were not used to preempt an imminent military attack on the united states it seems more appropriate to view uscovert actions as adjuncts to more extensive us military actions in support of us foreign policy as such these us covert actions do not appear to be true case examples of the use of preemptive military force by the united states cuban missile crisis of 1962 the one significant well documented case of note where preemptive military action was seriously contemplated by the united states but ultimately not used was th cuban missile crisis of october 1962 when the united states learned from spyplane photographs that the soviet ion was secretly introducing nuclearcapable intermediaterange ballistic missiles into cuba missiles that could threaten large portion of the eastern unite d states president john f kennedy had to determine if the prudent course of action was to use us military air strikes in an effort to destroy the missile sites before they becam operational and before the soviets or the cubans became aware that the us knew th ey were being insta lled while the military preemption option was seriously considered after extensive debate among his advisors on the implications of such an action pres ident kennedy undertook measured but firm approach to the crisis that utilized us naval quarantine of the island of cuba to prevent receipt of additional missile shipments from the soviet union as well as military supplies and material for the existing missile sites while diplomatic solution was aggressively pursued at the same time the us reserved the right to employ the fullhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21311crs6 10 for detailed background regarding the issues surrounding the

1st session range of military actions should diplomacy fail this approach was successful and the crisis was peacefully resolved10 iraq war of 2003 in the case of the iraq war of 2003 the united states has used significant military force against that nation ev though the us was not attacked first by iraq various public speeches made by the bush administration during the summer and fall of 2003 noted that the united states was prepared to engage in preemptive military action against unfriendly nations in advance of their becoming an imminent military threat to the us in septem ber 2002 the bush administration published the national security strategy of the united states of america which explicitly states that the united states is prepared to use preemptiv military force to prevent enemies of the united states from using weapons of mass dest ruction wmd against it or its allies and friends the timing of the release of this strategy document together with statements of senior bush administration officials regarding the potential threat to the us that iraqs wmd program posed led to speculation that iraq could be the first case where the expansive approach to use of preemptive military force would be applied subsequently the bush administration sought and obtai ned passage of security council resolution 1441 on november 8 2002 which among other things noted that iraq was still in material breach of its obligations unde r prior security council resolutions to destroy and not to seek to obtain various proscribed weapons and capabilities unscr 1441 further noted that serious consequen ces would result from failure of iraq to comply unconditionally with its obligations contained in the resolutions11 when president bush launched us milita ry action against iraq on march 19 2003 he stated he was doing so with coalition fo rces to enforce existing security council resolutions that had been violated by iraq since the gulf war of 19901991security council resolutions that expressly contemplat ed the use of force should iraq not comply with themand also to protect the security of the us in march 19 2003 report to congress on the issue president bush noted his conclusion and deter mination that further diplomatic efforts to enforce the imposed obligation that iraq destroy its wmd would not succeed thus requiring the use of military force to achieve iraqi disarmament the president did not explicitly characterize his military action as an implementation of the expansive concept of preemptive use of military force against rogue states with wmd contained in his national security strategy document of september 200212 however as us military action was justified to protect the security of the united states from prospective but not imminent threat of military action by iraq it could be argued that measured against the traditional concept of preemptive use of military force this was an act of preventive warby the united states
