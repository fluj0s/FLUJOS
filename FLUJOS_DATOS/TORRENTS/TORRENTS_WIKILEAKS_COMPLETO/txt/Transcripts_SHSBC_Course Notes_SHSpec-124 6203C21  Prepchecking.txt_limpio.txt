6203c21 shspec124 prepchecking pcs attention can become so concentrated on particular part of the gym that he does not recognize that the gpm has some 40 or 50 combinations in it trying to get the pcs attention off the last combination you found and onto the next combination you have found sometimes takes some doing the gpm is areas of stuck attention on identities the pc ordinarily runs through this cycle 1 they didnt want it then 2 they think it is fine some items are hotter than others and explain more than others you have twenty or thirty items before you get to the middle of the gpm the ones at the middle are the last ones the pc finds 3dxx bypasses and cuts through running items by the process of finding items 3dxx gets the bank down to the point of what is holding the bank together it is rather difficult since it is over the pcs last hundred thousand dead bodies fortunately only few of these items are remarkable the pc has probably been every item he puts on the list we are only trying to find the items that he is stuck with the process of listing keys out fifty to hundred of these at crack and we are left with the one that doesnt key out the gpm item the rest are locks on that what is holding that item is in some more basic deeper combination thus after you have found some more some of the ones you found earlier may drop out but only when you run the central package will you get rid of some of them the most horrifying ones the pc finds early on are liable to blow as locks later on though they may seem very important at first the reason auditors had so much trouble doing routine 3 for definition of this see p 34 above is that it is really much better though less accurate way of getting the actual package it reached deep into the gpm and the case and is more accurate when done absolutely right done poorly it was deadly to the pc running the wrong terminal was awful routine 3dxx doesnt require the some degree of accuracy and the pc shows continuous progress running it eventually too you get much more fundamental items than the original routine 3d items the object of prepchecking is to find chains of withholds and relieve them on the pcs case auditors seem to be having trouble duplicating this datum they dont seem to realize that you dont ask what question until you have specific withhold delivered into your lap auditors keep confusing zeroa questions with what questions see hcob 1mar62 prepchecking class ii skill the zero question gives you vast generality the zeroa question gives somewhat less generality the what question should give you more specific withholds not just generalities the zero question is about whole dynamic the zeroa gives generality it is not what question even though it can begin with what when you do get the specific overt then ask what about overt get when all appear and who if it doesnt clean up ask for an earlier one dont take something else which is vaguely similar but is not the same doingness run the whole chain of doing what you started on there must be an earlier one if it doesnt free on two runs through the withhold system chain gets charged up only because the first part of the chain is suppressed and forgotten finding the data of something will cause it to blow so if you have taken off the when the all the appear not appear and the who should have known from some incident it would blow if that were all there was to it all that will keep it reacting is some earlier withhold you can help the pc tell you by the murder system suggesting incomparably exaggerated overts so his dont look so awful sometimes you will hit chain which goes way back probably as part of the gpm you can still run it it just takes long time and sometimes your pc throws you red herring he gives you ptps and missed withholds in the beginning ruds this can lead you off on some new chain which has nothing to do with what you had started and left unflat the pc has moved into control of the session which enables him to stay away from some almost uncovered area sometimes you can get away with ignoring the outrud sometimes it is fatal dont in any case use withhold processes to handle an outrud in checking for missed withholds in ruds ask severely limited question sc you only pick up the ones between sessions dont let 3dxx session become prepcheck session because of the pcs out ruds at the beginning of session if his ruds keep being out and needing repair take few days off 3dxx and prepcheck for awhile otherwise the pc will feel he is getting auditing if it takes more than three days to find 3dxx item you will never get it because the pc will be arc broken about auditing ruds will just go further and further out you can even get the pc to put his own outruds in by insisting that you are going to find his item this promises him auditing
