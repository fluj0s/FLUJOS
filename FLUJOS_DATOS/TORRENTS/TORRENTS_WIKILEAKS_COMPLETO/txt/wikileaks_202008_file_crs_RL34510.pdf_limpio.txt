amendments and is 425 per hour the cash wage employers of pped employees must pay last updated in 1996 is 213 per hour in 1989 the small business exempti on was restructured to exempt from minimum wage requirements qualifying firms with an income of under 500000 but as administere d exemptions have only been available for employees not invol ved in interstate commerce in 2001 the clinton administration proposed restructuring of the companionship exemption under the flsa in 2002 the measure was withdrawn the issue has recently been the subject of supreme court ruling 2007 and of proposed legislation hr 3582 and s 2061 through nearly century some economists and later somemembers of congress have proposed in various formats indexation of the federal minimum wage an issue that still sometimes arises in 1986 section 14c of the act was amended to remove any specific minimum wage floor for ndicapped workers replacing it with negotiated wage commensurate with the workers

hour is allowed for youth workers under 20 years of age through th first 90 consecutive days of employment with an employer change was made by the 2007 amendments background during the 1960s and 1970s when major employers of youth workers such as retail and service industries were brought under the flsa the issue of youth sub minimum wage became extremely active proponents of the concept most notably from the hotel and restaurant industries but other segments of the economy as well urged that youth workers be paid at rate lower than the standard minimum wage regardless of experience or the quality of work they performed the period was marked by very high youth unemployment rate especially among black teenagers some suggested th at by reducing the wage rate more young workers could be employed others char ged that the plan was one more general reduction in wages and chipping away at the minimum wage further in market overflowing with willing workers reducing the wage floor would seem to benefit chiefly employers who might othe rwise hire youth workers at the full minimum4 early attempts at subminimum wage the concept of reduced wage for youth had been pending for number of years but it seems only to have been given serious attention during the 1960s nd later as industry took up its advocacy conversely organized labor and civil rights groups were strongly

again the effort failed as did other similar proposals during the period presidentelect ronald reagan 1980 was believed to support youth sub minimum wage he had been widely quoted to the effect that the minimum wage per had caused more misery and unemployment than anything since the great depression7 as the new administration commenced various hearings were conducted on the issue but again without legislative success representative erlenborn viewed the issue as standoff that some will want higher minimum wage for all workers that others will call for subminimum rate for youth for either side it may have been too high price to pay8 it would be standoff that would continue throughout the reagan presidency bush and experimental youth wages what had been subminimum wage gradually evolved into youth opportunity wage by the 1980s and then once more morphed into training wage by the late 1980s and 1990s the concept was still the same lowering wages w ould produce jobs for young persons

certain provisions added to the minimum wage title of the act such as the provision creating new subminimum wage for young people and the one denying increased cash wages to most employees who rely on

set the youth rate for persons under 20 years of age congress then raised the general minimum to 515 an hour but without linking the youth worker option to the new standard when in may 2007 congress again raised the general minimum wage mention was made of subminimum wage for youth thus under current law youth may be hired at 425 cents an hour legisla tively the youth rate is separate issu from the general wage floor14 the tip credit provisions during the 1960s and 1970s the flsa wa s progressively expanded to cover retail and service employees some of th workers were tipped employees and their employers argued that since they were given tips by the public they the employers should not be required to pa such employees full minimum wage as things stand under the tip credit provisions of the flsa all covered workers do receive at least the federal min imum wage of that wage at least 213 per hour must come directly from the empl oyer the employer may have to include higher amount in order to supplement tip s that the employee receives ie to make up for deficiency but whatever tip in come the worker receives employers must pay at least 213 per hour through the ears the level of the tip credit the difference between 213 per hour nd the minimum wage has varied background how much of tipped workers wage should be accounted for through tips how much should be paid directly by the em ployer speaking generally organized labor and tipped employees may be said to prefer zero tip credit the standard minimum wage should be paid directly by the employ er whatever income is derived from tips they suggest should be the property of the tipped employee conversely still speaking generally industry and employers would prefer 100 credit from this viewpoint the employer provides the context for the workers services the quality of the food the ambience and deserves to be reimbursed so long as the worker is actually paid through tips the tip credit thus has become an issue of equity and of percentages the early statute initially persons in the retail and services trades among others were exempted from coverage unde r the flsa in the 1961 amendments the secretary

the result was two reports heavily statistical that examined the general issue of tipped and nontippe d employment in the targeted areas through that mechanism the visibility of the issue was raised and the foundations were laid for subsequent actions15 in the 1966 amendments despite si gnificant opposition the new tip credit provision was added to the flsa pped employee was defined as one who customarily and regularly receives more than 20 month in tips16 an employer could count up to 50 of the applicable min imum wage as tip credit in case of dispute appeal could be made to the secretary thereafter adjustment of the tip credit provision became largely technical moving either up or down as congress judged appropriate when the basic minimum wage was ra ised in 1974 the credit remained at 5017 in 1977 the tip credit was restructur ed and the threshold was moved from 20 to 30 per month in tips at the sa time congress diminished the value of the credit from 50 down to 45 and to 40 by january 1 198018 then in 1989 congress essentially reversed its action of 1977 new amendments to the act provided that the tip credit would rise to 45 of the minimum wage as of april 1 1990 and to 50 after march 31 199119 the 1996 flsa amendments and beyond in 1996 revisions of the flsa differed somewhat from earlier measures in that they came to the floor as amendments incorporated into bill of sp ecial interest to industry the essence of which had little to do with st andard wagehour issues20 the bill provided that the credit would remain at 213 per hour or 50 of the then statutory rate of 425 per hour21 then with the minimum cash wage for tipped employees locked into place congress raised the general minimum wage in stepshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34510crs7 to 515 per hour the result was that the cash wage for tipped employees remained at 213 per hour while the basic minimum wage was raised by moving away from percentage figure 50 of 425 or 213 per hour to specific number 213 per hour to be paid by the employer there was decrease in the employers statutory obligation to his or her employees now to 414 when the 2007 increase in the federal minimum to 725 takes effect in july 2009 the cash wage obligation will sink to 294 of the minimum wage see table 1 the employer however will still be required to supplement the difference between the 213 per hour and the amount th eoretically earned through tips where the latter may be insufficient to reach the minimum amount by retaining the current structure of the tip credit the real value of the cash contribution of the employer to the tipped employee can be expected to decline with inflation in that context payment of tipped employee will be transferred from the employer per to the custom er at his or her discretion it may be that the current tip credit rrangement is satisfactory conversely some modification in the basic formula might be in order either raising or lowering the terms of the credit or going back to straight percentage figure there may be other possibilities as well table 1 the tip credit under the 2007 amendments to the fair labor standards act dollars per hour and percentages statutory federal

companionship workers might not accurately report their earnings for social security and related purposes29 devising flsa coverage for caregivers posed number of problems robert thompson for the

was necessary to narrow the exemption so that more workers woul d be covered under wa gehour standards41 the clinton proposal focused upon the charitycompanionship nexus under three scenarios under the first scenario specific percentage of time would need to be devoted to fellowship with the patient but it would need to be significant component of the companion s duties under the second scenario fellowship and related duties must take up at least 50 of the caregivers time finally under the third scenario compan ion would need to spend at least 80 of his or her time in companionship res ponsibilities in each case some patient related nonfellowship dutie s could be accommodated cooking meal washing clothing changing bed but clearly such activities would need to be marginal the rule could be interpreted to mean that all third party employment would be subject to minimum wage and overtime pay legislation42 as the clinton proposal defined companionship it might involve reading book or newspaper to the person chatting with him or her bout family or other events playing cards watching television or going for walk the activity must involve personal interaction between the inhome care provi der and the care recipient in order for the proposed companionship serv ices exemption to apply distinction would need to be made between an impersonal maid and personal companion 43 the

several states havi ng indexed their own minimum wage among them arizona missouri m ontana oregon vermont and washington might indexation work at the federal level some think that it might others are less certain while still others reject the concept outright the concept of indexation various theories have been offered w ith respect to indexation of the minimum wage in general the concept would be to anchor the minimum to an independent economic variable such as the consum er price index cpi or average hourly earnings in manufacturing ahe ot her options are also available according to some proponents of indexa tion if one were to link the minimum wage to the cpi for example it could be expected automatically to keep pace with inflation however use of indexation woul d seem to imply looking backward to last quarter or to last year and using that level of increase as the basis for increasing the federal minimum wage given the vari ation in the economy backward looking model may have certain drawbacks although indexation may be viewed as device through which members of congress would be relieved of responsibility for wage settings some suggest that having members actively invol ved rather than having formula is useful this depends upon ones interpretati on of the minimum wage whether it represents social policy or conversely is pr imarily an economic measure to be used on occasion in response to general economic conditions having the minimum wage associated with relatively stable economic variable could provide assurance to lowwage workers that as the costofliving increases their earnings will also increase under the present system there have been relatively long periods during which the minimum wage was not raised sometimes for as long as decade while the general economy moved along an upward trajectory at times this was the result of philosophi cal design on other occasions it may have resulted from the press of business before the congress however during such periods the statutory wage of the work ing poor has been allowed to atrophy51 early concerns and equity during 1937 and 1938 congress debated the federal minimum wage under severe pressure

of employer s and workers some of the concerns expressed by the small business community we re generic having to do with federal regulation of industry by government othe r concerns were rooted in the

pay their workers less than the otherwise standard federal minimum wage based solely upon th eir size conversel should profitab ility be consideration in wagehour applicability much of the early argument against the minimum wage was framed in terms of small business some argued that the tremendous amount and prohibitive cost of the bookkeeping and records involved w ould make payment of the minimum wage inequitable for small busine ss and involve such businesse s in processes with which they are unfamiliar60 as was frequently true the case for small business was argued not in terms of the owners ie personal loss of profit but rather as defense of employees of small firm who would surely be hurt if profits for their employers were affected it is the little fellow for whom i am talking observed one member it is the little industries in my district that are giving employment to those few people situated way up on the mountains and out in the country that cannot pay this wage those people he suggested will be out of employment61 while some expressed concern that adoption of minimum wage would have negative impact upon the economy others ex pressed sense that employers under the profit motive were opposing such legisl ation in order to enhance their personal or corporate gain one senator proposed that firms employing 10 or fewer than 10 persons be automatically excl uded from wagehour coverage62 yet another argued i do not care whether the manufacturing unit is small one or large one the american people are opposed to the exploitation and oppression of workers in plants of any size63 member from texas affirmed i think that we can all agree that any industry that serves useful economic purpose should be able to pay this wage the projected minimum and operate on

debate about the impact of minimum wage or small business exemption eventually came down to the actual wording of the statute the intent of the legislation may not always have been clear as the act was expanded and new groups of workers were included protests arose from employers on some occasions congress designed an exemption to meet particular industry and it wrote into the st atute very specialized language on other occasions exemptions were more generic that is employers earning less than given amount would not be covered the va rious modes of exemption came to exist sidebyside in 1977 general sma ll business exemption was set at 362500 but with other options included for particular i ndustries the result seems to have caused confusion among employers and possibly among workers67 with the 1989 amendments to the flsa th ere was some effort at consolidation figure of 500000 taking into account increased general wages and prices seemed reasonable to some and congress adopted it68 as reported in the house it was explained small enterprises whose total volume of sales or business done is less than 500000 would longer be covered in eliminating several confusing tests to determine applicability of the act to va rious industries the committee continues to demonstrate its sic support for the principle of true small business exemption the report continued this streamlined threshold test coupled with the elimination of exemptions elsewhere in the act shoul d make it much easier to determine which enterprises are covered and which are not 69 the measure was signed into law in midnovember 1989 in early february an article in the nations restaurant news explained that in consolidating and simplifying the language of the act the meaning had been altered

might assist the more severely disabled to develop better industrial skills but in practice it seems to have been source of endless dispute among the parties creating sense of frustration on both sides since in practice all of the nonsupervisory workers were in some measure disabledin mid1938 the flsa wa s adopted nd under section 14 later section 14c the several approaches were drawn together

carried on by charita ble groups he ruled that the wages in sheltered workshops special facilities empl oying the disabled would be set on the basis of earning capacity73 thus in practice dual st andard was established productivity wage in sheltered workshops and specific minimum rate for other sheltered employment from the beginning the social services industry tended to dominate the program and generally spoke for employers of the disabled it was not clear however who spoke for persons with disabilities on ce the program had been established it continued in place through the next several decades reform and oversight practical problems arose in the administr ation of the program some though disabled sought employment in the private sector and at the minimum wage or better their compensation would be arra nged whether collectively or individually on the same basis as other workers so workers remained sheltered under variety of programs more complex issue was the basic structure of the program within the system some workers were marginally di sabled and with minor assistance could function nearly as well or in some cases better than the standard worker others were severely disabl ed perhaps victims of several interrelated disabling conditions often the two groups the marginally disa bled and the severely disabled seem to have found themselves associated in single work environment and under circumstances that ffected mutual productivity this may have been especially notable where production was shared or wh ere an integrated unit was produced in such cases how were each of the parties responsible for only segment of product to be paid74 these questions have pe rsisted through the years advocacy groups for the disabled tende d to be fragmented representing groups of individuals with different types of di sabilities and to this were added other problems for example whether the disabled were to be regarded as clients or as patients was an important considera tion where treatment was concerned over time the issues continued to be debated in 1986 new hearings resulted in more formal treatment of the disabled and new compensation

century massachusetts wisconsin oregon the distri ct of columbia ca lifornia and other jurisdictions had experiment ed with various aspects of wage regulation but often where such efforts were effective th ey were overturned by the courts then in 1937 the supreme court in west coast hotel co v parrish86 reversed long tradition of opposing fe deral regulation of labor standards by affirming the right of the state of washington to regulate working conditions federal legislation was promptly introduced with passage of the fair labor standards act the following year atten tion focused upon the federal jurisdiction and intermittently the fede ral act has been expanded new focus of legislative authority after 1938 the thrust of minimum wage nd related legislati on came to rest in washington dc while the states cont inued frequently to enact and to update their state minimum wage laws these seem largely to have been peripheral filling in gaps in the federal legislation or wh ere deemed appropriate extending coverage to specific groups that had been ex empted under the federal statute decline of value of the federal standard up to the 1980s consideration of the minimum wage remained largely with the federal government then during the 1980s the statute remained somewhat dormant in 1989 there was momentary boost during the bush presidency as the rate moved in steps from 335 an hour in place since 1981 to 425 an hour by 199187 after the 1989 round the minimum wage d eclined in value under the impact of attrition until 1996 when twostep incr ease was enacted bringing the wage floor to 425 in 1996 and to 515 in1997 nothing further occurred for more than decade in 2007 the wage was once more ra ised in steps to projected level of 725 an hour by mid2009 however by th time that the 2007 increases will have been given effect the real value of the minimum wage will have declined substantially leaving the field open once again to the states88httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34510crs25 89 one of the elements discussed in the 1937 debates was interstate competition based upon wage rates more recently during hearings in 1995 senator nancy kassebaum rka noting that massachusetts had raised its state minimum wage above the federal inquired of senator john kerry dma if we keep it the federal minimum wage at 425 do you think businesses would consider relocating in say kansas or somewhere else if there is that disparity because it obviously is going to be consideration for some businesses senator kerry responded that was and is an issue that was raised and it is very legitimate question i am passionately committed to not having massachusetts be disadvantaged as to other states and clearly one of the things an business will look at is the question of the minimum wage see us senate fair labor standards ac t the minimum wage hearings of the committee on labor and human resources december 15 1995 washington gpo 1996 p 6 90 in

idaho where the rate w ill increase along with the federal ratedevolution to the states in 1989 and again in 1996 marginal increases were made in the minimum wage but generally the federal statute failed to keep pace with inflation during periods in wh ich there was action at the federal level the focus shifted back to the states see table 2 there are now 34 states and other jurisdictions that have wage rates in excess of the federal minimum and several of the states have indexed the minimum rate to increase at regular intervals see section on indexation the shift from federal action back to the states may seem appropriate to some but it may also have implications for public policy for industry and for labor it means dealing with variety of jurisdictions each with its own standard it may also mean renewed competition between highwage state and state with relatively low wages89 for investors it could also be f actor among many in considering where to invest especially in regions where there may be significant crossborder traffic or where other factors come into play for example in states with righttowork laws 90 though wage rates may differ from one state to the next other aspects of wagehour law may also be different for example in some states tip credit may not be allowed while just across the stat border it may be or hiring youth workers at subminimum rate may be permitted in one state but precluded in neighboring state in short each state may prescribe its own conditions for employment so long as they do not conflic t with the federal st andard under the flsa where there is conflict between state nd federal standards the requirements most in favor of the worker the higher standard normally will prevail as state rates rise relative to the federal standard states could find themselves in competition for jobs and for development httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34510crs26 table 2 status of state minimum wage rates as of january 2008 jurisdictions with minimum

2003 wagehour adminis trator tammy mc cutchen published in the federal register proposed rule updating section 13a1 that portion of the flsa that deals with minimum wages and overtime coverage for executive administrative or professional eap work ers under section 13a1 bona fide staff in the several categories are exem pt from the basic wage and hour provisions of the statute the mccutchen proposal was contentious triggering seve ral congressional hearings speaking generally organized labor was strongly opposed to the new regulation the department of labor was strongly in support of the change with modification final rule was issued in april 2004 taking effect in august 2004 since that time dol has been engaged in review of the operation of the rule offering series of new opinion letters dministrative advisories on classification of workers about the rule the original rule governing eap workers with roots going back to the early new deal era had been given effect in 1938 and had been revi sed periodically up to 1975 thereafter although various ggested changes were announced the regulation was not updated until the 2003 2004 rulemaking as implemented in order to qualify for exemption from the flsa targeted workers have to be paid at least 23660 per year and be engaged in activities that would qualify one as an executive administrator or professional for persons paid in excess of 100000 per year there is presumption that he or she has met the qualifying criteria absent any contention to the contrary what does it mean to qualify for exempt status if one meets the salary and duties tests one is an eap employee this means in effect that one does not need to be paid for overtime hours worked rega rdless of how frequent and extensive such overtime may become working through to the completion of ones task is merely part of the responsibility that goes along with being an executive an administrator or professional thus there is tradeoff each of these categories may have certain advantages associated with them but in wagehour terms the bottom line is relatively simple eap workers do not n eed to be paid overtime for hours worked in excess of 40 per week there are two tests for qualification under the rule the first test is one of salary as noted above the second test involves duties each position is judged individually but the duties of each individual worker can present problem for example when is an emergency medical technician professional or simply staffer with very serious work but with real professional responsibility how about funeral director journa list paralegal or chef in each of these fields and in many others clear distinction between exempt and nonexempt must rest upon precise an alysis of the work that is

independent discre tion and judgment does he have choice of work assignments and some measur of independence over the content of his work does she have the power to hire or fire subordina tes what is their primary duty and as telling how important is their primary duty to their employer such questions under dol regulations need to be addresse d for each type of work and frequently must be defined in the context of the work environment and culture in some cases though it may longer be controlling the amount of time that one spends in performance of task may ssist in determining eap status is one task an executive or administrative or professional function performed once year sufficient to render work er exempt or if one looks at the element of hiring and firing of subordinates does the deci sion rest strictly with the putative epa worker or is there an internal review panel that oversees such actions how much real latitude does the worker have the duties test can be enormously comp lex involving categories of workers across the entire spectrum it can also be source of near endless litigation as persons move into and out of exempt or nonexempt status in place and being tested the new rule is in place and being tested91 during recent months the department has been engaged in numerous reevaluations of the work processes of eap workers mainly these reviews and analyses deal with the duties test but such efforts tend to be of limite d reach often resting upon specific case and particular assumptions and unable to be applied w ith confidence to general categories of workers in early 2004 prior to release of the fi nal rule labor secretary elaine chao stated that the primary goal of the propos ed rule is to have better rules in place that will benefit more workers especially lowwage workers its intent she affirmed is to restore overtime protections especially to lowwage vulnerable workers who have little bargaining power with employers ms chao added clear concise and updated rules w ill better protect workers and strengthen the departments ability to enforce the law92 when the final rule was released in april 2004 ms chao stated the department is very proud of the final rule93 she added that she was pleased to see people recognize the significant gains to workers under our final rule and noted that t here can be doubt that workers win94

reports indicate people are gaining overtime protection97 later radzely was quoted as saying we have not seen single incident let alone the predicted 6 million incidents of an employee who has lost pay as result of the regulations and further once we got past the extreme rhetoric there have been surprisingly few issues in contention98 the real test may come with the adminis tration of the rule in particular the longterm impact upon the kinds of workers to which ms chao has referred recently the bureau of national affairs reported that three years after the new fair labor standards act whitecollar exemption regulations were implemented referring to discussion by panel of attorneys at the american bar associations employment law section the changes ve opened the door to new areas of wage and hour litigation that were not predicted when the rules were launched steven zeiff an attorney from san francisco suggested that the increased emphasis on the duties test has occurred because the new regulations clarified that the whitecollar exemption analysis should look to an empl oyees duties and not merely the job title zeiff stated courts are all over the place when it comes to the duties test99 the administration is several years into the new section 13a1 regulations have workers been bumped up or down in terms of pay and duties as result of these tests in order to assist them
