provisions 7 comparison of the house and senate etibusiness investment bills hr 4520 and s 1637 108th congress major focus of congressional tax policy deliberations in the first half of 2004 has been legislation that addresses the controversy between the european union eu and the united states over the us tax codes extraterritorial income eti tax benefit for exporting in recent years the eu has complained that the us eti provisions contravene the world trade organizations wto prohibition of export subsidies in series of panel rulings the wto has supported the eus complaint and authorized the eus imposition of retaliatory tariffs on us goods the eu began phasedin imposition of the tariffs in march both the house and the senate passed versions of legislation addressing the eti controversy the senate on may 11 s 1637 and the house on june 17 hr 4520 on july 15 the senate prepared the bill for conference by approving its own version of hr 4520 that contained the language of the bill it had approved in may but with the addition of buyout provisions for tobacco quotas the house bill contains its own tobacco buyout provisions both the house and senate bills proposed to phase out eti but contain wide range of additional tax cuts that in contrast to etis repeal would cut business taxes rather than increase them in general the tax cuts in both bills contained mix of tax incentives primarily for domestic production and tax cuts for overseas investment both bills also contained variety of revenue raising items the conference agreement while the bills overlapped in several areas there were prominent differences among both the tax cuts and the revenueraising items and among both the bills domestic and international provisions on october 6 house and senate conferees approved version of hr 4520 reconciling the bills differences the house approved the agreement on october 7 and the senate on october 11 the president signed the bill on october 22 it became public law pl 108357 according to joint tax committee estimates the bill agreement would reduce tax revenue by 87 billion over five years and would be virtually revenueneutral over 10 years increasing revenue by 1 million over fiscal years 20052014 like the house and senate bills the conference agreement is quite broad in scope and focuses on business taxes it contains broad range of both tax cuts and tax increases and like the house and senate bills the centerpiece of the conference agreement is repeal of the eti export tax benefit on the one hand and provision tax benefit for domestic production on the other along with number of tax cuts for crs2 firms with overseas production the conference agreement follows the senates version of domestic production benefit providing deduction rather than taxrate cut for domestic production after phasein the deduction would be 9 of taxable income as with both the house and senate bills the largest tax reduction for multinational firms is an alteration of the rules for allocating interest expense in connection with the foreign tax credit limitation other prominent differences between the house and senate bills included number of items included in the house bill but not the senate legislation these included number of tax cuts including rate reduction for lower levels of corporate income an extension of the expensing benefit for equipment investment liberalized depreciation for leaseholds and an option for individual taxpayers to deduct state and local sales taxes rather than income taxes of these the october conference agreement did not provide the ratereduction but included the other three of these items likewise the senate bill contained number of investment tax cuts not in the house bill including tax incentives related to energy and an extension of the allowable carryback period for tax losses net operating losses or nols these two items were not in the conference bill for more detailed list of the conference agreements provisions see crs report rl32652 the 2004 corporate tax and fsceti bill the american jobs creation act of 2004 impact on tax revenues according to estimates by the joint committee on taxation jct the house bill would reduce tax revenue by 324 billion over period generally spanning its first five years fy2005fy2009 and by 357 billion over its first 10 years fy2005fy2014 the senate bill would reduce revenue by 102 billion over its first five years and increase revenue by 847 million over its first 10 years1 these are net amounts comprised of the impact of revenue losing items minus revenue raising items the scope of the changes that would be implemented by the bills is thus not fully reflected by the net estimates the difference in the expected direction of the bills impact over the longer estimating period that is the house bills projected revenue loss and the senate measures expected small revenue gain is chiefly due to larger revenueraising provisions in the senate bill particularly in the areas of tax shelters expatriation and energy the bills revenuelosing provisions would reduce revenue by roughly comparable amounts jct revenue estimates for the conference committee chairmans mark indicate the conference agreement would reduce revenue by 8766 billion over five years fy2005fy2009 and would increase revenue by 238 million over ten years 1 us

sidebyside comparison of the house and senate bills follows extraterritorial income eti benefit for exports both bills address the eti controversy by phasing out the provision the bills differ however in the particulars of the phaseout senate house phases out the eti benefit over 2004 phases out the eti benefit over 2005 and 2006 with full repeal applicable in 2007 2006 with full repeal applicable in 2007 during the phaseout period during during 20052006 firms eti benefit 20042006 firms eti benefit would would equal specified percentage of the equal specified percentage of their full eti benefit that would otherwise average benefit in 20002001 apply for that year tax benefits restricted to domestic production by definition exports are produced in the domestic economy rather than abroad tax benefit for exports such as eti therefore necessarily poses tax incentive that favors domestic over overseas investment both bills contain new tax incentives that are explicitly limited to domestic rather than foreign investment although in view of wto rulings against export subsidies such as eti the new benefits apply to domestic production in general and are not restricted to the export sector senate house phases in 9 tax deduction for phases in reduction in the top corporate domestic production that initially would tax rate to 32 from current laws 35 decline in proportion to the extent of the deduction would not be diminished firms foreign operations the deduction by foreign operations or subject to wage would be limited to 50 of wages paid cap for firm receiving the full deduction and subject to the top corporate tax rate the benefit would have an effect similar to reducing the tax rate to 3185 tax reductions for foreignsource income foreign tax credit us citizens and firms are generally permitted to credit foreign taxes they pay against us tax they would otherwise owe on foreignsource income in general the crs4 bills each provide more generous rules relating to the foreign tax credit and associated calculations the tax code provides that foreign taxes can offset only the portion of firms us tax liability that applies to foreign and not domestic income many of the changes in the two bills apply to the rules firms must follow in calculating this limitation while there are some differences between the two bills there is substantial overlap the bills

that certain types of income principally income from passive investment such as interest rents royalties and dividends are subject to us tax even if earned through foreign subsidiary and not repatriated in general the bills would expand the scope of the deferral benefit incrementally by relaxing certain subpart f rules and making other changes as with the bills foreign tax credit

substantially different between the bills prominent provisions that are in the house but not the senate bill are reduction of the tax rates that apply to lower levels of corporate income and provision allowing individual taxpayers the alternative of deducting state and local sales taxes rather than income taxes the house bill also contains nontax provision providing compensation to tobacco farmers
