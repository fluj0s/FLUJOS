session as congress continues to deal w ith the hurricanes aftermath and as resource to help quickly identify some of the potential trade effects of any other natural or manmade disaster that might strike the u s gulf coast included are five graphs map and table summarizing specific trade da ta for the 16 ports finally this report looks at potential trade implications of any such disasters and id entifies some policy issues it will not be updated1 purpose of this report the gulf of mexico can be likened to gi gantic harbor whose span is roughly equal to onehalf the distance between the us atlantic and pacific coasts it is not surprising therefore that roughly 80 of the value of all trade that enters or leaves the united states along the gulf coast does so by water the strength of the gulf harbor is that it is somewhat protected and centrally located for easy water access to europe and the mediterranean africa south america or through the panama canal asia the problem with the gulf however is that because of recent weather changes it has been the site of increased numbers of higher intensity hurricanes these include hurricane katrina which struck the gulf coast on august 29 2005 and hurricane rita which struck the gulf coast on september 24 2005 temporarily closing or partially closin g five of the 16 trade ports2 and paralyzing th massive

edition fall 2005 p 35of oil and gas facilities including drilling platforms pipelines and refineries such disasters can result in considerable disruption to trade as commodities some of them perishable are delayed di verted destroyed or simply hung up and unable to get through blocked ports the us national hurricane center has reported that it expects recent wind and water temperature changes in the atlantic ocean which spawned these more intense storms to continue possibly for 25 years or more3 this report examines trade entering and leaving the united states through the gulf of mexicos 16 major ports which together account for 99 of all gulf waterborne trade it is designed as tool for planning or reaction as resource to help quickly identify some of the potential trade effects of any natural or manmade disaster that might strike the us gulf coast finally this report looks at potential trade implications of any such disasters and identifies some policy issues trade through us gulf ports along the gulf lie 16 of the 41 largest us ports see map figure 6 houston the gulfs largest ranks 4th and new orleans the second largest ranks 12th in size based on total trade value see table 1 among all us ports for waterborne trade three quarters of imports and exports of the 16 gulf ports are from three industries oil agriculture and chemicals this specialization results in large part from geography because the gulf area has traditionally been rich with oil and gas the processing industry for these resources grew up around them making the gulf magnet for additional oil and gas imports the chemical industry and many of its products derive in turn from crude oil symbiotically they also feed into thegulf trade as of total us trade oil 52chemicals 12composition of

and represent export and import data from the us census bureau manipulated by the us maritime admini stration to reflect waterborne tradeagricultural industry agricultural exports th rough gulf ports owe their abundance to the bargebased mississippi river tr ansportation system which ca rries products from at least 16 states cheaply and efficiently and deposits them in new orleans or nearby ports overall see figure 1 waterborne exports and imports that pass through us gulf of mexico ports account for less than onetenth of us trade 9 but much greater share of the oil 52 agricultural 8 and chemical 12 industries the remaining quarter of that trade is mostly machinery base metals textilesapparel and rubberplastics4 figure 2 shows the relative size and composition of us gulf exports and imports separately imports at 136 billion in 2004 are more than twice the value of exports at 62 billion and oil imports at 96 billion clearly dominate gulf imports accounting for 70 and account for nearly half 48 of all gulf trade agriculture the united states is the worlds largest agricultural exporter facilitated by the mississippi river which is an important component of the uss comparative advantage in agricultural trade the river is the central artery of 14500 mile inland waterway its barge traffic takes agricultural commodities especially grain down to ocean going vessels in new orleans and south louisiana and delivers such imports as coffee back up the river020406080100120140160 other 10chemicals 18agriculture 14 oil gas 8machinery 8rubberplastic 4 other 20oil gas 96base

of mexico is one of the great oil and gas production and refining regions in the world it is major region for oil and gas infrastructure including pipelines oil and gas wells oil and gas platforms and refinery at virtually every port nearly 60 of all oil consumed in the united states is imported roughly half see figure 2 of all imported oil enters the united states through the gulf much of it from

others elsewhere and such heavy products as petroleum coke whic h has various uses and is something the united states can spare chemicals the numerous chemical plants in the gulf particularly along the texas and louisiana gulf coasts account for slightly greater share of gulf exports and imports than does agriculture twenty percent of all us chemical exports exit through gulf ports see figure 4

implications and policy questions the extent to which the key us gulf indus tries are affected by disasters in the gulf area depends on which ports and industry infra structures are affected the 16 key ports in the gulf of mexico are depicted below in map form figure 6 and in table form table 1 for each port table 1 lists column 1 the name of the port and its ranking based on total exports and imports among all us ports the total 2004 trade value column 2 the total value of that ports exports together with major exports and their share of that ports total column 3 and the total value of that ports imports together with major imports and their share of that ports total column 4 if some ports are damaged products can be shipped out of the country through other ports but transportation costs may increase and perishable commodities may be lost although figure 6 shows commodity specialization by port many ports export high volumes of key commodities all 16 ports except gulfport handle oil as an export or import and typically include refineries all 16 ports ex port chemicals although only 10 specialize in chemical exports most grain exports pass through texas or louisiana only pascagoula specializes in exporting pou ltry although sizabl quantities of poultry not shown in table 1 also pass through mobile new orleans gulf port or houston gulfport specializes in textile and apparel exports hurricane katrina closed or partially closed five main gulf ports new orleans south louisiana mobile pascagoula and gulfport hurricane rita affected two beaumont and galveston most ports were quickly reopened while some goods found other import or export routes some oil production f acilities have still not reopened at the time this report was published currently monthly statistics on waterborne trade in us gulf ports are lagging economic activity by at least seven months thus statistics from which to estimate changes in the value of exports and imports as result of these hurricanes will likely not be available until about mid2006 meanwhile the us census bureau has begun releasing preliminary export and import data for all gulf ports covering months since hurricanes katrina and rita struck however these data have not been further refined by the us maritime ad ministration these data are available at httpwwwcensusgovforeigntradepressre leasegulf_indexhtml with data from either source however it may be hard to separate out effect s of katrina from other effects such as overall weather and supply and mand especially on agricultural products which may vary considerably in t onnage and value from year to year the potential for additional hurricanes in the gulf region in the coming years raises number of trade policy questions some of the most importa nt ones revolve around options for protecting the trade infrastructure which includes the mississippi river grain storage elevators the various ports oil facilitie s in the gulf of
