lawrence kapp analyst in national defense foreign affairs and national defense division congressional research service the library of congress abstract this report describes the creation and failure of the ready reserve mobilization income insurance program program designed to help military reservists protect themselves from financial loss during an involuntary order to federal active duty this report also discusses and analyzes several alternative policy options for addressing the issue of income loss among reservists due to mobilization this report will not be updated in the future the ready reserve mobilization income insurance program summary the ready reserve mobilization income insurance program rrmiip was department of defense dod program designed to help military reservists protect themselves from financial loss during an involuntary order to federal active duty though intended to be selffinancing program the rrmiip became insolvent soon after its debut in 1996 due to low enrollment and severe adverse selection the program was terminated by congress only year later and congress eventually appropriated total of 119 million to pay off insurance claims associated with the rrmiip the failure of the rrmiip diminished interest in mobilization insurance both in congress and dod but there has been continuing pressure by some reservists and various reservist interest groups to implement new program this report examines the creation and failure of the rrmiip and analyzes some possible options for addressing the issue of income loss due to mobilization including restructured mobilization insurance program individual savings and investment government reimbursement of loss and private insurance contents background 1 current issues 5 is there real need for

and investment 10 b government reimbursement of loss 11 c private insurance 12 inquiries about this report should be directed to robert goldich or david burrelli specialists in national defense at the congressional research service the ready reserve mobilization income insurance program background the ready reserve mobilization income insurance program rrmiip was instituted in response to growing concerns about the reported financial losses incurred by some reservists1 who were activated for the persian gulf war operation desert stormshield 19901991 although the soldiers and sailors civil relief act sscra2 has long given reservists some protection against financial loss due to mobilization one survey sponsored by the department of defense dod indicated that as many as twothirds of the reservists activated during operation desert shieldstorm suffered economic loss as result of their deployment3 these losses occurred due to differences between the reservists military and civilian pay expenses incurred by reservists because of mobilization and the decline in business experienced by selfemployed reservists during and after release from active duty another dodsponsored survey indicated that the potential for income loss during an activation was major concern for both officers and enlisted personnel in the reserves4 given dods increasing reliance on the reserve components dod was especially concerned that this potential for financial loss would have negative impact on recruiting and retention in the reserves thereby undermining the readiness of the reserve component and its ability to carry out future missions in 1996 congress directed dod to establish an optional income insurance program for reservists who were involuntarily ordered to active duty for more than 1 throughout this paper the terms reserves and reserve components refer to the ready reserve which is comprised of the army national guard army reserve air national guard air force reserve navy reserve marine corps reserve and coast guard reserve the term reservist refers to individual members of these organizations 2 soldiers and sailors civil relief act of 1940 october 17 1940 ch 888 54 stat 1178 some of the financial protections offered by the sscra are protection against foreclosures on homes and property reduction of interest rates on loans penalty free cancellation of leases as well as postponement of various legal processes for more information on this topic see crs report 91342 the soldiers and sailors civil relief act of 1940 as amended to date summary by robert b

reserve affairs deborah r lee status report on the ready reserve mobilization income insurance program may 8 1997 1 crs2 30 days5 dod implemented the program on october 1 1996 under the name ready reserve mobilization income insurance program after being notified of the program6 current reservists were given 60day window in which to enroll in the program if they so desired upon joining the reserves new reservists were automatically enrolled for 1000 worth of income insurance but were given the option to alter or eliminate the coverage within 60 days program participants were required to pay 1220 per month for each 1000 of coverage up to maximum of 6100 per month for 5000 of coverage after 30 days of covered service7 the insured reservists were entitled to receive monthly benefit payment equivalent to the amount of coverage purchased for up to twelve months out of any eighteen month period the program was meant to be selffinancing with benefits to be completely financed by the premiums paid into the system by enrolled reservists the rrmiip ran into difficulties almost from the moment it started first reservists signed up for the program at much lower rate than anticipated on the basis of survey research dod anticipated that about 40 percent of reservists8 or approximately 360000 individuals would enroll in the program in actuality only about 3 percent of reservists roughly 26000 individuals chose to enroll this dramatically reduced the amount of money which was paid into the system second the rrmiip suffered from severe adverse selection adverse selection occurs when those most likely to suffer loss are covered in greater proportion than others this can create situation where the actual losses incurred by the insurer are much greater than the losses originally anticipated as insurance premiums are based on anticipated losses the accumulated premiums in the insurance fund prove insufficient to pay for losses 5 p l 104106 section 512 february 10 1996 national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1996 110 stat 299305 6 the notification and enrollment process was decentralized occurring at the unit level thus the actual date on which individual reservists received notification starting the 60day clock varied from unit to unit 7 the term covered service means active duty performed by member of reserve component under an order to active duty for more than 30 days which specifies that the members service is in support of an operation mission for which members of the reserve components have been ordered to active duty without their consent or b is in support of forces activated during period of war declared by congress or period of national emergency declared by the president or congress 10 usc 12521 2 8 these statistics refer only to members of the selected reserve subelement of the ready reserve which contains those units and individuals most essential to wartime missions selected reservists generally perform one weekend of training each month for which they receive monthly paycheck and two weeks of training each year for which they receive separate paycheck another subelement of the ready reserve is the individual ready reserve which contains manpower pool of pretrained individuals who have already served in the active component or the selected reserve but who are not required to train regularly like the selected reserve members of the selected reserve about 900000 individuals were the primary target of the rrmiip although members of the individual ready reserve about 500000 individuals were also eligible to enroll crs3 certain amount of adverse selection was inevitable due to commonly known information about the recent patterns of reserve mobilization reservists in certain military specialties which have been in high demand in postcold war us military operations such as military police or civil affairs or in units with high readiness ratings could reasonably conclude based on recent mobilization patterns that their risk of mobilization was relatively high and therefore opt to purchase mobilization insurance reservists in military specialties or units less likely to be activated based on recent experience such as infantry or armor or in units with low readiness ratings could similarly conclude that their risk of mobilization was minimal and opt not to purchase mobilization insurance dod recognized this risk of adverse selection and attempted to adjust the mobilization insurance premium accordingly9 however different and more severe form of adverse selection occurred due to the unfortunate timing of the programs debut the rrmiip was initiated at the same time the clinton administration decided to extend the us presence in bosnia beyond december of 1996 as result the enrollment period for the rrmiip occurred at the same time many reservists were being mobilized for the third rotation10 of operation joint endeavor the bosnian peacekeeping mission thus many of those who signed up for the rrmiip were people who suspected or knew that they were about to be deployed in striking contrast to the 3 percent of the general reserve population who signed up for mobilization insurance some 85 percent of those activated for the third bosnia rotation enrolled in the program in most instances these reservists opted for the maximum benefit coverage of 5000 per month11 as result the insurance program had to respond to large benefit claims almost immediately however due to the low enrollment rate and the short time it had been in operation the program had not received sufficient premium payments to cover those claims this problem was not unforeseen the dod education benefits board of actuaries specifically warned thensecretary of defense william perry of this potentiality almost two months before the program was to begin in discussing the difficulty of setting an appropriate premium for the insurance fund the board of 9 seventeen percent of the rrmiip premium cost was related to dods assumption about the extent of adverse selection in the program source department of defense office of the secretary of defense for reserve affairs questions

endeavor under provision of law which authorized reservists to serve on active duty for more than 270 days therefore shortly before reaching this statutory limit activated reservists were replaced by another rotation of newly mobilized reservists most members of the third rotation of reservists for operation joint endeavor received official notification of their impending mobilization between october 1996 and january 1997 unofficial notification may have occurred slightly earlier actual mobilization for most members of the third rotation occurred between november 1996 and february 1997 11 department of defense office of the secretary of defense for reserve affairs questions and answers for hnsc manpower personnel sc hearing on 8 may 1997 concerning the ready reserve mobilization income insurance program rrmiip may 8 1997 12 crs4 actuaries stated the bosnia callup appears likely to extend beyond october 1 1996 when the insurance program takes effect although reservists then on active duty are ineligible others who replace them can purchase insurance and trigger substantial benefits in fiscal year 1997 such outlays may endanger the fund right away12 dod considered this warning but believed that callup during the startup period for the mobilization insurance program while risk was considered manageable in view of the premium income projected from overall enrollment13 the premium income which dod projected however failed to materialize due to the low level of overall enrollment in the program by december of 1996 1568033 was needed to cover insurance claims from about 500 mobilized reservists but only 634361 had been paid into the fund in premiums creating deficit of 93367314 faced with the insolvency of the rrmiip dod officials announced in december of 1996 that they would only be able to pay eligible reservists 4 percent of their monthly benefit payment although they promised that full payment would eventually be made the funds deficit passed 40 million in may 1997 and continued to grow rapidly15 in june 1997 congress approved an emergency supplemental appropriation of 72 million to cover the programs liability in the 1997 emergency supplemental appropriations act16 soon thereafter in the fy 1998 national defense authorization act congress terminated the program17 in terminating the program congress agreed to provide benefits to any enrolled reservist who on november 18 1997 1 is serving on an order to covered service 2 has been issued an order directing performance of covered service or 3 has served on covered service before that date for which benefits under the program have not been paid to the member18 however the enrollments of all other reservists in the insurance program were terminated as of that date thus reservists who received orders calling them to active duty after november 18 1997 were not eligible for any benefits additionally provision was made to refund the premiums of those 12 department of defense education

of 47 million was provided in the 1998 supplemental appropriations and recissions act20 in order to pay everyone still owed benefits and to close the books on the program current issues in terminating the rrmiip congress left the door open for dod to study and propose options for new mobilization insurance program however informal contacts with dod personnel and congressional committee staffers indicate that there is little inclination within dod or congress to push for new mobilization insurance program at the current time the failure of the rrmiip and the intense criticism which accompanied that failure is still fresh in the minds of many key policymakers nonetheless there is continuing pressure by some reservists and interest groups which represent some reservists to implement new mobilization insurance program still the experience of the rrmiip raises some serious questions about the mobilization insurance concept which are discussed below is there real need for mobilization insurance an issue when considering any new proposal for mobilization insurance is the level of demand for such program among reservists the willingness of reservists to participate in such program is vital to its success however as the rrmiip demonstrated accurately assessing the demand for mobilization insurance may not be an easy task according to former assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs deborah lee years of study showed that the potential income loss resulting from involuntary activation was the number one concern for reserve personnel21 moreover an analysis conducted by the rand corporation under contract to dod indicated that most reservists were willing to purchase mobilization insurance in order to protect themselves from income loss according to lee rand reported that over 67 percent of enlisted personnel and 55 percent of officers said they 19 there was some disagreement about whether or not to refund premiums dod reportedly favored policy of refunding premiums due to the quick collapse of the fund the senate agreed and in its version of the defense authorization act for fiscal year 1998 s 924 required the secretary of defense to refund premiums paid by reservists who had not received benefits under the program the house version contained such provision reflecting the view that mobilization insurance was similar to fire or auto insurance premiums are not refunded simply because the insured never files claim the house view prevailed in conference see maze rick refunds for those who didnt file mobilization claims army times october 6 1997 26 20 pl 105174 title i ch 1 sec 3 may 1 1998 1998 supplemental appropriations and recissions act 21 lee deborah we will do right by our troops army times may 26 1997 30 crs6 would buy mobilization insurance if the monthly cost were 100 per 100 of coverage22 yet the actual experience of the rrmiip contradicted the survey research the enrollment rate of 3 percent came nowhere near the 67 and 55 percent mentioned by assistant secretary lee nor did it come anywhere near the more conservative 40 percent enrollment rate anticipated by dod23 one explanation of this huge discrepancy is that the survey research drastically overstated the demand for mobilization insurance among reservists those questioned about mobilization insurance may have supported it in principle but when actually required to pay for the insurance many reservists may have concluded that their risk of mobilization was minimal and therefore declined to participate such decision may have been quite rational in light of recent mobilization patterns alternatively the survey data which was collected in 19911992 may have been obsolete by the time the program was implemented in 1996 the passage of time may have diminished the recollection of financial loss among those reservists who served during the gulf war and the natural turnover of personnel between 1991 and 1996 brought substantial number of new reservists into the reserve components who had experience whatsoever with mobilization and the financial troubles it could cause another possible explanation is that the program was poorly marketed rand telephone surveys conducted after the start up of the program found that 27 percent of reservists stated they were never informed of the program another 16 percent stated that they were informed but did not have sufficient information or time to make decision about enrolling24 however these survey responses also confirm that demand for mobilization insurance was much lower than anticipated for among the 57 percent of reservists who apparently were aware of the program and had sufficient information and time to make decision only small percentage chose to enroll recruiting and retention rates in the reserve components also seem to indicate that the problem of income loss is not as great concern as previously anticipated presumably if the risk of income loss associated with mobilization was serious problem for reservists recruiting and retention rates would suffer yet according to dod recruiting and retention rates for the reserve components have remained stable 22 us congress house of representatives committee on national security subcommittee on military personnel prepared statement of assistant secretary of defense reserve affairs deborah r lee status report on the ready reserve mobilization income insurance program may 8 1997 1 23 the disparity between rands estimate and dods estimate is perplexing considering that both estimates were apparently derived from the same information 24 us congress house of representatives committee on national security subcommittee on military personnel statement of mark gebicke director military operations and capabilities issues national security and international affairs division general accounting office observations on the ready reserve mobilization income insurance program may 8 1997 6 crs7 since the persian gulf war25 assistant secretary of defense lee conceded that the widespread recruiting and retention problems which were widely predicted from increased use of the guard and reserve have simply not occurred26 in light of this experience an argument can be made that there is not sufficient demand among reservists for mobilization insurance to warrant the creation of new program thus one policy option is to do nothing this option would be logical response to low interest among reservists for mobilization insurance and would eliminate the possibility of taxpayer dollars being used for another insurance fund bailout on the other hand maintaining current policy means that number of reservists will experience financial problems during any future reserve mobilization for even if there is little demand for mobilization insurance among reservists in general there may be great demand for it by specific individuals and among specific categories of reservists for example those reservists who hold exceptionally high paying jobs in their civilian life doctors lawyers pilots business owners would likely experience dramatic reduction in income during mobilization although constituting small percentage of the total number of reservists their financial losses would nonetheless be real and owing to the critical skills these reservists often possess of concern to military and civilian leaders if demand for mobilization insurance is primarily concentrated among certain types of reservists then smaller more focused program might be considered rather than broad all inclusive program such narrowly tailored program could however be criticized for protecting wealthier reservists while doing little to help middle and low income reservists wealthier reservists critics might point out may suffer substantial losses during mobilization but they often have greater financial resources with which to cushion their losses lower income reservists may suffer smaller losses than their wealthier counterparts but they often have lower levels of saving or other resources with which to protect themselves another factor when assessing the need for mobilization insurance is the future utilization of the reserve components with the drawdown of active duty forces the military is increasingly relying on the reserves to augment the active force not only for major combat operations like desert storm but for smaller peacekeeping and nationbuilding operations like bosnia and haiti thus the past experience with the rrmiip may not be good guide to the current and future needs of reserve personnel to the extent that reservists come to view mobilizations as routine occurrence rather than rarity their interest in mobilization insurance might increase 25 department of defense office of the secretary of defense for reserve affairs questions and answers for hnsc manpower personnel sc hearing on 8 may 1997 concerning the ready reserve mobilization income insurance program rrmiip may 8 1997 14 26 us congress house of representatives committee on national security subcommittee on military personnel oral statement of assistant secretary of defense reserve affairs deborah r lee status report on the ready reserve mobilization income insurance program may 8 1997 3 crs8 can the problems experienced by the rrmiip be avoided in new program the principal problems experienced by the rrmiip were low enrollment and adverse selection perhaps most importantly the problem of adverse selection was severely exacerbated by the coincidence of some bosnia mobilization orders with the beginning of the mobilization insurance program these problems could certainly be hedged against or even eliminated by various policy options several of these policy options are discussed below add waiting period or exclude an ongoing event an insurance program similar to the rrmiip could be set up with provision that coverage would not become effective for period of time say six or nine months after enrollment or with provision that precludes coverage for any military operation in progress at the time of enrollment this would eliminate the severe adverse selection which occurred under the rrmiip when reservists with knowledge of their imminent mobilization were offered mobilization insurance however this would not solve the more general problem of adverse selection reservists have some valuable knowledge of their relative risk of being deployed and would certainly use this knowledge in deciding whether to purchase income insurance or not nonetheless this type of adverse selection would be less severe than that encountered by the original rrmiip and might be compensated for by somewhat higher insurance premiums adding waiting period or excluding an ongoing event would do nothing to reduce the problem of low enrollment experienced by the rrmiip restricting eligibility for benefits in these ways could even decrease interest in the program b make mobilization insurance mandatory perhaps the most direct way to address the issues of adverse selection and low enrollment in administrative terms would be to make the mobilization insurance mandatory by enrolling all reservists automatically the two problems that plagued the rrmiip would be greatly mitigated additionally mandatory enrollment would substantially lower the cost of coverage currently similar policy is in place with respect to life insurance for reservists known as servicemembers group life insurance or sgli all reservists are automatically enrolled in sgli for 200000 worth of coverage they can opt for less coverage or coverage at all but the default coverage if the service member does nothing is 200000 mandatory enrollment would also strengthen the insurance funds ability to respond to the problem encountered by the rrmiip where the rrmiips liabilities were greater than its accumulated assets producing insolvency by providing the fund with guaranteed income stream mandatory enrollment would facilitate borrowing from the treasury to maintain solvency any such loan could then be paid back over time out of the stream of income flowing into the fund the biggest stumbling block to this approach would likely be the reaction of reservists to mandatory enrollment in program that would cost them money each month many reservists would probably judge their possibility of being mobilized to be so remote as to make this coverage waste of their money of course an opt out provision similar to that available for sgli coverage could mitigate such crs9 negative reaction but if substantial number of reservists chose to optout the problems of adverse selection and low enrollment might reappear another point to consider would be the size of the liability which could be incurred under mandatory enrollment policy if every member of the selected reserve were enrolled in the mobilization insurance program and the united states became involved in major conflict necessitating the mobilization of several hundred thousand reservists the monthly cost of providing insurance benefits would be very substantial for example assume that every selected reservist about 900000 individuals was enrolled for 1000 worth of mobilization insurance coverage and paid 1000 per month27 in premiums this would generate 9 million in income for the fund every month in five years the fund would accumulate little more than 702 million28 yet mobilization of 250000 reservists would create liability of 250 million per month thus if the fund had been in existence for five years at the time of the mobilization it would be insolvent by the fourth month of the mobilization29 of course if the fund were in existence for longer period of time before major mobilization occurred it might have sufficient assets to pay off the claims even if it did not have sufficient assets the fixed stream of income provided by mandatory enrollment might make it easier for the fund to borrow money from the treasury to cover these losses alternatively congress might be willing to appropriate money to cover the shortage as part of the cost of the war however it is important to note the potential for extraordinary demand on the fund under this policy option mandatory mobilization insurance coupled with major reserve mobilization could produce an unfunded liability much larger than that encountered by the rrmiip c make the insurance program loss based rather than value based the rrmiip was value based policy as participants purchased insurance with set value say 1000 per month whether they actually experienced income loss or not they received benefits equal to that amount each month under loss based policy also known as an indemnity policy reservists would only be eligible for benefits to the extent that they could demonstrate financial loss caused by their mobilization such policy would eliminate the incentive to purchase mobilization insurance when financial loss was anticipated as result of mobilization while this policy would not eliminate adverse selection it could help reduce it to more manageable level as many of those who anticipate being mobilized might nonetheless decline coverage 27 1000 per month for 1000 of coverage is slightly lower than the 1220 per month charged by the rrmiip mandatory coverage would produce lower premiums because every reservist would have to pay premiums even those with almost chance of mobilization 28 assumes the fund invests in private markets and those investments earn ten percent compound interest rate 29 assumes that as with the rrmiip benefits are paid for the first month of service crs10 significant downside of this policy option is that it would entail burdensome administrative requirements for verifying the amount of loss especially among those who are selfemployed this could have the effect of delaying payments to mobilized reservists at time when they need benefits most additionally this policy option would do little to address the issue of low enrollment and could produce even lower enrollment than that experienced under the rrmiip finally the people most likely to enroll in lossbased program would be those with the largest differential between civilian and military incomes doctors lawyers and pilots for example an insurance program whose benefits flow primarily to these groups would probably be subject to criticism as perk for the rich are there other ways to help reservists protect themselves against income loss besides new mobilization insurance program there are other ways to address the income loss problems associated with mobilization but they tend to be expensive either for the government or for the individual one of the great virtues of insurance is that it is relatively inexpensive way for the individual to protect himself or herself against the risk of future loss nonetheless there are other options some of which are outlined below individual saving and investment one set of policy options clusters around the notion that the individual reservist is primarily responsible for managing his own financial affairs in light of his status as reservist from this perspective mobilization is an obvious risk associated with reserve service those who join the reserve components receive compensation such as cash educational benefits and other privileges in return for accepting this risk therefore it is in large part the reservists responsibility to ensure that heshe has sufficient savings or investments to carry himself or herself through mobilization although the government can certainly implement policies which assist the individual in doing so for example the government could allow reservists to set aside certain amount of money each year in special savings account similar to an individual retirement account ira contributions and accumulated interest could be tax free allowing the reservist to build up fund that could be accessed during mobilization upon discharge or retirement from the reserve components the funds could be rolled over into an ira or made available for any use alternatively the account could be structured more like the thrift savings plan tsp for federal civilian employees whereby the reservists contributions are matched in whole or in part by the federal government while these ideas may have merit there are some drawbacks to them as well first of all as mentioned previously they are relatively expensive costing substantially more than mobilization insurance policy would for example reservist who anticipated an income loss of 1000 per month during deployment would have to put aside 9000 to cover his anticipated loss for standard 270 day mobilization even if the reservist made regular contributions over five year period with interest accruing tax free the reservist would still have to contribute crs11 about 115 per month30 in order to accumulate 9000 for many reservists the amount of money required to be put aside in such an account could prove to be unrealistically high for example in 1998 an officer in the reserves in the 03 paygrade31 with seven years of service made 433 for typical weekend drill an enlisted reservist in the e4 paygrade32 with four years of service made 184 for typical weekend drill33 setting aside 115 per month would consume 265 percent and 625 percent of their monthly paychecks respectively rather than set aside such large portion of their reserve paychecks every month for years on end to cover potential future loss many reservists would likely choose to ignore their risk and thereby leave themselves in financially precarious situation upon mobilization or alternatively to quit the reserves additionally such savings and investment plan even if generously subsidized by the government with matching contributions would do little to help mobilized reservists who had only recently joined the reserves unlike their longer serving comrades they would not have had sufficient time to accumulate any significant savings final point to consider would be the cost of any incentives offered by the government to stimulate saving and investment among reservists the tax benefits offered under an ira or tsp type program would decrease revenue to the treasury and the matching contributions offered under tsp type program would require direct government expenditure although the total cost to the government would depend on how the program was structured and how popular it was among reservists it could be substantial b government reimbursement of loss another alternative to mobilization insurance would be direct government reimbursement of income loss under such policy reservist who suffered loss in income could file claim for the loss and be reimbursed by the government either in full or in part such policy would be ideal from the perspective of the financially injured reservist it would require advance financial planning nor any direct cost however there are clear problems with such policy first of all it likely would prove to be quite expensive to the government in time of tight budget constraints such generous government program could be extemely difficult to justify secondly there would be problem of equity if the federal government directly reimbursed any income loss some mobilized reservists could be paid dramatically more than their active duty 30 assuming ten percent compound interest rate 31 the 03 paygrade is the paygrade of navy and coast guard lieutenants and army air force and marine corps captains 32 the e4 paygrade is the paygrade of army corporals and specialists navy and coast guard petty officers third class marine corps corporals and air force sergeants and senior airmen 33 the weekend drill pay figures reflect base pay only they do not reflect any special pays nor do they incorporate deductions for taxes or life insurance premiums the typical drill weekend referred to is also known as muta4 usually two full days of training conducted on saturday and sunday crs12 counterparts and other mobilized reservists for doing the exact same job34 such divergence could possibly cause dissension and hostility within the military finally such policy would require substantial administrative effort in order to verify the amount of loss especially among those who are selfemployed this could have the effect of delaying payments to mobilized reservists at time when they need their benefits most as well as adding to the overall cost of the program c private insurance another option would be encouraging private companies to offer reservists an insurance product similar to mobilization insurance if successful such policy option would capitalize on the expertise of successful insurance companies relieve the government of most of the risks associated with underwriting insurance policies and reduce the risk of insurance fund insolvency on the other hand it might be quite difficult to persuade private firm to provide such policy to reservists the unpredictability of the size frequency and duration of reserve mobilizations along with the strong evidence of adverse selection encountered in the rrmiip might make this unattractive to business of course there are any number of incentives that the government could offer these firms to make the business more attractive automatic payroll deductions for premiums mandatory coverage for reservists and protection against catastrophic losses for example however providing these incentives might prove to be economically costly or politically unpopular 34 of course this same objection can be raised against the concept of mobilization insurance certain reservists with mobilization insurance policies would make dramatically more than their active duty counterparts or other mobilized reservists without insurance policies for doing the exact same job however in the case of mobilization insurance there would probably be perception that the extra pay was the result of the individuals prudent financial management while in the case of direct government reimbursement there would probably be perception that the extra pay was simply extra pay for other versions of this document see
