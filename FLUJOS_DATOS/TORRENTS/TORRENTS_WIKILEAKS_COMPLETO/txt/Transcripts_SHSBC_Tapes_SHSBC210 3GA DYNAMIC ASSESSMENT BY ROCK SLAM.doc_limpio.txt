3ga dynamic assessment by rock slam lecture given on 18 september 1962 okay second lecture 18 september ad 12 3ga dynamic assessment once upon time there was thetan nobody happens to have that rule of thumb do they thats all right remember most of them 3ga the thing you should know about 3ga dynamic assessment by rock slam is that when it does not work you havent done it theres several tips one could give on this this is not particularly an expansive lecture that gives you all of the odd bits and all that sort of thing but its definitely of great interest to you that this has been working and it has been working very well it requires further working on and i am working on it further but there are many things you can do with this dynamic assessment by rock slam the idea is simply this the rock slam is called rock slam because it is needle manifestation which is achieved when the auditor is approaching what we once called the rock now theres something earlier than the rock and its called goal and if it were called goal slam you would have it because it is the goal that is slamming its producing great deal of random needle motion and this random needle motion is occurring solely entirely and completely because of the currents being set up amongst the items and identities the person has assumed or fought in the progress of executing his or her goal and it goes this way and it goes that way and it goes someplace else and the individual has place to go place to go to place to retire from in other words he cannot get away from it he cannot approach it nothing else is happening he is in state of agitation now this rock slam or goal slam which we will not call it we will maintain the word rock slam is thetan convulsion and in the absence of slamming needle you will very often find convulsing body the body will convulse before the rock slam will turn on people who have convulsing bodies may sometimes not develop rock slams and people who have rock slams may suddenly develop convulsing bodies was talking to somebody over in washington on an innocent subject and he looked like he was going to go into convulsion hes very very afraid of going into convulsion this idea upset him very much and that i was merely approaching the subject which he thought would send him into convulsion if id had him on the meter at that moment i would have found slamming needle do you see that so itthere it is in the bank the reactive bank and its the crisscross of currents that are battering thetan around and when this gets into solidity why it of course has the power of throwing the body around now the degree that it can throw the body around probably approaches poltergeist the thetan produces rock slam on the needle well thishes just feeling kind of thththth hes beingyou know his currents are going left right and center and so forth and theyre going through him and by him and up and down and side rrrrlllmm all right the next thing that would happen is this submergedthis is all surmised by the way but it has some factual evidence behind it im just trying to give you this illustratively you might have somebody who was convulsing physically you know the head starts going like this uhh uhhvuhhvuhhrvuhvuhhvuhhrvuhh see like slamming needle but then you also might have somebody whose whole body started to go that way and that is called an epileptic fit its also called other names that type of convulsion is the type im speaking of now supposing it advanced further than the body andthis is surmised you seeadvanced further than the body and entered the physical universe around the person and you would get the physical universe at first responding sort of enturbulatedly you get psycho walks up the front steps of an hgc the shipping clerk starts cutting his fingers with the shears you know thats fact you want to produce turbulence or something why just take some psycho and put him into the auditing lineup and youve got it you yourself will catch yourself dropping commands and so forth i had session like this in washington i was quite amazed i was handing out the wrong commands time or two and so forth ugh it was sort of aof theta poltergeist you know in the immediate atmosphere around dzzzzzzzz you know you could sort of feel it all right now if that went little bit further you would get real poltergeist perhaps you know the rugs being thrown around and so forth but certainly you get enmest whatever else you get you get enmest you look at that persons possessions and theyre starting to get chewed up you know you give this girl brandnew handbag and in the process of her grasping the handle it ages you get the idea anyway what it is is obsessive and random motion or postulate which is in state of producing obsessive and random intentions and impulses when restimulated lets say this fellow has goal to swim the english channel and we know this but he doesnt you see you never really get that as pure test we take him out to the cliff over at dover and we say to him we say swim the english channel see and my god he wouldnt know whether to jump off the cliff or run to london or hide under clam shell and hed probably go into some kind of convulsion hes being required to do something the requirement is illogical unreasonable unexpected you get all these conditions attached to itwould probably produce you some very interesting behavior and yet very often persons goal is said to them sometimes in level of command and person starts going bzzzbzztbzzzbzztblzzwzzzlzzmm you walk up to somebody who has goal to eat eats and you say to him im afraid youll eat the cat hell totally occlude the statement hell go straight into the bank and youll get rockslammy mental condition and hes liable to remember this on the backtrack as convulsion of some sort hes been backed into his item or hesor hes been backed into his goal in some fashion and he cant quite tell what it is but he sure feels random about it i see somebody has had this experience with an item or even goal and you remember times when this one suddenly was presented to you fellow has ahas goal to jump off high places see such goal anybody had has goal to jump off high places it is the goal you understand im not talking about random casual little subsidiary goal you know finds himself on high place man that is enough he doesnt jump off high places but actually he doesnt not jump off high places you get the idea he goes around seeking high places to jump off of and then never climbing up them now you should understand rock slam for what it is then it is the goal track theres many things you can say about it the pcs interest by the way follows the track of the goal and therefore follows the slam pcs interest follows the slam pcs getting interested the needles slamming pcs interested needles slamming pcs interested needles slamming pcs not interested needles not slamming in other words the pcs interest follows the slam pcs cognitions follow the slam all of sudden the pcs been sitting there as dead as some of this south african wood that wont even float in water see there he is total session response uhhuh hmhmm been like this for hundreds of hours of auditing hmhmm all of sudden this pc says to you ill bet all roof rafters are not really straight you know there is something about that theyre not really straight yes yes that item you just called out there thats very interesting notstraight roof rafters andandyes and it goes down on the other side too and very often theyre long yes ive had this experience and so forth sofunny thing ive just realized that most roof rafters they pretend they are straight see well if you werent watching your needle at the time youll find that it was you look down on it youd find it was slamming youre looking for the cogniting pc pcs any pc cognites when the slam is being followed youre going down the slam track and the pc will cognite if you just get on the edge of the slam someplace the pc is liable to cognite but pcs cognitions actually go down the track of the rock slam that is very interesting not that pc is suddenly inexplicably in session never having been before but the pc in actual fact is being reached as case well this is all grist to the auditors mill it isnt the pc is not insession when he is not rock slamming but if you want to see an exaggeration of insessionness it is during one of these periods now its as much as your life is worth to arc break pc who is in the middle of rock slam you wont be able to get away with the things you got away with when he wasnt rock slamming in other words it takes pretty careful auditing somebody the other day was busy teaching all the hcas in the central organization to do dynamic assessments and some of them were even up to running arc straightwire what he didnt realizewell we wont go into that and its all right everything is all straightened out now except theyre probably all mad at and realizing that i am preventing them from going clear im sure they realize this you really got to sit in there and audit that auditing better be pretty smooth if flub on your part coincides with cognition on the pcs part well 1 dont know blow up the room with an atomic bomb itd be much calmer somethings going to go wrong and furthermore the case is going to hang very badly at that point and will have to be straightened out you can get into more troubleanything you ever heard of by putting the pc on theon the track of slam and then all of sudden making horrible goof bust dropping the ball laying an egg in an auditing session it just isnt done therefore you should be pretty good auditor before you start monkeying around with rock slams now the pcs interest is high remember the old tone drop remember the curve the down curve remember youve got the guy going from tone 30 straight down to minus 8 with gradient now youre going to erase this well you spend the next few sessions patching it up see but this cant patch up because of course your patching it up means auditing and he already is cogniting but he s already cogniting on it but youve got to get rid of the auditing that messed it up so that in getting rid of the auditing that messed it up youre not then furthering his auditing or cognitions or ease but you cant further his auditing or cognitions or case until you have cleaned it up this is time an auditor wishes he just had never picked up that emeter on that pc it was the wrong time of day it must have had something to do with the stars in their conjunctions if not their prepositions this is very intense the whole subject of dynamic assessment is very intense and it should not be regarded casually by an auditor it is very intense activity all goals finding is an intense activity the main intent and intenseness is on the part of the pc his interest is so piqued that he thinks things get in his road which dont because all the time hes going down that track he of course is running into the items which you eventually will list out after youve found his goal and theyre all telling him he cant have it that they oppose it that he isnt you see and he knows not what of any of this so the first benefit of dynamic assessment is that it takes off the lot of the edginess from case and gives the reward of some very large finds to the pc you find his detested person hes very happy oooh yes thats why hes always hated josibelle hoho thats the person he hates the most in the whole universe that means something to the pc now we move it on down we find dynamic and we get this dynamic found if it is the dynamic and it is found and it slammed ah my hes really got his fingers on something that means great deal to him now we go ahead and find the item and here is something which is enormously significant to him he can explain things all over the place that have been happening to him for ages some people if they never got any further than finding the item theyd be perfectly happy the auditing had repaid them thousandfold over anything theyd expected it to be repaid see and then when you find their goal why all else pales but this is gradient the fellow isnt put on an enormously long wait before anything happens so that you get nervous charge building up over that tremendous long period of time of search that is one of the things wrong with 3ga done on its routine ordinary style of write out eight hundred and fifty goals and tiger drill them but you understand that when we were eliminating goals by assessment by elimination this tension was sufficiently great in building up in the pc over period of time to practically break the pcs heart and the auditors heart too that was tough but the reason it was tough is not that it was tough to do not that it was impossible to find goals by assessment by elimination because god help us were now running into more goals now after dynamic assessment that were found in the old days so we can audit them out the rest of the way good heavens it heads right back to the original goal but the pcs original goal was so burdened by all of these other things and rock slams and so on that the pc never really did get full digest of the goal full reality on it an assessment by elimination brought about nervous condition on the part of the pc where he is so nervy and so arc breaky he was almost impossible to audit now thatsthat should give you an idea or two of why were why were very happy to have such things as tiger drills and so forth now if you tiger drill list the goal is never behind youunless youre complete knucklehead and the pc is making gains most of the time and by erasing goals by tiger drill you are actually getting very very thorough therapeutic result for the pc and the pc is feeling better and better and better and better and better theres something to occupy the pcs time so an eight hundred and fifty goals list tiger drilled properly of course is highly therapeutic and this is fine and this is easier to do but its still not easy enough you need shorter jumps now ive seen tiger drill list go null on pc with more consequent splatter than anything i care to put pc over and many auditors doing old 3ga even with tiger drill just say well i just never want to put pc through that again and its not that it hurts its not that its arduous but the fellows right on terrific attention line and any little wiggle in the session or any breath of wind in life is magnified thousandfold to the pc well now on dynamic assessment you throw away most of these liabilities because youre going right in after it the pcs attention isnt directly on the goal its on the goal line in other words youre following in to the goal line by interest see you got gradient of interest and the pcs interested all the way he isnt sitting there like dummy the way he was in assessment by elimination youre actually tearing on down the line and the pc is an active participant in this because youre getting result every few hours now thats an advantage that shouldnt be discounted youre following the interest line by following the rock slam and the pc is turning up and handing you up data all the time very valuable to pc just to list list the rock slam out now aside from this dynamic assessment by rock slam being successfully done makes the pc feel absolutely marvelous just puts him on the top of the world its just great auditing dont kid yourself its great auditing the funny part of it is the auditor doesnt give damn those gains are just chaff in the wind they are nothing three cheers so the pc feels better good we dont give damn if he feels better what we want is his goal you understand its worth doing just to make the pc feel better but this is not the end product of it doing this over in washington just in the last three weeks here astounded by the fact that the pcs began to apologize to because id made this remark to them two or three times they come out oh i just feel glorious just top of the world i never felt better if i never got any more out of this than audit if i never got audited any more than this everything would seem wonderful to wonderful and id say will you please shut up and sit down and pick up the cans im trying to find your goal and it finally got through their skulls that i didnt give damn whether they felt wonderful or not i was after their goal and theyd cooperate like crazy but theyd say im sorry ron im sorry to have to tell you but you know i feel great you know well one doesnt necessarily try to promote that apology in pc but dont lose sight of it because actually in doing dynamic assessment by rock slam properly and correctly with all coal on the fire and with that old needle waggling on dwindling slams as you list and that sort of thing youre liable to be totally misdirected on the subject of what youre after you know pc feels so good and everything and you pat yourself on the back and you say well i got the pcs item made him feel wonderful dont you ever tell that dont you ever tell how wonderful the pc felt after dynamic rock slam assessment because ill ask you right away did you find his goal you got the pcs goal oh well as matter of fact we sort of knocked off on that hes sort of feeling pretty good these days and weve really entered into prepcheck area and you know kind of capitalize the gains something like that has nothing to do with it did you find the pcs goal now dynamic assessment by rock slam is sufficiently spectacular to distract the auditor from the basic reason he is auditing the pc believe it or not hes supposed to find the goal and therefore if you do excursions or diversions or something in some direction that do not enhance finding the pcs goal you are wasting time and enough time can be burned in dynamic assessment by rock slam as it is you can burn lots of time up on one now any of you that are ever going to make class iv auditor let tell you this youve got to be able to do it fast do it fast you understand i think youre pretty wonderful right here i think youre pretty wonderful to have picked it up in the short period of time and have produced as many dynamics and as many items and as many goals as you have in this very short period of time to learn it and to do that is great tribute to you and i dont want you to sit back on your laurels and expect you to think that is how long it should take you because let tell you something you should be able to find by the reason of scheduling by reason of finance by reason of routing of pcs by reason of running groups by reason of program clear earth youve got to be able to find the pcs goal in week and that includes complete assessment with the goal in your paw youve got to be able to do it in week otherwise nothing is going to tally now im demanding something of you which i can do and which you can do but you set yourself nice zenith be effective when you find that meter in your paws you audit you understand we dont care how good the pc feels or how bad the pc feels were not interested in the least so long as it doesnt get in the road of our auditing you feel as good as you want to just let go ahead and get this list see its that frame of mind now why am i talking to you like this all of sudden well thats because im talking to you on the basis of an upgrade talking to you on the basis of an upgrade i expect you to get out of here class iii definitely expect you to get out of here class iii and if you really want to be up on top class iv now im not kidding about class iv because itd take class iv to handle group you understand why lets saylets say youve got fifty people in group and theyre going to co audit and theyre going to do this and theyre going to do that and every week youre going to reach into that bunch of people and youre going to pick up one human being and youre going to completely alter change their lives and send them on the road put them back in the group again to get the thing listed out all right thats your program for world clearing youll find that that program is working right nowis being started on the washington staff course that program will be started here and there and the other place and youre going to be very familiar with that program because there isnt any other way you can do it you cant afford the time to do it any other way therefore its up to to make dynamic assessment by rock slam or some other method of finding pcs goals as rapid and effective and positive as possible and therefore its up to you saint hill graduate to be able to do this the end of one year you would have produced fifty clears not to be sneezed at all right now thats pretty terrific its in your hands to do this im not talking to you about pie in the sky and wouldnt it nice be nice to be clear and all this sort of thing im not talking to anythingabout anything that is even vaguely out of your reach this is right in your reach right now therefore i want you to be class iv auditor and be able to find goal in week and as soon as i am able to trim the edges around the technology little bit more to find goal in twelve and half hours but let tell you the hotter it gets the hotter youve got to be as an auditor the faster you find goal the cleverer quicker and more responsive youve got to be as an auditor and theres some point where you reach diminishing returns you find the goal so fast the pc doesnt find out about it this idea of setting him up in ray machine you know with one thing going in one side of his head and the impression on screen on the other side of him and we analyze the wave and say your goal is to catch catfish ahhaha im afraid that point is without the pcs interest or attention hed say it is now the funny part of it is that goal listed i have found out now without the goal being tiger drilled at the beginning of every session into decent read will not make clears on all cases and some cases will bog so therefore youve got to be able to have goal there that the pcs got some reality on will follow down youve got to keep it cleaned up and you will see pcs interest in his goal his reality on his goal ebb and fade as his listing continues it is always brought back simply by tiger drilling the goal into the clear again but that has nothing to do with finding the goal finding the goal is precision activity which is based first and foremost on terrifically positive good smooth auditing this auditing can have nothing to do with the fact that i dont understand tr 4 this auditing can have nothing to do with the fact im having trouble reading meter this auditing has nothing to do with the fact that i dont like to audit some pcs you understand in your hands at this time exists technology which has not before existed it is positive it is definite it has definite end product the same technology undoubtedly repeats over and over the second goal found on the first secondgoalclear made here was found by the original method but with tiger drilling and it was number 400 and something on the second 850 list thats interesting isnt it the second goal was found on that list and it was that deep onto the list takes long time it takes one minute to clean up goal on an average on tiger drilling and you should be able to hit goal minute that is the average for the long ones and the short ones and the middle ones and those that the pc wishes to god hed never put on the list you know to tie knot around my aunt marandys left ear and the pc is saying all the time that isnt my goal and the auditors having to clean it up so there it goes there it goes there it goes that includes that one but its goal minute thats aboutthat is the speed of tiger drilling now at 460 you add 460 minutes plus your rudiments over that period of time now thats very fast goal finding if you take look at it but with most pcs you will not find it is quite this fast or quite this easy thats not slow goal finding you divide 6 into 460 and youre going to get something that doesnt look like too much auditing because in the first place you didnt sit there and list the pcs goals the pc just wrote those goals out of session or elsewhere or somebody else listed them well you see that one by indications comes well within an ability to find second goal in very short intensive just by routine and ordinary methods but great many pcs will never have their goal found in the absence of dynamic assessment by rock slam and the first intensive that is the first time that you try to find pcs goal ahha thats rocky road man most pcs thats rocky road it is amazing that as many early goals as we found are in thats amazing to goal after goal person after person that we found them on originally but isnt it interesting that they faded away wouldnt show up or anything until wed done dynamic assessment by rock slam on them and headed it right into inevitably just that goal that was the only goal it could be ill tell you some funny stories about thatright now i wont but its very amusing now what are we heading for were heading for an efficient positive method of finding goals were not heading for method in which it takes us 3 hours on josibelle and 196 hours on pete this method we want nothing to do with nothing to do with because it lends an uncertainty onto the line which drives an auditor halfway around the bend and sends the pc through the top of his skulluncleared just try it sometime say well list 850 goals and well tiger drill them down the line and find your goal 850 theyre all dead behind you and there are goals in front of you so you say to the pc well your goal wasnt on that list how about well how about writing another couple of hundred goals tonight and so forth and you do the couple of hundred and you say hehhehheh awfully sorry but youseems like weve erased the last goal here how about writing 5 or 600 goals tonight on some cases this could go to 5 or 6000 goals thats 5 or 6000 minutes man 5 or 6000 minutes of auditing and thats an awful lot of auditing see what that adds to now we found some goals on accs earlier and some accs ran all 6 weeks without finding anybodys goal auditing and auditing and auditing and auditing what terrible lose very upsetting we want stabilized action now right now dynamic assessment by rock slam is unstable to this element of luck just like you have luck as to whether or not the goal was early on the list so you have luck as to whether or not the list youre assessing is complete first thing you must recognize cardinal rule of thumb about list is if item assesses out unmistakably unmistakably item assesses out the list was incomplete there is other reason i have added these all up and subtracted them and multiplied them and subdivided them and turned them over to the rabbits and birds there is other reason if you didnt find the item on that list the item was not on that list and that is the open and shut of it very simple now youd be amazed how often you have luck just by writing down the 8 dynamics calling them off to the pc and say consider overts against and so forth youd be surprised how often this is lucky youll be surprised how often you have 250 quote dynamics unquote listed by the pc and have item on them do you see that some certainty needs to be attached to that and the certainty that attaches to it is the rock slam during listing now new capers can be expected along this line this is not sterile line this is under very hot development but use what youve got what i would use right now is exactly what you would use itswe know this we know this that if we can get dynamic pc has rockslamming overts on we can then list what represents that dynamic to the pc on dwindling rock slam the rock slam dwindles item by item gets smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and we then have list that we can assess and we will find an item and that the goal will be an overt against that item in one shaded meaning or another as given on the list now those are your certainties now the entrance point is the tough point trying to find the first slam now we developed new caper i dreamed one up in washington on this basis the most detested person what opinionated person have you most detested was the original question well its not bad question but what if the fellow couldnt ever see any people at all or people were nowhere near anything he found to be wrong now youre going to lay an egg youre going to have to say who or what have you detested and youre liable to wind yourself up with something that looks like an item now were into the experimental field of dynamic assessment by rock slam do you see why who or what have you detested this isnt too good it isnt perfect but its better than nothing how many ways can you enter this thing well let tell you shortcut very short shortcut you say to the pc what do you wish was not part of existence and you take list which you scrap you dont pay much attention to that list and then after youve done that list which kind of oils him up and grooves him in you say what isnt part of existence and youve got the what isnt part of existence list this will serve you as an item if it will develop rock slam you assess it by consider overts against you will find out the common denominator of all dynamics and items is that the person will not admit they are part of existence its test when the person first thought it over he said well that wasnt real wasnt part of existence didnt belong on the dynamic scale see its aits thing from which they have individuated its thing that theyre against its thing they dont want anything more to do with and thered probably be several ways you could groove somebody in but do you wind up with an item youve actually really wound up with person or thing which is the most detested person or thing havent you now you could regard it as an item and you could get someplace but experimental action right at the present moment would be to use this question highly experimentalyou get this thing what isnt part of existence list get that nice and long assess it by consider overts against youll find one finally has heavy slam on it consider overts against this last slamming item can be built perhaps back to dynamic this way you understand this is whenallelsefails you realize im giving you the whenallelsefails i probably havent made it too clear your youve tried to get dynamic list and you failed you tried to get detested person from that and get dynamic list that was meaningful and it just didnt go anyplace you got the idea we couldnt get dwindling slams we just couldnt get anything on youve always got this one what do you wish wasnt part of existence throw that list away and list what isnt part of existence assess that list and youve got an entrance point or youve got an item well its interesting im not sure how you decide and therefore im about to make the following test to see whether or not this works we take an item so found and we say what part of existence does item found on what isnt part of existence list belong to see what part of existence does belong to and were going to get larger thing which perhaps then well we get list we assess that consider overts against we pick out the rock slamming item out of that and then we list this what part of existence does blank represent see represent again see if we get our dwindling slam you understand this excursion what im pointing out to you merely by giving you this experimental method is not whether or not this works or doesnt work but that this has several entrance points and if i found as many entrance points as this you can expect more you can expect them to be very thorough entrance points right now youre in somewhat hitormiss state its kind of by luck that its on the first list detested person is very very fine way of finding it you use the detested person this way you say what opinionated person have you detested or something like that assess it by rock slam you could say what part of existence does blank the assessed person represent to you not what is blanks by the way this is serious error to say what is blanks idea of the dynamics that doesnt work but we get joe see and we say all right what part of existence does joe represent to you see and the person will give you dynamic list sometimes it lists down at once to an item and sometimes youve already found the item on the list you get the liability here well your exact procedurethe way i would go about dynamic assessment on raw meatwould be just this way id say what partwhat opinionated person have you detested they give one person then they give two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen twenty twentytwo twentythree people and im not even bleeding the meter dont you see i say are there any more and they add couple as an afterthought and then ill assess that list by think of doing bad things to each person in turn and assess it rock slam by elimination with that question wind up with one of these people youd be surprised how often its the first person they said its amazing how often it is just the first person its not good enough however to just take the first person all right we take this person we say what part of existence does blank represent as soon as weve got blank busily listed weve got dynamic list and we will find that rock slams are appearing now that list doesnt get listed however on dwindling slam we shouldnt expect such riches at this time and we assess that new list by saying think of doing bad things to the items on this list and we will come out with an unmistakable rock slam if we are lucky if weve had rock slam why before on the person and weve had asome rock slams on the listing of the dynamics and if weve had an unmistakable rock slam and hammer and pound away on the dynamic we finally eliminated down to let tell you that the list then of the item will be dwindling slam itll start wide and item by item itll get narrower and narrower finally go down to dirty needle and had to be bled off then we assess that list which is the item list once more consider committing overts against or think of doing bad things to either command will serve and bang one of those things will fire we finally get that firing very very well and we have the pcs goals line and then we say what goal might you have that would be an overt against the item found and that should be dwindling slam and go right on down and finally disappear into dirty needle and pass away and then you should list list six right away and then you should list some of the other lists but list six is must because in high percentage of the cases the goal will be number one two three or four listed on list six so much so of course that you quite often ignore list one and other lists hit that list six also do not do not tiger drill selected goals by the auditor do not do that just start at the top of list six and start going yeah why think about it see why even add that element of evaluation these lists are rather brief dont you see it doesnt take you long to do these things anyhow and who knows the pcs goal might be to kiss mermaid who hasnt eaten garlic were not sure what his goal will end up see but in any event the goal is the goal and it will be the goal and if its there it fires now an action which must go before must precede any dynamic assessment by rock slam is as follows the pc lists 850 goals on his own or hes listed it for them by another auditor in coaudit and dont forget this one before you do the dynamic assessment and go to all that trouble you sit down and you take every goal ever found on the pc and you make list of those goals i dont care whether they were good bad indifferent he says theyve been erased we dont care we write down that list of goals and we tiger drill that list it seldom goes more than 6 or 7 and we tiger drill them with these magic words the first tiger drill is done as followstiger drilling words this is brandnew idea to you on the word suppressed has anything been suppressed got that you tiger drill the buttons its amazing what you can do somebodys sure theyve had paindrughypnosis been proved to them in upper sullivan island and you can tiger drill pain you can tiger drill drugs you can tiger drill hypnotism tiger drill words quite amazing what it does if you think somebodys dramatizing her name because shes crying all the time and her name is teary you want to know we used to do other things with this well the answer to it is tiger drill just tiger drill the word teary and you can tiger drill to flatness or cognition now that is must for somebody who has been audited bitfor lot or prepchecked and so forth lets clean up these words we have had an experience horrifying experience of pc selected to have his goal found at the congress slamming with gorgeousity kicking the pin you could see the needle bend im sure and the second the pc thus tested reported for session was found to have rock slam at all and the rock slam just was off and that was it pretty grim huh well the suppression there was terrific because the consequences of all our clearing him were succinctly stated by that pc in letters of fire with exclamation points hed have to practically do everything include committing suicide i think it was pretty drastic what hed have to do if we cleared him of course the overt word was scientology and that saved our bacons nicely but as soon as we got onto the line the rock slam turned back on again how could this have been turned on earlier by tiger drilling words also it could have been handled by tiger drilling period of time youve not heard of that one before you heard of prepchecking period of time but tiger drilling it is just sitting right there on the meter and bingety banging it that however was not too good on this case what was happening on this case was the consequences of becoming clear something that has to be gone into with every pc that you are working you have to go into the consequences of being clear if i cleared you what would be the consequences youll find out sometimes its so catastrophic the pc never will give you his goal he knows what clearing is hes done it lots of times himself you put the person in front of the fac one machine and you start turning the handles and he knows why you shouldnt clear people because he gets hole in his chest you know the old machine that had the had the big blast that went out the front and the little peekhole in the back that it came back and hit the operator somebody was telling the other day theyre going to make these for the us army and iwhy i didnti didnt think they ought to do it they could only be operated by clears and clears wouldnt operate them interesting so why build the machine anyway here was case of sudden vanishment of rock slam now youre going to confront that many time and maybe there are many better solutions to it but right now you will find that tiger drilling words will serve an enormous number of purposes thats one for you to put down because i think that will be with us for long time the other thing is work the suppress button hard and the other thing is to work the careful button careful is actually more likely to turn on rock slam than suppress and the probability is that our pcs rock slam at the congress would have turned on if the careful button had been well enough operated or heavy enough operated but i dont think it was used because it was put in little bit later im not sure about that but i think thats the ease all right now ive seen lot of rock slams occurring underneath that careful button rock slams which were off so now i told you that there were two things that you should do before you start in on dynamic assessment on pc there were two things you should do and one of them is to tiger drill the buttons into some kind of shape and the other one is to take those early goals any goal found on them to date and tiger drill those goals with this command in auditing on the goal to catch catfish has anything been suppressed etc do you get it in auditing on the goal soandso and you tiger drill with other phraseology than that you just tiger drill that one and you will find out that goal that has been buried and cannot be made to read again can be made to read by prepchecking the buttons and then prepchecking with this formula in auditing on the goal whatever it was has anything been the buttons got it now that has varieda varied form where it didnt succeed you can go into since whatever date the goal was found on the goal whatever the goal is has anything been and tiger drill it in that fashion okay so youve got an alternate method youve got the period method and youve got in auditing ive seen goal tiger drilled goal already found and abused ive seen goal tiger drilled with plain tiger drilling ordinary tiger drilling out of existence it didnt read it didnt fire it didnt cough it didnt sneeze there was nothing there was not yeep left on it pcs satisfied with it too somatics left on it everybody happy the pc happy and the auditor happy and everybody cheerful that his goal being gone then opened up on again with tiger drilling the buttons of the tiger drill and then swinging in on the goal and making it read and i have seen this happen taking an old goal seeing it totally flattened withutterly and completely erased as far as anybody could tell not quiver on mark v emeter and here it goes gone not anot mention couldnt get suppress to read couldnt get anything to read couldnt get any part of anything to read gone and then suddenly run in auditing on the goal to catch catfish has anything been suppressed and all of sudden seeing the goal come back to life with crash okay seen them both so dont ever discard old goals as beneath your contempt an early goal is found on this case this goal is for the birds nobody could possibly make anything out of this goal and it was run on the pc for some days with success and you say well i guess we can neglect that yes you can neglect it why not neglect the whole case in fact why audit the ease at all because from that moment onward that case makes further forward progress thats horrifying you know that says why we stopped them from letting hcas find all the goals dzzzz must have been rough see that so your pc has had this ridiculous goal found to tie bowlines on bight on the backs of catfish and ride with pipe in my teeth across the seas of arizona and the auditor says this couldnt possibly be goal therefore ill neglect this thing and the case is parked from there on case is parked you got to handle that goal like i just told you i may even think of better ways of handling it but thats good enough for fewthree weeks of development youll get that goal firing and knock out any residual fire in it and get it out and get it gone get the protests off of it and get that thing went and now all of sudden the pc aruns like baby carriage savvy get rid of them old goals before you wind up on dynamic assessment and you will be happy character because the pc has already experienced an improvement under your auditing and therefore has confidence in you as an auditor and you can use every bit of that confidence while doing dynamic assessment course if you insist on doing it and itsalready theyve been thoroughly cleaned up and you cant get spark out of any of them and the pc keeps telling you but theyve been cleaned up and you keep saying well i know but ive got to make sure according to rons lecture of september 18 ad 12 i have to go over these things with fine i know but the auditor did last week youll eventually get the goals reading again of course all theyll respond to is the word protest theyll all be reading thats outside the auditing formula but there in final analysis is where we have arrived at with 3g dynamic assessment by rock slam good hunting thank you
