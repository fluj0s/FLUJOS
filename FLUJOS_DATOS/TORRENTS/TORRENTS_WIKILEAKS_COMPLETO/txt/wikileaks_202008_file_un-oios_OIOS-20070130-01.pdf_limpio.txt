with the investigation were also interviewed 14 to protect the identities of the girls alleged to h ave been involved in sexual activities with peacekeepers in the bunia area duri ng this investigation they are referred to as victims in this report most of the witnes ses to the allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse were themselves victims 15 after all the victims were interviewed relevant do cuments and photographs were obtained and analyzed victims and witnesses viewed photographic arrays of peacekeepers in an attempt to identify the alleged perpetrators often the victims had to be shown photographs of an entire contingents rota tion approximately 750 peacekeepers or if victim could recall the spec ific date of the sexual encounter photographs of the approximately 150 peacekeepers w ho were in the area at that time 7 16 idoios intended to have all peacekeepers identifie d in the photographic arrays participate in physical lineup for more conclusiv identification purposes and then participate in interviews with idoios however u nbeknown to idoios investigators upon their arrival in bunia in january 2006 the mber state 1 contingent had rotation of troops scheduled for the first week of march after casebycase analysis of all evidence idoios requested the postponement of the rotation of 39 member state 1 peacekeepers although an additional 36 member sta 1 peacekeepers had been identified by witnesses participating in the photog raphic identification process idoios concluded that insufficient evidence existed to pos tpone their repatriation primarily because there was identification of these peacek eepers by victim willing to cooperate in the investigation 17 the lineups and interviews were conducted in the pr esence of military legal officer and representative from the respective litary contingent v investigative details the allegations 18 upon their arrival idoios met with the coordinato rs of local non governmental organization ngo which provided repo rts of congolese girls who had given birth to babies allegedly fathered by monuc pe acekeepers over the course of the following week idoios investigators spoke with congolese girls at the ngo office who provided additional sexual exploitation and abu sea allegations against peacekeepers these girls ranged from 15 to 18 yea rs of age 19 from 17 january to 13 february 2006 the following llegations were received by idoios sexual exploitation and abuse allegations 1 217 alleged victims 2 54 babies 3 fathered or girls impregnated 10 peacekeepers alleged to have engaged in sexual exploitation and abuse with local girls 4 75 1 this figure includes the original 11 allegations nd represents sexual relationships rather than indi vidual sexual acts it also includes allegations reported by third parties 2 not all the alleged victims were interviewed of the 54 alleged victims 14 admitted that they had h ad sexual relations with peacekeepers 3 denied in volvement with peacekeepers 20 could not be found 10 were not identified and 7 refused to cooperate wit h idoios 3 all victims and witnesses interviewed referred to babies fathered by peacekeepers as white babies regardless of the color of the baby or the alleged father 4 the photographic arrays viewed by victims and witn esses resulted in the identification of 75 peacekee pers still in the mission 73 from member state 1 and 2 from member state 3 however during the physical lineup victims identified only 27 peacekeepers with whom they claimed to have had sexual relations 8 20 idoios investigated allegations against 39 peaceke epers 5 only one allegation was sustained which has been reported as id case 036006 and there was recommendation in another involving paternity id c ase 020106 that member state 1 pursue the investigation because the subject peac ekeeper had been repatriated before he was interviewed and dna sample taken victims witnesses and alleged perpetrators 21 none of the girls interviewed by idoios came from stable environment education beyond elementary grades was nonexistent they often lived with prostitutes friends or distant relatives most had visible means of financial support although one claimed to be hairdresser and two stated that the sold charcoal 22 group of about 10 girls who refused to cooperate in the investigation were reported to be residing at liquor storebar which was in effect brothel this was one of three such establishments identified during the course of the investigation two of the establishments were later visited by idoios staff and found to be exactly as described by the victims bar in the front and small room containing mattress in the back 23 one girl who did cooperate with the investigation c learly saw herself as prostitute and advised idoios that she had had sex ual relations with more than 15 peacekeepers this particular girl had been vict im in the 2004 idoios investigation as were nine other victims in the current investiga tion 24 the majority of the girls referred to the peacekeep ers with whom they were having sexual relations as their boyfriends upo n the boyfriends rotation 6 out of the area the girl often became sexually involved with new boyfriend the boyfriends paid for sex with cash 2 to 5 food or clothes notwithstanding the very limited nature of these relationships when interviewed or when viewing the photographic arrays some girls cried or stated that they did not want t get their boyfriends into trouble 25 some witnesses and victims who turned up for interv iew expected financial compensation for the time being spent on the interv iew which idoios was unable to provide this made it difficult for other witnesses to cooperate since the news had gone round that there was money involved in interview s some victims who admitted having sexual relationships with peacekeepers refu sed to take part in photo identification parade unless they were paid subs tantial sum of money as compensation since idoios does not pay for information gatherin g this very important aspect of the investigation regrettably could not take place in s ome cases and they could not be conclusively investigated prostitutes have the ten dency of migrating from one place to the other in search of places where they can earn more from their work they change 5 as noted in paragraph 16 75 peacekeepers were ide ntified in the photographic array identification process but idoios requested the postponement of the repatriation of only 39 6 often girls provided idoios with the exact date t heir boyfriends departed the mission 9 their names and ages as they move along making the ir identification difficult since they possess civil status documents this hampered th work of idoios 26 on several occasions multiple witnesses identified the same peacekeeper from the photographic arrays and provided testimony to corro borate each others evidence most witnesses also described themselves as victims of s exual exploitation and abuse 27 the 2004 investigation noted that young boys actin g as pimps brought girls to peacekeepers in contrast the 2006 investigation found that for the most part the girls now interacted directly with the peacekeepers 28 during the course of interviews with the alleged pe rpetrators not single peacekeeper admitted that he had engaged in sexual relations with any congolese girls however several peacekeepers stated that the girls often exposed their breasts pulled up their dresses andor make sexual gestures towards t he peacekeepers assigned to the guard posts idoios received confirmation from bunia prosecutor and ranking bunia police officer that the member state 1 contingent c ommander had complained in july 2005 that girls attempted to seduce member state 1 peacekeepers 29 the ranking bunia police officer informed idoios t hat in one operation after the complaint by the member state 1 contingent commande r seven girls were arrested for loitering outside the member state 1 outposts and i n subsequent operation 21 were arrested bunia prosecutor claimed that the arrest s acted as deterrent but none of the girls were charged because prostitution is not cr ime in the drc 30 idoios also noted that several girls stated that s ome of the member state 1 peacekeepers provided time money and food to local girls without any expectation of sexual favours intimidation of victims and witnesses 31 as the investigation unfolded peacekeepers identif ied in the photographic arrays were informed that their repatriation would be dela yed this soon became public knowledge and caused serious concern for many of th girls and peacekeepers victims who had not cooperated in the investigation those from the liquor storebar engaged in verbal confrontations with those who had they wer upset about the possibility of losing their economic livelihood and also warned vi ctims who had cooperated with the idoios investigation and had babies allegedly fat hered by peacekeepers that their babies might be taken away from them 32 one victim informed idoios that she had received message from peacekeeper that he would hack them if he ever saw them again 33 another victim reported that four girls had receive d 10 bribe not to identify peacekeepers and that the member state 1 chief th summoned them to the camp and thanked them for not cooperating with the investiga tion when confronted by idoios 10 with this information one of the four girls acknow ledged that she had received 10 from peacekeeper but denied that it was bribe ano ther admitted that peacekeeper warned her by telephone against future interactions with investigators but denied that she received any money the third girl denied that she had been paid bribe and the fourth refused to be interviewed by idoios investigators the three girls who did cooperate with the investigation had initially identified pea cekeepers in the photographic arrays but either did not identify anyone in the physical iden tification parades andor refused to participate in the procedure these developments t end to provide credence to the information that some of the victims were bribed to not cooperate 34 idoios investigators noted that the investigative process itself was intimidating to the girls often their only exposure to authori ty had been sexual abuse by congolese militiamen or intimidation and solicitation of brib by the local police apparently the girls had never been exposed to the concept of th orough and fair investigation while cultural and social barriers were broken down throu gh informal interaction with female idoios investigators lack of cooperation with t he investigative process increased significantly once the physical identification line ups commenced 35 the girls also told idoios that they feared the cal police and expressed concern that their cooperation would lead to the in volvement of the local police authorities three girls provided corroborating and detailed evidence that before idoios began its investigation they were arrested after h aving been in contact with member state 1 peacekeepers two of the girls were beaten including on their breasts and held overnight in custody while the third was set free in order to get 5 for the release of the other two which she allegedly received from memb er state 1 peacekeeper the military environment in bunia 36 the ituri district commander was reluctant to coope rate with idoios unless directed to do so by the force commander or conting ent commanders it was also apparent that the district commander had little kno wledge of the idoios mandate to investigate allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse despite the predeployment training conducted with contingents in the mission by dpko consequently there were significant delays in all aspects of the investigat ion that required input from the military administration 37 at least one sexual exploitation and abuse allegati on was made against each contingent including the member state 7 military p olice mp as discussed idoios concentrated its efforts on the cases in which the alleged perpetrator was still in the mission which dictated focus upon the member state 3 and member state 1 contingents 38 although the member state 1 contingent commander in bunia was supportive of this idoios investigation some officers of the mber state 1 contingent were extremely critical of idoios and its role in the i nvestigation despite repeated explanations of its necessity some of the member state 1 commanding officers appeared to consider that idoios had elicited alle gations and stated to idoios that 11 these allegations were either fabricated or attempt s by the local population to take advantage of their soldiers they emphasized the s tress and pressure this put on their peacekeepers 39 idoios observed the questionable attitude of the m ember state 1 military police legal officer assigned to liaison with idoi during the interview and identification parade stages of the investigation he informed idoios that congolese girl advised him in the fall of 2005 that she had g iven birth to baby fathered by member state 1 peacekeeper he stated that he view ed this allegation as an attempt to extort money as the girl had evidence to suppor t her claim and therefore the complaint was not reported to idoios in accordance with the provisions of ares59287 idoios observed that this attitude was shared by other officers of the member state 1 contingent military contingents 40 as part of its investigation idoios interviewed l of the contingent commanders assigned to bunia it was confirmed tha t sexual exploitation and abuse awareness training had been given to the peacekeepe rs both prior to their deployment and upon arrival within mission 41 idoios observed however that only the member sta 3 contingent has implemented adequate preventive measures concerning sexual exploitation and abuse the member state 3 commander installed mesh within the military camps perimeter fencing to prevent direct contact between the peace keepers and the local population not only were basketball football volleyball runni ng track and miniature golf facilities constructed within the camp but mandatory games an d tournaments including contest to see which unit could construct the best garden i n front of its designated barrack were also organized peacekeepers had access to member state 3 television programs and were provided with free telephone calls home in ddition member state 3 peacekeepers were not paid their mission allowances while deploy ed in bunia and consequently did not have cash to pay for sex 42 the member state 1 contingent was assigned responsi bility for security and perimeter control of bunia there were ten checkpo ints within bunia manned by the contingent peacekeepers were assigned 30day rota tions from one checkpoint to another during which they ate slept and worked at the checkpoint their work and accommodations were in direct contact with the loca l population separated at most by string of barbed wire although there were limited recreational facilities at the main camp there were none at any of the checkpoints ins pected by idoios 43 the member state 7 mp unit in bunia consisted of 11 military police officers inquiries with the mp commander revealed that the u nit had not received single allegation of sexual exploitation andor abuse ho wever within two days of its arrival in 12 bunia idoios learned of several local establishme nts 7 in which peacekeepers could have sex additionally as noted in this report i doios received 217 allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers vi findings 44 idoios must establish tangible and convincing evid ence to support its findings and recommendations consequently although the legations suggested frequent and ongoing sexual exploitation and abuse there was fficient evidence to substantiate only one of the allegations 8 45 however pursuant to its mandate 9 idoios is not only responsible for the investigation of alleged violations but also for th assessment of serious risks to operations which could lead to violations of establ ished regulations rules and policies in this regard idoios notes the following concern s the 2004 civil conflict in the drc resulted in econ omic hardship family breakdown and poor education which made earning mon ey by sex an important wherewithal for some girls in the area an d facilitated pattern of sexual exploitation and abuse idoios observations suggest that some peacekeepers take advantage of this weakness to par ticipate in and encourage prostitution including child prostitution in cont ravention of the regulations rules and established policies of the in general and monuc in particular this underlines the persistence and prevalence of s ea allegations in the area it is notable that ten of the girls reported to be victims in the 2004 idoios investigation were also alleged to be sexually invo lved with peacekeepers in 2006 the member state 1 military outposts offer preve ntive measures to deter close contact with the local population nor are th eir peacekeepers provided with adequate recreational activities this coupl ed with the indifference of some commanding officers 10 towards allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse indicate the lack of effective preventive asures against sexual exploitation and abuse by member state 1 peacekeepe rs 7 the establishments usually consisted of tworo om house in which one could purchase and drink beer idoios visited two such establishments the front room was set up for drinking and the back room had mattress on the floor 8 it should be noted that idoios was unable to addr ess 135 of the 217 sea allegations the majority of which were against peacekeepers who had already lef t the mission 9 paragraph 17 of stsgb273 10 this was evidenced by the refusal of member st ate 1 mplegal officer to report an allegation of paternity brought by girl against peacekeeper t idoios in accordance with the provisions of ares59287 see paragraph 39 whether this was an attempt to extort money or legitimate cry for help cannot be established because the complaint wa s never reported contrary to the organizations commitment of zero tolerance towards sexual exploit ation and abuse 13 shortly after its arrival in bunia idoios receive d 217 allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse these allegations which w ere mainly against the member state 1 contingent included at least one legation against each military contingent in bunia including the member state 7 mp in contrast the mp contingent in bunia informed idoios that it had not received single sexual exploitation and abuse allegation 46 while there was sufficient evidence to substantiat only one allegation of sexual exploitation and abuse against individual peacekeep ers idoios is of the considered view that that girls and young women in bunia remai n at high risk of sexual exploitation and abuse due to the following considerations several victims attended idoios interviews with th eir babies whom they claimed were fathered by peacekeepers all but one of the babies were noted by investigators to be fairskinned victims frequently had detailed knowledge of peacekeeper including his first name rank position or exact repatriation date several of the victims began to cry when identifyin g their boyfriends during the course of the photographic identification proce ss stating that they did not want to get them in to trouble while most victims stated they had boyfriends so acknowledged that they were prostitutes actively promoting their serv ices to peacekeepers these assertions were further substantiated by memb er state 1 commanders complaint that local women were exposing themselves to his soldiers and the subsequent raids by the local police see paragra phs 28 and 29 victims corroborated each others evidence of sexua l contact with member state 1 peacekeepers and on several occasions ident ified the same individual from an array of over 750 photographs victims identified several drinking establishments where peacekeepers could obtain alcohol and sex idoios investigators atte nded two of the establishments and noted evidence of alcohol consum ption in the front room and mattress in the back room exactly as describ ed by the victims one such establishment was located only 200 meters from the member state 1 contingents camp idoios corroborated to the fullest extent possibl information received just prior to the physical identification process t hat victims who refused to cooperate in the investigation engaged in verbal co nfrontation with those who had see paragraph 31 and that victims were subje ct to bribes andor intimidation by some of the member state 1 peacekee pers see paragraphs 32 14 and 33 47 given the economic hardship lack of family support or other sources of income facing the victims along with the reported bribes nd intimidation and apprehension of the investigative process it is not surprising tha t some victims refused to cooperate or ceased their cooperation with the idoios investiga tion although only one allegation was substantiated it is likely that vulnerable gir ls are resorting to prostitution with peacekeepers which is violation of stsgb20031 3 consequently idoios concludes that the environment in bunia as discuss ed gives rise to high risk that the organizations commitment of zero tolerance towards sexual exploitation and abuse will not be fulfilled 48 the commanders of the member state 3 contingent in bunia took proactive approach to preventing sexual exploitation and abus by providing recreational and other outlets for their soldiers their efforts should b used as model for other national contingents in monuc vii conclusions 49 instances of sexual exploitation and abuse do not ccur in isolation they are part of an existing chain of problems that include pover ty political instability and abuse of power lack of education and income opportunities f or girls and young women and lack of prevention of the breaches of military disciplin therefore any attempt to achieve zero tolerance of sexual exploitation and abuse mus t address all these root causes 50 the 2004 idoios report on bunia recommended measur aimed at alleviating the problems with sexual exploitation and abuse in monuc as well as in other missions 11 dpko accepted all the recommendations in the repo rt and detailed how it envisaged implementing them some of them are repr oduced below along with idoios assessment of their implementation based n the findings of this investigation recommendation 2 the department of peacekeeping perations and monuc as matter of high priority should impleme nt strong prevention programme with emphasis on protecting the most vul nerable girls those under 18 years of age and establish rapidrespo nse detection programme utilizing personnel experienced in such cases begi nning in bunia on an expedited basis and then expanding to the other reg ions of monuc idoios concludes that implementation of this reco mmendation has been insufficient in bunia upon the arrival of the id oios team to bunia the member state 7 mps reported that sexual exploitatio n and abuse was not significant problem see last bullet of paragraph 4 5 above however idoios soon received numerous sea allegations and several allegations of paternity involving peacekeepers see paragraphs 18 and 19 w hich although only one 11 see a59661 paragraphs 4857 15 allegation was substantiated suggests the likeliho od of ongoing sexual exploitation and abuse of local girls recommendation 3 senior monuc managers must becom more involved and demand accountability from both civilian administra tors and contingent commanders in the mission monuc must take steps to ensure that administrators and officers demonstrate implementat ion of all existing regulations and policies aimed at preventing sexual abuse and exploitation idoios concludes that implementation of this recommendation has been insufficient in bunia upon the arrival of the id oios team in bunia the ituri regional commander was not aware of the provi sions of ares59287 see paragraph 36 consequently ays in the investigation occurred recommendation 4 the department of peacekeeping perations and monuc should undertake programme to provide regul ar briefings for troops on their responsibilities to the local popul ation and on prohibited behaviours and to ensure that all troops and civili ans on united nations missions are fully conversant with united nations p olicies on the subject of sexual exploitation and abuse idoios confirmed that sexual exploitation and abus awareness training had been given to all peacekeepers both prior to their deployment and upon arrival within the mission see paragraph 40 idoios beli eves that this training should be reinforced by regular refresher training in thea tre recommendation 5 the monuc force commander in co njunction with contingent commanders should enforce strict discip line over the personnel under their command idoios noting that it received only two sea alleg ations against the member state 3 contingent but received many more against m embers of the member state 1 contingent concludes that monuc has not sufficien tly implemented this recommendation recommendation 6 monuc should identify and implem ent measures that ensure that all military compounds are adequately s ecured to prevent unauthorized entry and egress as well as ad hoc tra ding between troops and the local population idoios noting that it received only two sea alleg ations against the member state 3 contingent but did receive many more again st the member state 1 contingent concludes that monuc has not sufficientl implemented this recommendation 16 recommendation 7 monuc should collaborate perhap s under the auspices of the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs with other non governmental organizations and united nations agenc ies in the bunia area to find ways of strengthening the existing programmes to empower and protect the vulnerable population to allow for alternative means of survival idoios concluded that despite monucs efforts the women and children in bunia remain vulnerable to sexual exploitation and abuse recommendation 8 given that this problem is not u nique to monuc and with new missions being opened in areas where similar pr oblems can arise it is recommended that the department of peacekeeping ope rations consider wider application of prevention and detection policies to protect against sexual abuse and exploitation by peacekeepers this may include the designation of local officials or nongovernmental organizations to rece ive reports of sexual exploitation and abuse the central reporting of l cases to mission senior management on an expedited basis the development f missionbased rapid response teams the development of educational prog rammes for the troops on their responsibilities and on sanctions for sexual exploitation and abuse the public naming and shaming of those found to have gaged in sexual exploitation and abuse and the permanent exclusion from peaceke eping missions of those troops who engage in sexual exploitation and abuse and of their contingents commanders idoios recognizes the complexity of sexual exploit ation and abuse issues within peacekeeping environments and believes that ongoing discussions by the department of peacekeeping operations troop co ntributing countries and idoios will result in strengthening relevant p olicies 51 the idoios investigation found that allegations ag ainst peacekeepers from the member state 3 battalion could not be substantiated and noted the proactive approach of the member state 3 battalion in preventing opportun ities for sexual exploitation and abuse in bunia 52 the idoios is of the view that the deployment of m ember state 1 troops on 30 day rotations in check points throughout the city f bunia is conducive to an environment in which instances of sexual exploitation of the cal population are possible this situation is further exacerbated by the insufficien t attention to implementing preventive general measures concerning sexual exploitation and abuse opportunities on part of some member state 1 military command staff 53 while only one allegation of sexual exploitation an d abuse could be substantiated the idoios observations in the course of the inve stigations indicated that some member state 1 peacekeepers deployed in bunia have frequented prostitutes who are congolese girls while idoios recognizes the compl exity of sexual exploitation and abuse issues within peacekeeping environments it c oncludes that the failure to 17 sufficiently and effectively implement the proactiv preventive measures recommended in its previous report a59661 has allowed an vironment to persist in which sexual exploitation and abuse occurs 54 given the overall findings of the report the organ ization should consider peacekeeping operations in bunia as high risk for further violations of stsgb200313 viii recommendations given the findings of this investigation idoios m akes the
