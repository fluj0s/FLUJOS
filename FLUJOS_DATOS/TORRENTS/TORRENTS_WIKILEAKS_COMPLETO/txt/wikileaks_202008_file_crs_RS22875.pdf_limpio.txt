include extending strikefighter service lives and increasing planned procurement of strikefighters this report will be updated as events warrant background navy and marine corps strikefighters the navy and marine corps which are both part of the department of the navy don each operate hundreds of strike fighters which are tactical aircraft that can conduct both airtoground ie strike and airtoair ie fighter operations strikefighters constitute the majority of the aircraft in each of the navys 10 activeduty aircraft carrier air wings cvws1 of the 70 or more aircraft typically embarked on navy ai rcraft carrier 44 are st rikefighters strike fighters also constitute significant portion of the marine corps three activeduty marine air wings maws2 some marine corps strikefighte rs are assigned to navy cvws the principal strikefighter operated by th navy and marine corps is the fa18 hornetsuper hornet manufactured by boeing the older through d models of the fa18 are called hornets while the newer larger and more capable and f models are called super hornets the navy operates more than 600 hornets and super hornets while the marine corps ope rates more than 200 hornets plus

in the originalthe projected shortfall8 dons inventory of strikefi ghters currently falls short of the number that navy offi cials state is required to fu lly support requirements for cvws and maws and the navy is projecting that this shortfall will grow in coming years the navy projects that current don strikefighter shortfall of about 15 aircraft will grow to about 30 aircraft in fy2009 to more than 50 aircraft in fy2016 and to more than 90 aircraft in fy2017fy2020 before declining to more than 50 aircraft in fy2021 and to roughly zero aircraft by fy2025 at its p eak in fy2017 the navy states the projected don strikefighter shortfall will be 125 aircraft of which 69 w ill be navy strikefighters the navy states that the proj ected don strikefighter shortfall if applied entirely against navy cvws would have the effect of re ducing the number of activeduty cvws during the period fy2016fy2020 from 10 to 7 the navy states that the projected shortfall is the most optimistic projection because it assumes among other things that the service lives of hornets can be extended from the current planning figure of 8000 flight hours to 10000 flight hours the hornets were originally built for service liv of 6000 hours goal that was later changed to 8000 hours the navys mos t optimistic projection also assumes that procurement of f35s for don will increase from year to year as currently planned and eventually reach sustained rate of 50 aircraft per year although extending hornet service lives to 10000 hours is assumed in the navys most optimistic projection the navy has not ye t determined whether such an extension is feasible and costeffective the navy st ated in lateapril or earlymay 2008 that it felt fairly confident we can get to 10000 hours on the hornet but we havent finished the assessment yet9 in july 2008 however it was reported that preliminary results from continuing navy review have found that keeping the through dmodel hornets flying longer will require additional inspections modifications and longer time out of service navy spokesman said our estimate of the strike fighter gap assumed we could proceed with the slep servicelife extension program on the hornet s as planned the spokesman said the scope and extent of the effect on the shortfall will take approximately four to six months to determine early results from the review also found hot spots in the current hornet fleet that could force the navy to conduct inspections and further modify the aircraft to keep them flying for just 8000 hours additional study is required to determine whether or not these fatigue hot spots are unique or systemic the spokesman said10 if hornet lives can be extended to 10000 hours but the sustained f35 procurement rate turns out to be 35 aircraft per year rather than 50 per year the navy states thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22875crs4 11 source briefing from industry officials to crs on april 10 2008 12 see david fulghum boeing plans

office joint strike fighter recent decisions by dod add to program risks gao08388 march 2008 summary pageprojected don strikefighter shortfall woul d increase to more than 120 aircraft in fy2016 more than 160 aircraft in fy2017 and more than 200 aircraft in fy2019 fy2022 peaking at 229 aircraft in fy2022 and th decline to more than 120 aircraft in fy2025 within that projection the navy stat the shortfall in navy strikefighters would exceed 80 aircraft for the peri od fy2017fy2022 peaking at 109 aircraft in fy2020 the navy states that this greater projected don shortfall if applied entirely against navy cvws would have the effect of reducing the number of activeduty cvws during the period fy2016fy2020 from 10 to 6 some industry sources argue that the strike fighter shortfall is likely to be roughly twice as large as the navys most optimistic projection due to difficulties in extending hornet lives to 10000 hours and risks in th planned f35 procurement profile they argue that extending hornet lives to 10000 hours is highrisk assumption given the material condition of hornets today includi ng recently discovered problem called stress corrosion cracking they also argue that the f35s initial operational capability ioc date may be delayed because of delays in completing the development of the aircraft and that funding constraints may limit procurement of f35s for don to less than 50 per year they calculate that if the f35s ioc is layed one year and if budget constraints limit procurement of f35s for don to 42 per year the projected shortfall in navy strike fighters would increase to 80 aircraft starting in 2010 and p eak at 134 aircraft versus 69 under the navys projection11 reported unsolicited proposal from boeing boeing reportedly has made an unsolicited offer to the navy to begin pr ocuring an improved version of the fa18ef featuring upgraded avionics under this pr oposal the navy could forego procuring f 35cs while waiting for an even more advanced strikefighter design that could become available for procurement around 202412 issues for congress size of strikefighter shortfall one issue for congress to consider is the potential size of the shortfall key factors to consider in clude the likelihood that the navy will be able to extend hornet lives to 10000 hours the likeli hood that th f35 will achieve its scheduled ioc and the like lihood that don will achieve sustained f35 production rate of 50 aircraft per year concerning the deve lopment schedule for the f35 march 2008 government accountability ffice gao report on the f35

meeting mands for daytoday forward deployments of don strikefighters for purposes of regional terrence and reassurance the shortfall could lead to reduction in the number of st rikefighter squadrons available for service reduction in the number strike fi ghters in each squadron or both options for congress options for congress to address the proj ected don strikefighter shortfall include but are not limited to the following some of which could be combined request further information and analysis from don andor industry concerning the potential size of the shortfall fund service life extensions of ho rnets to as much as 10000 hours if such extensions prove feas ible and cost effective increase planned procurement of fa18efs in coming years increased planned procurement of f35s in coming years and expedited procurement of new longrange bomber regarding the third option fa18ef proc urement could be continued for few years beyond fy2012 until procurement of f35s for don begins to increase to higher levels alternatively fa 18ef procurement could be c ontinued for longer period of time so that mix of substantial numbers of both fa18efs and f35s is procured for certain number of years third option would be to begin procuring improved fa 18efs in lieu of procuring f35s while waiting for an even more advanced strikefighter to become available for procurement ar ound 2024 supporters of increased fa18ef procurement could argue that the fa18ef is capable aircraft that it is less expensive to procure than the f35 and that procuring the established fa18ef design poses less risk of cost growth than procuring the new f35 design regarding the fourth option supporters of increased f35 procurement could argue that the f35 as newer design is more cap able than the fa18ef and thus more able to counter potential future milita ry challenges such as those that might be posed by improved chinese military forces14 that the cost difference between the f35 and the fa 18ef is not as great as it appears on first inspection because the procurement cost of the f35 includes the cost for number of ancilla ry pieces of equipmen t that are purchased separately for the fa18ef and that reducing or eliminating the f35c buy for the navy could reduce economies of scale in producing f 35s and thereby increase the cost of f35s that are built for the marine corps the air force and foreign buyers don officials in addition to studying the feasibility of extending hornet service lives to 10000 hours reportedly are considerin g the option of procuring an additional 50 to 282 fa18s and the option of either accel erating or slowing down planned production of f35s15 the navy reportedly would consider using third myp arrangement for fahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22875crs6 16 see for example

production of f35cs17 regarding the fifth option cvws nd longrange bombers share important attributes neither requires in theater bases and thus offer potential for prompt strikes in crisis therefore an increased inventory of longrange bombers could in some ways make up for shortfall in don strike fighters of course longrang bombers have other attributes that do not mirror don strike fighters such as hi gher cost and lower potential survivability this means that replacing don strike fighters with longrange bombers would change the overall capabilities of dod ai rpower either negatively or positively depending on the context current dod plans call for fielding new long range bomber by 2018 and bomber advocates have argued that new bomber could be fielded in more timely manner18 legislative activity for fy2009 fy2009 defense authorization bill hr 5658s 3001 section 124 of hr 5658 as reported by the house armed services committee would require the secretary of defense to submit report on fa18ef and ea18g procurement for fy2010 through fy2015 including comparative co sts and benefits of using annual versus multiyear procurement to procure the aircraft and the secretarys recommendation as to whether congress should authorize multiyear pr ocurement for the airc raft the provision would also authorize subject to the availa bility of appropriations the secretary of the navy to obligate up to 100 million of the am ount authorized for fa18ef and ea18g procurement for use in cost reduction initiatives in fy2009 the committees report hrept 110652 of may 16 2008 di scusses section 124 on pages 141142 the senate armed services committee in its report srept 110335 of may 12 2008 expressed concern about the projected don strikefighter shortf all and its belief that the navys estimate of the size of the shortfall may be based on questionable assumptions the committee stated that it believes that multiyear procurement of additional fa18efs may be he lpful in reducing the shortfa ll and that the navy should explore all available options in determining how to address the shortfall the committee expressed concern that failure to establish the conditions for multiyear procurement of fa18efs could reduce the savings of such procurement the committee stated that it remains supportive of the f35 and that navy plans for procuring f35cs should not be affected if the navy decides to pursue an fa18ef multiyear contract pages 123 124 concerned by testimony that it receive d from dod regarding aircraft shortfalls the committee required sec 171 dod to annually submit longterm plan for procuring tactical aircraft so that congress can make rational judgements about which aircraft programs to fund
