justice canada litigation branch civil litigation section 234 wellington st ottawa ont k1a 0h8 attention alain pr√©fontaine delivered via email dear sir re mpcc 2008 042 proceedings held october 7 2009 as you are aware my clien t richard colvin is witness and takes position on the motions brought before the commissioner during the above referenced proceedings last week i have reviewed the transcript from the proceedings however and feel compelled to address certain elemen ts in your submissions as they relate to my client in order to provide clarit as this matter goes forward during last weeks proceedings commission counsel confirmed that the pur pose of pre hearing meetings with subjects and witnesses is to narrow issue s eliminate the element of surprise and address potential secrecysecurity concerns it was indeed on the basis of such understanding of the pre hearing procedure that my client agreed to meet with commission counse l and notified you of this decision on september 1 2009 your response on september 4 2009 was to warn my cl ient that section 38 notice had been issued over his testimony effectively forbidding him from meeting with commission counsel you did not specify who had made the notice you acknowledged in your submissions last week that pre hearing interviews would dramatically mitigate the risk of inadvertent disclosure during public hearings of vidence covered by s 38 while conceding that pre hearing meetings would allow s 38 concern s to be addressed you stated that the prehearing meeting requires willingness of the individual concerned to parti cipate in an interview with commission counsel we reiterate that mr colvin is willing nd ready to cooperate with the commission in accor dance with the governments stated policy of full cooperation your statements last week to the commissioner regarding the reasons other government servants have declined to cooperate belie the content of your earlier correspondence t such individuals from our perspective the willingness of crown servants to cooperate with the c ommission has been matter over which you exerted early and profound influence this is in contrast to the submissions you made last week wherein you advised the commissioner that witnesses and subjects were simply exercising individual human rights in declining to cooperate we are in fact conce rned that your submissions on this issue may have had the effect of misleading the commissioner specifically during proceedings l ast week you stated that the decision whether or not to be interviewed was entirely within the control of the witnesses or the subjects you stated that as counsel we have approached all of the witnesses that we repre sent and all of the subjects n one have seen fit to accept the commissions offer you went on to scribe at length the right of those 2 summonsed to decide whether or not to participate and stated for exa mple that the fact that witnesses have not seen that it was in their best i nterest to participate in this voluntary interview is something that should be occasion for comment you stated that the off er was relayed and none of them accepted your emphasis in submissions was that thes witnesses and subjects were simply exercising their individual rights in declining the commissions offer to cooperate this description of your communications with government servants on the pre hearing interview process does not reconcile with the letter you delivered to 29 individuals summonsed including my client on july 28 2009 i note you advised the commissioner that communicat ions with witnesses and subjects on pre hearing proceedings are covered by solicitor client privilege but there is valid claim for privilege over your j uly 28 2009 letter in the case of my client since you were never retained by him in your july 28 letter under the heading in bold what is at stake f or you you advised witnesses and subjects that their reputation was at stake you cautioned that government servants must appear before the commission in public and that the commission is active ly seeking to publicize the hearings and the report you advised that the interview would provide commission counsel with two advantages but that the onl advantage to witness or subject would be to get to know his interrogator and feel more comfortable about the interrogation you w ent on to state that there is reason to believe the interview will allow you to convince her not to call you to tes tify you advised that the pre hearing interview would allow commission counsel to obtain testimony in advance and that she commission counsel will commit you to that recollection you stated as follows in her mind your appearance at the hearin g will be the occasion to confirm what she believes she has already learned informally not the occasion for you to stray from the predicted path departures from this path during the course of the hearings will lead her to question why you are not provi ding the same answers thus putting your credibility in issue are you l ying now or did you lie then what portion of my questions did you not understand when we last met you warned that military police are at especially high risk of re putational damage that they could be directly criticized by the commission and that this criticism c ould further trigger review process before the military police credential review board you state d that additional members of the military police could be served with notice of potential adverse findings following certain procedural requirements you warned however that the level of obser vance by the commission of this procedural safeguard is uneven finally you stated that milit ary commanders could become t he collateral casualties of the hearing and the legality of thei r decision to transfer afghan detainees will be the battleground on which the allegation of failure to investi gate will be fought you closed the letter by strongly suggesting that wit nesses and subjects obtain legal advice before deciding whether to be interviewed and you directed them to named departm ent of justice lawyers you did not as required by law society rules advise that the department of justice was precluded by conflict of interest from simultaneously representing canada witnesses and subjects nor did you recommend crown servants seek the advice of independent legal counsel as senior department of justice lawyer you have duty to fairl and impartially describe m pcc procedures to government employees who may have understanding of the process and who are relying on your description to such government employees you portrayed the pre hearing interview as hostile process whereby an interrogator would be gi ven the upper hand in screening evidence and entrapping witnesses into an evidentiary script according to your tter as result of 3 participating in pre hearing interviews government servants might face accusations of l ying during public hearings fac greater risk to reputation and carry the potential moral burden of unwittingly exposing military and other colleagues and peers to disciplinary penalties you also cautioned that the commission might commit procedural violations to the detriment of bjects and other military police on the battleground of the hearings we expect that such scription of the pre hearing interviews would unnerve even the most cooperative government employee and i t is thus hardly surprising that only one witness my client has agreed to navigate the minefield you describe he is in position to do so only through access to legal advice provided by non government legal counsel one must question whether other government servants would be similarly w illing to co operate if they had the benefit of independent legal counsel with independent legal advice other government servants might also overcome as mr colvin did the chilling effect of your july 28 letter if other witnesses had agreed to cooperate my cl ient would not now be uncomfortably alone among witnesses the right to unbiased independent good faith legal advice is fundamental to canadas legal system and encoded in law society rules where there is conflict of interest or where cr own servant is charged with an offence the governments own policy also requires that crown servants should have access to independent legal counsel crown servants may apply for privat legal counsel through the treasury board policy on the indemnification of and legal assistance for crown servants however under the policy the department of justice decides whether an individual crown servant is entitled to legal representation while this procedure would seem proper in case s where legal risk is presented from outside parties in this case where government has such compelling int erest in protecting its reputation it is inappropriate for the department of justice to ur ge crown servants to retain the department of justice as legal counsel it is also improper that the department of justice be empowered to grant or deny the application of crown servant for independent legal counsel furthermore in the case of my client your legal colleagues within government made misleading and inaccurate descriptions of wha t constitutes conflict of interest under treasury board policy conflict of interest must be established before the government will authoriz independent legal counsel for crown servant in april 2009 your colleagues advised my client that confli ct of interest exists only where crown servant finds himself or herself so strongly opposed to government policy for reasons of conscience or similar reasons that such servant is ble or unwilling to implement government policy and thus fulfill his r her duties you advised that only in such cases would such individual be entitled to independent legal representation by lawyers outsi the department of justice this is in stark contrast to the proper law society definition of conflict of interest which is focussed on the competing interests on the part of the lawyer and not the clients personal feelings about government policy or their duties under the rules of the law society of upper canada lawyer is prohibited from representing more than one side of dispute lawyer must also cease acting where conflict of interest is likely unless after disclosure adequate to make an informed decision the client or prospective client consents under the law society rules lawyer is in conflict p osition whenever competing interest would be likely to affect adversely law yers judgment on behalf of or loyalty to client or prospective client or b whenever such lawyer might be prompted to prefer the interests of one client over that of another client or prospective client in this case you represent government and have an interest in protecting that client from embarrassment you also represent military police subjects and have an interest in suppressing or reframing any evidence detrimental to these individuals you represent military commanders who have an interest in avoiding blame or legal consequences for detainee policies and practices in afghanistan you r epresent witnesses who might introduce evidence harmful to governme nt the military police and commanders you also purport at times to represent the attorney general who has an interest in bl anketing evidence under s 38 with 4 these disparate and competing roles you perform we question whether your clients are evenly served and whether the interests of certain of your clients are placed above the interests of others aside from breaching law society rules your multi party representation has caused confusion in the commissions proceedings during your submissions l ast week at one point you stated this is the government of canada speaking while at another point the commissioner specified mr pr√©fontaine youre representing not the government of canada here today but if i c an remind you the seven subjects in the transcript from last weeks proceedings you are listed s counsel for the attorney general if other government servants subjects and witnesses had been given correct information on their right to legal counsel an accurate explanation of co nflict of interest and fair and unbiased description of pre hearing interviews we doubt whether my client would now be in the position of facing unwelcome public glare as the sole cooperative witness we question whether his colleagues and peers in d fait and other parts of government would refuse to cooperate without suc h historical and ongoing misrepresentations and ethical violations by the department of j ustice on final note we have learned that department of justice lawye rs have instructed mr colvins dfait colleagues on internal communications with him as first r aised in my letter to you of september 15 2009 we again remind you that legal issues related to the afghanistan public interest hearings should not be brought to bear upon mr col vin in the performance of his duties or in his relations with colleagues to restrict communications between my client and his dfait colleagues is an improper exertion of litigation strategy by the department of just ice and an inappropriate interference in internal dfait operations this event is more than can be abide d and we ask you again to kindly contain legal issues in this matter within the legal framework respectfully yours lori g bokenfohr cc freya kristjanson paul champ mark wallace client
