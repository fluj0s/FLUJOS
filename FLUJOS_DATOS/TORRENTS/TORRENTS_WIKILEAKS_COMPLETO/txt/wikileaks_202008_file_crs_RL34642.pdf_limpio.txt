spring and summer 2008 the ruling justice and development party akp government of turkey continued to conduct very active foreign policy aimed at portraying the country as regi onal power and at improving relations with its neighbors it has engaged iraq in order to fight the kurdistan workers party pkk us designated foreign terrorist organization fto prevent the emergence of an independent kurdish state in northern iraq and ensure the development of stable neighbor this engagement includes advances in both political and economic bilateral relations turkey also has been facilitating indirect israelisyrian peace talks and improving political and economic ties to syria more controversially the akp has drawn closer to iran partly because turkey believes that it would be harmed by possible conflict over irans nuclear program and partly because it seeks to diversify its sources of energy the akp has continued to act on its eu ambitions and offers turkey as bridge between its neighbors and europe however turkeys policy toward cyprus may impede progress toward eu membership and its approach to the cyprus settlement talks may not be as constructive as it was in 2004 finally turkeys relations with armenia have been troubled mainly because of its refusal to recognize the armenian genocide of the early 20 th century and nagornokarabakh issues the akps policies toward iran syria hamas and sudan differ from those of the united states and some in the international community it acts in what it views as turkeys national interests at times seeming to disregard the possible reaction in washington despite criticizing these akp policies the bush administration values bilateral relations with turkey for geostrategic reasons major oil and gas pipelines transit turkish territory and us forces value use of turkeys incirlik air base members of congress have registered their concerns about turkeys conduct toward cyprus greece and armenia as well as their support for turkey in its fight against the pkk and in its effort to join the eu mainly by introducing resolutions this report will be updated as developments warrant

experienced considerable domestic political turmoil yet those difficulties have neither affected turkeys very active foreign policy nor its bilateral relations with the united states stable turkey is important to the united states mainly for geostrategic reasons turkey is situated amid the troubled balkans the caucasus and the middle east regions and is critical energy and transit hub between central asiathe caucasus and europe the akp government sees turkey as major regional power serving the cause of peace and stability in its neighborhood it seeks to facilitate the peaceful resolution of israeliarab disputes and of problems the international community has with its neighbors iran and syria it has been less active of late regarding the armenianazerbaijani dispute over the azerbaijani region of nagornokarabakh and the cyprus issue despite governmental changes in yerevan and nicosia that might prove more conducive to settlements than in the past some of the akps regional foreign policy initiatives appear to contradict the bush administrations goals visàvis some of turkeys neighbors in particular the akps engagement with hamas syria iran and sudan has contradicted us and much of the international communitys policy of isolating those regimes and groups and has produced expressions of concern from washington turkeys geostrategic importance to the united states is symbolized by the incirlik air base since the 1950s with minor interruption turkish governments of all political persuasions have granted the united states forces permission to use the base under bilateral defense cooperation agreement in the past the us granted turkey considerable foreign aid tacitly in exchange for such access in recent years as turkeys economy has grown however the united states has not provided it with much assistance the following sections of this report describe turkeys policies on selected issues and as appropriate us administration and congressional views of turkey in these

surrounded by troubles in the middle east balkans and caucasus and by hostile neighbors in syria iraq iran the former soviet union greece and cyprus since taking power the akp has worked assiduously to alter the environment that produced this selfassessment by changing turkeys regional posture improving relations with its neighbors and working to create region of peace the akp government has proceeded with very active foreign policy agenda even as its future was in doubt in 2008 professor ahmet davutoglu is major contributor to the akps approach to foreign policy he is key foreign policy advisor to and frequent traveling companion of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan president abdullah gul and foreign minister ali babacan in 2001 davutoglu published strategic depth treatise calling for new turkish foreign policy strategy based on multidirectional strategic vision 1 he argued that turkey should follow policies of its own making instead of following ones that extend global designs and called on the country to acknowledge its cultural and historical ties to its region davutoglu states that turkey has strategic vision for the future of our region based on common security framework political dialogue economic interdependence and cultural and sectarian harmony2 in other words he nurtures vision of turkey as major regional power broker3 turkey now enjoys rapprochement with greece close political and economic ties with syria growing trade and energy ties with iran continuing good relations with israel and all of the central asian republics and especially close re lations with azerbaijan cyprus and armenia are the only exceptions to improvements in turkish relations with regional actors more on them below davutoglu personally guided turkeys outreach to the palestinian hamas group and is mediating the indirect israelisyrian peace talks some critics of the akp suggest that it has followed an islamic foreign policy 4 yet the akp has abandoned neither turkeys nato membership nor its ambition to join the european union eu as it simultaneously has paid more attention to the region and the east turkeys almost relentless engagement with some of its neighbors puts it at odds with us foreign policy the akp does not share the us goal of isolating iran syria hamas and sudan preferring engagement with all turkish officials believe that their foreign policy serves to expand relations between the west and the middle east and adds value to us and european policies by providing additional avenues of approach they ma intain that there is contradiction between their policies and those of their western allies the akp has welcomed visits by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad palestinian hamas poliburo chief khalid mishal and sudanese 1 the book has not been translated into english ahmet davutoglu stratejik derinlik turkiyenin uluslarasrasi konumu reviewed by hasan t kosebalaban in the middle east journal autumn 2001 many turkish specialists also

efforts to change these leaders behavior in case has the akp been successful moreover the akp has failed to hold these pariahs to international standardsperhaps because they are muslimeven if it risks isolating turkey from the eu and its nato partners the united states and much of the international community have policies of isolating these leaders ahmadinejad because of irans failure to cooperate with international efforts to control or end its enrichment of uranium mishal because the united states and the eu consider hamas to be terrorist group and bashir because of what the united states and others consider the sudanese governments policy of genocide in darfur and more recently their support for the international criminal court prosecutors efforts to have bashir arrested for genocide and war crimes the us state department has criticized turkeys outreach to each of these men the department has been less critical of turkeys relations with syria and even has made positive comments about turkeys role in reviving israelisyrian talks issues on turkeys foreign policy agenda of most concern to the us administration and to congress are discussed below figur 1 t urk ey and its neighbors

grant approval for us forces to transit turkish territory in order to open second front in the war against iraq before the war turkish officials had warned us interlocutors about the potential effects of conflict on regional stability and about possibly resulting increased sectarian unrest turks believe that their fears were realized when the separatist kurdistan workers party pkk which had waged 15year guerrilla war against turkey from 1984 to 1999 at cost of more than 30000 lives took advantage of the chaos in iraq to gain safe haven in northern iraq 6 from there the pkk relaunched campaign of violence against turkey after spate of particularly bloody pkk attacks in the fall of 2007 turkish troops massed on the border with iraq seeming to prepare for major incursioninvasion president bush met prime minister erdogan at the white house on november 5 in an effort to prevent turkish military operation that might further destabilize iraq the president promised to provide turkey with actionable intelligence to use against the pkk and set up tripartite consultation mechanism among gen david petraeus then commander of the multinational force in iraq general james wainwright us deputy chief of staff and general ergin saygun then deputy chief of the turkish general staff since that time turkish forces have launched targeted air and ground strikes against pkk camps and other facilities located in the mountains of northern iraq they have expressed satisfaction with their results wh ile blaming the pkk for continuing terror attacks in turkey hres 796 introduced on november 5 2007 condemns the pkk for its ongoing terrorist attacks against turkey and the turkish people because it has battled pkk separatists for so long turkeys overriding goal regarding iraq is to preserve its neighbors territorial integrity in order to prevent the emergence of an independent iraqi kurdish state that could serve as model for turkeys kurds or more permanent haven for the pkk to that end the turkish government has established relations with most major iraqi ethnic groups and encouraged them to work together to develop functioning democracy and to cooperate in counterterrorism turkey advocates consensus solution for the status of the oilrich city of kirkuk mainly in order to avoid it becoming the financial foundation for kurdish state but also to ensure the rights of the iraqi turcomen ethnic kin of the turks at the invitation of president gul iraqi president jalal talabani kurd made his first official visit to ankara in march 2008 new special envoy to iraq murat ozcelik has reinvigorated relations with all iraqi factions and with davutoglu expanded that outreach to include prime minister nechirvan barzani of the kurdish regional government krg in northern iraq turkish officials thus far have avoided president massoud barzani of the krg because he has said that he considers the pkk to be political problem for turkey and not terrorist organization 7 they say that they are still waiting for the krg to take concrete action against the pkk on july 12 2008 prime minister erdogan made the first visit by turkish prime minister to iraq in 18 years and later reported that he had received support from prime minister nuri malikis 6 the us state department designated the pkk as foreign terrorist organization fto on october 8 1997 7 for example interview with

issue of pkk terrorism the two leaders signed an agreement to establish high level strategic cooperation council under its umbrella the two prime ministers will meet annually foreign and other ministers will meet three times year and technical committees four times year to work on joint future for the two countries erdogan voiced his intention to improve relations in many areas bilateral trade volume was 3 billion in 2007 and the two governments aim to increase it to 5 billion by the end of 2008 and 20 billion by 2010 8 turkish businesses also have been involved in some 4 billion in construction projects although that is declining due to payment problems despite occasional disruptions caused by the security situation 350000 barrels of oil flow daily from iraq to turkey via the kirkukyumurtalik pipelinemainly for international shipping the turkish petroleum corporation tpao the state oil company has been granted conditional approval to bid on oil exploration drilling and marketing in iraq the iraqis are worried about the capacity of the tpao to handle the project and made final approval contingent upon tpaos ability to put together consortium of interna tional companies turkey also is interested in linking iraqi natural gas to the planned nabucco pipeline intended to transport gas from central asia and the caucasus thus in many ways it can be said that the akp has achieved its goal of good neighborly relations with malikis iraqi government g11g156g155g138g142g149g146g556g21g162g155g146g138g151g561g22g138g149g148g156g561 turkey has good relations with both israel and syria which had suspended their peace talks in 2000 during february 2007 visit to turkey is raeli prime minister ehud olmert reportedly discussed the possibility of turkish mediation between his country and syria with prime minister erdogan the turkish leader may have seized on this overture to advance his agenda of regional peace and to enhance turkeys image as regional power on may 21 2008 reportedly after considerable ground work by professor davutoglu israel syria and turkey simultaneously announced that israel and syria had launched proximity or indirect peace talks in istanbul mediated by turkey several rounds of talks have taken place and turkey remains active in the indirect talks syrian president bashar asad has said that he would not move on to direct talks until there is new us administration maintaining that such talks require an international sponsor from whom he is presumably seeking financial and security guarantees it is not clear what role if any turkey would play if and when direct talks are launched in the future turkish diplomats say that their goal is peace and in the end it is enough that they may have helped prepare the foundation for peace agreement without getting credit for achieving one nonetheless israel and syria have both recognized turkey as pivotal regional actor and the akp has taken another action toward its goal of region of peace the turkish initiative to restart peace talks between israel and syria appeared contrary to the bush administration policy of isolating syria because of syrias destabilizing influence in lebanon support for hezbollah and hamas and ties with iran and contrary to the administrations emphasis on achieving an israelipalestinian peace agreement this year however white house press secretary dana perino stated that the administration was not surprised by the may 21 announcement and did not object to it secretary of state condoleezza rice affirmed stating we would welcome any steps that might lead to comprehensive peace 8 turkish state minister for trade kursad tuzman quoted in turkish minister announces plans for joint industrial zone at turkeyiraq border anatolia news

further the cause of peace in the region and secretary rice publicly thanked foreign minister babacan for turkeys role in the process at june 5 meeting9 the administration also characterized turkeys enterprise as an opportunity to convey appropriate messages to damascus perino stated what we hope is that this is forum to address various concerns that we all share about syriathe united states israel and many othersin regard to syrias support for hamas and hezbollah and the training and funding of terrorists that belong to these organizations we believe it could help us to further isolate

g11g155g138g151g561 in its attempts to forge greater regional stability the akp government has tried to bridge the gap between iran and the international community and to expand bilateral relations with its neighbor on the most pressing international issue of the moment turkish officials state that iran has the right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes but has called on iran to cooperate with the international atomic energy agency iaea and demonstrate that its nuclear program has peaceful intentions the turks also want to preserve their own right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes however they do not want iran to develop weapons of mass destruction and thereby upset the regional balance of power foremost the turks seek to avoid another war in their region it is in this light that the akp had hoped the united states and others would view the first working visit of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad to istanbul on august 1415 2008 observers emphasized that it was ahmadinejads first visit to na to member state and eu candidate country ankara suggested that the visit provided an opportunity to pass messages at the highest level iran does not think that it needs an intermediary with the international community but ahmadinejad said that he viewed turkeys efforts to defuse tension and to further constructive dialogue positively 12 turkish newspaper claimed that during their meeting president gul urged ahmadinejad to accept the incentive package offered by the five permanent members of the security council and germany p51 to freeze irans enrichment program but ahmadinejad simply reiterated his stance that the program is peaceful and that iran would not accept freeze13 there was official turkish statement about the conversation and the akp could not point to any achievements on the nuclear issue resulting from ahmadinejads visit bilateral turkishiranian relations have strong economic dimension about 15 million iranian tourists visit turkey annually trade is growing with volume of 8 billion in 2007 that is expected to reach 10 billion by the end of 2008 with target of 20 billion within four years14 the balance is sharply in irans favor because turkey imports oil oil products and gas from its neighbor turkey is net importer of oil and gas and depends on russia for 68 of its gas supplies it looks to tehran to lessen that dependence and sees the bilateral relationship as in its vital national interest the first iranianturkish gas pipeline went on stream in 2001 but supplies have been sporadic during the winter as iran diverts them for its own domestic needs in july 2007 turkey and iran signed memorandum of understanding or preliminary agreement for the turkish petroleum corporation tpao to be granted

accession talks with the eu in october 2005 subsequently there was drop in enthusiasm for the eu in turkey in part as result of statements by newly elected european leaders who strongly oppose turkeys eventual eu membership notably german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy sarkozy and merkel have suggested offering turkey special relationship or privileged partnership with the eu in lieu of membership they have not defined these terms which may not mean much more than the customs union turkey has enjoyed with the eu since 1995 the eu has long struggled with whether turkey should be allowed to join the union and many eu citizens and leaders remain wary of turkeys possible accession given its large population relatively poor economy and muslim culture in november 2006 the eu suspended negotiations with turkey on 8 out of 35 chapters of the acquis communautaire body of eu laws and regulations that candidates must conclude and implement before accession the suspension was due to turkeys refusal to open its ports and airports to cypriot ships and planes the eu so declared that chapter would be closed completed until turkey meets the requirements regarding cyprus an eu member the eu sees turkeys position as contravening eu requirements for the free movement of goods ankara insists that the eu keep its promise to end the isolation of predominantly turkish cypriot northern cyprus before turkey takes actions benefitting greek cypriots who control the internationally recognized government of cyprus but only the territory of the southern twothirds of the island nonetheless the eu continues to open other chapters for negotiation more on cyprus below aside from the cyprus issue the eu demands that turkey carry out many reforms including constitutional changes to ensure an independent judiciary tighter civilian control over the military greater guarantees of freedom of expression and more protections and freedom for religious and ethnic minorities among other requirements the eu praises the reforms that turkey has undertaken so far but finds them insufficient turkish supporters of eu membership were dismayed when the akp

civilmilitary ties and other matters the turkish parliament will take up the plan when it reconvenes in october 2008 the akp government portrays its eu vocation as part of its regional foreign policy suggesting that turkey is the link between its region and europe that europe should want to exploit eu membership for turkey is unlikely before 20132014 if then so turkey may be able to wait out the tenure of current european leaders opposed to its membership the united states strongly supports turkey in its efforts to achieve eu membership and lobbied the eu strongly to accept turkey as

begin negotiations on september 3 many greek cypriots believe that talat will not be able to conclude settlement without the approval of ankara where key constituencies may not agree to the compromises needed the akp strongly supported talat in 2004 when turkish cypriots approved and the greek cypriots rejected the last settlement plan for cyprus the socalled annan plan now the akps
