us interests were directly involved because of the danger posed by potentially unstable russian economic political and security system and the possible linkage by policy makers between economics security political interests and debt settlement relief came from new imf program shortterm rescheduling fram ework agreement that suspended principal payments for russian paris club debt through the year 2000 and substantial forgiveness of the soviet era commercial london club debt russia made debt rescheduling key issue at the okinawa g8 meeting on july 2123 2000 and in subsequent bilateral and international meetings when the short term framework agreement ended prime minister kasyanov announced in janua ry 2001 policy of partial servicing of their paris club debt creditor reaction was so strong president putin reversed kasyanov and assured creditors that all debt obligations would be met later in early 2001 russian leadership shifted its concern to an external debt servicing crisis expected in 2003 noting that russia would then either need debt relief or would face default germanys position as leading paris club creditor is that russia should be able to meet its debt obligations germany holds about half of the 42 billion of outstanding paris club debts inherited from the soviet union germanys paris club russian debt rose in 2001 by inclusion of russian commitment to pay an earlier debt by the soviet union to the german democratic republic the additional 6 billion russian debt is being given special treatment by germany russia and germany are discussing debt for asset swaps for this debt improved russian economic performa nce has generated additional currency reserves and increased revenue that has eased the burden of servicing their debts and meeting their needs for discretionary spending even with substantial reserves in the russian central bank the ministry of finance must either buy the reserves or reduce budget outlays in order to meet paris club debt servicing commitments without structural reform with changes in the incentive system the economic upswing may be part of cycle rather than new trend line of sustainable economic growth reducing the debt service requirements through further rescheduling limiting subsidies and containing defense spending may be necessary if russia is to meet the budgetary needs for implementing the structural reform us options in paris club soviet era negotiations range from rescheduling to deep debt restructuring and use of debt swaps the united states gives more explicit attention than germany and other

states in the view of some analysts without structural reform many analysts argued that russia would regress in future economic performance and governance the dangers to the united states of failed russian federation would then be great possible buildup and use of nuclear and conventional weaponry return to more authoritarian government in weakened federation increased destabilization of its eurasian neighbors aggravation of global economic problems and an inimical foreign policy on the other hand the opportunities to the united states of successful russia might be substantial with transition to democratic government with functioning market system russia might become an important american business partner with development of democratic system russia could become more cooperative ally and contributor to global stability linkage between russian performance and the united states interests are less evident to some analysts both the dangers and opportunities from russian developments are considered by some analysts to be of marginal importance to united states interests in maintaining peace and prosperity both the executive and the congressional branches have roles in determining the interests of the united states in debt relief the congress of the united states has played selective role in past paris club negotiations the united states has weighed the importance of the precedents of policies adopted in some past paris club negotiations on debt inherited from previous regimes the united states house of representatives took leadership position in the 1992 polish paris club agreement that wrote down over 50 of the debt democratic poland inherited from its communist regime predecessor the underlying assumptions were that the debts were uncollectible and without relief they would impede the countrys effort to pursue successful transition to functioning democratic market system the united states stressed the importance of structural reform for russia to make successful transition to functioning market economy with sustained growth american leadership did not explicitly accept the proposition that russian debt was uncollectible or that debt relief would permit the russian budget to support the cost of structural reform and serve as leverage to constrain subsidies and defense expenditures the congress has become more involved in all paris club negotiations and the linkage of debt relief to foreign security issues has broadened especially dealing with russian debt since enactment of the federal credit reform act of 1990 the congress must be directly involved in any official debt reduction official debt forgi veness must be accounted for in the appropriations process congress is informed on debt relief even if debt reduction is not

agreement had been held up russia would have been required to make scheduled payment or run the risk of losing its most favored nation status the lendlease agreement in 1972 permitted four debt payment deferrals the allotted postponements in payment have now been used up the administration chose to go forward with the bilateral agreement and not follow the wishes of congress as the administration complied with the paris club agreement the payment was not required at that time administration officials noted that the agreement on debt relief made in 1999 was based on an established policy of supporting heavily indebted countries with balance of payments crises who had imf programs moreover they argued bad precedent would be set by noncompliance that would weaken the

service to export ratio of 1215 in 1999 russias economic performance improved and their estimated gdp was increased making them less indebted country proponents of hipc relief might therefore argue that russia was less qualified for debt relief than many hipc countries6 this comparative need was expected to lead to shortfall in hipc financing the house approved 225 million of the 472 million the hipc budget requested in fy200001 only 75 million was tentatively approved by the senate7 paris club agreement involving 50 reduction of the outstanding russ ian debt would have required budgetary outlay of as much as 455 million8 funding for russian debt restructuring would have competed with hipc for these limited funds in the international affairs budget this possible choice between hipc and russian debt restructuring did not come to pass but potential for tradeoff was made evident the paris club framework agreement of august 1999 was expected by russian leaders to be followed in 2001 with comprehensive paris club agreement this debt issue was raised at the g8 okinawa meeting in july 2000 on july 18 2000 senators jesse helms trent lott mitch mcconnell and john w warner sent letter to president clinton advising him that we strongly oppose any further debt rescheduling reduction or relief for the government of russia absent significant changes in russian spending priorities on

kasyanovs statement on prospective noncompliance was strong and negative the paris club secretary took the unusual step of sending an official cautionary letter to russia counseling full debt service

on paris club soviet era debt of less than 5 billion russias external debt crisis russia inherited close to 100 billion debt from the soviet union in 1991 russia as the successor state in the socalled zero solution proceeded to lay claim to all the foreign assets of the soviet union and also assumed its liabilities from 1991 to 1998 russia ran budget deficits and partly financed them by borrowing abroad building up its external debt to over 150 billion12 russia was able to service or meet its debt obligations up to 1998 with the help of several restructurings of its officia l and commercial debts by its western creditors with the financial crisis of august 1998 came an external debt crisis precipitated by its inability to service its 173 billion due in 1999 the oecd described the situation as follows following the dramatic depreciation of the currency the burden of foreign debt has become so high as to make the servicing of all scheduled payments unfeasible indeed such strategy would have devoted the equivalent of over 80 of planned federal tax revenue in 1999 to foreign debt service alone instead the russian government has been following strategy of servicing only the part of the foreign debt incurred by the russian federation itself as opposed to the inherited debt of the soviet union negotiations are continuing on debt restructuring agreements that russia needs to get back on track and boost its credibility in the international community13 the debt crisis of 199899 put russias leaders in double bind either they could choose not to meet their debt obligations by going into default on its inherited debt and suffer lack of support from the donor institutions and loss of access to the international capital markets or they could meet more of their debt obligations and effectively exhaust the revenue available for discretionary appropriations in their budget the budgetary restraints faced by the russians may merit debt rescheduling rather than debt reduction as an option that congress may consider with reduction of the value of russian securities gkoofz to 10 of their cash value the western security market was effectively closed to russia the gkoofzs are domestic bonds that were primarily held by russian banks and foreign buyers russia had used this security market before august 1998 to finance its substantial budget deficits14 even with limited servicing of its external debts russia had substantial arrears or non payments of social expenditures and funding of reform programs the budgetary squeeze was also exacerbated by increased military claims for financing chechnya and for military procurementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30617crs6 while russia had been seeking debt relief after the 1998 financial crisis in order to help resolve its external debt crisis debt restructuring was sought solely on the official and commercial debt russia inherited from the ussr this inherited debt represented close to twothirds of

beginning with 2001 the dollar value of the debt estimated to be as much as 6 billion was determined by exchange rate calculations agreed to by german and russian financial authorities prime minister kasyanov did not include the old gdr obligation in his preokinawa debt statement20 potentially offsetting to russias debt burden are their claims on debts owed to them by other countries and assets abroad inherited from the soviet union the bulk of the enormous official debts owed to russia especially debts for military equipment sales may be largely uncollectible russian estimates however consider 25 billion of the debts as collectable the value of soviet assets abroad inherited by russia in the zero solution has not been subjected to objective inventory estimates range widely from 20 to 600 billion whatever the accurate amount neither the collectable outstanding debts nor assets abroad have yielded appreciable inflow of funds to russia to date21 there is little evidence of russian plans to exploit these potential sources of funds to relieve their debt burden russias economic growth prospects and debt management there are two competing views on current russian economic growth prospects one perspective articulated by the world bank imf and oecd is that the present upsurge in russian economic growth is fragile and that sustained growth requires significant structural changes that need to be initiated soon if not under way in the near term the upsurge of growth may provide at best an economic breathing space followed by return to financial and debt burden crises resulting from another down cycle more expenditures for reform would be needed in this view to bring about structural reform and attain sustainable growth and increased revenue the second perspective held by some economists and bankers judges the current improvement in economic performance as having staying power and that necessary structural changes are now taking place during this improvement in performance in this view the economy is seen to be already on new trend line of sustained and rising growth those who stress the rich natural resource potential of russia that ought to be able to support sustained growth reinforce this view bearish outlook under the first broadly held view the size and distribution of the russian budget is important to success in generating sustained growth providing an increased revenue stream and managing the external debt structural reform requires increased expenditures for recapitalizing working banks and pensionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30617crs9 22

federation 19992000 op citsystems restructuring bankrupt state enterprises for sale to private owners improving transport and communications infrastructure and providing at least minimum outlays for health environment and education without debt restructuring that reduces the debt servicing burden limits subsidies and restrains military outlays these claimants may continue to squeeze out budgetary outlays necessary for reform even with debt relief overly ambitious military programs might draw down funds released by debt relief paris club creditors would likely be especially concerned if they perceived their debt relief funds would be used to fuel military budgets designed to strengthen military programs that would threaten the security of creditor countries the international institutions especially the world bank imf and oecd find that institutional changes in the russian econ omic incentive system are critical to attaining sustained growth and an increased and reliable stream of revenue for government financing the critical problem identified in world bank analyses is that of changing the nonpayment system in russia22 without an efficient tax code working banking system and bureaucratic system that regulates competitive enterprises with hard budget constraint russia will not be able to effectively gather taxes generate investment pay wages and pensions and manage debt uneconomic subsidies to housing and utilities do not improve the quality of living spaces and absorb 4 of the gdp the world bank views the present russian economic system as disincentive system based on rent seeking rather than profit maximization and therefore persistently hostile to the development of sustained solvency and economic growth with the introduc tion of working institutional infrastructure in russia sustainable growth may be assured international financial institutions view repatriation of some of the over 150 billion capital flight as necessary contributor to the success of russian fiscal and monetary reform export earnings returned to russia rather than retained abroad in flight capital might then pay taxes and contribute revenue for needed domestic investment23 without these comprehensive structural reforms called for by the world bank even debt relief under the favorable terms set up by both the london and paris clubs may not be sufficient for russia to attain the threshold of sustained economic growth and effective future debt management the oecd points to the same structural requirements needed to effect russian reform in stressing the need to address the demonetization of the economy the oecd also calls for reworking the entire fiscal relationship between the federal and regional governments with more local mandates that may be funded

the imf views the delay in reforming the fiscal infrastructure as special deterrent to the development of productive economic incentive system perhaps main internal factor contributing to the russian crisis was the persistent failure to bring fiscal problems under control lack of commitment for fiscal reform at the highest political levels political opposition to such reforms lack of cooperation by regional governments and the emergence of influential oligarches unwilling to share the tax burden all helped stifle the base of fiscal reform on the expenditure side control over spending in the military area was particularly lax25 russian expenditures for military and security forces in chechnya led to concerns by the imf that the military budget increases would exceed the approved budget or be hidden off budget in either event priority military claims would absorb or delimit revenue that was planned and needed for social welfare expenditures and funding institutional reform measures alexei arbatov deputy chairman of the defense committe in the duma projects an increase in defense spending if putin follows current military doctrine26 current military doctrine he notes rests on two pillars nuclear deterrence and preparation for local wars including the need for peacekeeping forces under discussion in russian military circles is proposed third pillar for defense planning that would provide for forces that might counter those of nato to fund the first two pillars of current military doctrine the military budget would have to increase to 35 of gdp from the present 25 this increase may allow for 50 increase in military procurement an increase from close to zero procurement budgeting for most of the decade27 arbatov strongly supports the increased budget for military reform and professionalization of forces we will be able to reach new level in the course of three years to preserve the most advanced defense industries double the wages of soldiers and officers and place the army on fully professional level these steps albeit expensive to implement would provide for adequate nuclear deterrence and reformed military forces prepared to fight small wars however arbatov strongly opposes the third pillar the socalled balkan scenario for countering nato here we face fundamental question if the balkan scenario suddenly becomes the prevailing one in our military doctrine and there are many forces including in the general staff who are insisting on this then nothing will come out of our cooperation with the west this will contradict our foreign policy ties and

external debt but not without possible consequences for funding reform to service the external debt russia needs to have foreign currency available and the means to buy the foreign currency the central bank of russia has built up substantial foreign currency reserves of 28 billion by december 200036 the ministry of finance may buy the necessary currency to pay the debt by either printing money or borrowing from abroad neither of these options is attractive the first is inflationary the second would create very expensive debt the third option for providing foreign currency is to shift expenditures in the budget from nondebt service spending to debt service the discretionary spending squeezed out of the budget may have been ticketed to fund reforms eg recapitalizing working banks and pension funds putins personal economic advisor alexei illarionov has favored this fiscal option but it may not be used without possible effects on reform37 strong russian growth without significant structural reform may contribute to more capital flight abroad and increased dollarization of savings in russia reform of the financial system key part of putins structural reform may lead

such as our united states marshall plan assistance estimated at 88 billion in current dollars and the annual transfer of 70 billion from western to eastern germany after the 1990 german unification debt relief is necessary he claimed because it is essential to successful reform and because russia would then be able to meet its remaining commitments to the creditor countries the required

russian leaders would result in immediate costs and future risks to the creditor count ries once the principal and interest were reduced in most creditor countries the debt written off would have to be offset in the creditor countrys budget if russias commitment to meet the conditions of the restructured debt obligations were not being followed then the creditor countries would have limited future leverage needed to assure collectability of the remaining debt in the long run40 the debt relief policy implies substantial degree of trust in russias future credit worthiness and the acceptance of the risk of future noncompliance with newly negotiated debt terms all creditors supporting relief may need to have confidence that russia would follow its commitments to structural reform and thereby assure prospect of sustainable economic growth increased revenue and sustained debt management finally political benefits in security and foreign policy matters may not accrue even

because of the importance placed on debt relief by russia these discussions may focus on four issues that have been under consideration in past paris club negotiations precedents from past agreements cost of forgiveness to creditor countries sustainability of russian economic growth and debt management and strategic and political benefits linked to debt agreements each of these will be discussed with the current german position in italics precedents for paris club debt relief russia has cited number of precedents when the united states has supported debt relief especially for inherited debt44 united states officials have not recently discussed these precedents as relevan t to current debt discussions the german position is that past london club and paris club agreements do not prejudge any paris club agreement there are two types of precedents that have been under discussion the first has to do with the order in which debt settlements are negotiated as between multilateral entities eg imf paris club and london club the second is related to the status of debts inherited from previous regimes the precedents for time sequencing of past debt agreements have been that the paris club follows the imf and precedes the london club and each sets precedents for the other germany made clear that the london club agreement of february 2000 featuring 50 reductio n in debt and clearer acceptance by russia of its obligation for paying debt inherited from the soviet union was not acceptable as starting point for paris club negotiations russia and some paris club members may still raise the london club outcome as precedent45 although russia in the zero solution agreement accepted responsibility for soviet debts the russian government did not accept the role of principal obligator of the inherited debt46 the old soviet foreign economic bank vnesheconombank owned by the central bank of russia continued to be the principal obligator for inherited paris club soviet debt this ambiguity on debt obligations was cited by russia as reason for defaulting on soviet debt while continuing payment of russian federation debt obligations after the august 1998 financial crisis this ambiguity was resolved in the london club agreement when the russian government accepted the position of principal obligator for payment of the new eurobonds the commercial debt was converted at discounted rate to the newly issued eurobonds replacing soviet era commercial debt instruments47 the second precedent that has been considered in past negotiations is the standing of debts inherited

special way at the paris club it is round fenced or set aside for special bilateral negotiations in his summit with president putin chancellor schroeder suggested this debt be handled by debt for

repayment to the united states the lendlease debt was renegotiated in an agreement in 1972 that wrote down 90 of the debt based on the precedent set by the earlier british settlement of their

position is strongly opposed to reduction of their russian paris club debt on grounds of cost of debt relief in the german budget they made this clear in rejecting the london club forgiveness as precedent for one thing the private banks involved have partly bought german debt at discount so they retain profit under this schedulin g agreement for another thing tax laws generally allow banks to write off their losses eg through unpaid russian debt service as tax deductible this also means decline in tax revenue of the concerned countries both considerations do not apply to official creditors germany owns the largest percentage of debt and therefore would incur the greatest cost from debt relief the former soviet gdr debt of estimated 6 billion added to more than 20 billion paris club debt would increase the russi an debt to germany to some 28 billion more than the total imf disbursements to russia since 199158 some germans note however that the united states may take favorable view toward debt relief since the american debt is small compared to the german debt59 based on paris club principle of equal burden sharing the cost of debt relief for the german budget would be approximately eight times that for the united states see percentage shares in table 2 the same requirement for compensating for official debt relief in the budgetary process of the united states and germany applies to other countries in the paris club notably japan60 japan would likewise have to compensate for paris club reductions in their general account budget by using public funds japan

either the state or agriculture department accounts in the united states budget offsetting factors to the cost of paris club debt reduction could be developed in the state and agriculture department

gas export debts of ukraine albeit with little success63 in the early 1990s the united states was one of the leading proponents of debt for nature and other debt conversion mechanisms for countries in transition64 the burden of debt relief may be ameliorated by paris club debt swaps that require purchases of debt by third party at the present market value of the debt if the market value of russian debt were calculated at 35 per 100 of debt then that would be the price for third party purchase this debt might then be converted to ecological purposes as was done in the polish ecofund65 lend lease debt might be logical candidate for debt swaps as all payments have to be made not later than july 1 200166 debt swaps might be attractive to the russian government for debts not likely to be forgiven

make it possible to support the debt service burden without debt relief70 however the sufficiency of revenue and increased reserves are not enough to provide the necessary government expenditures to support the required reform revenue for covering costs of structural reform such as outlays needed to recapitalize reformed commercial banks and pension systems is necessary but may be squeezed out of
