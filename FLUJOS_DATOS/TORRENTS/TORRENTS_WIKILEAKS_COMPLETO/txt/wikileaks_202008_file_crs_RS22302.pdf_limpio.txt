eight house and eight senate committees instructed to reduce spending within their jurisdiction were to submit their recommendations to their respective budget committees by september 16 reconciliation procedures require that the budget committees incorporate the legislative submissions of instructed committees into an omnibus bill without any substantive revision2 by informal agreement in the senate however the deadline for committee submission was postponed to the week of oc tober 1721 the house also has adopted informally delayed time frame the other two reconciliation bills for revenue reductions and an increase in the public debt limit are to be reported directly to the house and senate by the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee respectively unlike in the case of omnibus legislation committees that receive sole instruction report their recommendations directly to their chamber rather than submitting them to their respective budget committee under the terms of th budget resolution the two committees were to report the revenue bill by september 23 and the debt limit bill by september 30 by informal agreement in the two chambers however the two committees are expected to report the bills several weeks later in the session after the omnibus spending legislation has been reported additional detail on the reconciliation
