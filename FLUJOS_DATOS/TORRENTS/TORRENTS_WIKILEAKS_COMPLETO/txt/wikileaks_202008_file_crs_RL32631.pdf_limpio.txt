infrastructures and key assets although the strategy provides such definitions the meaning of critical infrast ructure in the public policy context has been evolving for decades and is still open to debate twenty years ago infrastructure was defined primarily with respect to the adequacy of the nations public works in the mid1990s however the growing threat of international terrorism led policy makers to reconsider the definition of infrastructure in the context of homela nd security successive federal government reports laws and executive orders have refined and generally expanded the number of infrastructure sectors and the types of assets considered to be critical for purposes of homeland security the usa patriot act of 2001pl 10756 contains the federal governments most r ecent definition of criti cal infrastructure the nspp contains the most recent detailed list of critical infrast ructures and assets of national importance the list may c ontinue to evolve however as economic changes or geopolitical developments influence homeland security policy there is some debate among policy makers about the implications of an ambiguous or changing list of critical infrastructures ambiguity about what constitutes critical infrastructure or key resource could lead to inefficient use of limited homeland security resources for example private sector representatives state that they need clear and stable definitions of sset criticality so they will know exactly what assets to protect and how well to protect them otherwise they risk protecting too many facilities protecting th wrong facilities or both on the other hand arbitrarily limiting the number of cr itical infrastructures priori due to resource constraints might miss dangerous vulnerability clear criticality criteria will also be important if federal agencies intend to implement and enforce any potential future security regulations related to critical infrastructure this report will not be

subject to interpretation as practical matter what is considered to be infrastructure depends heavily upon the context in which the term is used in us public policy the definition of infrastructure has been evolutionary and often ambiguous twenty years ago infrastructure was defined primarily in debates about the adequacy of the nati ons public workswhich were viewed by many as deteriorating obsol ete and of insufficient capacity typical report of the time issued by the council of state planni ng agencies define d infrastructure as wide array of public facilities and equipment required to provide social services and support private sector econo mic activity according to the report infrastructure included roads bridges water and wer systems airports ports and public buildings and might also include schools health facilities jails recreation facilities electric power production fire safety wast disposal and comm unications services3 in 1983 report the congressional budget office cbo defined infrastructure as facilities with the common characteristics of capital intensiveness and high public investment at all levels of government they are moreover directly critical to activity in the nations ec onomy the cbo included highways public transit systems wastewater treatment works water resources air traffic control airports and municipal water supply in this category the cbo also noted that the concept of infrastructure could be applied broadly to include such social facilities as schools hospitals and prisons and it of ten includes industria l capacity as well4 in subsequent report however cbo narro wed this definition of infrastructure to exclude some facilities often thought of as infrastructuresuch as public housing government buildings private rail service and schoolsand some environmental facilities such as hazardous or toxic waste sites where the in itial onus of responsibility is on private individuals5 congress itself has often enacted legisl ation defining or ffecting one or more infrastructure sectors but has rarely done so comprehensively in 1984 congress did enact bill that established the nationa l council on public wo rks improvement with mandate to report on the state of public works infrastructure systems pl 98501 analysis required by that act was to include any physical asset that is capable of being used to produce services or other be nefits for number of years and was to include but not be limited to roadways or br idges airports or airway facilities mass transportation systems wastewater treatment or related facilities

water resources solid waste and hazardous waste services 7 the councils report was one of the last significant fe deral initiatives during the 1980s to consider the definition of in frastructure by the early 1990s policy makers attention had largely moved aw ay from infrastructure issues broadly instead legislative proposals tended to address the needs of individual infrastructure sectors critical infrastructure and key resources the growing threat of international terro rism in the mid1990s renewed federal government interest in infrastructure issu unlike the previous period which was focused on infrastructure adequacy federal agencies in the 1990s were increasingly concerned about infrastructur protection this concern in turn led policy makers to reconsider the definition of in frastructure in security context on july 15 1996 president clinton signed executive order 13010 establishing the presidents commission on critical infrastructure protection pccip8 this executive order eo fined infrastructure as the framework of interdependent networks and systems comprising identifiable industries institutions i ncluding people and procedures and distribution capabilities that provide reliable flow of products and services essential to the defense and economic security of the united states the smooth functioning of gove rnment at all levels and society as whole this definition of infrastru cture is consistent with the broad definitions from the 1980s eo 13010 went further however by prioritizing partic ular infrastructure sectors and specific assets within those

are so vital that their incapacity or destruction would have debilitating impact on the defense or economic security of the united states9 the commissions final report to the president echoed the eos defi nition of vital infrastructure10 the general concept of vital or cr itical infrastructure in eo 13010 was not entirely new having appeared in some fo rm in many of the policy debates in the 1980s the order did break new ground however in listing what it considered to be critical infrastructures according to eo 13010 these critical infrastructures were telecommunications electrical power systems gas and oil storage and transportation banking and finance transportation water supply systems emergency services including dical police fire and rescue and continuity of government the list of critical infrastru cture sectors in eo 13010 was much broader than that reported by the national c ouncil on public works impr ovement in addition to transportation water systems and public

rationale for classifying sp ecific infrastructure sectors as critical our critical infrastructures are particular ly important because of the functions or services they provide to our country our cr

immediate damage americas critical infrastructure encomp asses large number of sectors our agriculture food and water sectors along with the public health and emergency services sectors provide the essential goods and services americans need to survive our institutions of government guarantee our national security and freedom and administer key public f unctions our defense industrial base provides essential capabilities to help safeguard our population from external threats our information and telecommunications sector enables economic productivity and growth and is particularly important because it connects and helps control many other infrastructure sectors our energy transportation banking and finance chemical industry and postal and shipping sectors help sustain our

industrial base information and telecommunications energy transportation banking and finance chemical industry postal and shipping20 this list of critical infrastructures encompasses those of eo 13228 but adds chemicals and postal and shipping services due to their economic importance while there may be some debate in particular about why the chemical industry was not on earlier lists that considered military and economic secur ity it seems to have been added also because individual chemical plants could be sources of materials that could be used for weapon of mass struction or whose operations could be disrupted in way that would signifi cantly threaten the safety of surrounding communities while not identifying it as such in this list the national strategy also discusses cyber infrastructure as closely connected to but distinct from physical infrastructure the strategy states that dhs will place an especially high priority on protecting our cyber infrastructure21 in addition to identifying critical infrastructure the strategy also introduces the concept of key assets as subset of nationally important key resources the strategy defines key assets as individual targets whose destruction would not endanger vital systems but could create local disaster or profoundly dama ge our nations morale or confidence key assets include symbols or historical attractions such as prominent national state or local monuments and icons in some cases these include quasipublic symbols that are identified strongly with the united states as nation key assets also include

of critical infrastructures and key assets nspp released in fe bruary 2003 reaffirms the critical infrastructure sectors identified in the national strategy for homeland security the 2003 strategy also defines three categories of what it considers to be key assets one category of key assets comprises the diverse array of national monuments symbols and icons that represent our nations heritage traditions and values and political power they include wide va riety of sites and structures such as prominent historical attractions m onuments cultural icons and centers of government and commerce another category of key assets includes facilities and structures that represent our na tional economic power and technological advancement many of them house significant amounts of hazardous materials fuels and chemical catalysts that enable important production and processing functions third category of key assets includes such structures as prominent commercial centers office buildings and sports stadiums where large numbers of people regularly congregate to conduct business or personal transactions shop or enjoy recreational pastime 23 the strategy specifically identifies nuclear

identifying and prioritizing which assets of an infrastructure are most essential to its function or pose the most significan t danger to life and property if threatened or damaged is necessary for developing an effective protection strategy but the scope and complexity of critical infrastructure sectors can make it daunting task to identify which specific assets are critical for example recent report by the national research council n rc characterizes the extent of the us domestic transportation system one of the cr itical infrastructures as follows the us highway system consists of 4 million interconnected miles of paved roadways including 45000 miles of interstate freeway and 600000 bridges the freight rail networks extend for mo re than 300000 miles and commuter and urban rail systems cover some 10000 miles even the more contained civil aviation system has some 500 commercialservice airports and another 14000 smaller general aviation airports scattered across the country

the trans portation system is large maritime network of inland waterways ports and vessels as the definitions of critical infrastru cture and key resources have evolved in us homeland security policy respon sible agencies have been seeking greater refinement and prior itization within these categories in 1999 for example the critical infrastructure assurance office c iao which was established to support president clintons national infrastructure protection plan termined that many federal agencies responsible for critical infrastructure prot ection lacked clear understanding of what constitut ed critical asset within an infrastructure as result the ciao instituted new program by which an agency could identify and assess its critical assets identify the depe ndencies of those asse ts on other systems including those beyond the di rect control of the agency and prioritize the homeland security act implies some type of critical asset differentiation as well by requiring dhs to identify priorities for protective and support measures within the nations critical infrastruct ure sectors sec 201d3 president bushs national strategy fo r homeland security explicitly adopts critical asset differentiati on the strategy states the assets functions and systems within each critical infrastructure sector are not equally important the transportation s ector is vital but not every bridge is critical to the nation as whole26 the strategy formally introduces the cept of critical assets as way for the federal government to focus its efforts on the highest priorities in critical infrastructure protection27 the bush administrations national strategy for the physical protection of critical infrastructures and key assets reaffirms the requirement to prioritize critical assets the strategy calls for what amounts to prioritized master list to frame the initial focus of our national protection effort we must acknowledge that the assets systems and functions th at comprise our infrastructure sectors are not uniformly critical in nature particularly in national or major regional context we must develop comprehensive prioritized assessment of facilities systems and functions of nationallevel criticality and monitor their preparedness across infrastructure sectors28httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32631crs12 29 office of the president february 2003 p 3 30 national petroleum council securing oil and natural gas infrastructures in the new continuedwhile the strategy calls for objective ssessment of critical assets it acknowledges that the criticalityof individual assets is potentially fluid the strategy states that as we act to secure our most critical infrastructures and assets we must remain cognizant that criticality varies as function of time risk and market changes29 the requirements of hspd7 continue th policy of critical asset prioritization and protection in the strategy it is interesting to note however that hspd7 requires dhs to do so with an emphasis on critical infrastructure and key resources that could be exploited to cause catastrophic health effects or mass casualties comparable to those from the use of w eapon of mass destructi on this emphasis on health and safety appears to imply yet another basis for prioritizing infrastructure protection challenges identifyi ng critical assets private companies and federal agenci have shared responsibility for identifying critical assets since pdd63 wa s issued in 1998 that directive required each lead federal agency to work with p rivate sector entities in their respective infrastructures to contribute to sectoral national infrastructure assurance plan by assessing the vulnerabilities of the sect or to cyber or physical attacks among other tasks sec iv according to pdd 63 these assessments shall include the determination of the minimum essential infrastructure in each sector sec v iii1 the responsibility of the private sector to work with federal agencies in developing and maintaining lists of minimum essential infrastructure or critical assets continues to be an essen tial part of the government s infrastructure protection strategy individual critical infrastructure sector s have implemented independent and often varying approaches for identifying their own critical assets for example the june 2001 security guidance issued by th national petroleum council npc for oil and natural gas infrastructure stated the following the first step in the risk management process is to identify and put value on each of the key assets of the organization these key assets can be people facilities services processes programs etc next the impact of loss for each of these assets is estimated this is measure of the loss to the company if the asset is damaged or destroyed simple rating system based on userdefined criteria can be used to measure the value of the asset eg very low low moderate high extremely high and the impact of its loss in more complex risk management system the value of an asset and impact of loss can be calculated in monetary units these values may be based on such parameters as the original cost to create the asset th cost to obtain temporary replacement for the asset the permanent replacement co st for the asset costs associated with the loss of revenue an assigned cost for the loss of human life or degradation of environmental resources costs to publicstakeholder relations legal and liability costs and the costs of increased regulatory oversight30httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32631crs13 30 continued economy washington dc june

infrastruct ure protection dept of homeland security testimony before the house select committee on homeland security infrastructure and border security subcommittee april 21 2004 35 starks t and andersen congress industry both in dismay over homeland securitys performance on critical infrastructure cq homeland security july 29 2004while it acknowledged the need to identif critical assets the npcs guidance left it up to individual companies to determine the specific basis for criticality in their security assessments it is important to note that the npc initially defined key asset with respect to potential loss to the company rather than broader economic or social welfare impacts as called for in federal critical infrastructure strategies this emphasis illustrates the practical challenge of relying on private companies to identify critical assets in the context of national infrastructure security in an effort to establish and implement more consistent standard for what constitutes critical asset the national strategy for the physical protection of critical infrastructures and key assets requires dhs to develop uniform methodology for identifying facilities syst ems and functions with nationallevel criticality and build comprehensive da tabase to catalog these critical facilities systems and functions31 under section 201 of the homeland security act pl 107296 responsibility for this critical asset catalog lies with the dhss information analysis and infrastructure protection directorate iaip developing uniform methodology for id entifying critical ssets and compiling critical asset list for the united states as whole has been difficult for iaip in april 2004 iaip reported that it had co mpiled list of 1700 critical assets but confusion among private sector and state g overnment partners bout what constituted critical asset cast doubt on the valid ity and completeness of that list32 for example among electric utilities there was some question as to why certain assets were considered critical by iaip since some of t hose assets were not in use and others did not support significant electric loads33 similar inconsistencies emerged when iaips list was compared to critical asset lists developed by state agencies as the assistant secretary for infrastructure protection in dhs testified befo re congress what we have done to identify critical assets in the united states and what the states and local municipalities and c ities have done ofte n do not reconcile34 according to press accounts subsequent classified briefings with members of cong ress to review lists of critical assets in their st ates have continued to raise concerns about iaips critical asset identification35httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32631crs14 36 for additional

infrastructure protec tion although the commission discussed in more detail issues related to transportation secur ity none of its recommendations advocate change in the direction of or the organi zational structures th at have evolved to implement existing infrastructure protection policies nevertheless the commissions recommendations could speed up implementation in some areas given the attention nd renewed urgency expr essed by the commission36 policy issues the us governments definition of critical infrastructure has evolved over the years and at any given time has left considerable room for interpretation furthermore since the 1980s the number of sectors included under that definition has generally expanded from the most basi c public works to much broader set of economic defense government social and institutional facilities as illustrated in table 3 the list may continue to evolve and grow as economic changes or geopolitical developments influence homeland security policy should congress care if the overall list of critical infrastructures remains fluid one concern is that an unclear or unstabl understanding of what constitutes critical infrastructure or key resource could lead to inefficient security policies at the very least growing list of infrastructures in need of protection implies growing attention from the federal government and implicitly need for more resources devoted to protect them under the homeland security act and other legi slation the federal government is required to interact with each critical infrastructure to support and maintain database of vulnerabilities to integrate the database with threat analyses to monitor incidents on each of the infrastructures and to issue warnings as appropriate these activities call for time and resources the federal government also may choose to assist fi nancially in effecting nece ssary protective measures not only for infrastructure owned and operated at the state or local level but also for privately owned and operated infrastructures allocating limited public resources across an excessively broad range of infrastructures may be an inefficient use of resources however arb itrarily limiting the num ber of critical infrastructures priori due to resource constraints might miss dangerous vulnerabilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32631 crs15 table 3 critical infrastructure

criteria for identifying individual critical assets and key assets may also lead to protection ineffici encies especially where private companies are responsible for security spending these criteria may become particularly important if federal agencies intend to implement and enforce any potential future security regulations related to critical infrastructure various private sector representatives state that they need clear and stable definitions of asset criticality so they will know exactly what assets to protect and how well to protect them otherwise they risk protecting too many facilities protecting the wrong facilities or both either outcome would increase ultimate costs passed through to consumers without commensurate security benefits nd could potentially divert scarce private resources from better uses such as public safety or envir onmental protection as oversight of the federal role in infrastructure security continues questions may be raised concerning the ongoing effo rts of dhs to define and priortize critical and key assets in addition to this specific issue however congress may wish to assess how critical infrastructure identification fits in the nations overall strategy to protect critical infrastructure for example if asset criticality is not clearly defined increasing resources for infrastructure secur ity inspections by dhs officials could be of limited value likewise diverting infrastructure resources away from safety to enhance security might further reduce terror risk but not overall pub lic risk if safety programs become less effective as result us infrastructure security necessarily involves many groups federal agencies indus try associations rge and small asset operators and critical and noncritical sset owners reviewing how these groups work together to achieve common security goals is an oversight challenge for congress
