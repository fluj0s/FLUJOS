linda levine domestic social policy division january 23 2008 abstract the amount of education in which individuals invest greatly inﬂuences their labor market outcomes for example highly educated workers on average are better paid than other workers fouryear college graduates also are less at risk of unemployment if they should lose their jobs these displaced workers are more likely than others to ﬁnd new jobs the importance of educational attainment to earnings levels has grown over time as well concern about the extent of wage inequality in us society arose in part because of the comparatively large increases in real inﬂationadjusted earnings of workers with at least bachelors degreehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs227921 for information on societal benefits see crs report rl33238 the benefits of education by linda levine order code rs22792 january 23 2008 education matters earnings and employment outcomes by educational attainment linda levine specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division summary the amount of education in which individua ls invest greatly influences their labor market outcomes for example highly edu cated workers on average are better paid than other workers fouryear college graduate s also are less at risk of unemployment if they should lose their jobs these displaced workers are more likely than others to find new jobs the importance of educational ttainment to earnings levels has grown over time as well concern about the extent of wa ge inequality in us society arose in part because of the comparatively large increases in real inflationadjusted earnings of workers with at least bachelors degree the benefits of greater educational attainment that accrue to individuals are both monetary eg higher earning s and nonmonetary eg better health the benefits of additional years of schooling extend beyond individuals and their families these societal benefits also are of pecuniary eg gr eater economic growth and nonpecuniary eg increased civic involvement nature partly because of the spillover of benefits from individuals to society congress has enacted measures to encourage more of the nations population to enroll in postsecondary educationa l institutions eg pell grants education tax provisions this report focuses specifically on differences over time in selected labor market outcomes of individuals associat ed with their educational attainment1 earnings workers with more education historica lly have had higher annual earnings on average than workers with less education in 2006 the latest year for which data are available worker with bachelors degree earned almost three times more than worker who had not graduated from high school 56788 and 20873 respectively as alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22792crs2 can be seen from the columns labeled current dollars in table 1 the importance of educational attainment to earnings has incr eased over the years the wage premium of workers with bachelors degree compared to workers with some college courses or an associate degree grew by 13 percentage points from 51 on average in the first seven years of the 1980s to 64 on average in the first seven years of the 2000s the payoff to graduating as opposed to not graduating fro m high school similarly increased by 14 percentage points from an average of 33 in the earlier period to 47 thus far in the current decade the wage gap between workers with postsec ondary education short of fouryear college degree and high school gr aduates also widened but by less than 4 percentage points from 10 on aver age in 19801986 to under 14 in 20002006 table 1 average earnings of workers 18 years or older by highest level of educational attainment 1980 to 2006 rall

of living increase over the years but their wages have been more insulated from rising prices the greater their educational attainment the growth in earnings of indi viduals who did not gr aduate from high school just slightly outpaced the rise in the c onsumer price index between 1986 and 2006 which would have increased their purchasing power by 1210 the real inflationadjusted value of wages paid to workers with high school diploma or some college or associate degree held up much better against price incr eases over the 20year period they could have bought an additional 4533 nd 4684 respectively in goods and services bachelors degree holders fared the best the purchasing power of their 2006 paychecks was 10256 greater than their 1986 paychecks see columns labeled 2006 dollars in table 1 the real average annual earnings of f ouryear college graduates grew very substantially and fairly stead ily through the mid1990s while those of workers with high school degree or less rose slightly or fell this disparate pattern sparked still ongoing concern about the extent of wa ge inequality in us society2 although the real wages of college graduates have continued to increase in the last 10 or so years the earnings trend of less educated workers has improved as result the premium paid to workers with bachelors degree has been rising more slowly in recent years the annual earnings differences by level of educati on presented in table 1 can be expected to produce even larger disparities after years spent in the labor force according to 2002 census bureau study high school dropouts employed fulltime yearround ie at least 35 hours week at least 50 weeks year over 40year working life might earn total of 10 million in 1999 dollars similarl employed high school graduates might earn 12 million and those with some college c ourses or an associate degree might earn 1516 million college graduates employed fulltime yearround throughout their working lives were estimated to earn considerably more 21 million on average3 employment as educational atta inment increases the likelihood of unemployment decreases in 2006 for example the unemployment rate of workers age 25 and older was 68 if they lacked high school diploma 43 if they we re high school graduate s 36 if they took some postsecondary courses or obt ained an associate degree nd 20 if they had at

unemployment and wage inflation frbsf economic review 2007 note the unemployment rate of workers without hi gh school diploma compared to the overall unemployment rate worsened markedly between 1978 and 2000 but has since shown some improvement 6 bls defines displaced worker as someone who loses job held for at least three years because of plant closings or moves insufficient work or abolition of

2016 monthly labor review november 2007a bachelors degree4 unlike the previously examined increase over time in the educational wage premium relative unemployment rates by educational attainment generally have been stable since 19785 the risk of displacement is lower and the likelihood of reemployment is higher for longtenured workers with at least bach elors degree compared to other workers6 workers with fouryear college degree or mo re were laid off from longheld jobs at belowaverage rate from the late 1990s to the mid2000s while the displacement rate of workers with high school diploma or less usually equaled the average rate workers with more years of schooling who were displaced from fulltime jobs had higher rate of reemployment in fulltime jobs than displaced workers with fewer years of education for example 72 of workers with an advanced degree and 63 of workers with bachelors degree displaced from fulltime jobs in the january 2003 to december 2005 period were reemployed in fulltime jobs in january 2006 comparable reemploy ment rates were 57 among displaced high school graduates nd 39 among displaced workers who did not enter or complete high school the us bureau of labor statistics bls projects that employment in occupations typically requiring at leas t bachelors degree will increase by 153 between 2006 and 2016 well above the allo ccupations average of 105 the nearly five million new jobs estimated to be available to persons with at least fou ryear college degree could account for almost onethird of all jobs projected to be added to the economy in the tenyear period many of the estimate d five million new jobs are in professional occupations some professional specialties computer software engineers applications computer systems analysts and network systems and da ta communications analysts elementary and postsecondary school teachers and accountants and auditors not only are projected to be among the fastest growing fields but so among those adding the largest number of positions through 2016 occupations that usually require little or postsecondary education are projected to grow at comparatively slow rate but these less skilled comparatively lowpaying jobs eg retail salespersons food pr eparation and serving workers general office cl erks home health aides nonetheless rank among those estimated to experience the largest numerical increases in employment between 2006 and 20167
