markets be competitive or that they contain some predetermined number of participantscompetitors it is concerned rather with the operation of markets on the assumption that properly functioning market ie one in which there is an opportunity for viable competition and is not skewed by the predatory actions of participants will best protect consumers monopoly and monopolist are therefore merely descriptive terms used to illustrate situations in which single entity or group of entities possesses effective control of the market in which it operates neither term implies anything about the lawfulness of the monopoly possessed monopolization on the other hand is the term used in antitrust law to characterize as unlawful situation in which monopolistirrespective of whether his monopoly has been lawfully achieve dcouples his monopoly status with behavior designed to unfairly exploit maintain or enhance his market position similarly attempted monopolizationconnotes situation in which an entity unlawfully or unfairly attempts to secure market monopoly the longstanding judicially created rule of reason which involves balancing an anticompetitive action with any procompetitive results underscores those facts whether market participant who is monopolist must deal with anyone who desires to deal with it continues to be largely governed by the socalled colgate doctrine in 1919 in united states v colgate co 250 us 300 the supreme court recognized the unfettered right of private vendor to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal colgate notwithstanding the existence of an essential facility ie necessary component of potential competitors business and which is both unavailable from any source other than the alleged monopolist and cannot be reasonably duplicated once established has generally been thought to impose duty to deal with the actual or potential competitors of even lawful monopolist the continuing viability of the socalled essential facilities doctrine however was called into question by the supreme courts 2004 ruling in verizon v trinko 540 us 398 the antitrust division of the department of justice doj and the federal trade commission ftc each operate on the assumption that the monopoly status of competitors is antitrust relevant only insofar as their actions may impact the operation or competitiveness of

holds that robust competition will best protect consumers it is concerned with the viability of individual competitors only insofar as their fates affect marketplace competitiveness1 there is neither an arbitrary antitrust directive concerning the requisite amount of competition deemed acceptable in any given market nor any predetermination of the point beyond which market participant may grow nor is there any absolute number of competitors market participant must face although there are general prohibitions against monopolization and attempted monopolization in the sherman 2 and clayton acts3 and prohibition against unfair acts in commerce in section 5 of the federal trade commission act4 monopoly and monopolist are merely descriptive terms used to illustrate situation in which single entity possesses effective control of the market in which it operates neither term implies anything about the lawfulness of the monopoly possessed there is concept of fault monopolization in united states antitrust law 5 absent finding by court of guilty behavior by monopolist6 therefore there can be finding of monopolization further the antitrust rule of reason has modified the concept of competition by recognizing that in certain situations the anticompetitiveness of some actions must be balanced against any procompetitive effects that might be produced by those actions 7 accordingly any assessment of whether any of the prohibitions against monopolization have been violated requires two inquiries first it must be determined whether an entity is in fact monopolist8 and second whether that monopolist has unlawfully monopolized the markets within which it operates the applicable relevant market which may be either product or geographically based or both assuming that market participant has been lega lly determined to be monopolist as opposed to being so determined by reference to the popular definitionie one who possesses at least 51 market share the question arises does that monopoly entity have legal obligation to 1 the purpose of the sherman act is not to protect businesses from the working of the market it is to protect the public from the failure of the market the law directs itself not against conduct which is competitive even severely so but against conduct which unfairly tends to destroy compe tition itself it does so not out of solicitude for private concerns but out of concern for the public interest spectrum sports inc v mcquillan 506 us 447 458 1993 2 15 usc 17 specifically 15 usc 2 3 15 usc 1227 specifically 18 4 15 usc 45 5 ie there is bright

discussion of some doj and ftc enforcement activities that underscore the monopoly byitselfisnotunlawful notion 6 examples of guilty behavior include eg predatory pricing or tying the purchase of an

it was most clearly enunciated in 1918 in board of trade of the city of chicago v united states 246 us 321 238 1918 see notes 21 and 22 infra and associated text 8 monopoly power has since at least

have generally answered no9 but the situation long thought to create such an obligationmonopolist ownership or control of an essential facility10is currently not as settled as was once thought in 2004 the supreme court opined that we have never recognized such doctrine and we find need either to recognize it or to repudiate it here11 the recent prosecutions by the antitrust division of the department of justice microsoft and the federal trade commission intel both discussed below are particularly illustrative of the monopolymonopolization dichotomy

law they are not synonymous shorthand definition of monopoly is the power to control prices or exclude competition 12 the significance of the ability to exclude competition or control prices however lies in the supposed deleterious effect of the lack of competition on consumers who are presumed to benefit from the existence of largely competitive markets the impact on excluded competitors is relevant only insofar as it affects the fate of competition the antitrust injury requirement obligates complainants to demonstrate as threshold matter that the challenged conduct has had an actual adverse effect on competition as whole in the relevant market to prove it has been harmed as an individual competitor will not suffice 13 it is axiomatic that the antitrust laws were passed for the protection of competition not competitors 14 9 despite the generally recognized evils of monopoly power it is well settled see j von kalinowski antitrust laws trade regulation 8023 at 841 1979 that 2 does not prohibit monopoly simpliciter or as the supreme court phrased it in the early landmark case of standard oil co of new jersey 221 us at 62 monopoly in the concrete berkey photo inc v eastman

law15 and courts have differed over the years since the passage of the sherman act in 1890 as to the size of the market share that must be attributable to given market participant in order to accurately label the participant monopolist16 absent finding by court of guilty behaviortherefore there can be automatic finding of monopolization based merely on finding of monopoly power finding of monopoly power does not by itself necessarily equate to finding of the monopolization prohibited by either section 7 of the clayton act or section 2 of the sherman act or the unfair practices prohibited by section 5 of the ftc act17 the point that monopoly or size does not equate to unlawful monopolization was made in 1998 by the assistant attorney general antitrust division sometimes people complain about merger solely based on its size i want to make clear however that antitrust analysis focuses on the specific competitive harms that may be associated with particular merger not on its size in the abstract thus for example big merger may not be challenged because the merging parties are not competitors or potential competitors of one another and the merger does not raise any vertical antitrust issues at the same time we may challenge smaller merger that involves the only two firms that make particular product the key for our review is whether the merger will harm consumers not the sheer size of the corporate entities involved 18 g25g145g138g157g561g157g145g142g561g3g151g157g146g157g155g158g156g157g561g14g138g160g156g561g18g155g152g145g146g139g146g157g561 as noted above both the sherman and clayton ac ts contain absolute prohibitions only against monopolization and attempted monopolization section 2 of the sherman act makes it felony for any person to monopolize or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire with any other person to monopolize interstate commerce section 7 of the clayton act the socalled antimerger provision prohibits mergers or acquisitions by persons engaged in interstate commerce the effect may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create monopoly19 15 the industrial reorganization act s 1167 93d cong introduced by senator philip hart would have created rebuttable presumption that monopoly power existed whenever eg there was either 1 lack of substantial price competition among two or more corporations for specified 3year period or 2 f our or fewer corporations accounting for 50 or more of sales in any line of commerce in any section of the country secs 101b23 the bill would also have placed on the corporations found to possess m onopoly power except in cases in which such power was the result of lawfully obtained patents the burden of proving to an industrial reorganization court that such power should not be divested sec 101c 16 90 of market supply is enough to constitute monopoly it is doubtful whether sixty or sixtyfour percent would be enough and certainly thirtythree percent is not alcoa 148 f2d 416 424 2d cir 1945 the court was commenting on the various ways in which the market control exercised by alcoa could be and had been calculated by the district court the

used in 1911 by the supreme court in standard oil co of new jersey v united states20 modifies the apparent inflexibility of the prohibitions in those provisions the doctrine recognizes that in certain circumstances adhering to the letter of the law concerning monopolization would be unreasonable21 and that the anticompetitiveness of some actions must be balanced against any procompetitive effects that might be produced by those actions22

market entity is considered monopolist or whether it can be successfully charged with either having attempted to monopolize market or actively monopolizing market depends on the definition of the market in which it operates defendant facing charge of attempted monopolization would prefer to have the relevant product market andor the relevant geographic market defined broadly if he can include several interchangeable substitutes for his product its and therefore his proportion of that product market will be calculated differently than if the product market is confined to only his product or his product and merely few alternatives similarly the more expansive the definition of the geographic market within which the alleged monopolist is operating the less likely it is that he will be seen to control sufficiently large portion of it to justify determination of monopolist or finding of attempted monopolization and as was noted earlier there can be automatic finding of monopolization based merely on finding of monopoly power moreover the fact that trademarked or patented product gives the owner lawful monopoly over that product may not suffice to justify determination that he is monopolist in given market 23 20 221 us 1 1911 21 the legality of an agreement or regulation cannot be determined by so simple test as whether it restrains competition every agreement concerning trade every regulation of trade restrains to bind to restrain is of their very essence the true test of legality is whether the restrain t imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition to determine that question the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the bu siness to which the restraint is applied its condition before and after the restraint was imposed the nature of the restraint and its effect actual or probable the history of the restraint the evil believed to exist the reason for adoptin g the particular remedy the purpose or end sought to be attained are all relevant facts board of trade v united states 246 us 321 238 1918 22 the doctrine which is used as an alternative means of evaluating the antitrust lawfulness of challenged activities is employed only where the action in question is not automatically prohibited as per violation of the antitrust laws price fixing eg is per violation that can never be saved from illegality by any attempt to describe the price fixing as reasonable see eg united states v trenton potteries 273 us 392 397 1927 the power to fix prices whether reasonably exercised or not involves power to control the market and to fix arbitrary and unreasonable price united states v soconyvacuum oil co 310 us 150 217 1940 for over forty years this court has consistently and without deviation adhered to the principle that pricefixing agreements are unlawful per under the sherman act and that showing of socalled competitive abuses or evils which those agreements were designed to eliminate or alleviate may be interposed as defense arizona v maricopa medical society 557 us 332 34855 1982attempt by medical society to keep floorunder medical

earlier the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in case decided upon transfer from supreme court25 on the way to noting that the way in which market share was calculated mattered

law the enactment of the sherman act in 1890 the concept of the socalled essential facilities doctrine has been developing courts have rather consistently held that monopolist who controls an instrumentality that is crucial to the ability of potential competitor to compete and which cannot be reasonably duplicated by the potential competitor must make that facility available to him perhaps the most well known essential facilities case is united states v terminal railroad association in which access to the only terminal in st louis that could reasonably accommodate rail traffic to the west was required to be made available to potential competitors of the railroads who jointly owned the terminal48 the concept of an essential facility was determinative when in 1985 the court required the owner of three of four skiing mountains to continue allowing the owner of the fourth mountain to jointly market access to all four mountains49 as the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit explained in mci communications corp v att case that required tt to grant connection to its telephone lines in order to allow mci to compete in the longdistance telephone business monopolists refusal to deal under these circumstances the requested access was both technically and economically feasible is governed by the socalled essential facilities doctrine such refusal may be unlawful becau monopolists control of an essential facility sometimes especially in telecommunications law called bottleneck point through which everything destined for specific point must pass can extend monopoly power from one stage of production to another and from one market into another thus the antitrust laws have imposed on firms controlling an essential facility the obligation to make the

the 1992 jointly issued horizontal merger guidelines59 make clear that the monopolymonopolization dichotomy is key enforcement concept the guidelines were promulgated in order to inform the business co mmunity of the agencies doj ftc governing philosophy and analytical framework when they are reviewing the permissibility of proposed mergers but they afford good view of the agencies overall thinking about antitrust culpability the purpose and underlying policy assumptions section of the introduction states unequivocally that mergers should not be permitted to create or enhance market power or to facilitate its exercise it goes on to note however that while competitively harmful mergers will be challenged there is larger universe of mergers that is either competitively beneficial or neutral 60 we earlier quoted an assistant attorney general to the effect that competitive harm rather than size is the determinative element in decision on reviewed merger61 two relatively recent cases clearly illustrate the antitrust enforcement agencies differentiation between the existence of monopoly power and active monopolization the department of justice suit against microsoft62 and the ftcs complaint against intel63 in microsoft the antitrust division stated that microsoft possesses and for several years has possessed monopoly power in the market for personal computer operating systems64 the doj action however was filed not to challenge microsofts monopoly status but rather the companys actions to protect its valuable and presumably lawful windows monopoly against potential competitive threats and to extend its operating system monopoly into other software markets microsoft has engaged in series of anticompetitive activ ities microsofts conduct includes agreements tying other microsoft software products to microsofts windows operating system 65 exclusionary agreements precluding companies or potential competitors 59 the guidelines were issued in 1962 by the antitrust division and revised in 1982 and 1984 they were substantially modified and issued jointly by doj and the ftc 1992 and revised by the agencies in 1997 the 1984 version indicated that the department would consider foreign as well as domestic competition in determining the geographic market for the products or services of potential merger 234 the 1992 version states that the unifying theme of the guidelines is that mergers should not be permitted to create or enhance market power or to facilitate its exercise 01 the 1997 revision dealt only with the agencies treatment of the socalled efficiency defense merger that is on balance anticompetitive will not generally be saved by claimed or actual efficiencies nor likely be approved by the reviewing agencies 4 although the guidelines are not binding on either the antitrust division or the ftc or for that matter the courts they are indicative of the ag encies thinking with respect to the competitive concerns inherent in all market transactions 60 merger guidelines 01 61 see footnote 18 and associated text 62 united states v microsoft civil action 981232 filed in the united states district court for the district of columbia on

microsofts software competitors or potential competitors and exclusionary agreements restricting the right of companies to provide services or resources to microsofts software competitors or potential competitors 66 in the charges against intel corporation by the ftc the commission acted to restrain the pattern of conduct that violates section 5 of the federal trade commission act 15 usc 4567 and not because of intels acknowledged monopoly status68 as monopolist intel can compete by producing better cheaper and more attractive products it cannot act to cement its monopoly pow er by preventing other firms from challenging its dominance intel has acted illegally it has used its monopoly power to impede innovation and stifle competition by denying necessary technical information to certain customers in retaliation for their suits against intel to enforce their the customers patents allegedly infringed by intel 69 g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 judicial determination of monopoly status for market participant says nothing concerning the lawfulness of the monopoly enjoyed at most monopoly status indicates that the monopolist possesses sufficient market power to control prices or exclude competition but such determination does not automatically create an obligation on the part of the monopolist to deal at all or fairlywith other entities in the ma rket or with consumers that obligation may be created only by further finding either that th monopolist has achieved his monopoly position in violation of the prohibitions against monopoliza tion or attempted monopolization in the sherman or clayton antitrust acts or the prohibition against unfair practices in the federal trade commission act ie possesses an unlawful monopoly or that he has unlawfully exploited even lawfully obtained monopoly position or both in other words monopolists guilty behavior is what creates monopolization violation of the antitrust laws not his status as monopolist the duty to deal with actual or potential competitors of lawful monopolist who has not been found to have engaged in some guilty behavior is generally governed by the colgate doctrine which gives market participants the right to choose their commercial relationships that right however has been thought to have been circumscribed by what has become known as the essential facilities doctrine it stands for the proposition that monopolist who possesses or controls necessary component of an actual or potential competitors business must make it continued requires that there be two separate productseach or either capable of being purchased separately by consumer but also defendant with monopoly power in the market for the tying product lack of choice for the consumer and foreclosure of substantial volume of commerce tying is most generally analyzed as per violation of the antitrust laws although when court has failed to find the requisite separate products rule of reason analysis has been

obtainedat all or only at prohibitive expense in verizon communications inc v trinko however the supreme court questioned the validity of the essential facilities doctrine in antitrust lawat least in the context of regulated entities when regulated entity violates regulatory statute that compels the sharing of specifically named facilities the court said there is not also an automatic antitrust violation without finding that that behavior would have violated someth ing in the antitrust lawswith or without the existence of the statutory requirement 70

present case does not fit within the limited exception recognized in aspen skiing co v aspen highlands skiing corp 472 us 585 1985 the complaint does not allege that verizon voluntarily engaged in course of dealing with its rivals or would ever have done so absent statutory compulsion here therefore the defendants prior conduct sheds light upon the motiv ation of its refusal to dealupon whether its regulatory lapses were prompted not by competitive zeal but by an ticompetitive malice the contrast between the cases is heightened by the difference in pricing behavior in aspen skiing the defendant turned down proposal to sell at its own retail price suggesting calculation that its future mono poly retail price would be higher verizons reluctance to interconnect at the costbased rate of compensation available under 251c3 of the 1996 telecommunications act tells us nothing about dreams of monopoly the specific nature of what the 1996 act compels makes this case different from aspen skiing in more fundamental way in aspen skiing what the defendant refused to provide to its competitor was product that it already sold at retailto oversimplify slightly lift tickets representing bundle of services to skiers in the present case by contrast the services allegedly withheld are not otherwise marketed or available to the public the sharing obligation imposed by the 1996 act created something brand newthe wholesale market for leasing network elements we do not believe that traditional antitrust principles jus tify adding the present case to the few exceptions from the proposition that there is duty to aid competitors 540 us at 409410 411
