been amended on number of occasions since its enactment the most salie nt of the modifications has been as result of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 pl 99177 also known

procedure set forth in section 310 of the congressional budget act first used in 1980 reconciliation is twostep process triggered when the budget resolution includes instructions to one or more committees directing them to recommend changes in revenue or spending laws necessary to achieve the overall levels agreed to the recommendations are then considered in one or more reconciliation measures under expedited procedures certain features of the reconc iliation process are enforced by points of order that are included in this report for more on the reconciliation process generally see crs report rl33030 the budget reconciliation process house and senate procedures by robert keith and bill heniff jrpoints of order in the congressional budget process introduction the congressional budget act of 19741 established the basic framework that is used today for congressional considera tion of budget and fiscal policy the act provided for the adoption of concurrent resolution on the budget budget resolution as mechanism for coordinating congre ssional budgetary decision making this process supplements other house and sena procedures for considering spending and revenue legislation by allowing congress to establish and enforce parameters with which those separate pieces of budgetar legislation must be consistent the parameters are established each year wh congress adopts the budget resolution setting forth overall levels for new budget au thority outlays reve nues deficit and debt these overall spending levels are then allocated to the various committees in the house and senate responsible for spending legislati on the overall levels and allocations are then enforced through th use of points of order and through implementing legislation such as that enacted through the reconciliation process2 points of order are prohibitions against cer tain types of legisl ation or congressional actions these prohibitions are enforced when member raises point or order against legislation that is alleged to violate these rules when it is considered by the house or senate points of order are not selfenforcing point of order must be raised by member on the floor of the chamber before the presiding officer can rule on its application and thus for its enforcementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97865crs2 3 for example the prohibition against motions to recommit concurrent resolutions on the budget in the house under section 305a2 of the act is typically not counted as separate point of order likewise the requirement under section 308a of the act for reports on legislation to include cost estimates is not form ulated as point of or der although the house has deemed it necessary to formally waive the provision on occasion 4 the expiration of the provisions of the ba lanced budget and emergency deficit control act at the end of fy2002 has rendered moot number of points of order for example points of order provided in the congressional budget act to allow the senate to enforce discretionary spending limits section 312b or maximum deficit amounts section 312c have been rendered moot because statute currently specifies such limit or amount although the congressional budget pro cess encompasses myriad procedures dealing with spending reve nue and debt legislation th is paper focuses only on that portion of the process that stems from th congressional budget act the tables below list the points of order currently in cluded in the congressional budget act table 1 as well as related points of order established in other measures these other measures include the fy2009 budget resolution table 2 the fy2008 budget resolution table 3 hres 6 110th congress adopting the rules of the house for the 110th congress table 4 and the budget enforcement act of 1990 table 5 that pertain to the consideration c ontents or implementation of the budget resolution points of order are typically in the form of provision stating that it shall not be in order for the house or senate to take specified action or consider certain legislation that is inconsistent with the requirements of the budget act other provisions of the act form ulated differently estab lish various requirements or procedures particularly concerning the contents and consideration of the budget resolution or reconc iliation legislation these provi sions however are not typically enforced through points of orde r and are not included here3 as amended through the balanced budg et act of 1997 points of order in the congressional budget act are permanent none of the provisions listed in table 1 is scheduled to expire lthough several points of orde r have limited applicability or have been rendered moot by the expiration of limits they were intended to enforce4 the freestanding point of order protecting th social security trust fund in the house established in the budget enforcement act table 5 is also permanent however other points of order established under recen t budget resolutions have various sunset provisions or limited application see table 2 and table 3 for current examples application of points of order most points of order in the budget act pply to measures as whole as well as to motions amendments or conference repor ts to those measures when point of order is sustained against consideration of some matter the effect is that the matter in question falls the application of points of order in the house is clarified in section 315 of the budget act this provision states that for cases in which reported measure ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97865crs3 5 section 313d provides special procedure for further consideration of measure should point of order under this section be sustai ned against provision in conference reportconsidered pursuant to special rule point of order against bill as reported would apply to the text made in order by the rule as original text for the purpose of amendment or to the text on which the pr evious question is ordered directly to passage in this way point of order would be considered as applying and waiver would be required if substitute resolved the problem in addition the rules of the house for the 110th congress include provisi on further specifying that for measure considered pursuant to sp ecial rule points of order under title iii of the budget act apply regardless of whether the measure considered is actually reported from committee under rule xxi clause 8 points of order apply to the form of measure recommended by the reporting committee where the statute uses the term as reported in the case of measure that has been reported the form of the measure made in order as an original text for the purpose of amendment or the form of the measure on which the previous question is ordered di rectly to passage the effect of point of order in th senate is clarif ied under section 312f which provides that when point of order against measure is sustained the measure is recommitted to the appropriate co mmittee for any furt her considerati on this allows the senate an opportunity to reme dy the problem that caused the point of order section 312d is also designed to provide the senate with the opportunity to remedy problem that would provoke point of order this provision states that point of order may not be raised ag ainst measure amendment motion or conference report while an amendment or motion that would remedy the problem is pending section 312e clarifies that any point of order that would apply in the senate against an amendment also applies ag ainst amendments between the houses further this section also states that the effect would be the same as if the senate had disagreed to the amendment this woul d allow the senate to keep the underlying measure pending and thus retain the ability to resolve their differences with the house this provision therefore means that any resolution of the differences between the house and senatepassed versions of measure whether it is in the form of conference report or not mu st adhere to the provisions of the budget act there are exceptions to the general princi ple of applying points of order to measure as whole the most salient is probably section 313 the socalled byrd rule this section applies to matter contained in any title or provision in reconciliation bill or resolution or conference report thereon as well as any amendment or motion if point of orde r is sustained under this section only the provision in question is stricken or the amendment or motion falls5 several of the points of order in the senate establishe d under recent budget resolutions have been written so that they apply to individual provisions rather than the measure as whole in the manner provided in section 313e of the budget act the point of order against emergency spending designations section 204a5 of sconres 21 110th congress further provides that if sustained the effect of this point of order is that provision making an emergency designa tion shall be stricken and may not be offered as an amendment from the floorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97865crs4 6 in the case of points of order under secti on 313 of the budget act and by extension points of order under secti on 204 of sconres 21 110th congress and section 313 of sconres 70 110th congress as well as points of order under section 314 of sconres 70 110th congress single point of order may be raised against several provisions the presiding officer may sustain the point of order as to some or all of the provisions and motion to waive the point of order may likewis be made concerning some or all of the provisions against which the point of order was raised 7 as originally provided in title x of th balanced budget act of 1997 the threefifths requirement expired on september 30 2002 the senate subsequently adopted sres 304 on october 16 2002 renewing the threefifths re quirement for all of the points of order identified in section 904c 2 except for section 302f2b through april 15 2003 the threefifths requirement including for section 302f2b was renewed through september 30 2008 under section 503 of hconres 95 108th congress extended through september 30 2010 under ction 403 of hconres 95 109th congress and is currently extended through september 30 2017 under section 205 of sconres 21 110th congressprocedures for waiving points of order the congressional budget act sets fort h certain procedures under section 904 for waiving points of order under the act these waiver procedures apply in the senate only under these procedures senator may make motion to waive the application of point of orde r either preemptively before it can be raised or after it is raised but before the presiding officer rules on its merits6 in the senate most points of order unde r the budget act may be waived by vote of at least threefifths of all senators duly chosen and sworn 60 votes if there are vacancies see table 1 the threefifths waiv er requirement was first established for some points of order unde r the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 beginning w ith the balanced budget act of 1997 this supermajority threshold wa s applied to seve ral additional point s of order on temporary basis these points of order are identified in section 904c2 and the threefifths requirement is currently scheduled to expire september 30 20177 the threefifths threshold has so been required for the senate to waive the application of many of the points of order establishe d in recent budget resolutions such as the paygo point of order as with other provi sions of senate rule s budget act points of order also may be waiv ed by unanimous consent in the house budget act points of orde r are typically waived by the adoption of special rules although other means s uch as unanimous consent or suspension of the rules may also be used waiver may be used to protect bill specified provisions in bill or an amendment from point of order that could be raised against it waivers may be granted for one or more amendments even if they are not granted for the underlying bill the house may waive the application of one or more specific points of order or they may include blanket waiver that is waiver that would protect bill provision or amendment from any
