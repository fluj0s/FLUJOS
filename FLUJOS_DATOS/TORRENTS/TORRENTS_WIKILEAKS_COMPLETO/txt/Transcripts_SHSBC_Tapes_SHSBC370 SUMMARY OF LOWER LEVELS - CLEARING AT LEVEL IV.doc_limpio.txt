summary of lower levelsclearing at level iv lecture given on 10 march 1964 well im glad to see you looking so well whats the date audience march the 10th march the 10th ah well 10 march ad 14 saint hill special briefing course and you today are going to hear summary of lower levels and clearing at level iv in which you will be very interested indeed now ive been beating my brains outnot being inside them its fairly painless activitytrying to find out how howhaving shot the moon we got our feet back on the ground now there has to be some bridge between 0 and v obviously v is becoming the catchall level by which the individual picks up and refines all of his knowledge of the mind and so forth in order to kick off into the astronomic altitudes of vi we have made the gun in vi thatsthats there in fact i dont know of anything very much you have to do in vi welltrained this is very easy untrained its impossible see and so having shot the moon whats that leave you well its i think alexander an oldtime enemy of mineevery once in while somebody comes along and says im alexander the great dont you see or something like that or i was alexander the great something like that they dont quite realize the hair going up on the back of my neck dont you see because he got to point where he had more worlds to conquer thats the traditional contribution of alexander the great to literature in history and he had more worlds to conquer dont you see well thats great but he might have figured out how you got from greece to india when he got to india there were more worlds to conquer thats for sure but had he conquered anything from greece to india that was the question and he went and sat down in royal palaces of satrap and pined away hadnt realized that he in actual fact had not conquered up to the point where he had more worlds to conquer because that empire fell apart like bunch of confetti at wedding and it was gone and in the dust in very short order why well there was way to get from india to greece or from greece to india thats the fact so he never made any bridge he not only had more worlds to conquer he hadnt conquered the one he was living in so were in danger of getting up to the esoteric levels of vi and looking around and realizing we had more worlds to conquer and that leaves thirty or forty of us as ots and thats it thats the end of the push dont you see in the first place you cant take somebody off the street up here and say all right this is the way you go about it you do this list see and you take the meter and when you get rocket reads and so on why you null that thing out and then you plot that on goals plot as the actual gpm and so forth and then you do its opposite and so forth and then you add twentyone and so on and thats all there is to it and im afraid about this time hed be standing there with his jaw dropped scientology progresses on reality hes not in position to recognize any part of an actual gpm and so hes really not about to get any reality on scientology so the lower levels is the contest of achievement of reality its not really the contest of making somebody better its the contest of achieving the stepping stones of reality of course at level 0 youre taking somebody who doesnt even know the worlds here reminds of the position i was in when i was fourfive in this lifetime and i used to look around this great bowl of the hills up in the rockies and in dim sort of cavedin way wonder wonder if there was anything beyond those hills dont you see very dim wonder not sure not sure justjust wondering and thats all very well but so is this guy he looks at his kitchen and at the environment of the job where he works and the wrath of the boss and the inclement weather of his wife and its like looking at this bowl of hills you see is there anything beyond this see and he isnt at all sure that there is well unless you can show him theres something beyond that hes never going to take any step further youve left him in that little depression of hills and that is that how do you walk him out of there how do you get him from that point to some other point so that he can take off because believe he must be walked from point of recognition of reality to point of some recognition of reality before he can take off to an ultimate reality its done by gradients one of the oldest tricks that we have and its quite peculiar to dianetics and scientologythe idea of gradient doing it little bit at time you jump too big step in gradient and person goes unreal now i was studying unreality the other day and i found out that unreality was associated with charge charge and unreality are the same thing they are the same if you overburden somebody too heavily with bunch of suppresses and that sort of thing he is incapable of understanding an ri be perfectly obvious rithe auditor sitting there does to be hungry bring about to eat see and the auditors looking at this hah bvo ba of course to be hungry brings about to eat yeah so what and the pc now has invalidations suppress overcharge hes sitting in the middle of the rat race and so forth and he says well to be hungry well to eat hmmm well let see let say that over again to myself would to be hungry bring abouti dont know lets see to be hungry wand so on so on wildest thing you ever wanted to see now you get the suppresses and the invalidates off of these things and all of sudden why he saysyou know you get it straightened up get the burden off of itand he says well to be hungry bring about to eat i mean thats whats so hard to understand about that but just couple of moments before by reason of overcharge in other words too muchtoo much charge too heavily burdenedhes fellow with ton of coal sitting on his head dont you see and youre asking him to look around and see the environment and of course he cant see out through ton of coal you move the ton of coal and he says theres an environment see its very funny i mean because you can take the pattern items at level vi and just throw your session ruds out badly on them and the pc wont understand them its an interesting clinical study of understanding understanding then is directly related to charge and person who has too much charge on his case cant understand therefore he doesnt have any reality so an overcharged individual is incapable of achieving reality and reality is necessary to the understanding and gradient steps that he has to take in order to go totally free now do you see what binds him in overcharge his wifes always yapping and yowling at him or her husband is always yapping and yowling at her dont you see here weve got yap and yowl and weve got this and weve got this and weve got worries and so forth and all of that sort of thing and finally people under those circumstances will do the stupidest things see because their environments too heavily charged its the actual active environment in which they live its too heavily charged and they cant understand beyond that point their understanding is swamped and of course they dont understand it either they dont even understand they have wife or husband it gets down to that point what is wife they will go around mutter mutter mutter to themselves you see what is wife what is man you know mutter mutter mutter mutter its just too heavily charged all caved in on the subject every once in while youll see couple go get married who have been fighting consistently and continually see they didnt do nothing but fight and worry and worry and fight and fight and worry and worry and fight and one day they walk down and get married you say thats stupid thing to do well of course theyve created themselves mutual environment of overcharge to such point they have comprehension of what theyre doing you see that if you want to see somebody do something silly why start piling up the charge on him give him lots of conflict give him lots of duress give him lots of this that and the other thing hell do something silly i didnt really wasnt really at that moment trying to explain to you the workings and functions of an army or government but if it applies apply it stupidity then comes about from charge what do we mean by charge we mean its unreleased masses of energy unreleased unresolved stored masses of energy thats charge its more than that the significances arentdont enter into it you get somebody to sort out his problems by significance and hes likely to not solve them because in actual fact its his overcharged environment that is making him too stupid to solve his problems and weve got an awful lot of stuff in getting this bridge together between 0 and vweve got an awful lot of stuff thats quite miraculous and weve done an awful lot with it and its quite surprising what we have managed to do over period of years with this material you yourself know you can do this or that or the other thing with pc and very often it works quite marvelously dont you see and you can do all kinds of oddball things and so on whats straining you is an effort to attain consistency of result thats your main worry consistency of result joe bill pete now how do we get joe bill pete bailed out of it well obviously weve got to get result on bill and then when weve done that get result on joe and then result on pete dont you see weve got to get consistent result and what breaks an auditors heart is to get beautiful result on bill result on joe and make pete sick as dog see thats an inconsistent result so therefore to get consistent result you would have to deal with the common denominator of difficulty with joe bill and pete and attack that common denominator not the individual difficulties of joe bill and pete you see how you could achieve consistency of result now you see unless we can achieve consistency of result on the levels from 0 up through to v unless we can achieve some consistency of result nobody will ever make the bridge so were posedin putting in the processes and activities of an auditor between 0 and vwith the problem of giving the auditor consistent result and enough result to bring about not only reality on his own part but on the part of the people hes processinga mutual reality on the situationin order to persuade them on forward now if the thing that is making them stupid is charge and if this is the common denominator of bridgeovercharged environments overcharged individuals the guy hasnt got reality on something because hes just too plowed in dont you see hes got too many tons of coal on the top of his headthen its quite obvious that what we have to charge and attack at those levels is this matter of charge weve got to make somebody brighter and weve got to get him to be able to see further and weve got to get rid of of course some of the things hes worrying about and then we would achieve it so that the only thing we can do the only thing we can do at levels 0 on up to v is get rid of charge but in view of the fact that the basic charge on the case is the actual gpm and as the person at that level those levelsis incapable of attacking thoseand that is said veryvery advisedly theyi mean very factuallytheyre not capable of attacking these thingsand if thats the basic charge on the case and if we cant get anywhere by putting the pc into it but troubleand believe we are going to get place but trouble if we try to put the person into it at those levels before hes ready to and before he has any education on itwhy then quite obviously what we want to do is bail him out of the charge rather than get rid of the charge so we have level 0 to v devotedthats up to v thats not including v0 to iv inclusivedevoted to destimulation the skills of destimulation which is to pull the pc out of the charge not try to erase the charge certain amount of erasure is bound to take placebound to take place but if were concentrating on destimulation we will be achieving the same ends were getting the individual out of these masses of charge so what were really attacking at those levels are keyins were trying to destimulate so obviously level 0 to iv inclusive which is up to v are addressed to the whole subject of destimulation were studying destimulation now what do we mean by destimulation well were trying to knock out the keyins that keep the charge pinned to the individual were not trying to destroy the charge or get rid of the charge what were trying to do is bring the individual out of it and that is an art of very high order were trying to pluck the individual out of the roaring whirlpools of energy by tripping those little items which keep him connected to it now were not going to restimulate anything until we get up into actual gpms and then were just going to throw him to the lions then he can get rid of all of the charge and asis the whole ruddy lot of it because thats all contained in one processr6 see and thats athats completely rounded up proposition but the funny part of it is the individual with all of his restimulations pinned together is in actual fact incapable of recognizing an actual goal so if you take the actual goal and pile on top of it all of the keyins trying to get the individual now to recognize the actual goal is going to be very difficult indeed so the right way to go about it is to pull the individual out by disconnecting the keyins pull him out of the actual goal let the whole thing subside and then at level vi shovel it all off into the gutter you see that as different proposition now if an individual standing on pile of coal looking at lifesaver lets take lifesaver and put it on the concrete and then put ton of coal on top of it and then put the individual on top of this pile and say now all youve got to do is pick up that lifesaver and he says what lifesaver lifesaver right down there of course you idiot where well you see really its underneath the coal well i dont see any well ill take it on faith all right lets do list for the lifesaver lets do this for the lifesaver lets do that for the lifesaver you cant find the lifesaver why well now thats not too perfect metaphor but here is the position you find the individual in you could get him back to point where that pile of coal wasnt all piled up but if its subsided and lay across low levelwas only couple of inches thick around the lifesaver he could see the lifesaver then by getting the lifesaver if you could imagine that the lifesaver would hold the coal there the moment he grabbed hold of the lifesaver all the coal would disappear then youve done the trick dont you see but thats what youre up against if that ton of coal represented all of his keyins and his upsets why he isnt going to get anywhere close to that lifesaver now thats perhaps not as smart graph as i could make you on the subject but it tells you what youve got to do with an individual now if an individual can be in the midst of an actual ri at level vi and not understand it merely because of some session invalidation so forththe auditor overlisted and the guy didnt think it was it and they found it once and they abandoned it and then they came back and picked it up again and suddenly he cant understand it and then we brush off couple of suppresses and destimulate its connection with the session you see now he all of sudden can understand this ri and it blows one has to understand ris or they dont blow because of course they are not in printed english theyre thought and thought requires understanding now in view of this if an individual can do that in the middle of session on an actual ri what do you think hes going to do in life these gpms and the whole track and that sort of thing are so jammed up and so locked up with everything under the sun the individual with his attention gruesomely and howlingly concentrated on some littlenot even pile of coal but concentrated on just lump of coalwell youve got to show him he can do something about the coal he can do something about it and he gets big reality and hope factor and his confidence resurge on this basis that if he could get his attention off just one lump of coal for few minutes it would make him feel so different and so interestingly alive compared to how he has felt that now he gets big upsurge in reality and you can get him to tackle fourfive lumps of coal see you got gradient you got gradient by which this can be done see and its matter of confidence knocking out the charge destimulating him so he is brighter and so forth and thats the problem between 0 and iv inclusive how do you do this well you take this individual and hes so mired down in the middle of his family or his job or his social security work or something that he hasnt got any time to do anything and he cant even lift his eyebrows long enough to do anything and he cant spend any time trying to get out of this hes just barely able to hold it at bay its likehes in the same frame of mind ofyoure trying to sell lion tamer padded suit you see and hes fighting forty lions forty and theyre all about ready to come off of their pedestals you see and the chairs broken by this time and hes running out of blank cartridges so you say hey id like to sell you this suit see itsit proofs you against being chewed and you know he wouldnt pay bit of attention to you he cant take his attention off these lions long enough well the thing to dothe thing to do of course is to take the lionsthe immediacy of the lions away lion by lion and then he begins to get the idea that maybe he doesnt need the blank cartridge pistol and so forth and you sort of play it back and forth and you destimulate his environment now an environment can itself be present time problem that fellow who was being charged for murder and who was going to be sent to the electric chair is very very hard to interest in much of anything hes its like the fellow who is going down toboggan slide or like one of theseone of these swiss ski runs that goes ninety miles an hourright about the middle of the run you cant unload see so there is point of an individual being inso involved and his environment so charged that there isnt anything you can do about it so the first level of processing happens to beand this of course would not include all cases but its the most extreme case which delivers it into your hands most extreme case is the unconscious person theyve just gone down for the third time you seebut that one point is is you have to remove the person from his present time environment to some degree and youll find out that if youre ever called upon to handle the insane the removal of the individual from his environment which is restimulative and overcharged and giving him nonrestimulative environment where nobody is bothering him and where he can get some rest will be your best route you do very lowlevel processing well you say well some of these blokes are going to sit there and starve to death and they wont eat and so forth well i think theyre probably not eating because theyre under such duress that they may be treated or they have to answer questions or something like this you look around and all you do is keep removing charge from the environment to the best degree you can so some of them starve to death well all right they go through the betweenlives area and pick up another body theres your lowest level of action in other words this is giving somebody nonrestimulative relatively so environment removing him from the restimulative environment well thats pretty low level but it exists as processing level now lets go from therelets go from thereand we will find the individual is now so engrossed in his present time problems that he is obsessively solving everything under the sun moon and stars and hes just obsessively solving his present time and his solutions are so pyramided that you dont dare touch any corner of the pyramid or youll get collapse of the lot and you find out that that quite commonly states the average person in the street you find the housewife going to marketif you were to walk alongside of one and say now what are you thinking about right now whats the stream of consciousness going through your brow well if i do thisand so oni could get johnnysso onand then i could do theso on and so on and so onand if i could save us little bit of money out of the grocery money why thatd give uswaf waf waf waf waf waf wafand i might be able to get that new dress if i could get mrs joneswaf waf waf wafand if that waf waf waf waf waf waf waf waf its just wild string of solutions theyre going on and on and on one right after the other solve solve solve solve solve solve solve solve solve solve solve solve solve solve solve well now you can come up to your lowest level of actual processing on the basis of itsa on solutions tends to take over that automaticity im just showing you the scope of somethingim not giving you the fixed form of these things im just showing you what could be done see and nownow lets look at the firstwhat in actual fact would be the first processing level that wouldyou would really saddle as an auditor as pro that you would call processing and thats your repetitive question or your objective processes at level ii now right up to this pointup to this pointyou are not confrontingwe of course have bypassed assists and so forth there are other processes that do things at those levels which of course assists is just acquaintance familiarity with the thing that hurts or something or where it was hurt but when you get repetitive process hqs level now that certificate what is the bug from there on up that might make processing dangerous and that would give you loses and that is the question your old man here has had to had to answer and it was answered in this fashion what isnt in an actual gpm see what isnt in an actual gpm is there something that isnt in an actual gpm that could be processed with impunity and there is there is something that isnt in an actual gpm and that is noun or pronoun now there are some pronouns in actual gpmstheres such thing as myself there is sometimes i andbut theyre part of the wording of goal so prospronouns are not absolutely safe but at level ii youre so far from the actual gpm you could probably use them with impunity youre at such distance theres so much coal between you and it and these things only form very tiny portion of some goals that theres reason to debar them at level ii but as the pc progressed from level ii on up i would begin to get wary of using pronoun and id begin to get leery because you do have toto help myself to forget myself things like this dont you see those things do appear in actual goals but aside from that one little observation there are nouns in actual gpms none there isnobody has goal to be an assassin nobody has goal to be god nobody has goal to be wife nobody has goal to be goddess nobody has goal to be criminal they are not actual goals see and nowhere in it do you have terminal sultan or alcohol or cats kings or coal heavers see nowhere there are such terminals there are such oppterms theres nesses and ities theres nervousness you see ability theres things of this kind you see the adverbial and adjectival nouns are present so you dont use those nesses ities ions communication think of communication is liable to be sending you right straight down the route toward an actual gpm think of communicator and it wouldnt got the idea you could process with absolutelyimpunity an assassin you could prepcheck it you could run brackets on it you could do almost anything you ever heard of in the way of processing on the subject of an assassin and we suddenly come to why the 20th acc made clears and the missing secret why it wasnt general its because nouns were processed on brackets accidental see so youd actually key out actual gpms because an assassin might very well be the hundredandfiftyfirst lock on an actual ri death so the individuals alert to this idea of an assassin all right on an assassin has anything been suppressed here we go fine what are you going to do youre going to key out that actual gpm destimulation all of sudden its over there and the pcs here and his needles flopping interessante huh well now listen what is an actual gpm what is an actual ri completely aside from the other considerations anybody at level ivand this is what im teaching you today is level ivshould at least know that these things exist and they are mass with significance now thats really what you have to know at level iv what they are theyre mass with significance that mass is very big and massy too and the significance is very significant but they are mass with significance so therefore masses with significances key in actual gpms what is the keyin of an actual gpm mass with significance what is mass with significance aside from being an actual gpm well i dont know man is mass with significance fireplace is mass with significance house is mass with significance tree is mass with significance desk is mass with significance room is mass with significance piano is mass with significance emeter thats mass with significance easel thats mass with significance pencil is mass with significance and every one of them is potential keyin of an actual gpm or an actual ri yous walkin around in present time that is just full of restimulators yous haunted and i think we know now why everybody is in present time its the most haunted area now you think its significance that keys in the actual gpm of course if youve got an actual ri thatshas communicating or something like that as an actual ri and somebody says that to you often enough i can guarantee that it will key in there is slightest doubt about that i dont think itd be very safe to process because the individuals going to go down but he hasnt got the actual rihe probably even hasnt got it quite correctly worded so if that was processed directly youd have trouble supposing you had an actual ri helpand there is such an actual ri how could you help how could i help how could you help how could i help cut your throat man youre sending him right down the chute and the next thing you know hes going to be in the middle of goal which is not in sequence not his present time gpm you havent got the goal that goes with it youve got the pc now into an ri hes going to turn on some somatics and hes going to have ball he may have some fever and chills to go along with it well hows the process become at all safe well the lowest level of safety on such process is how could i help you and how could you help and its the and the you that salvages it why because its mass with significance but you normally dont look at the pronoun as mass with significance see you tend to forget it now you think its help thats doing all this we dont know that its the help doing it at all we might get just as much bang out of the process by just running you spot you spot spot you spot dont you see because youve got mass with significance now im not advising this as process im simply giving it as sample of process is recall terminal terminal of course is mass with significance that is capable of receiving sending or relaying communication boy arent we back into the old days when we were giving forth with this kind of stuff see recall terminal good recall terminal good recall terminal why does old arc straightwire work well the laws of life of course are senior to the gpms we have laws of life which are not dictated to us by actual gpms weve got the laws of life which come about and make actual gpms and we had already entered it at higher strata than that level fortunately for the lot of us see now the law in which were involved there is that arc straightwire worked as long as it had pronouns felt some affinity for someone communicated with someone something was really real to you now what were the little hidden bugs in those process commands those things were chosen empirically these out of great many commands were found to be commands that were workable and id never sorted out of them exactly what it was that made them work and we turnturns out to be the something the someone that was the workable aspect isnt this fascinating therefore you can prepcheck mass that has significance you can run it in brackets you can add up other commands and significances to the auditing command as long as its there and youre running it now level ii we dont have any assessment so how do we get the auditor across this band well objective processes of course having him touch wall is mass with significance isnt it and the control and the communication and the havingness involved in the action contain principles of life that are senior to actual gpms so those things added upcontrol communication havingnessadded up to the mass with the significance which is wall gave us 8c as one of the highest level workable processes we ever had at that level see isnt that interesting see but it was the wall that was basically what it was it was the wall the mass with the significance that wall was very likely to key in actual gpms see so when you got him familiar with the wall the wall would key out the actual gpm would resiwouldwould go away see destimulate die down so because you cant dotherell be other devices of this sort of thing because you cannot expect anybody at level ii to assess therefore cant expect them to assess so therefore you would tend to depend on pronouns and objective processes such as walls and so forth to give workability to processing youll find things will get very real to this fellow level i the basic mass with significance that he gets familiar with and begins to trust and so forth is the auditor somebody to listen to him and thats all you could really expect him to do at level 1 was just getget the idea there was an auditor there or somebody he could talk to but level ii you could introduce other things like them you see someone something and add some significance to the auditing command and then youve got the regularity of the auditing command helping you along toothe repetitive nature of the command you see because your auditing cycle is in there working and very probably the best process at level ii was the process which is never noticed at level ii which is simply the comm cycle you ask question the pc can answer the pc does answer the question you let itmaking sure that he answered the thing completely and you acknowledge it see its that cyclic action which is the process which makes level ii now how comehow come auditor well an auditors mass with significance but an auditors lot more than that an auditor is apparently senior to masses with significance see an auditor carries hope and aliveness and so forth along with it this is something new something different so an awareness of just the existence of such person and so on is terribly therapeutic friendly mass with significance that will give him hand see thats all well that tends to take the curse off the horrible masses with significance that are around see here is one mass with significance that is not an enemy now the nature of this universe is twopole nature this is two pole universe ol bucky fuller was sweet enough to come over one time and give lecture over in elizabeth all by my lonesome i was very appreciative of that taught lot twopole universe singles cant exist in this universe doubles can and we look how thoroughly that is we get the principle of the motor motors motors dont operate unless current is circulating between two poles and those two poles have got to be fairly close together but if the current can circulate between two poles pole and pole b and you girls dont have to know anything about electricity you probably know more about electricity anyhow than i do because ive laughed off most of mans science in the field of electricity its too incredible i ruined whole university education on the subject for mary sue she was utterly betrayed i happened to remark to her one day that man had never seen an electron see hes seen only the manifestations that one might exist but he has never seen an electron and he really doesnt know what the pattern of them is and he really doesnt know what molecules are these are all assumptions and it was such terrible betrayal that she threw away all of rice institute and the university of texas into the wastebasket was very upset about this because shed had to memorize exactly how they looked and how many sides they had you see and how much they weighed and all this sort of nonsense well man does know that these things exist by third or fourthrate evidence you see but hes just guessing what they are and that he hasnt guessed right is obvious because he has flying saucers see he really has none of the energy devices that he should have for instance youto really get somewhere in civilization youve got to have powerlittle packages of power of some kind or another you dont want long cord dragged out you see hundred and seventyfive yards of cord with fellow with one drill on the end of it you know everybody falling over this cord impractical and he really has source of power so he cant know very much about electronic structure or molecules or anything of that character otherwise hed be able to convert it to power see costs him i dont know how many million bucks to turn over the wheels of one atomic submarine once you know and i think they feed them pills at relative intervals and somebody told mei was very surprised to find out that they only cost three or four times as much as fuel oil of course in space opera one gets used to little button one slides into the side of gun that runs the gun all year you know blows mountains down butpackaged power so dont be too upset because you think i am asking you to suddenly understand mans scientifichaequations in the subject of electronics and electricity im not im just asking you to fall back on the fact of just one thing that every time you see motor or any interchange and so forth its got two poles and these two poles are standing there side by side and that theres magnetic interchange between these two poles and as long as these two poles are rigid and dont collapse why the pushpull in between those two you can do things with but it takes two now to give you how simple this is take single electrode on the meter and hold the single electrode but let the other electrode go to blazes and see if your meter reads see and your meter isnt going to read see and then take ahold of both electrodes and youll see that the meter reads both electroim not talking about singlehand electrode if you get singlehand electrode it has to be split in the middle youve got two poles in singlehand electrode so you have to have hold of two cans in order to make the meter read thats to complete the circuit well thats an evidence of the twopole nature of this universe and thats all there is to it and things dont operate one on onewell on one pole now ive put myself over the jumps considerably to find out little bit more about this and solve this bit better in the earlierwell i guess its only month or two ago and i sat there with onehand electrodedouble pole onehand electrodeand ran out whole actual gpm it wasnt too gruesome an experience but i had to find out if these things could be self audited and so forth well you can plot goals yourself i had to find out see because you might get parked on exnoo or something of the sort and howwhat do you do about it you know if you havent gotten it cleared up and so forth what does somebody do if he hasnt got an auditor is there road in that particular line very well may be one youd probably be better off running them out that way than not running them out you understand i mean its thatbut its touchy but what was different about that session ta i who get lots of ta when audited by an auditor running exactly the same materials with arc breaks any kind nothingno ta little thresh of the needle ri falling about that far returning almost at once blowdown represented by the fact that it didnt return from little slash that big you see usually find real ri its anything from half division to division and half tone arm blowdown see ta well this revealedthis revealed something this is research exercise i wouldnt wish it off on you but it revealed that fact in the absence of an auditor pc who gets ta doesnt get ta i consider this very very interesting indeed and i think it actually describes any pc youve got who isnt getting ta i made that point fast didnt i you got it so the amount of ta pc gets is proportional to the two terminals ness present in the session if you havent got two terminals in session youve got ta if youve got one terminal in session you get ta see and if youve got one and one onethousandth of terminal you get little ta and if you get one and one onehundredth of terminal sitting across from it you get bit more ta and you get your highestflying ta of course when you simply had two terminals you understand so that weve got the auditor sitting there has to be real to the pc for there to be two terminals in the session isnt thatisnt that elementary in other words the pc doesnt have an auditor he doesnt have any ta now this is not the auditors fault this describes the state of case the native state of case of the pc its only the auditors fault when the auditor isnt remedying it well ive noticed something very interesting in plotting actual gpms and in engaging in any new action i can generally start gradient on my pc it starts at about fortynine or fifty ta divisions down for two and half hours of auditing and then begins to get some ta and goes fairly rapidlya session or two later youll find theres about seventy and then two or three sessions later about ninety and two or three sessions after that has progressed up to about hundred and three you got the idea in other words heres an increasing amount of ta pc is not introverted now on the newness of this exercise and activity and so therefore is more easily able to have an auditoryou gotless introverted into whats being done and more capable of having an auditor so new process to which the pc is very strange is also factor in addition to the auditor the pc is sufficiently introvertedhe doesnt see his auditor so to the degree he doesnt see the auditor he doesnt have ta you understand hes soso involved with this mental exercise hes trying to do that he doesnt notice anybody else is around and then the next session hes not that involved with the same exercise dont you see hes little more familiar with it so hes got little more auditor and the next session why hes even less involved with it and hes got more auditor dont you see and so you get gradual increase of ta independent of whether the process is doing him any good or not now therefore we were boy im really dragging them out of the old history icebox herebut therefore weve got our only one remember only one mind you today im handing you significances and terminals and heres the only one and the only one gets ta aint nobody else alive see there being nobody else around why naturallyhe very easily assesses on self by the way that would be natural assessment for such person there isnt anybody else so he doesnt get ta funny part of it is he wouldnt have had any ta years ago either thats the point you miss its very easy for an auditor to miss that the pc has been going through life without auditing in the condition he is found in in the session and very oftenvery often the auditor adds it all up that it just happened just this instant in the session the pc is like that now you see and he doesnt quite wrap his wits around the fact that the pcs inability to answer the auditing question the pcs complete driftiness and dispersal and inspecificity on the subject of anything under the sun has been characteristic of this pc for quite while and he is just confronting life product this is where this pc has gotten to in other words charge has accumulated on this individual to point where he longer understands that anybody else exists see charged up to point where there is reality on second terminal anyplace so therefore we never get an energy interchange with anybody else weve got standing wavean animated standing wavewalking through the society that blocks all incoming and all outgoing flow well thats how hes trapped there is his own traptailormaderight where he is at flow now he could be stuck on win or on series of loses he could always talk to joe but joe is dead so he solves this by being in continuous communication with joe this of course denies him any other terminal because if people arent joe theyre nobody see thats one way it can happen and the other way it can happen of course ishe wasnt in communication with joe either or anybody else ever so just the fact that something might tick him little bit that it might exist causes him to clam up its like the psychiatrically treated patient who had learned through long treatment in psychiatry to keep his mouth shut well thats what life has taught this boy you see you mustnt be there and you mustnt communicate so nothing else is real and he is very very heavily charged now keyedin are lot of actual gpms and so forth but hes not capable of reaching in any direction to achieve these tremendous keyins involved here and were still talking now about the levels ii on up to get ta we would have to rehabilitate otherterminalism and at ii we would do it with pronouns because we cant assessyou cant assess at level iiit would have to be object or them or you know something recall time you communicated with something you know arc straightwire that sort of thing at iii you would move into nebulous zone of assessment but observation actually its observation by assessment we have worked out level iii assessment which is whole intensive just keep going over everything with the pc that is on this consecutive list and you just discuss each one of these points with the pc and at the end of the discussion of course you do haveyou have come up with lot of conclusions but the pc has probably blown them by cognition by this time in other words digout so youyou could make level iiias close as you could come to an assessmentwould be do the whole thing by assessment you know do nothing but discuss what really at level iv becomes an assessment see you dig the whole thing out by discussion but then you dont do anything much with what you dig out because it wasnt to assess to certain end or product anyway you were doing this we were talking about it it was fitted into glum areas and that sort of thing you get what i mean in other words its just by going back and forth by meter steering and that sort of thingwe would finally wind up there well theres better ways to go about this along with terminal we get period of time time is the single source of aberration the wrong mass at the wrong time or the right mass at t wrong time and this thing will lock up at any time time is very important very very very important so much so that if person has somatic if we simply date the somatic itll ordinarily fall away quite interesting thats putting it in its proper time proportion this is an interesting method of destimulation because all restimulation depends on mistake in time pc thinks it is tuesday last week and tuesday last week he hadhe barked his shins so hes made mistake in time so he has pain on tuesday week later in his shin because he thinks its tuesday week ago its not actually sufficiently difficult to be able to teachthe time aberration and therefore it gets very easily overlooked by an auditor its not something that you can easily teach once youve said hes made mistake in time or theres lie about time connected with the thing youve just about said it see he thinks its tuesday last week nownow you can go out and you teach all sorts of things about engrams and everybody gets all bogged down into the mental image picture of the whole thing and so forththe basic lesson you are trying to teach and the reason you dragged in these other things is the pc thinks its tuesday last week he actually cant have somatic well hes got headache you see in 1964 how can he have headache in 1964 and why does he have headache in 1964 well obviously the headache came from someplace this is one point where medicine and ourselves part company medicine considers all injury sourceless injuries do not have sources psychosomatics have sources there can be malfunctions without cause thats sort of grim hopeless apathetic look at it isnt it we claim the headache dont you see has cause see and the basic cause of the headache is mistake in time time errors he hit his head in 1960 and he has headache in 1964 why well because he thinks its 1960 of course so therefore you date the somatic accurately to 1960 and the misthe proof of the pudding is in the metering you date this thingyou date this thing and he ceases to have headache gor this is coo you can do thisa lot of people have experienced this weird phenomena particularly when its well done the only thing that keeps you from doing it well is that if its been wrongly dated youll get the date of the wrong date see thats theabout the only thing you date another mistake in time and this is the most baffling of all baffling experiences to an auditor if he doesnt know that he can get beautiful date on wrong date lets say the pc last tuesday said it was last friday so youll get the date of last friday unless you straighten it all out and remove that its very easy to detect dont you see and thats how you miss and thats about the only way you miss in dating somatics and getting rid of them you always get rid of the somatic if you accurately date it but what gets in your road is the fact that the pc has been there ahead of you pc has already wrongly dated it and youre liable to find the pcs wrong date or you can find the date when the pc wrong dated it and then this is overburdened on the actual date so you find these others and then you re date it and then itpretty soon you come up and say well the emeter doesnt accurately date because ive gotten three dates for this one incident you didnt realize you got the time when the pc wrongly dated it first you got the wrong date the pc gave it then you got the date when the pc wrongly dated it and then you got its right date see now in view of the fact the pc may have wrongly dated it four times you see it can look very involved but you can straighten that out you can say well is this when you dated it or is this the date you dated it to orsee something like that you can straighten it out within those limits why you get this weird fascinating phenomenon of the fellow has horrendous psychosomatic and you find out that it was on october the third 1957 and bang and it sort of goes zzzzzz like little punched balloon and its gone whered it go what happened well you just discovered its source now in view of the fact that you cannot run terminalsin view of the fact you cant easily run terminals that have not been accurately assessed you mustnt really play around with terminals that havent been well assessed you get yourself into lot of trouble if somebody doesnt know anything about assessment at all who is busy assessing something then comes up with his product and runs it you can expect hash you know the pc is protesting like mad billycans he never heard of them he never heard of it and you keep getting this read its because an emeters charge meter not lie detector or truth detectorall it detects is charge thats all it detectscharge its chargemeter and so of course if your pc is all heavily charged up on the fact that hes insisting it is not billycans on the list you of course will get the result billycans and then you are running what you should have been running protest on in the session and youre saddling him with billycans because it read so well you see its just lousy job of assessment thats all see well thats where that gets you in trouble so therefore at level iii whatever other process we use we prepcheck at level iii and so forth we prepcheck at level iii and do othermany processes at level iii but i dont think that very much assessment should be brought in at level iii we are given this beautiful thing of time factor and so at iii we could do lot of tricks with time time factor so we get problems intensive as very nice process at iii now of course that takes sort of an assessment doesnt it it takes an assessment of sorts but its an assessment which is then run for long time so it can be done by higher level auditor on the basic assessment they had to do this in hgcs all over the world theyve had to take higherclass auditor and get them to check out and do the problems intensive assessment and where they did that assessments were very very successful and their problems intensives were successful you see but where they didnt do that why it wasnt successful but time factors are something that can be used at class iii the present time problem done any way shape or form dont you see where the individual keeps saying he has present time problem and then whatever the present time problem is with in terms of terminal you prepcheck thats elementary see he has present time problem with his wife all right now he talked about that in itsa and it got better but by this time its worse again so you prepcheck wife dont you see something like that very arduous but its what the pc says and what the pc seems to be worried about so you can getyoucontinuing to use repetitive processes and doing prepchecks on things selected on terms of timeor usinglike your problems intensiveor using just the other side of the problem whos the problem with you see any other old problemsany other old problems process we ever had see weve got grab bag right there now if you throw into that class any other grab bag process we ever had why it makes class anything that mounted up to that then we move into iv and we make iv clearing level now id like more time to talk to you about class iv and so forth but let say that the technology of the 20th accperfectly accurate technologyand that prepchecking was probably much more successful when addressed to the terminal found than the previous process of running in brackets running help in brackets or that sort of thing in brackets on what was found prepchecking is more successful than that so just an ordinary prepcheck on whats found now that leaves us what that leaves us assessment and level iv is an assessment type process and you can make keyedout clear and this is why we didnt make keyedout clear in the past was just the assessments were bad and the eventual process that was run on the terminal found was very poor the process run well like we specialized too much on some button well maybe it wasnt the pcs button dont you see we were using prehav scale assessment to move in in back of this terminal and so on particular reason to do that youve got the prepcheck buttons so why dont you just prepcheck it now the object of class iv then could be destimulated individual to the state of clear making the certificate hcs quite real indeed ill probably talk to you some more about this but actually there probably isnt too much more to talk about how do you make clear well r3 with those difference of processes mentioned would make clear r3 was very valid lets do list of the pcs goals and lets find the goal thats stuck in its going to be wrong goal so what not going to be the pcs right goal so what so its going to be an implant gpm so what it was the goal that came up isnt it thats all we are interested in it was the goal that came up we dont care what kind of goal this is if its only goal or what kind of goal were going to get goal elementary all right now having gotten goal were now going to do terminals list for that goal also brief list this is brief goals list see they just list this till the needle is clean see on the terminals list you just list it till the needle is clean so you get goal well what goal might you have theres perfectly good question see well hes about as likely to give you an actual gpm goal see as penguin is about to walk in that door see its just not going to happen i just unmocked him now you dont care in the first place if he gives you wrong goal so what somatics dont come from wrong goals they come from right goals that are suppressed and invalidated so you take this short goals listthis sounds like old times seeyou take this short goals list just list till the needles clean and then who or what would have that goal was the magic question to list the terminal with who or what would have that goal well lets list few and lets not go overboard lets just list the needle clean on the thing and then lets assess it and while listing it lets take peculiar and particular attention to any big steep horrendous falls or any excitement on the needle see to record that later youre going to find terminal and having found terminal on this list it should give you some little nicenice needle action see its all were asking for particularly if we unsuppress it and so on the only thing weve got to be sure of is its noun noun so we actually could go to the degree of say thuhuhuhuh uhuhuhuhuhuhuhuh to the pc every time the pc didnt list noun see see pc lists nervousness see we say uhuhuhuhuhuhuhuh thank you very much now on this list has anything been suppressed very clean clear understanding we want nouns we want cats kings coal heavers see we want wives we want kitchen stoves you understand we want masses with significance and what do you know what do you know were going to find ourselves on that list something we can prepcheck so we knock prepcheck into this thing bokitybok and we prepcheck it up to point of highlevel cognition where it just simply blowsand we wont get ta action after thator we simply process the ta action out of it keeping our session rudiments in well thats great weve had it were not going to do single other cottonpicking doggone thing with that goal and were not going to do anything more with that terminals list were now going to find another goals list and were going to find another terminal got it we flatten these things reasonably but try not to plow the pc in were going to wind up at the end of this run with completely free needle and clear but thats actually all the mechanics there are to it providing we never upset the pc about what goal hes to put on the list dont you see he can put any goal on the list providing we keep those goals lists too for later on and providing we dont overlist madly and providing we get terminal there that gives us some nice needle action and then providing we just mildly prepcheck this terminal were going to have ourselves free needle why the only thing that can key in the actual gpm is the mass with significance because an actual gpm is mass with significance see so we get the mass with the significance thats noun we know we havent got an ri for an actual gpm so if we prepcheck it weve got the thing which is keying in an actual gpm so the goal we found on the list is thousands of miles from being an actual goal we couldnt care less were not doing anything with it see its some kind of goal even if its just an item on the list and it is probably the lock that is keeping the actual in see so we could probably strip these things off left and right now if youre careful as you go along over such route of clearingif youre very carefulonly to choose things which have recognizably good reads that dont come from big protest or argument with the pc see this thing has got read so forth there it is see and as long as we dont get it up that were hotting it up to get actual honesttogod real goals and start arguing with the pc as to whether theyre actual goals or regoals or something becausehuh theyre all just items on list hes had this kind of goal at some time or another dont you see youll probably find hes very interested in one of those goals on the list and another one he doesnt want to have anything to do with well respect his wishes dont get in an argument about it you have to handle it softly you have to handle it gently otherwise youre liable to get your hands on something there and invalidate it and turn yourself on some somatics youll wish you didnt have anything to do with so lightly lightly and all youre trying to do is destimulate the pc and you make yourself clear and thats an r4 process revised from what we know now to deliver destimulated clear i was talking about this earlieri didnt give you an active formula many months ago by which to produce this but you notice i did revive the hcs certificate and have been talking about this level now if this terminal is what you sum up service facsimile into this was probably what they were trying to make guiltysee make right make wrong ow any of these things would fit in you see make guilty is the service facsimile cousin of ow see make self right and others wrong well that adds up to making somebody guilty youre probably having all of that delivered into your paws except youre finding now what theyre trying to make guilty dont you see so theres another possible family of processes that add up into that particular lineup just pointing out the service facsimile has something to do with this not that you necessarily use it but you arent left high and dry with result this thing wont prepcheckwell obviously then somebodys trying to make it guilty gives you the other line of process which you could use at that time see you could use your old service facsimile processes you know how would you make yourself right about it and how would you make others wrong about it but that would be rather extreme look i dont think youll run into that very very hot and heavy but thats the only thing i can think of that you would run into if youve got noun its neither going to be terminal nor an oppterm because it doesnt exist in actual gpms so you havent got to worry about any of that old stuff that we were worried about at that time so ive given you actually very simple rundown list little reasonable goals list find goal pc is really interested in and then just list nouns of who or what would have it and then prepcheck the result and if you dont drive the pc into hole with bunch of out mid ruds and choosing the wrong item and only getting goals by protest why youre going to wind up after youve done this few timeswhy youre going to wind up with lot of keyedout gpms and youre going to wind up with clear so there is the manufacture of clear by destimulation the destimulated clear and this isbe very very handy to use this doesnt particularly invalidate anything else you know in the way of processing im just showing you there is route based on materials which are more or less in your hands with this one addition that ive finally gotten the common denominator that isnt present in actual gpms and so wont key them in which is very very handy to have so therefore thats very safe to process and with thatwith that squared awaywhy of course the road is open to ordinary runofthemill book one type destimulated clears you can key out actual gpms actual gpms are keyed in only by masses with significance and oddly enough there will only be one mass with significance in any given environment that is really raising the devil with the pc hes got thousands of them apparent theyre all associative theres only one thats keeping it stirred in so eventually you will move along the line till you will finally fall into that one and you find out the reason he can never walk down main street and that sort of thing is because of the glass in the shop windows and he thought it was the traffic and he thought it was policemen and he thought it was city life and he thought it was most anything he thought it was his shoes and so on it was the glass in shop windows and youll eventually fall into that category and find out what it is that makes it impossible for him to walk through the city streets this is the kind of thing that you run into with this but now therethere is map and design of perfectly safe useable processes which will take the individual from level iv up toward level v so hes got enough reality and is unburdened enough so that he can understand and you can get him searching for and actually finding actual gpms so as to run out the bank in its entirety the thing is to fish him out of the bank so that he can then go back and finish up the bank all right thats it thank you
