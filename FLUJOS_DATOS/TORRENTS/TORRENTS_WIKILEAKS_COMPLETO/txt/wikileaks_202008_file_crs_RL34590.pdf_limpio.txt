background for several years the administration has proposed increases in co payments and enrollment fees for retirees and their dependents who are not medicareeligible the administration argues that the growing costs of defense health care both in absolute terms and as percentage of the defense budget require efforts to seek greater contri butions by users it argues that inasmuch as tricare prime enrollment fees were set in 1995 and have not been raised since it is reasonable that they should be increased congress has thus far refused to give dod the requested authority to raise the fees

enrollme nt fees for retired military personnel and their dependents who are not eligible for medicare medicareeligible retirees can use the tricare for life program which w ould not be affected by the proposed fee increases dod asserts that retirees us ing tricare prime pa id approximately 27 percent of their health care costs in 1995 but now pay only 12 percent consistent with recommendations of the department of defense task force on the future of military health care the proposed dod budget for fy2009 would have gradually raised enrollment fees for those using tricare prime the hmolike option from the current 460 selfdependents to 2011 rates as high as 1750 for retirees making over 40000 annually dod also pr oposed creating an enro llment fee for retirees who use tricare standard the feeforser vice option of 120 per year in addition dod maintains that retail prescription usage and costs have contributed significantly to the growth in health care spending and recommended increases in pharmacy co payments along with eliminating copay ments for pharmaceuticals provided by the dod mail order pharmacy according to dod these fee increases would save some 12 billion in fy2009 opposition from beneficiary organizations has been strong and the government accountab ility office concluded in may 2007 that dods estimates of cost savi ngs were overestimated congress has

component personnel wounded in action background national guard and reserve pe rsonnel who qualify for disability retirement or placement on the temporary di sability retired list tdrl have their disability retired pay calculated using form ula that factors in years of service or disability rating whichever is more favorable to the service member however unlike regular component personnel who are on duty every day of the year and receive year of service for each year of duty reserve component personnel who normally serve parttime have their years of service calculated using more complex formula based on their level of participation this thod sums up reservists participation points3 and divides by 360 to produce th number of equivalent years of activeduty service given the lessthanfulltime nature of reserve service this means that an individual who has been serv ing in the reserves for 20 years may only have four or five year s of service for retired pay computation purposes original housepassed version hr 5658original senatepassed version s 3001final version s 3001 section 641 would amend 10 usc 1208 so that reserve component personnel who qualify for disability

year of service for each year in which reservist met the minimum participation standard of 50 points hence under this provision reservists w ith 20 qualifying years of reserve service would have been awarded 20 years of service for his disability retired pay computation it would have benefitted some combatinjur ed reservists particularly those with modest disability rating 3040 but many years of
