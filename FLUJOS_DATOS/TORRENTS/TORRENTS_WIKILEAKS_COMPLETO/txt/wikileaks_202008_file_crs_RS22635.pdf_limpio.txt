retirement income secur ity act of 1974 erisa singleemployer defined benefit pension plan1 may be terminated at the employers discretion if plans assets are sufficient to meet its benefit liabilities this process is called standard termination2 the plan administrator initiates standard termination by giving written notice to affected parties reporting information about the plans assets and benefit liabilities to the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc and informing the participants and beneficiaries of the benefits due them the pbgc then looks at the information to determine whether the criteria for standard termination have been met if the pbgc approves the termination the next step is for the plan administrator to distribute the plans assets to its participants and beneficiaries in order to provide the benefits due them erisa 4041b3 requires that these distributions be done through the purchase of annuities from commercial insurer or by other means that fully provide the benefits and are permissible under the plans terms and pbgc regulations 3 if any assets remain after the distribution they may be given back to the employer sponsoring the plan so long as all liabilities to participants and beneficiaries have been satisfied and the reversion is permissible by law and under the plan terms 4

for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits and defraying reasonable administrative expenses5 fiduciary must act with the care skill prudence and diligence of prudent person acting in like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of like character and with like aims6 under erisa fiduciary includes anyone who exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets or has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan7 these activities do not include plan design or business decisions which include decisions to adopt modify or terminate 1 defined benefit plans are

plan is decision that implicates fiduciary responsibility to the plan participants and beneficiaries9 there are two basic issues in beck regarding whether the defendant employer breached erisas fiduciary duty requirements the first issue is whether erisa permits merger as means of plan termination this is key question because the employer could not have breached any fiduciary duty it may have owed under erisa if it co uld not have legally chosen to terminate the plan by merger in addition if erisa does not pe rmit plan to terminate by merger the employer may not have had access to the reversion section in erisa explicitly provides that standard termination may occur by merging the terminatin g plan with multiemployer plan furthermore the erisa section that addresses plan mergers between singleemployer and multiemployer plans erisa 4232 does not speak to singleemployer plan terminations10 thus the question raised by beck is whether erisa 4041b3 which provides that plan assets must be distributed in standard termination in the form of annuities or by means that in accordance with the provisions of the plan and any applicable regulations otherwise fully provide all benefit liabilities under the plan11 permits the distribution to occur through plan merger the second issue is whether the decision to choose the merger option is discretionary administrative decision subject to erisas fiduciary obligations or is plan design or business decision not subject to such obligations prior to beck it does not appear that any court had addressed whether the decision to terminate plan by merger implicates erisas fiduciary duty standards however several federal courts of appeals have held outside the scope of plan terminations that fiduciary duty arises when plan sponsor chooses to merge pension plan with another plan12 g4g142g140g148g561g159g495g561g18g3g5g7g561g11g151g157g142g155g151g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g23g151g146g152g151g561

companys pension plans because the liabilities were worth millions of dollars the bankruptcy court saw the pbgcs claims as problematic for the chapter 11 plan confirmation14 in 2001 crowns board of directors decided to look at the possibility of terminating the plans under standard termination as part of this effort they sought bids for annuities that would be used to make the final distribution of benefits to plan participants and beneficiaries few months later pace international union which was the ion for crowns hourly workers suggested that crowns plans merge with the pace industrial union management pens ion fund piumpf multiemployer pension plan for pace union members pace thought the merger would be beneficial for crowns workers because piumpf would provide additional benefits and an established dispute resolution program in the following months attorneys from crown and pace discussed the merger and exchanged draft merger agreement crowns board was info rmed of the merger proposal and agreed to compare the options of purchasing annuities and merging once it received the final annuity bids shortly thereafter crowns board met to look at the final annuity bids which were set to expire the next day and learned that the pbgc had agr eed to release its claims if crown purchased the annuities the board then decided to buy the annuities in order to terminate the 12 overfunded plans because the plans were overfunded there was an estimated 5 million reversion to crown the other five plans became the responsibility of prior plan sponsors successor pace and two plan participants then sought preliminary injunction to prevent crown from terminating the plans they alleged that crown had violated its fiduciary duty under erisa by failing to adequately consider the merger proposal g14g152g160g142g155g561g5g152g158g155g157g561g17g153g146g151g146g152g151g156g561 the bankruptcy court held in favor of pace finding that 1 the decision of whether to purchase annuities or merge the plans was fiduciary decision and that 2 crown had breached its fiduciary obligations to plan participants and beneficiaries in failing to adequately consider paces merger proposal the us district court for the northern district of california affirmed the bankruptcy courts decision in relevant part 15 the ninth circuit in affirming the decision of the district court found that merger into multiemployer plan can be means of terminating pension plan under erisa it also held that the crown directors had breached their fiduciary duty16 in evaluating the merits of the breach of fiduciary duty claim the court noted that crown did not have duty to use the funds assets to the beneficiaries optimum benefit and that reversion under certain circumstances is acceptable however the court pointed to the findings 13 for more information on the insurance termination program see crs report 95118 pension benefit guaranty corporation fact sheet by john j topoleski 14 chapter 11

that crown was focused on an improper set of interests17 the court agreed with the lower courts findings that crown breached its fiduciary duty by failing to prioritize the participants interests and also by failing to make an investigation of the plans investment options18 g21g158g153g155g142g150g142g561g5g152g158g155g157g561 in reversing the decision of the lower court th supreme court did not focus on whether crowns decision to purchase an annuity instead of merging the pension plans was fiduciary decision19 instead the supreme court found that crown did not breach its fiduciary duty in failing to consider paces merger proposal because merger is not permissible form of plan termination under erisa in its decision the supreme court looked at the language of section 4041b3 of erisa under which plan assets must be distributed in standard termination in the form of annuities or by means that in accordance with the provisions of the plan and any applicable regulations otherwise fully provide all benefit liabilities under the plan pace had argued that mergers could fall within this otherwise language as the merger of assets into the multiemployer plan could fulfill plan benefit obligations the court however sided with the pbgcs interpretation of the section that merger should be viewed as an alternative to rather than an example of plan termination20 the court also pointed out that congress had not expressly provided for merger as means of plan termination in support of its position the court provided three ways in which erisa treats merger and termination differently first the court explained that if plan terminates through the purchase of annuities erisa ceases to apply to both the employer and the remaining plan assets merger on the other hand represents continuation rather than cessation of the erisa regime21 the court pointed out that had the plans been merged into the larger multiemployer plan that crown could still be subject to erisas requirements if it employed plan participants second in standard termination erisa allows an employer to recover surplus amounts not necessary to pay plan liabilities had crown merged the plan it would not have been able to take back those assets due to erisas antiinurement provision which prohibits employers from obtaining reversion in the absence of termination the court found that it was reasonable for the pbgc to refuse to recognize termination mechanism that did not allow for the receipt of these funds as authorized by law 17 id at 678 18 the secretary of labor filed an amicus brief with the nth circuit in support of petition for rehearing brief for amicus 0315303 03155331 9th cir 2005 the secretary argued that the decision to terminate or merge the crown plan was not subject to erisas fiduciary obligations it appears the pbgc also filed an amicus brief in which it argued that merger was not permissible means to accomplish standard termination under erisa see petition for

in order to find for pace it would have to decide that merger was an acceptable method of plan termination the supreme court expressed its reluctance not to defer to the pbgc and that to answer these questions without the views of the agencies responsible for enforcing erisa would be to embark upon voyage without compass id quoting mead corp v tilley 490 us 726 11989 internal quotation marks

merger was not to be included as permissible means of termination the court explained that provisions dealing with merger are contained in different set of statutory sections that maintain different rules and procedures while pace had argued that company could theoretically follow both the rules for merger and termination the court found this reasoning flawed accordingly the court held that merger is not permissible method of terminating singleemployer defined benefit plan g5g152g151g140g149g158g141g146g151g144g561g17g139g156g142g155g159g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 the beck case has been considered narrow decision in part because as commentators have pointed out the facts of the case determination of whether to terminate plan through merger is unique situation22 in addition while the lower courts addressed whether the decision to purchase annuities or merge the plans was fiduciary decision the court acknowledged this issue but focused on an antecedent question namely whether merger is permissible form of plan termination under erisa thus questions may still remain as to the scope of fiduciary duty following decision to terminate pension plan it has also been noted that the beck case did not foreclose the possibility that pension plans can be terminated in ways other than an annuity or lumpsum payment 23
