robust nuclear earth penetrator issues fy2005fy2007 summary earth penetrator weapons often called bunker busters burrow into the ground some tens of feet before detonating greatly increasing their ability to destroy buried targets the united states has several types of conventional earth penetrators the current us nuclear earth penetrator the b6111 bomb cannot penetrate certain types of terrain in which hardened underground facilities may be located so the air force and the national nuclear security administration nnsa are studying more effective penetrator the robust nuclear earth penetrator rnep while secretary of defense rumsfeld said in 2003 that rnep was study nnsas fy2005 budget document showed fiveyear total of 4847 million if rnep were to proceed beyond the study phase nnsa said decision had been made to proceed and outyear figures were shown to meet congressionallymandated budgeting requirements and were not request rnep requests are of course subject to congressional approval rejection or modification the fiveyear figure sparked congressional debate the fy2005 national defense authorization act contained the full rnep request 276 million the house and senate both rejected amendments to that bill that would have eliminated rnep funds however pl 108447 the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act appropriated funds for rnep as result nnsa could not work on rnep in fy2005 the fy2006 rnep request was 40 million for nnsa for studies and 45 million for the department of defense dod to study integrating rnep onto the b2 bomber the house passed the fy2006 energy and water development appropriations bill hr 2419 with nnsa rnep funds the house passed the fy2006 national defense authorization bill hr 1815 providing the requested dod funds and transferring the nnsa funds to dod the house appropriations committees mark of hr 2863 the fy2006 dod appropriations bill provided 40 million for conventional nonnuclear penetrator study committee staff indicated that the bill included the 45 million for dod and that the committees intent was that dod use the money to study integration of conventional penetrator onto the b2 the bill as passed by the house retained these provisions the senate armed services committees mark of s 1042 the fy2006 national defense authorization bill recommended providing the nnsa funds as requested but denying the dod funds on grounds that the dod program should await completion of nnsas feasibility study the senate provided 40 million for nnsa for rnep in hr 2419 rejecting an amendment by senator feinstein to delete the funds the senate appropriations committees mark of hr 2863 recommended eliminating dod funds requested for rnep on october 25 senator domenici said that nnsa had dropped its rnep request and planned to focus earth penetration on conventional weapons technology so he said energy and water conferees agreed to drop funding for rnep hr 1815 as signed into law pl 109360 provided funds for rnep but 40 million for dod for conventional penetrator study for fy2007 nnsa requested funds for rnep and has closed out the project accordingly this report will not be updated further contents

underground facilities to protect key assets conventional weapons are unable to destroy many such facilities though opinions differ on whether nonnuclear means can disable or isolate them surfaceburst nuclear weapons would have limited effectiveness against deeply buried facilities in contrast nuclear weapon that burrows into the ground few meters before detonating would be more effective because it would transfer much more of its energy into the ground the united states has one type of nuclear earth penetrator the b6111 bomb which was accepted into the stockpile in september 20011 that weapon though according to an article by several scientists from alamos national laboratory cannot survive delivery into certain types of terrain in which such hardened underground facilities may be located2 the administration proposes rnep as study of modifications to convert existing b83 nuclear bombs to an earth penetrator configuration another bomb the b61 had also been under consideration earlier the air force has been leading the study which started in may 2003 with nnsa in charge of studying modifications of specific warheads accordingly the department of defense dod and the national nuclear security administration nnsa which is the department of energy doe agency in charge of the us nuclear weapons program requested funds to study the robust nuclear earth penetrator rnep rnep has been the most controversial nuclear weapon program in congress for the past few years supporters argue that it is needed to attack hard and deeply buried targets such as leadership bunkers or wmd production facilities in countries of concern thereby deterring or defeating challenges from such nations critics assert that rnep would lower the threshold for use of nuclear weapons and prompt other nations to develop nuclear weapons to deter us attack secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said in may 2003 that rnep is study it is nothing more and nothing less3 the plan was that the rnep study

crs2 fy2003fy2005 while congress appropriated the fy2003 request of 150 million the fy2004 request met much criticism the house rejected an amendment by representative tauscher to transfer funds from rnep to conventional means of attacking buried targets the senate tabled an amendment by senator dorgan and another by senator feinstein to bar funds for rnep and adopted an amendment by senator nelson fl and similar amendment by senator reed to require congressional authorization to start development engineering discussed below or later phases of rnep the nelson amendment became section 3117 of pl 108 136 the fy2004 national defense authorization act congress reduced the fy2004 appropriation to 75 million in response to this reduction nnsa planned to spend almost all of the 75 million to study the b83 as an rnep candidate and little on the b61 study4 the b83 study was being conducted by lawrence livermore national laboratory in livermore ca and sandia national laboratories livermore branch the b61 study was the responsibility of alamos national laboratory alamos nm and sandia national laboratories headquarters site in albuquerque nm for fy2005 congress eliminated rnep funding for fy2006 the administration requested 40 million for nnsa to conduct sled test in which penetrator body would be shot down test track and slammed into material such as concrete block to help design and evaluate penetrators for fy2006 the administration also requested 45 million for dod to study linking rnep to the b2 bomber the appropriation was 40 million for dod to conduct the sled test to address some technical issues that have arisen in the rnep debates the bob stump national defense authorization act for fy2003 pl 107314 section 1033 called for national academy of sciences report on effects of nuclear and conventional earth penetrator weapons epws the report released in april 2005 had nine key conclusions 1 many highvalue buried facilities can be held at risk by nuclear but not conventional epws 2 penetration to depth of 3 meters captures most effects of epws on buried targets deeper penetration puts the weapon at greater risk 3 epws cannot penetrate deeply enough to contain nuclear weapon effects fully 4 casualties from nuclear weapon burst at shallow depth or on the surface are essentially the same 5 detonating nuclear weapon at shallow depth increases the energy transmitted to buried target permitting reduction in yield by factor of 15 to 25 6 attacks using nuclear epws near urban areas could produce thousands to over million casualties or hundreds to several hundred thousand for attacks in rural areas 7 nuclear epw could reduce civilian casualties in an urban area by factor of 2 to 10 compared to surfaceburst weapon with 25 times the yield 8 nuclear weapon would have to detonate within chamber where chemical or biological agents were stored to destroy the agents the same is true of nonnuclear thermobaric bombs which generate high heat and pressure and 9 in nuclear attack on chemical weapon facility nuclear effects would probably kill many more civilians than would the released chemical agent while nuclear attack on 3 continued myers

rl32599 bunker busters sources of confusion in the robust nuclear earth penetrator debate both by jonathan medalia any consideration of rnep in the second session of the 109th congress may hinge on whether the administration requests funds for the program in the fy2007 budget developments in the fy2005 budget cycle the fy2005 budget and plan congress required nnsa and doe before nnsa was created to provide fiveyear budget projection current year plus four outyears in the national defense authorization acts for fy1997 pl 104201 section 3155 fy2000 pl 10665 section 3253 and fy2001 pl 106398 sections 3154 and 3155 the fy2005 budget cycle was the first in which nnsa presented detailed outyear projection with the current request in the fy2005 request the projected figures for rnep were fy2005 request 276 million fy2006 950 million fy2007 1454 million fy2008 1284 million and fy2009 884 million for fiveyear total of 4847 million6 the fy2005 request also presented plan for rnep all figures for fy2005fy2009 are subject to congressional approval rejection or modification the research program for fy2003fy2009 was thus estimated to cost 4983 million 61 million spent for fy2003 75 million appropriated for fy2004 and 4847 million as noted for fy2005fy2009 if rnep were to proceed through development and production additional costs would include completing production engineering and manufacturing components to convert the selected weapon into an earth penetrator these figures include nnsa costs such as for the penetrator case but exclude air force costs for the guidance unit tail assembly guidance computer etc nnsa cannot provide an estimate of total program cost because it has not completed the cost study 5 national academy of sciences national research council division

directed stockpile work at httpwwwmbedoegovbudget05budgetindexhtm crs4 by way of background the departments of defense and energy agreed years ago to formal set of phases by which modified nuclear weapons move through research development production deployment and retirement often called the phase 6x process the key phases for rnep are phase 62 feasibility study and option down select phase 62a design definition and cost study phase 63 development engineering in which the nuclear weapons laboratories produce completed warhead design and phase 64 production engineering in which the design is adapted for production and system to manufacture the weapon is created in its fy2005 request nnsa stated the performance targets for rnep as follows fy2005 complete 56 of scheduled rnep phase 6262a activity further in fy2005 subsystem tests and full system test of the proposed design will be completed fy2006 complete 100 of scheduled rnep phase 6262a activity fy2007 report results of rnep phase 6262a to nuclear weapons council joint department of defense doddoe agency that coordinates nuclear weapon programs obtain if applicable rnep phase 63 appropriate authorization complete initial 25 of

15 of scheduled rnep phase 64 activity if appropriately authorized7 the fy2005 request therefore seemed to cast serious doubt on assertions that rnep is only study however nnsa administrator linton brooks stated we included funds in our outyear budget projections to comply with legislative requirements for fiveyear budget projections the outyear projections are placeholders in the event the president decides to proceed with development and congress approves decision will be made until the study is completed the law is clear that beginning 63 engineering development requires congressional approval8 the legislation that he referred to is pl 108136 fy2004 national defense authorization act section 3117 which states the secretary of energy may not commence the engineering development phase phase 63 of the nuclear weapons development process or any subsequent 7 department of energy fy 2005 congressional budget request vol 1 pp 69 70 76 8 letter from linton f brooks administrator nnsa to honorable ellen tauscher mar 17 2004 crs5 phase of robust nuclear earth penetrator weapon unless specifically authorized by congress an nnsa manager responsible for the program stated that if outyear funds were not included in the fy2005 budget nnsa would have faced two choices that it deemed unsatisfactory 1 by the time the budget for one fiscal year is submitted the budget for the next fiscal year is largely fixed without the placeholder decision to proceed with rnep could not have been implemented until the second fiscal year 2 alternatively without the placeholder decision to proceed with rnep could have been implemented promptly only by taking the needed funds out of other programs the budget projection reflects costs that might be expected if rnep were to proceed to phases 63 and 64 the manager emphasized that decision had been made on whether or not to proceed with those phases pending completion of the phase 6262a study9 the rnep study was initially projected to cost 45 million 15 million year for fy2003fy2005 the numbers however have changed for each year for fy2003 delay in submission of dod study required by the fy2003 national defense authorization act pl 107314 section 3146 delayed the start of nnsas rnep study so 61 million was spent of the 150 million appropriated for fy2004 congress cut the appropriation to 75 million for fy2005 the request was 276 million and the appropriation zero vs 150 million originally planned and for fy2006 the appropriation was zero for rnep but 40 million for related conventional penetrator study criticisms questions and responses critics reacted to the rnep budget projection and plan presented with the fy2005 request representative tauscher in letter to nnsa administrator linton brooks stated that this is the first notice that we have received of significantly ramped up activity and that the planning and budgeting for further steps in the 6x process in the next five years speaks to clear intent to develop these modified nuclear weapons at time when the feasibility study has not been completed and the department of defense has not submitted request for this weapon10 steven aftergood of the federation of american scientists argued that there are not fiveyear budgets for every research program that might lead to development he reportedly said if they had placeholders for every funding scenario theyd have to request an infinite amount of money this is an expression of intent to move ahead with an expanded program11 another critic jay coghlan director of nuclear watch of new mexico was quoted as saying the present administration is definitely seeking 9 telephone interview feb 10 2004 10 letter from representative ellen tauscher to linton brooks administrator national nuclear security administration mar 8 2004 11 paul richter questions raised about bomb plan angeles times mar 11 2004 p 12 crs6 to expand us nuclear capabilities while at the same time it denounces any kind of effort by others to do the same12 programmatic questions the following paragraphs present questions from representative tauschers letter responses from administrator brooks13 and additional information based on discussions with staff from nnsa alamos national laboratory and lawrence livermore national laboratory representative tauscher wrote for fy2005 the budget request describes the rnep activities as including subsystems tests and full system test of the proposed design such activities appear to go beyond research activities and may be interpreted to fall into 63 activities in your view why are such activities consistent with legislation passed by congress last year what specific activities would be associated with the initial year of 63 work on the rnep in fy2007 administrator brooks responded the subsystem and full system tests of the proposed design refer to impact tests to be performed on surrogate penetrator bodies at sandia national laboratories sled track facility these tests are consistent with the definition and requirements for phase 62 feasibility study we need to understand whether the penetrator bodies are survivable to ground penetration in the required geologies before feasibility can be assessed the context of this question is that the fy2004 national defense authorization act pl 108136 section 3117 requires specific congressional authorization before starting phase 63 or subsequent phases of rnep nnsa indicated that one type of physical test as distinct from computer simulation is planned as part of the 6262a study series of sled track tests at sandia national laboratories some would be done as full system tests in which the various components of an rnep would be assembled in penetrator body strong heavy pointed metal case without guidance system or fissile materials14 this assembly would be mounted on sled that is sent down track at high speed and slammed into large concrete block to test how well the components withstand the deceleration required of an earth penetrator weapon this type of test is included in the 6262a study because nnsa deems it essential to assess feasibility in turn successful demonstration of feasibility is necessary condition for the weapon to proceed to phase 63 in preparation for the full system tests number of subsystem sled tests will be conducted in which candidate rnep components are slammed into water target these were to have started in the third quarter of fy2005 and to be held at sandias sled track located at kirtland air force base in albuquerque nm 12 jeff tollefson santa fe new mexicancom mar 11 2004 13 letter from linton f brooks administrator nnsa to honorable ellen tauscher mar 17 2004 14 information provided march 1112 2004 crs7 more advanced tests would be conducted in phase 63 in one type vibration flyaround tests mockup of the weapon would be mounted on an aircraft and flown to validate that the weapon would not be damaged by the vibration of the aircraft and to determine the weapons aerodynamic stability in this test the device would not be released another type of test which would occur later in the development process once the guidance system was developed would involve dropping mockup of the weapon from an aircraft both types of test would use surrogate material heavy metal instead of fissile materials other tests would probably be conducted as well representative tauscher also asked with regard to the annual performance results and targets what technical military and other criteria would the nnsa consider and what decisions would be made before it requests legislative authorization to begin 63 work who is involved in the determination to begin 63 work and why does the budget indicate that this might happen in fy 2007 similarly what criteria would the nnsa use to base its decision to go from phase 63 to 64 in fy 2009 administrator brooks replied the national nuclear security administration nnsa does not make the decision to proceed to phase 63 or subsequent phases if nnsa and the air force agree that the phase 6262a study results support proceeding to phase 63 engineering development the nuclear weapons council nwc could consider whether to proceed further if the nwc recommends going forward nnsa would move beyond the study stage only if the president approves and funds are authorized and appropriated by the congress he further stated that the criteria nwc would use in this decision include the feasibility and military utility of the design definition and the projected cost and schedule established in the phase 6262a study and that if rnep does proceed to 63 the president and congress will make separate decision on whether to proceed to phase 64 production engineering to support decision to move rnep to phase 63 nnsa would address cost schedule and feasibility while the air force would address military requirements as hypothetical example nnsa might say that an rnep would have specified cost could be ready by certain date and would have certain characteristics weight accuracy depth of penetration etc the air force might decide not to proceed if the penetration ability was too low or if nonnuclear alternative existed or it might recommend proceeding if the proposed rnep was the only way to accomplish what it considered critical military mission the decision to request congressional approval would be worked through the nuclear weapons council and ultimately be made by the president the decision on whether or not to proceed with phase 63 was projected to occur in fy2007 because the phase 6262a study was expected to conclude late in fy2006 with elimination of rnep funds for fy2005 and fy2006 these decisions would be set back they would be rendered moot if the administration chooses not to proceed with the program which might be revealed in the fy2007 request crs8 rnep budget and need for congressional approval for many members the fiveyear cost of rnep as presented in the fy2005 budget document came as surprise not only in the amount but also in what appeared to be an intent contrary to legislation barring phase 63 or greater work on rnep without congressional authorization senator domenici said i was surprised to see that the request that nearly 500 million is provided for the robust nuclear earth penetrator in the out year funding the department doe should not assume such large sums in its budget without congressional approval or direction i want it explained to this committee unequivocally what we are doing and what we are authorizing and what we are not doing and what we are not authorizing because nobody on this committee is voting to do this were voting to study it if it wins but not to do it to study it is small amount of money to do it is lot of money15 senator reid said to nnsa administrator linton brooks i am little concerned maybe even put off by the notion that youve included half billion dollars in your out year spending plan as what you call place holder for bunker busting pending white house and congressional decisions im not sure that we can allow this to go forward this is large place holder many remain unconvinced that this is an appropriate path16 senator kennedy said to secretary of energy spencer abraham youre rushing ahead with the nuclear weapons including the mininukes and the nuclear bunker busters ill give you chance to be able to explain how this program which was 45 million two years ago is now up to almost 5 billion why are we going ahead and are going to be requesting 5 billion from congress on new nuclear weapons the bunker buster17 in colloquy senator warner expressed his concern on the rnep budget and secretary abraham offered an explanation senator warner lets talk about the robust nuclear earth penetrator and i was looking at the out years and particularly 2006 looking at fairly substantial increase and i bring to your attention the fact in 2004 the department of energy we put in the legislation may not proceed to the engineering development phase three or to subsequent phases without specific authorization from congress and can you correlate that substantial 06 bump up with this statutory provision which i hope will remain 15 us congress senate committee on appropriations subcommittee on energy and water development fy2005 budget of the

to move from stage of research or preliminary inquiry to the engineering phase we are required to provide fiveyear budgets however so that people can look down the road and make proper sort of assessment of what potential expenses will be18 is there military requirement for rnep another concern is that there is military requirement for rnep senator reed is there specific military requirement for the rnep today secretary abraham it was the conclusion of the nuclear posture review that threat that needed to be addressed in the 21st century in the immediate period ahead of us would be hard deeply buried targets number of approaches to dealing with that were then asked to be researched this is just one of them its threat that rose to the level of being included in that review senator reed theres doubt about the threat but its your opinion that the position of the administration is there is specific military requirement for the rnep not for device to counter deeply buried targets but for the rnep is that your position secretary abraham the position of the administration is that we should inquire about or that we should make inquiries and investigate variety of approaches to dealing with the hard deeply buried target whether or not this approach is feasible is the first question and the second is whether or not its preferable to other approaches that would involve conventional weapons and we have not completed the first phase of that inquiry let alone the second19 nnsa has stated that requirement has been used in two senses20 before dod or nnsa start concept study there is perceived need for capability this type of need used to be called requirement but dod now uses the term desired capabilities and characteristics in the case of rnep this perceived need has reportedly been documented in classified form an unclassified document dealt more generally with defeat of hard and deeply buried targets21 requirement is also used for specific weapon as applied to the acquisition process according to nnsa dod will not have an acquisition requirement before there is well defined system or component for them to acquire in the nuclear weapon life cycle that will not occur until the completion of the phase 2a62a study 18 ibid p 8 19 ibid p 18 20 nnsa provided the information in this paragraph on apr 1 2004 21 us departments of defense and energy report to congress on the defeat of hard and deeply buried targets submitted by the secretary of defense in conjunction with the secretary of energy in response to section 1044 of the floyd d

committee and s 2400 as reported from the senate armed services committee both contained the full amount requested for rnep 276 million the house armed services committee strongly reaffirms the importance of the rnep phase 6262a study it further stated the committee also takes note that recent defense science board task force study on future strategic strike forces specifically recommended that research be initiated on nuclear weapons that produce much lower collateral damage than those weapons in the existing nuclear stockpile the committee also reminds the nnsa that any efforts beyond study could only be pursued if the president approves and funds are authorized and appropriated by congress22 representatives tauscher markey skelton dicks allen and spratt offered an amendment on

remains unconvinced by the department of energys superficial assurance that the rnep activity is only study and that advanced concepts is only skills exercise for weapons designers the committee notes that the management direction for fiscal year 2004 sent to the directors of the weapons design laboratories left little doubt that the objective of the program was to advance the most extreme new nuclear weapon goals irrespective of any reservations expressed by congress the committees priorities are maintaining our nations nuclear deterrent in safe and secure condition and maintaining our nations integrity in the international effort to halt the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction the departments obsession with launching new round of nuclear weapons development runs counter to those priorities the committee directs the nnsa to focus wholly on its primary mission of maintaining the safety security and viability of the existing stockpile 25 on june 25 the house considered the

acknowledged in an interview30 another report stated sen pete domenici r nm one of the chief backers of rnep and aci funding in congress told reporters this week that he agreed to the spending cuts for both programs in order to get the omnibus bill finished31 developments in the fy2006 budget cycle the fy2006 rnep request for fy2006 nnsa cast program more modest in its cost scope and schedule than it was for fy2005 rather than show fiveyear projection nnsa recognizing that separate decision would be needed to go beyond the study phase projected cost for the study only ending in fy2007 and reduced the scope of the study from the b83 and b61 to the b83 only as result the cost was much lower 40 million for fy2006 and 140 million for fy200732 as ambassador brooks explained the reason the level is so much less is we have cut back on what it is that we propose to do originally we proposed to examine two different warheads fundamentally what were doing is taking warhead putting very hard case on it controlling its attitude very precisely so that it can penetrate few meters into rock and still stay intact and go off that way the energy goes into the ground weve concluded that we can demonstrate whether or not the concept is feasible by looking at only one warhead we selected the b83 which is one of the two bombs we were looking at because that was where we were when the program was stopped33 further nnsa stated the robust nuclear earth penetrator rnep category includes funding for the phase 622a air forceled study the decision to complete this study was reaffirmed with dod

action by the congress on rnep we asked the department of defense to review the continuing need the secretary of defense personally reviewed that and at his direct personal request we have included the money in the budget for this year he did this not because hes particularly interested in developing new weapon but because there are adversaries who are building deeply buried facilities and it is unwise for there to be anything thats beyond the reach of us power40 according to press report secretary of defense donald rumsfeld wrote memo in january 2005 to thensecretary of energy spencer abraham that stated i think we should request funds in fy06 and fy07 to complete the rnep study you can count on my support for your efforts to revitalize the nuclear weapons infrastructure and to complete the rnep study41 there was also suggestion that dods request was crucial to does decision to include rnep in the fy2006 budget according to press report the reason the money was put in the budget was the result of direct request from the defense department to finish the study said anson franklin spokesman for the energy departments national nuclear security administration the secretary of defense was consulted and based on that information we put it back in the budget42 37 continued operation and maintenance air force volume i feb 2005 p 87 available at

times online edition february 8 2005 crs16 legislative activity the house appropriations committee recommended eliminating nnsa funds for rnep from the energy and water development bill hr 2419 as it did in the fy2005 bill the report stated the committee continues to oppose the diversion of resources and intellectual capital away from the more serious issues that confront the management of the nations nuclear deterrent primarily the transformation of the cold war nuclear weapons complex and existing stockpile into sustainable enterprise the committee has been disappointed at the bureaucracys adherence to an initiative that threatens congressional and public support for sustainable stockpile initiatives that will actually provide longterm security and deterrent value for the nation43 the house passed the bill 41613 on may 24 with amendments on rnep and only few brief mentions of it in prepared remarks note that the bill did not address the air force rnep request which fell under the jurisdiction of the dod appropriations subcommittee the house armed services committee recommended providing the dod rnep funds as requested but transferring the 40 million in nnsa funds to separate program in dod in explaining the transfer the committees report stated based on the applicability of the sled test results to various options for hdbt hard and deeply buried target defeat the committee believes that this nnsa rnep study is more appropriately conducted under program element within the department of defense44 accordingly the committee authorizes 40 million in pe program element 64327f for penetrator test that would evaluate the feasibility of various options for different types of penetrators that could hold hdbts at risk the committee intends that this study be completed by the end of fiscal year 200645 however 23 of the 28 committee democrats stated that the report language could be construed to allow the sled test to inform whether nuclear payload could be used in highspeed penetration of hard geologies and urged that the test should be conducted in manner that only informs conventional payloads46 the house passed the bill hr 1815 39039 on may 25

purpose in mind the house appropriations committees fy2006 dod appropriations bill hr 2863 contained 40 million for conventional penetrator study as new program under hard and deeply buried target defeat system48 further it retained 45 million within the categories nuclear weapons support and primary combat weapons that was requested for integrating rnep with the b249 committee staff explained that the committee intended that the study be of nonnuclear means of hard and deeply buried target defeat and not of rnep as corollary the staff continued since the rnep study was not funded but the 45 million was linked to the b2 the committee intended that the latter sum be used to study integrating conventional earth penetrators with the b250 the house passed hr 2863 39819 on june 20 with change to the foregoing provisions51 the senate armed services committee reported the defense authorization bill s 1042 on may 17 it recommended eliminating the 45 million in dod funding on grounds that evaluation of rnep feasibility by the department of energy is not scheduled to be completed prior to 200752 further the committee does not believe that these activities are necessary to evaluate the feasibility of rnep53 the committee recommended providing the 40 million that nnsa requested for rnep54 the senate began considering the bill on july 20 on july 22 the senate debated an amendment

line 66 nuclear weapons support also under line 66 it eliminated another 14 million requested for counterproliferation support to counter future threats such as deeply buried targets while the conference on the energy and water bill was underway senator domenici issued press release stating that nnsa had dropped its request for continued research on rnep and that conferees had therefore dropped rnep funding according to the senator the focus will now be with the defense department and its research to earth penetrating technology using conventional weaponry the nnsa indicated that this research should evolve around more conventional weapons rather than tactical nuclear devices with this department change in policy we have agreed not to provide doe with funding for rnep57 the

2005 clarification of key points in fy2006 hearings hearings in 2005 added information on topics that may arise in any future debate such as the yield of rnep the collateral damage the weapon would likely cause and the military requirement for rnep the following colloquy occurred at hearing in february representative terry everett could you please tell directly if theres military need for this for robust earth nuclear earth penetrator secretary of defense donald rumsfeld it is question thats difficult to answer because sometimes they say military requirement and thats formal process there was military requirement for military aircraft for example there was military requirement for unmanned aerial vehicles until they came along and so what i believe there is need for the study which is what were talking about here and not weapon were talking about taking existing weapons and doing study to see if they can be reduced in their power their lethality to level thats lower than the current weapons are so that they might have the ability to penetrate the earth in way that could help protect the united states of america i think that it is clearly in our countrys interest to do the study has it speaking to general richard myers chairman joint chiefs of staff you want to comment on whether theres quote military requirement specifically general myers you bet our combatant commander that is charged by this nation to worry about countering the kind of targets deeply buried targets certainly thinks theres need for this study and general cartwright has said such i think that i think the joint chiefs think that and so the study is that its not commitment to go forward with system its just to see if its feasible60 this colloquy occurred at hearing in march representative ellen tauscher i just want to know is there any way an rnep of any size that we would drop will not produce huge amount of radioactive debris nnsa administrator linton brooks there is not representative tauscher secretary rumsfeld last week confused the debate over the rnep when he told our committee that the rnep study is taking existing weapons and doing study to see if they can be reduced in their power lethality to level that is lower than current weapons my understanding was that the rnep study was not going to change the physics 59 us congress committee of conference

2005 transcript by federal news service pp 3031 crs20 package of the warhead but simply look at ways to repackage the device so it can penetrate hard geologies am i right or are you also looking at lowering the yield of say the b83 to perhaps under five kilotons administrator brooks we are not looking at changing the yield of the physics package ambassador brooks i really must apologize for my lack of precision if we in the administration have suggested that it was possible to have bomb that penetrated far enough to trap all fallout i dont believe that i dont believe the laws of physics will ever let that be true this is nuclear weapon this is nuclear weapon that is going to be hugely destructive and destructive over large area sane person would use weapon like that lightly and i regret any impression that anybody including has given that would suggest that this is going to be any easier decision i mean if this weapon were in the arsenal today it would still be hugely difficult decision for any president to even contemplate it so i the administration believes and i personally believe that this study should continue but it i want to i do want to make it clear that any thought of sort of nuclear weapons that arent really destructive is just nuts61 to summarize the foregoing passages by clarifying several points that were at issue in earlier debates on rnep may help focus any future debate there is formal military requirement for rnep there is considerable interest by dod and the armed services in learning through the proposed rnep study whether rnep is feasible the possible conversion of b83 bomb to an rnep would not involve changing the yield of the weapon rnep and probably any other nuclear earth penetrator would not penetrate the ground deeply enough to contain fallout use of rnep would therefore cause huge amount of fallout and destruction because rnep if it is deployed would be nuclear weapon presidential decision to use it would be very difficult developments in the fy2007 budget cycle nnsa requested funds for rnep for fy2007 the program appears nowhere in its fy2007 request document62 nnsa stated in january 2006 that it 61 testimony
