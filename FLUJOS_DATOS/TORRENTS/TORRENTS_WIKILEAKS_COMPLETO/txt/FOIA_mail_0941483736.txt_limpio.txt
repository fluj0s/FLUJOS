from tom wigley wigleymeekerucaredu to mike hulme mhulmeueaacuk subject re confidential cru scenarios date mon 1 nov 1999 141536 0700 mst cc rwatsonworldbankorg dear mike thanks for your detailed response about your use of the sres scenarios im sure it will be useful to bob watson i wish i could explain better what bobs problem entails it is intensely political my judgement is that if i tell you more then this will indirectly help bob in answering the questions posed of him by sensenbrenner particularly should bob need to get back to you please note that this is confidential information please note too that i am making my own judgement on this in the interest of clarifying complex issue i have not been authorized by bob or anyone associated with ipcc to divulge this information the stated concern of sensenbrenner is that the use of the sres scenarios prior to their ratification might in some way jeopardize ipccs independence and objectivity sensenbrenner apparently uses as guidelines in making his judgement ipccs principles as approved in vienna austria in october 1998 together with june 11 and 28 1999 letters giving appendix to the principles which is entitled procedures for the preparation review acceptance approval and publication of ipcc reports which was approved in april 1999 sensenbrenner implies that these documents raise concerns about the use of preliminary ipcc material by dr wigley and the pew center on global climate change for nonipcc purposes apparently without ipcc sanction he considers that these issues are significant because they relate directly to the integrity of the ipcc process in my case i bypassed the ipcc process by obtaining permission in writing from the 4 groups who produced the marker scenarios i did not acknowledge the ciesin web site in your case apparently you did the problem here is that this site stated very clearly that the data were not for citation or quotation did you take notice of this my view is and has always been that contributors to such data sets or distribution sites do not give up the intellectual property rights to their own data they could do so of course by signing appropriate legalcopyright documents but i have never done this nor as far as i know has anyone who contributed to the ciesin site this is why i went to the individual authors in order to obtain permission to use their data in my pew report i hope you can see that there is an important difference between what you did and what i did at face value it would appear that you have ignored the clearlystated message that the ciesin site data were not for citation or quotation more on this point below you refer back to the july 1998 bureau meeting agreeing that the preliminary sres scenarios in your words could and should be used by scientists from my reading of the background material this is subtly wrong the bureau only agreed that the data could be used by the gcm modeling community as it happens i am part of that community and i acted as the interface between the scenarios and the rest of the ncar gcm team providing sres data to them in form that could be used for our gcm runs i do not think you can claim to have filled this particular and quite specific role in your work however there are some interesting subtleties here that i think vindicate your position the issue is what is meant by the gcm modeling community in my view anyone who uses gcm data either to provide data sets to the impacts community or to carry out diagnostic studies directly to improve gcms is part of this community note that this does not allow one to include the impacts modelers as part of the gcm community the two stated aspects are precisely what you do furthermore scengen which i presume you have used in your work makes direct use of gcms in order to produce spatiallyspecific climate results based on any given emissions scenarios including the sres scenarios the scengen method is simply an alternative way of translating emissions scenarios into gcmbased and gcmtype output in my view anyone using the sres scenarios in the development of scengen or applying scengen to produce spatiallyspecific climate results for dissemination to others must be included as part of the gcm modeling community referred to in the bureaus agreement regarding use of the sres scenarios you may have interpreted the bureaus statements even more broadly than this but this is of consequence since what you have done also falls squarely within the more restricted interpretation that i have given above nevertheless i think it would have been wiser for you to have done things the way i did rather than to have acknowledged the ciesin site as your source the next issue raised in your email concerns the ddc i have not looked at this site but i presume it duplicates what was on the ciesin site if so then its use and the use of the preliminary sres data must be controlled by the rules under which the ddc was set up and operates the key questions therefore are 1 do these rules allow the use of these data by anyone 2 do the sres data as it appears on this site include the statement not for citation or quotation 3 does this make moot the whole issue of the use of the sres scenarios in other words if these data are available to all and sundry with restrictions through ddc then one can complain about their use although in your case since you acknowledged ciesin rather than ddc you may still be subject to criticism what this could amount to is loophole in the ipcc rules of procedure sensenbrenner might then argue that this loophole should be closed by clarifying and tightening the rules for the ddc the bottom line is that i think you have done things in perfectly legitimate way even acknowledging the ciesin site is legitimate since your primary application was in the production of climate change scenarios as member of the gcm modeling community as i believe this community should be defined you have then distributed these results to the global climate impacts community who in turn will be feeding their results back into the ipcc process through wgii your chosen method of distribution especially the wwf pathway might be judged as less than ideal but i cannot see anything that you have done that goes explicitly or implicitly against ipcc regulations below the bottom line is the concern expressed by sensenbrenner that these actions yours and mine might in some way have undermined the integrity of the ipcc process it would be interesting to hear from sensenbrenner just how he thinks that might have happened all we have done is distribute credible and defensible scientific information if this information were to be in conflict with the currently bestavailable science this might be an issue of concern but it is not the more such credible scientific information is distributed to the community particularly when it is presented in an easilyread nontechnical yet authoritative way the better i can see way that this can distort the ipcc process some people however appear to think that it might less kind interpretation might be that they are just trying to slow down the process by tying it up in legal and procedural knots but i have evidence that this is what they are trying to do i hope you can see from the above quotes and somewhat convoluted arguments what legal and political minefield this is these sorts of issues do not seem to arise outside of the usa but here they take on an enormous importance one must tread very cautiously cheers tom on sat 30 oct 1999 mike hulme wrote bob you will have seen tom wigleys email asking about the climate scenarios i prepared for wwf and which were distributed 2 weeks ago i have just got back from trip away and am concerned that you are concerned hence my immediate reply these cruwwf regionalnational scenarios do use the preliminary sres98 emissions scenarios that are posted on the ciesin and ipcc ddc web sites the cruwwf reports state that preliminary emissions scenarios sre used they acknowledge the ciesin source of these emissions and they make it clear that the derived climate scenarios are the work and responsibility of the authors alone maybe some background would help explain why i do not think that from my perspective there is cause for concern although i am aware of the criticism the sres report has increasingly been receiving and that the issues are bigger than i may realise __________________________________________ july 98 ipcc bureau meeting agreed that the preliminary sres emissions scenarios could and should be used by scientists in their unapproved form dec 98 the above was reiterated to wgi scientists at the paris meeting in particular it was recognised that sar science would have to be used in the interim ie next 1218 months to generate the climatic and consequently impact implications of the sres emissions jan 99 the sres open process ended the ipcc ddc placed the preliminary sres98 emissions scenarios on the open ddc web site as requested by the ipcc task group on climate scenarios for impact assessment chair martin parry the objective of the ddc right from its original 1997 commission was to provide timely access to emissions scenarios observed climate datasets and new gcm experiments all of which would be assessed in the ipcc tar thus enabling impact scientists worldwide to construct and apply consistent climate scenarios this information has already been used by several 100 scientists including many in developing countries only in this way would it be at all possible for wgii to have access to impactadaptation science that was in any way consistent with the wgiii sres emissions and wgi climate modelling material the placing of the sres98 emissions on the ddc web site was widely discussed in the tgcia and was publicised at the time to the research community using the ddc including through the a4flier advertising the ddc that was sent to the wgi and wgii mailing list feb 99 hulmecarter used the preliminary sres98 emissions and other ddc products to develop climate scenarios for the european union as part of the eufunded acacia assessment unrelated to toms usbased acacia the approach i took in using the sres98 emissions for the acacia climate scenarios was my decision and was not part of any ipcc activity the acacia climate scenarios and indeed entire eu acacia impacts assessment have been widely reviewed within europe and are part of the draft report presented to brussels last month they will published in their final form in june 2000 this euacacia activity has done in my view exactly what the ddc was intended to do namely allow impact scientists to generate results using consistent scenarios and assumptions these results provide the raw material for ipcc to assess in their tar chapters my approach for converting the preliminary sres98 emissions into climate scenarios is also being used in many other eu and ukfunded impact research programmes and is generating variety of scientific reports and papers several of the latter are under peerreview at the moment and may be citeable in time for the 2ndorder wgii drafts is an apology needed for this activity if so then i and others on the ipcc tgcia totally misunderstood the brief of the ddc and the intent of the july 98 and dec 98 ipcc decisions may 99 wwf commissioned to prepare set of nationalregional climate scenarios for them to launch in october 1999 it seemed entirely appropriate and legitimate to to use the same method i had adopted for euacacia to generate these wwf scenarios june 99 toms pew report was published using sres98 emissions is not dissimilar way to ie using them to drive simple climate model based on sar science july 99 following some controversy over the pew report there was an email circular from wgi tsu griggs reminding that there was active encouragement from ipcc for scientists to use the preliminary sres98 emissions in modelling work the conditions were that it should be stated that they were unapproved by ipcc ie preliminary and that work using them should ideally be peerreviewed and published tom wigley followedup on this circular by explaining his use of sres98 in the pew report the conditions he met and his justification for using them i noted this correspondence at the time and did not feel that my use of sres98 emissions in my wwf work was out of order oct 99 the 15 sets of cruwwf regionalnational scenarios were published and widely distributed by wwf these leaflets state that preliminary ipcc emissions scenarios are used acknowledge the source of these emissions as the ciesin site and make clear that the climate scenarios are the work of the authors alone and other organisation furthermore the approach i have taken which i originally designed back in december 1998 has been subject to diversity of peerreview activities and will shortly be published _______________________________ sorry for making this lengthy reply but it seems best to spell out the history and my thinking to avoid any room for misunderstanding in summary the only two grounds on which i think i could be criticised for using the sres98 emissions in my cruwwf climate scenarios are if 1 the ipcc ddc was wrong to put the sres98 emissions on its web site back in january 1999 and to publicise its purpose in doing so if we were wrong then this error goes back to january 1999 and the tgcia fundamentally misunderstood its brief 2 the pronouncements of the ipcc in july 1998 and december 1998 were intended to apply only to scientists who had formal role in the ipcc and that the sres98 emissions could only be used for official ipcc scientific activities whatever these may be this would draw very dubious line between science done for ipcc and science done not for ipcc ipccs brief is to assess all done by matter whom or for what purpose best wishes mike dr mike hulme reader

wigleymeekerucaredu to mike hulme mhulmeueaacuk cc robert watson rwatsonworldbankorg subject confidential cru scenarios date 27 october 1999 1902 in strictest confidence dear mike bob watson contacted last week asking about some climate results that he apparently saw on the cru andor wwf web pages the cru web site states that you have produced and already distributed set of regional scenario leaflets based on new ghg emissions scenarios which i think is what bob may be concerned about i hope that new does not refer to the sres scenarios you may recall that when i was in cru i showed you in confidence letter from f james sensenbrenner chairman of the us house of representatives committee on science criticizing ipcc for allowing to use these scenarios in my pew report unfortunately this issue is not going away and any further perceived misuse of the sres scenarios prior to their ipcc ratification would exacerbate the problem considerably i do hope therefore that you have not used the sres scenarios i expect not since i explained the potential problems to you in july please reassure and bob if by chance you have used the sres scenarios but not yet distributed the wwf leaflets i urge you to hold fire until you have contacted bob best wishes tom tom ml wigley senior scientist national center for atmospheric research po box 3000 boulder co 803073000 usa phone
