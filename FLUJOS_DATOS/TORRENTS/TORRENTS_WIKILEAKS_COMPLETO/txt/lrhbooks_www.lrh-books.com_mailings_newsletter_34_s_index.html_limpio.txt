bridge publications inc newsletter date effectiveness and being serious failure is merely the gradient scale of death if person fails too many times hes going to die thats certain because this society will deny him food clothing and shelter if he fails too many times he will die its all right to cut your finger but dont cut your throat cutting the finger is little bit of dying if you cut your finger too hard and too solidly you could kill yourself in other words this is the way people look at this thats their gradient scale of failure the gradient scale of defeat and they regard life seriously just to the degree that they regard death seriously and they regard failure and defeat seriously just to the degree that they will regard the whole computation of survival how serious is it that you live well if youre going to die it becomes very serious that you live becomes serious business and person actually is situated on the tone scale to the degree that they are serious about living they are also effective in inverse ratio to their seriousness you can show any person who is taking it very very very seriously and ill show you long chain of failures person gets most serious about living when he is dying l ron hubbard excerpted from the scientology milestone one lectures incidents before earth an article by l ron hubbard from the scientology milestone one lectures you sit here on earth today not as race of people who go back down an evolutionary track on earth but as an evolutionary race or race which goes back into the depths of this galaxy now it would be very well if youd always lived on earth it would be fine but your organism is adapted to earth or you have adapted this organism to earth the possibilities are high that you have actually an evolutionary line here on earth that your organism did an evolution here on earth but this in wise means that you as theta individual are that evolutionary line because you see that is protoplasm line that is what were calling the genetic line protoplasm and its cycle is preconception conception birth procreation preconception and so on in other words it just keeps going up the line up the line as an unending stream of protoplasm going through earth time and that unending stream of protoplasm goes through earth time give good attention to that it goes through earth time and it has on it various stages of evolution now evidently you went through these very rapidly because you were quite knowledgeable and i dont think you have too much in common with the animals of earth that again is open somewhat to question but you really dont have anything in common with tiger or jackal or even the monkeys in the zoo youll notice that the whole public came up and screamed like banshees the second that darwin came in with monkeys well there was good reason to youve gone through notunlikeamonkey form but youve never been monkeys and you probably went up through this span very rapidly and probably you werent even in the organism at the time it came up that line you get the idea well you can follow that protoplasm line back you can even follow semblance of theta line back on that protoplasm line you get the idea genetic background the organism which you inhabit then has background it has background which is genetic background which is even paralleled by spur theta line background which yet is not you but which can influence you so when you start running somebody back down the time track back through the evolutionary ages you actually depart from moment when he was he and where that point is i dont know but you depart from that and you go straight on back through some rapid stages of evolution here on earth in other words youve got whole theta line now this line does not come down to earth carrying any body there isnt protoplasm line extended onto earth to parallel that line but back here there is theres line that ends there and this line is what youd call your mest body line and it probably will be found to have interruptions in other words there isnt an unending stream of protoplasm that matches you as an individual but there are probably many streams of protoplasm that match you as an individual you see maybe you went through whole cycle back here sometime or other and chopped the protoplasm line and migrated or went someplace else and then after lapse started another protoplasm line or dubbed into another protoplasm line and then finished that line and so forth and here on earth youll find here you are arriving on earth protoplasm line ends there you arrive as thetai line and dub in on the earth theta line and the protoplasm line on earth which was already continuing you follow that you should know this pretty well because this is track youre going to put your preclears back down and im not telling you for the sake of fancy theory im telling you to keep from getting into trouble with your preclear history of the theta line the history which can be roughly sketched at this time is more or less as follows and what were going to follow now is just the theta body line that goes back and here is thetae plus thetai thetae plus thetai and this is present time and this is theta body line and this is earth this is the spot where it joins earth earth and then we come back from here and we go through cycle here which may have points on it and undoubtedly does which weve not determined and it comes all the way back here and here is origin this origin at some unimaginable length of time in the past certainly in terms of millions of years perhaps in terms of hundreds of millions of years perhaps even in terms of thousands of millions of years which would be billions and perhaps even in terms of otheruniverse years as distinct from this universe and its planets way back here at origin you get the first separation from theta and that actually would be incident one incident one now there are many other incidents follow that there is by the way little bit of grief on that and you can run that on preclears you can run it on any of your preclears youll find incident one theres little grief on that separation now you should be able to recognize incident one as distinctly different from the other incidents which im going to point out to you incident one just sort of separates from theta and sort of joins in on universe and there is that moment of separation and theres little bit of down tone scale of course because naturally it has joined into something resembling mest if not mest itself and its joined mest so immediately that the theta joins mest you get drop on the tone scale so naturally theres an emotional curve on it and you can run that incident you can find that incident in practically any preclear you lay your hands on incident one incident one then is separation from theta now we come up the track and we find what is actually heavy facsimile one im calling it facsimile one in these talks its term would be called heavy facsimile one the facsimiles or the incidents which occurred prior to heavy facsimile one are very light compared to facsimile one according to our present knowledge you understand that by facsimile one i dont mean thats the first time person took recording and the reason thats called heavy facsimile one or service facsimile one is it is basic on the service facsimile chain this is basic on the service facsimile chain you dont have to have this one to run this one you dont have to have incident one to run heavy facsimile one but this is the beginning on the service facsimile chain facsimile one and the invader race now its very simple incident but very difficult to run its very patterned and you can run it without much trouble it simply consists of this the race with its bodies and so forth inhabiting place in this universe planet in this universe was hit by infiltrated by an incoming race now the race to which we are native the theta line to which we are native was actually highly mystic it was capable of lot of things telepathy teleportation odds and ends stuff and concentrated rather heavily in that this invader race came in and says with lot of electronics and said boys all youve got to do is take this little jimdandy whizzer and you know you will be twice as thetesque as before they sold you all bill of goods and evidently we didnt penetrate their minds their thoughts or their intentions because one right after the other bang bang bang bang bang they knocked us off they knocked us off with very simple apparatus and that simple apparatus consisted of something that went around your head and across the top of your head and under your chin under your throat and back of your head and everything pointed at the pineal they turned on the juice and something came in the middle of the head toward the pineal three points on the top of the head toward the pineal from under the throat up at the pineal from the back of the head into the pineal and from the sides of the jaws into the pineal in other words every point of entrance toward the pineal was hit suddenly and hard and very excruciatingly the net result the pineal gland which at that time occupied what you had as skull and was practically all the skull there was practically folded up and your mystic powers more or less went by the boards before earth incident then you went ahead and dramatized it and there are lot of overt acts on it and pretty soon you got so bad as race that perhaps you were elsewhere by this time you were hauled up oh some long long long long time later maybe even million years later you eventually wound up before another crew and this other crew said we dont want you around anymore and were going to send you to jail and so they packaged you up and shipped you off and that is an incident we call before earth be thats before earth and they shipped you off and you wound up here and all they did was transport your theta line here and you joined in on the mest body line here i dont know too much about the modus operandi that worked at that time but they evidently had it in mind it contains by the way sort of being put in an ice cube state its quite nice and by the way the early christian hell was painted up as hot hell and cold hell and you see the early christian paintings have guys up to the ice cube up to the neck now thats two hundred about two hundred ad you find them doing this now when you got down here to earth theres probably joinup line and then there is seriesprobably theres some overt acts here on earth and overt act facsimiles and then theres present time but the incidents youre trying to run on case are actually heavy facsimile one and be as the principal incidents really and dont get them mixed up here because theres bt before time and you can reach this on preclear by asking before time and theres facsimile one which is back here someplace its about million years ago or million two hundred thousand years ago it varies from person to person but its in the order of magnitude of million years and then theres rejection be being kicked off onto earth and earth is hell and youre here i guess until you get reformed but theres race existing right now out in outer space and this race is not very interested in you not very interested and some of you by the way without much trouble can do contact across because some of your theta line stayed out there but there are the incidents which you will find of principal interest in the preclear and these are the incidents which you will have to run out of the preclear if youre going to take somebody off the top of the dial im sorry if it stretches your credulity i do hope however that it doesnt stretch it to the point where you wont operate on it l ron hubbard from the lecture principle incidents on the theta line whizzer slang something or someone extraordinary or wonderful thetai theta individual thetae theta earth excerpted from the scientology milestone one lectures test your knowledge of the scientology milestone one lectures effectiveness and being serious incidents before earth test your knowledge with this ot quiz blow the lid off whole track memory why are these lectures important the breakthroughs presented here signal crucial turning point in mans understanding of himself and his place in the universe here is nothing less than the empirical discovery of the human soul and the launch of new subject to study its full nature capabilities and potentials scientology technology here is the description of how ron used the first emeter to uncover and chart the theta line that timeless spaceless influence that animates motivates controls and forms matter energy space and time here are the breakthroughs which shattered the one life lie that had trapped mankind revealing the whole track of spiritual existence scientology is the study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself universes and other life and this is the lecture series where it all began here are some examples of what you will find out in this series how you can be in more than one place at one time mysticism magic and religion and why they failed to find the answers what the difference is between the genetic line and the theta line how rons fiction stories relate to whole track recall what happened to you before earth and why were you sent here how to win over 15 or 11 just with your body motions alone the difference between having faith and being faith how being deals with motion at various levels of the tone scale the fourteen characteristics of theta how the body is built and animated where fear of death comes from the source of ringing in the ears what facsimile one is how constructive criticism reduces an individuals selfdeterminism what trick thought is doing in the material universe why you have to go earlier lifetimes in auditing the goal of scientology and how to reach milestone one complete ability the steps
