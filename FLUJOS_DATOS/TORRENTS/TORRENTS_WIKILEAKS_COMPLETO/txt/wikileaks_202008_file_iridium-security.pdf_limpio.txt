user verification simbased piniridium confidential7 authentication the iridium system supports the gsmspecified algorithm a3 for authentication security in sim based subscriber equipment the iridium authentication process is adapted without change directly from the gsm specifications the gsm algorithm a3 is used to encrypt authentication information transmitted over the air interface authentication encryption designed to prevent isu cloning fraud gsm encryption algorithm a3 is executed on sim card to generate signed result sres response based on the following inputs secret ki parameter stored in sim card rand parameter supplied by network iridium confidential8 hardwareequipment validation eir equipment identity register simply white list and black list the eir is database when isu requests services from the network its imei international mobile equipment identity is checked against the eir to assess which category it falls into blacklisted isus are not allowed to access the network those reported stolen or whose operation on the network will adversely affect the network whitelisted isus are those that are permitted to access the networkiridium confidential9 iridium channel security iridium voice data and signaling channels are afforded some security by the limited distribution of the air interface and feederlinkinterface specifications the iridium air interface specification is made available only to iridium subscriber unit isu manufacturers iridium satellite llc is the sole isu manufacturer feederlink interface specifications are not distributed outside of motorola opportunities for surreptitious monitoring of iridium bearer channels exist an eavesdropper could in principle monitor lband channels uplink from isu to space vehicle sv downlink from sv to isu kband channels uplink from gateway to space vehicle sv downlink from sv to gateway iridium confidential10 iridium link monitoring opportunities eavesdropperiridium confidential11 lband channel security to monitor an lband channel located within the transmit range of the isu being monitored 10 to 30 km isu downlink lband transmissions could be received over much wider area but within the coverage area of common beam the complexity of the iridium air interface makes the challenge of developing an iridium lband monitoring device very difficult and probably beyond the reach of all but the most determined adversaries among the complications are large continually changing doppler shifts frequent interbeam and intersv handoffs timedivision multiplexed burst mode channels complicated modulation interleaving and coding iridium confidential12 kband channel security to monitor kband feederlink channel sophisticated monitoring device located in the general proximity of an iridium gateway highgain antenna capable of tracking svs as they move from horizon to horizon complexity of feederlink interface poses formidable technical challenge for prospective eavesdroppers cost of the monitoring device alone would be strong deterrent among the technical complications are large continually changing doppler shifts high capacity 3072 mbps channels highgain tracking antenna
