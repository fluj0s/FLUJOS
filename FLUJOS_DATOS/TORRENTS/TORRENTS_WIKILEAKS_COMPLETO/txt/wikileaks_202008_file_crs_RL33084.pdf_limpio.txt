assistance dua worker may not receive uc benefits at the same time as receiving dua benefits workers who qualify for uc benefits receive them for the duration of weeks that they are entitled to under state uc laws workers who do not qualify for uc benefits may be eligible for dua benefits for 26 weeks however if worker qualifies for less than 26 weeks of uc benefits the worker may qualify for dua

directresult of the disaster disaster unemployment assistance eligibility clarification n november 13 2001 dol issued new interpre tive rule clarifying the definition of the phrase unemployment as direct result of the major disaster dol issued this clarifying rule because the septembe r 11 2001 disasters presented number of exigencies not anticipated by the existing regulations the action by dol amended 20 cfr 6255 by adding new paragr aph c to read as follows 6255 unemployment caused by major disaster c unemployment is direct result of the major disaster for the purposes of paragraphs a1 and b1 of this section workers or self employed individuals unemployment is direct result of the major disaster where the unemployment is an immediate result of the major disaster itself and not the result of longer chain of events prec ipitated or exacerbated by the disasterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33084crs5 such an individuals unemployment is dir ect result of the major disaster if the unemployment resulted from physical damage or destruction of the place of employment physical inaccessibility of the place of employment due to its closure by the federal government in imme diate response to the disaster or lack of work or loss of revenues provided that prior to the disaster the employer or the business in the case of selfemployed individual received at least majority of its revenue or income from an entity that was either damaged or destroyed in the disaster or an entity closed by the federal govern ment in immediate response to the disaster prior to the construction of this new rule the phrase unemployed as direct result of major disaster had never been defined in the regulations though dol issued the new clarifying rule in the wa ke of the september 11 2001 disasters the rule applies to any subsequently declared major disasters the rule is intended to make clear distinction between those individuals unemployed as an immediate result of the disaster itself and those whose unemployment may have been caused by long chain of events initiated by the disaster the rule is also intended to exclude those individuals whose unemploym ent is the result of general economic decline as an indirect effect of major disaster benefit determina tion and duration when reasonable comparative earnings history can be c onstructed dua be nefits are determined in similar manner to regular state uc benefit rules for example selfemployed persons would be expected to bring in their tax records to prove level of earnings for the previous two years these records

injuries caused as direct result of the disaster that make them unavailable for work would receive dua benefits of an amount equi valent to what they would have received under the uc system if they were not injured and available to work in all cases workers will receive dua benefit that is at least half of the average uc benefit for that state and cannot receive more than the maximum uc benefit
