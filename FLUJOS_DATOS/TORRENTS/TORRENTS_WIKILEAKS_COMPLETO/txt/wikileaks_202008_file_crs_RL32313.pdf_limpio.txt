seve ral key policy issues that congre ss considered in reviewing the districts appropriations for fy2005 the controversy surrounding funding needle exchange program touches on issues of home rule public health policy and government sanctioning and facilitating the use of illega l drugs proponents of needle exchange program contend that such programs reduce the spread of hiv among illegal drug users by reducing the in cidence of shared needles opponents of these efforts contend that such progra ms amount to the government sanctioning illegal drugs by supplying drugaddicted pe rsons with the tools to use them in addition they contend that public health c oncerns raised about the spread of aids and hiv through shared contaminated n eedles should be addr essed through drug treatment and rehabilitation programs another view in the debate focuses on the issue of home rule and the citys ability to use local funds to institute such programs free from congressional actions the prohibition on the use of federal and district funds for needle exchange program was first approved by congress as section 170 of the district of columbia appropriations act for fy1999 pl 105277 the 1999 act did
