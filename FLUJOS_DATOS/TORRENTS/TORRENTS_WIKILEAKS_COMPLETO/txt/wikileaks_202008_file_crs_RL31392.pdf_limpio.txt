compensated through various programs for losses to their tax bases due to the presence of most federally owned land these lands cannot be taxed but may create demand for services such as fire protection police cooperation or simply longer roads to skirt the federal property some of these programs are run by specific agencies and apply only to that agencys land the most widely applicable program run by the department of the interior doi applies to many types of federally owned land and is called payments in lieu of taxes or pilt the authorized level of pilt payments is calculated under complex formula this paper addresses only the doirun pilt program there is piltlike program generally applicable to military lands but small fraction of military lands are eligible for the program described herein this paper explains pilt payments with an analysis of the five major factors affecting the calculation of payment to given local government it also describes the effects of certain changes in pilt in 1994 and 2008 the 1994 changes phased in marked increase in the authorized payment levels though appropriations did not keep pace there was intense lobbying by local governments to convince congress to appropriate the full amount or to create new mandatory spending to fund the program provision for mandatory spending in pl 110343 will ensure that beginning in fy2008 and continuing for four more years all counties will receive 100 of the authorized payment it seems likely that there will be efforts to convert the temporary mandatory spending into permanent feature of pilt with the enactment of five years of mandatory spending counties might also begin to debate the equity of the pilt formula itself in future years other issues have arisen concerning pilt since the program was created in 1976 one is the inclusion of additional lands under the pilt program particularly some or all indian lands which are not now eligible for pilt many categories of indianowned lands cannot be taxed by local governments in some counties this means very substantial portion of the land is not taxable the remaining tax burden therefore falls more heavily on other property owners to help compensate for this loss some counties have proposed that indian lands variously defined be included among those eligible for pilt payments in addition some counties would like to revisit the compensation formula and emphasize payment rate more similar to property tax rates feature that would be major change in counties with high property values finally for lands in the national wildlife refuge system some would argue that all lands of the system should be eligible for pilt rather than continuing the pilt provision that excludes payment for acquired lands the exclusion affects primarily counties in eastern states and with full funding for pilt the lost payments represent an even larger sum in addition the mandatory spending provision described above applied only to pilt but not to the refuge systems own payment program counties with refuges would argue that the refuge fund should also provide for mandatory spending

governments unless the governments are authorized to do so by congress since local governments are often financed by property or sales taxes this inability to tax the property values or products derived from the federal lands whether reserved from the public domain or acquired may affect local tax bases significantly instead of authorizing taxation congress has usually chosen to create various payment programs designed to make up for lost tax revenue these programs take various forms many pertain to the lands of particular agency eg the national forest system or the national wildlife refuge system 1 the most wideranging payment program is called payments in lieu of taxes or pilt it is administered by the department of the interior and affects most federal lands exceptions include most military lands and lands under the department of energy doe lands have their own smaller payment program2 in fy2008 the pilt program covered 6101 million acres or about 94 of all federal land the payments in lieu of taxes act of 1976 pl 94565 as amended 31 usc 69016907 was passed at time when us policy was shifting from one of disposal of federal lands to one of retention because of that shift congress agreed with recommendations of federal commission that if these federal lands were never to become part of the local tax base then some compensation should be offered to local governments to make up for the presence of nontaxable land within their jurisdictions3 moreover there was longstanding concern that some federal lands produced large revenues for local governments while other federal lands produced little or none many members felt that the imbalance needed to be addressed the resulting law authorizes federal pilt payments to local governments these payments may be used for any governmental purpose many of the issues addressed when pilt was cr eated have continued to the present time one issue is the appropriate payment level and subsequent erosion of payments due to inflation for many years counties held that payments were not keeping pace with inflation then pilt was amended in 1994 figure 1 shows major increase in the actual dollars appropriated for pilt from fy1993 to fy2008 even adjusted for inflation the figure indicates substantial increase over this period4 1 for more information on some of these agencyspecific payment programs see crs

gaorced94204 washington dc july 1994 2 program to support local schools for the presence of ch ildren of federal employees including military dependents provides some support to local governments however and to some extent compensates for lost property tax revenue when military families live on federally owned land for more information see crs report rl34119 impact aid for public k12 education reauthorization under the elementary and secondary education act by rebecca r skinner and richard n apling 3 these lands may cause local government expenses such as fire protection ambulance service shared police protection or even need for longer roads to go around the lands but they were not viewed as adding to the counties jobs at least not when compared to private ownership 4 inflation

these nine categor ies of lands as entitlement nds and the term is used throughout the act however because entitlement is word which is used in very different and potentially confusing context in the congressional budget process these lands will be called eligible lands in this paper this paper omits consideration of certain small payments under 31 usc 69046905 which involve temporary compensation

grossly disparate payments congress provided that the previous years payments on eligible federal lands from other agencies payment programs to counties would be subtracted from the pilt payment of the following year so for hypothe tical county with three categories of eligible federal land one paying the county 1000 the second 2000 and the third 3000 then 6000 would be subtracted from the

payments for these eligible lands under other payment or revenue sharing programs of the federal agencies that control the eligible land15 the amount to be deducted is based on an annual report from each state to doi this option is called the standard provision alternative b which is less the countys eligible acreage times 32 per acre or the countys ceiling payment pick the lesser of these two this option is called the minimum provision and is used in the counties that received relatively larg payments from other federal agencies in the previous year the county is authorized to receive whichever of the above calculationsa or bis greater this calculation must be made for all counties individually to determine the national authorization level from the programs inception through fy2007 the authorized payments were subject to annual appropriations after passage of pl 110343 this spending is mandatory for fy2008fy2012 the combination of other federal payments and pilt in the standard option means that reductions or increases in those other payments in the previous year could be exactly offset by increases or reductions in pilt payments however for fy2008 provided that the countys population is not so low as to affect the outcome pilt payments cannot fall below 32 per acre see step b above so the full offset occurs only when the other federal payments in the previous year total less than 197 per acre ie the maximum payment of 229 per acre minus the 32 per acre minimum payment from pilt16 15 payments under the secure rural schools program for forest service lands and certain bureau of land management lands are included among those prior year payments to be deducted see crs report rl33822 the secure rural schools and community selfdetermination act of 2000 forest service

from other agencies then adds at least enough money to the bucket to bring it to the 229acre mark moreover if the bucket is already above the 229acre mark pilt adds 32acre regardless of the amount in the bucket already the money bucket could r each levels of 15acre or more with the last 32 added by pilt the county population ceilings might then be thought of as holes in the sides of some of the buckets that prevent them from filling beyond certain level for that bucket ie county

formula had generally been appropriated with few exceptions such as sequestration under the grammrudmanhollings act title ii of pl 99177 but the value of the payments fell due to inflation in response congress amended the law in 1994 the amendment to pilt pl 103397 focused on increasing the total payments building in inflation protection and making certain additional categories of land eligible19 after the amendments passed the increasing discrepancy between appropriations and the rapidly rising authorization levels led to even greater levels of frustration among local governments and prompted intense interest among some members in increasing appropriations until the passage of pl 110343 see figure 2 above whether congress will make the mandatory spending permanent remains to be seen

being debated inclusion of native lands tax equivalency especially for eligible urban lands and payments affecting the national wildlife refuge system 17 an exception would occur if the countys population is so small that the county is affected by the pilt ceiling on payments due to population 18 doi does not include estimated full payment levels in its an nual budget justification to congress and confines itself to the administrations request for the year however dois annual report of current year pilt payments to counties includes this information 19 an important issue in 1994 was also the question of the eq uity of the payments and the balance struck in the payment formula between heavily and sparsely populated communitie s b between those with federal lands generating large revenues and those with lands generating little or revenue and c between the amounts paid under pilt and the amounts that would be paid if the lands were simply taxed at fair market value but these issues were not addressed in the 1994 amendments and have scarcely been mentioned in the debate since then

supported adding indian lands to the list of lands eligible for pilt the complexity of the pilt formula makes it very difficult to calculate the consequences of such move either for authorization levels or appropriation levels congre ss would have to decide what sorts of indian lands would be eligible for such payments and variety of other complex issues20 once the eligible categories are determined congress might wish to limit payments to counties with more than some minimum percentage of indian lands within their borders regardless even very restrictive definition of indian lands seems likely to add millions of acres to those already eligible once the criteria for eligibility were fixed it would still be difficult to determine the effect on authorization levels to paint an extreme example if all of the eligible indian lands were in counties whose pilt payments were already capped due to the population ceiling inclusion of indian lands would have effect on pilt authorization levels as long as mandatory spending is in place appr opriations would go up to fund the new lands if mandatory spending is allowed to expire each county would receive pro rata share of the full authorized payment level individual counties whos eligible acres had jumped markedly with the inclusion of indian lands might receive substantially more than in the past in fy2013 the provision for mandatory spending is due to expire if it is not extended then annual appropriations would need to be maintained at much higher level to compensate for the inclusion of millions of acres of newly eligible indian lands if not most counties would not only receive smaller fraction of the authorized amount but some those with few or eligible indian acres might actually receive fewer total dollars than in the past g11g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g23g155g139g138g151g561g14g138g151g141g156g561g138g151g141g561g22g138g161g561g7g154g158g146g159g138g149g142g151g140g162g561 some observers have wondered whether urban federal lands are included in the pilt program the response is that urban lands are not excluded from pilt under the current law for example in fy2008 the counties in which sacramento ch icago cleveland and arlington are found as well as the district of columbia all received relatively small pilt payments as shown in table 1 20 the many classifications of indian lands include trust lands restricted lands and fee private lands both on and off reservations trust lands are lands held by the federal government in trust for an indian tribe or individual restricted lands are lands held by an indian tribe or individual but subject to federal restrictions on alienation eg sale or encumbrance eg mortgaging most but by means all indian trust and restricted lands are on indian reservations trust and restricted lands whether on or off reservations are not subject to state or local land taxes on reservation indian fee lands may or may not be subject to state and local land taxes depending on the federal statute under which the land was feepatented offreservation indian fee lands are generally subject to state and local land taxes indian reservations may also include nonindian fee lands which are subject to state and local taxation alaskan native corporation lands none of which are trust nds are affected by the alaska native claims settlement acts limits on state taxation congress would have to decide which of these many classifications of indian lands would be subject to pilt benefits further congress might choose to distinguish between indian lands which have never been taxed by county or state versus those indian lands that were once taxable but which were acquired into nontaxable status after some specified date

counties which tend to be small rarely have large populations and large eligible acreage in the same county on the other hand western counties tend to be very large and like sacramento may have many eligible acres as well as large populations furthermore as the cases of arlington and the district illustrate pilt payments are by means acting as an equivalent to property tax payments since private owners of those 6963 acres in the district or the 27 acres in arlington would surely pay much more than 24345 or 0 respectively if the land were subject to property taxes because the formula in pilt does not reflect an amount commensurate with property taxes counties such as these might support revised formula that would approach property tax payments

eligible for pilt and those that are acquired are not in addition the national wildlife refuge fund nwrf continues to be annually appropriated as it has been in the past for fy2008 payments for nwrf will be approximately 47 of the authorized level for refuge lands eligible for pilt some or perhaps all of the nwrf payment will be made up for in the following years pilt payment but for acquired lands this will not occur since they are not eligible for pilt congress may consider making all refuge lands eligible for pilt andor providing mandatory spending for nwrf as it has for pilt eastern counties could be the largest beneficiaries of such change although some western states may also have many nwrs acres that are not currently eligible for pilt see table 2 for selected state examples t
