are us citizens vieques pronounced veeeh kez is small puerto rican island few miles east of mainland puerto rico the department of the navy don which includes the navy and marine corps purchased the western and eastern ends of the is land between 1941 and 1950 the two donowned parcels totaled about 22000 acres or about twoth irds of the island almost all of the 8000acre western parcel which was used pr imarily as naval ammunition depot was returned by don to the municipality of vieques on may 1 2001 the remaining don owned 14000acre eastern parcel was used by us naval and other military forces since the early 1940s for training exercises invol ving shiptoshore gunfire airtoground bombing by naval aircraft marine amphibious landings or some combination the parcel included roughly 11000acre eastern ma neuver area for marine corps ground exercises and roughly 900acre live impact area lia designed for targeting by live ordnance the lia was at the eastern tip of the island several miles from the civilian populated center section of the is land which has bout 9300 residentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20458crs2 until april 1999 the navy used the vieques training range about 180 days per year of these about 120 days were for integr ated ie combined landseaair livefire exercises ie exercises with explosive ammunition by us atlantic fleet aircraft carrier battle groups and amphibious ready groups prep aring to deploy overseas on regular six monthlong deployments to the mediterra nean sea or persian gulf until 2001 don officials argued adamantly that there was site other than vieques where atlantic fleet naval forces could conduc t integrated livefire training operations and that such training operations are critical to fully preparin g us naval forces for deployment puerto rican discontent and opposition us military activities in puerto rico had been source of discontent among puerto ricans for several decades puerto rican oppos ition to don activities on vieques increased after 1975 when don withdrew from culebra another small puer to rican island near vieques where don had conducted some of its livefire training operations afte r withdrawing from culebra as consequence of strong puerto rican opposition to dons use of that island don consolidated its livefire training operations at vieques puerto rican dissatisfaction regarding military training activities on vieques was driven by several issues 1 lost potential for economic development due to lack of access to most of the islands land interruptions to local fishing operations and the effect of don s activities on reducing the potential for developing the island as tourist destination 2 the inadequacy of don economic development efforts intended to compensate the vieques community for this economic loss 3 damage to the islands environment ecology natural resources historic resources and archaeological sites caused by don training activities 4 concern that the incidence of cancer or other diseases might be increased by pollutants released into the local environment by don training operations 5 noise especially from nearby shiptoshore gunfire 6 safety the risk of an offrange accident and 7 perceived don insensitivity in conducting its rela tions with the vieques community april 19 1999 bombing accident and subsequent impasse on april 19 1999 the pilot of marine corps f18 on training mission mistakenly identified an observation post located just to the west of the lia but still well within the overall range perimeter as its intended target the two 500pound bombs dropped by the plane struck the post killing david sanes rodriguez puerto rican civilian employed as security guard and injuring four others followi ng the accident don temporarily suspended its use of the range the accident galvaniz ed puerto rican opposition to dons activities on the island puerto rican political leader s and overwhelming segments of puerto rican public opinion soon declared their firm opposition to any further military training operations on the island and called for don to withdraw from the island immediately and return the land to puerto rico at the same time dozens of demonstrators entered the range most of which was offlimits to the civilian population and established several protest camps preventing don from easily resuming training activities there rush panel on june 9 1999 president clinton asked secretary of defense william cohen to establish special panel to study the situation the 4member panel was chaired by frank rush who was the actin g assistant secretary of defense for force management policy the rush panel as it was called released its report on october 19 1999 the report recommended among other things that don should immediately conduct
