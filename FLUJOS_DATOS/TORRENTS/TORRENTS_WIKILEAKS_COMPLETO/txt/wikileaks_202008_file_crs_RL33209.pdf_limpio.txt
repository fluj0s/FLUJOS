to the response or services that members of congress provide to constituents who request assistance each year thousands of constituents turn to members of congress with wide range of requests from the simple to the complex members and their staffs help constituents deal with administrative agencies by acting as facilitators ombudsmen and in some cases advocates in addition to serving individual constituents some congressional offices also consider as casework liaison activities between the federal government and local governments businesses communities and nonprofit organizations members of congress determine the parameters of their constituent service activities casework is conducted for various reasons including broadly held understanding among members and staff that casework is integral to the representational duties of member of congress and that such activities can be part of an outreach strategy to build political support in addition casework might also be viewed as an evaluative stage of the legislative process constituent inquiries about specific policies programs or benefits may suggest areas where government programs or policies require oversight or legislative consideration one challenge to congressional casework is the widely held public perception that members of congress can initiate broad array of actions resulting in speedy favorable outcome the rules of the house and senate and laws and regulations governing federal executive agency activities however closely limit interventions made on the behalf of constituents when performing casework congressional staff cannot force an agency to expedite case or act in favor of constituent however congressional staff can intervene to facilitate the appropriate administrative processes encourage an agency to give case consideration and sometimes advocate for favorable outcome this report which will be updated as warranted discusses house and senate rules and guidelines laws and regulations

congressional office refers to the response or services that members of congress provide to constituents who request assistance casework appears to be one of the more enduring representational activities members of congress have been providing such service since the early years of the american republic1 in contemporary times thousands of constituents seek assistance annually from members of congress with requests ranging from the simple to the complex members and their staffs help individual constituents deal with administrative agencies by acting as facilitators ombudsmen and in some cases advocates typical casework requests include the following tracking down misdirected benefits payment filling out government form applying for social security veterans education and other federal benefits explaining government activities or decisions applying to military service academy 2 seeking relief from federal administrative decision and emigrating to the united states or applying for us citizenship in addition to providing services to individual constituents some congressional offices also consider as casework their liaison activities between the federal government and local governments or businesses concerned about the effects of federal legislation or regulation on their jurisdiction or interactions with communities and nonprofit organizations seeking federal grants or other assistance all congressional offices carry out some type of casework as part of the process of determining how to carry out their congressional duties memb ers of congress determine the parameters of their constituent service activities 3 casework is conducted for various reasons including constituent demand4 and broadly held understanding among members and their staff that 1 for example representative john quincy adams of massachusetts who served as president before his election to the house noted in his diary that he provided services to number of constituents requests included corrections of the date on military pension certificate discussions with the secretary of the treasury regarding the reappointment of collector in adams district and numerous applications for

congress5 others believe that casework activities can be part of an outreach strategy to build political support among constituents6 finally casework is seen by some as an evaluative stage of the legislative process some observers suggest that casework inquiries can provide members of congress with micro level oversight of executive agency activities affording members the opportunity to evaluate whether program is functioning as congress intended constituent inquiries about specific policies programs or benefits may also suggest areas in which programmatic or policy changes require additional oversight or legislative consideration 7 as consequence the level and intensity of congressional casework varies among member offices8 one challenge to congressional casework is the widely held public perception that members of congress can initiate broad array of actions resulting in speedy favorable outcome the rules of the house and senate and laws and regulations governing federal
