sometimes our antispam filter thinks your post isnt legit so it holds it for moderation well automatically approve anything that isnt spam since we launched this new blog weve had about 300 attempts by spammers to make comments and excluding one other comment yours was the first to cause false positive after looking into it bit more it looks like all comments are now moderated by default this is because we installed plugin that locked down what users can do but it wasnt supposed to automatically moderate everything we tried uninstalling the plugin but that didnt fix the problem even my own comments are being moderated were talking with the developer to see whats up until then all comments will be moderated the site might be getting complete redesign this summer anyways drupal works lot better than wordpress what we currently use for what we need so well probably switch back to that all of the articlesphotoscommentswhatever from this site will transfer over thanks for alerting us to this problem and ill fix it as soon as i can adb blockquote citecommentbody148p stronga hrefcomment148 relnofollowa frienda strongp palso for site that promotes free speech why are you moderating

completely different side of the story i am only as good as my sources if anybody has information on this such as the report leelanau has submitted to isacs school employeees students etc i encourage you to send it to at leelanautalkatgmailcom sources write the rules if you dont want to release the documentsevidence then i wont as long as i can see evidence contrary to what ive been told about isacs ill update this site to reflect that and issue an apology for distributing information that is inaccurate on related note i think that especially given these allegations it would be good move for school administrators to release these isacs reports other schools have opted to publish their isacs reports online from what i have seen of them there is compelling reason for the school to keep them secret adb blockquote citecommentbody15 classregularquotep stronga hrefcomment15 relnofollowanonymousa strongp pokay so when is the isacs representative coming to leelanaup blockquote blockquote
