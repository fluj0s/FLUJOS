g343g561g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 since the 1930s us tariff law has required almost all imports to carry labels so that the ultimate purchaser usually the retail consumer can determine their country of origin however certain products including number of agricultural commodities in their natural state such as meats fruits and vegetables were excluded for almost as many decades various farm and consumer groups have pressed congress to end one or more of these exceptions arguing that us consumers have right to know where all of their food comes from and that given choice they would purchase the domestic version this would strengthen demand and prices for us farmers and ranchers it was argued opponents of ending these exceptions to country oforigin labeling cool contended that there was little or real evidence that consumers want such information and that industry compliance costs would far outweigh any potential benefits to producers or consumers such opponents including other farm and food marketing groups argued that mandatory cool for meats produce or other agricultural commodities was form of protectionism that would undermine us efforts to reduce foreign barriers to trade in the global economy cool supporters countered that it was unfair to exempt agricultural commodities from the labeling requirements that us importers of almost all other products already mu st meet and that major us trading partners impose their own cool requirements for imported meats produce and other foods with passage of the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 10816 retaillevel cool became mandatory for fresh fruits and vegetables beef pork lamb seafood and peanuts starting september 30 2004 continuing controversy over the new requirements within the food and agricultural industry itself led congress to postpone full implementation the fy2004 omnibus appropriations act pl 108199 postponed coolexcept for seafooduntil september 30 2006 the fy2006 agriculture appropriation pl 10997 further postponed it until september 30 2008 1 during deliberations on new omnibus farm bill in 2007 and 2008 those affected by cool reached consensus on series of amendments intended to ease what many of them viewed as some of the more onerous provisions of the 2002 cool law modified were such provisions as the recordkeeping requirements considerations for labeling us and nonus origin products and penalties for noncompliance these amendments were incorporated into the final farm bill pl 110246 11002 the enacted 2008 bill also maintained the september 30 2008 implementation date and added goat meat chicken macadamia nuts pecans and ginseng as commodities covered by mandatory cool 1 an interim final rule for seafood cool was published on october 5 2004 and

of the tariff act of 1930 as amende d 19 usc 1304 every imported item must be conspicuously and indelibly marked in english to indicate to the ultimate purchaser its country of origin the us customs service generally defines the ultimate purchaser as the last us person to receive the article in the form in which it was imported so articles arriving at the us border in retailready packagesincluding food pr oducts such as can of danish ham or bottle of italian olive oilmust carry such mark however if the article is destined for us processor where it will undergo substantial transformation the processor is considered the ultimate purchaser over the years numerous technical rulings by customs have determined what is or is not considered substantial transformation depending upon the item in question the law has authorized exceptions to labeling requirements including articles on socalled j list named for 1304a3j of the statute which empowered the secretary of the treasury to exempt classes of items that were imported in substantial quantities during the fiveyear period immediately preceding january 1 1937 and were not required during such period to be marked to indicate their origin among the items placed on the j list were specified agricultural products including natural products such as vegetables fruits nuts berries and live or dead animals fish and birds all the foregoing which are in their natural state or not advanced in any manner further than is necessary for their safe transportation see 19 cfr 13433 although j list items themselves have been exempt from the labeling requirements 304 of the 1930 act has required that their immediate containeressentially the box they came in have countryof origin labels for example when mexican tomatoes or chilean grapes are sold loosely from store bin country labeling has not been required by the tariff act

poultry products inspection act as amended 21 usc 451 et seq regulations issued under these laws have required that country of origin appear in english on immediate containers of all meat and poultry products entering the united states 9 cfr 32714 and 9 cfr 381205 only plants in countries certified by usda to have inspection systems equivalent to those of the united states are eligible to export products to the united states all individual retailready packages of importe d meat products for example canned hams or packages of salami have had to carry such labeling imported bulk products such as carcasses carcass parts or large containers of meat or poultry destined for us plants for further processing also have had to bear countryoforigin marks however once these nonretail items have entered the country the federal meat inspection law has deemed them to be domestic products when they are further processed in domestic fsisinspected meat or poultry establishmentwhich has been

enough of transformation so that country markings are longer necessary meat and poultry product imports must comply not only with the meat and poultry inspection laws and rules but also with tariff

frozen fruits and vegetables goat meat chicken pecans macadamia nuts and ginseng these items are exempt if they are an ingredient in processed food only pacaregulated retailers those purchasing at least 230000 year in fresh fruits and vegetables are covered and must inform consumers of origin by means of label stamp mark placard or other clear and visible sign on the covered commodity or on the

countries for example beef might have been from an animal that was born and fed in canada but slaughtered and processed in the united states likewise products from several different countries often are mixed such as for ground beef for covered red meats and chicken the cool law permits the us origin label to be used only on items from animals that were exclusively born raised and slaughtered in the united states with an exception for those animals present here before july 15 2008 permits meats or chicken with multiple countries of origin to be labeled as being from all of the countries in which the animals may have been born raised or slaughtered requires meat or chicken from animals imported for immediate us slaughter to be labeled as from both the country the animal came from and the united states requires products from animals not born raised or slaughtered in the united states to be labeled with their correct countryies of origin and requires for ground meat and chicken products that the label list all countries of origin or all reasonably possible countries of origin many retailers and meat processors reportedly had planned to use the catchall label second bullet above on as much meat as possibleeven products that would qualify for the usonly label because it is both permitted and the easiest requirement to meet cool supporters raised concerns that the label would be overused undermining the whole intent of cool ie to distinguish between us and nonus meats 6 in an effort to balance the concerns of both sides usda attempted to clarify its august 2008 interim rule

canada and mexico but that the mixed origin label cannot be used if only us origin meat was produced on production day7 the final january 2009 rule attempts to further clarify the multiple countries of origin language for example muscle cut products of exclusively us origin along with those from foreignborn animals if commingled on single production day can continue to qualify for combined us and nonus label it was never th intent of the agency ams for the majority of product eligible to bear us origin declaration to bear multiple origin destination the agency made additional modifications for clarity ams stated in material accompanying the rule 8 nonetheless some producer groups reportedly co ntinue to view this portion of the rule as loophole that would allow meat packers to use multiple countries or nafta north american free trade agreement label rather than labeling us products as products of the united states this is misleading to consumers stated national farmers union nfu president tom buis9 for perishable agricultural commodities ginseng peanuts pecans and macadamia nuts retailers may only claim us origin if they were exclus ively produced in the united states however us state region or locality designation is sufficient us identifier eg idaho potatoes for farmraised fish and shellfish uslabeled product must be derived exclusively from fish or shellfish hatched raised harvested and processed in the united states wild fish and shellfish must be derived exclusively from those either harvested in us waters or by us flagged vessel and processed in the united states or on us vessel also labels must differentiate between wild and farmraised seafood g5g152g159g142g155g138g144g142g561 consumers may not find country labels on much more of the food they buy due to cools statutory and regulatory exemptions first as noted all restaurants and other food service providers are exempt as are all retail grocery stores that buy less than 230000 year in fresh fruits and vegetables second processed food items derived from the covered commodities are exempt and usda in its final rule has defined this term broadly at 7 cfr 65220 essentially any time covered commodity is subjecte d to change that alters its basic character it is considered to be processed although adding salt water or sugar do not under usdas definition change the basic character virtually any sort of cooking curing or mixing apparently does for example roasting peanut or pecan mixing peas with carrots or breading piece of meat or chicken all count as processing as result only about 30 of the us beef supply 11 of all pork 39 of chicken and 40 of all fruit and vegetable supplies may be covered by cool requirements at the retail level 10 whole peanuts are almost always purchased in roasted form which will not have to be labeled some critics are arguing that ams overstepped its authority and congressional intent by excepting such minimally processed commodities 7

cool under provisions of the tariff act of 1930 for example while bag of frozen peas and carrots is considered processed food item under the cool final rule if the peas and carrots are of foreign origin the tariff act requires that the country of origin be marked on the bag ams argued citing similar regulatory situations for roasted nuts and for variety of seafood items11

using mandatory animal identification id system but the original 2002 version stated that the secretary may require that any person that prepares stores handles or distributes covered commodity for retail sale maintain verifiable recordkeeping audit trail that will permit the secretary to verify compliance verification immediately became one of the most contentious issues particularly for livestock producers in part because of the potential complications and costs to affected industries of tracking animals and their products from birth through retail sale producers of the plantbased commodities as well as food retailers and others also expressed concern about the cost and difficulty of maintaining records for commodities that are highly fungible and often widely sourced the 2008 law eased these requirements somewhat by stating that usda may conduct an audit of any person that prepares stores handles or distributes covered commodity in order to verify compliance such persons must provide verification but usda may not ask for any additional records beyond those maintained in the course of the normal conduct of business in its final rule ams stated that covered persons

have questioned the trade legality of mandatory cool they claimed that publication in august 2008 of the interim rule had already altered normal trade patterns and caused large financial losses the initial focus of these concerns was on livestock ie cattle and hogs and their products the animal products industries were becoming increasingly integrated across all three north american countries in recent years particularly after the onset in 1994 of the north american free trade agreement nafta and before that the canadaus free trade agreement in 1988 these agreements along with the global uruguay round agreements under the world trade organization wto by helping to reduce tariff and nontariff barriers to trade have enabled animals or their products to move across borders more freely based on market demands for example in the pork industry the canadians tended toward breeding and farrowing small pigs which in turn were shipped to the united states where access to large supplies of grain made it more economical to feed them to slaughter weight 15 number of animal health and other incidents have disrupted this market integration from time to time perhaps the most significant recent event was the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse in 2003 first in canada and later in the united states which halted most southern crossborder movement of cattle and beef this trade was still recovering in 2007 and 2008 the predominance of bse mad cow cases coming out of canada rather than the united states may have contributed to wider support for the mandatory cool law some analysts believe although government officials assert that both countries now have strong scientifically defensible safeguards in place to ensure that bse is controlled and that its infectious agent does not enter the human food supply 16 13 gary w brewster et who will bear the costs of co untryoforigin labeling and daniel d hanselka et demand shifts in beef associated with countryoforigin

december 1 2008 canada had filed request for formal wto consultations on cool with the united states normally if such consultations are unable to resolve an issue the next step likely would be referral to wto dispute settlement panel mexico also had requested wto consultations on cool on december 17 2008 both the canadian and mexican filings asserted that cool is inconsistent with several wtorelated trade commitments including those providing that imports must be treated less favorably than products of domestic origin that laws on marks of origin should not damage imports reduce their value or unreasonably increase their cost and that laws rules and procedures on country of origin should not themselves create or disrupt international trade among other things 17 canada reportedly suspended its wto challenge following publication of the cool final rules until it can determine whether the rules will in fact allow for more flexibility and ease the financial impacts on canadian producers however the canadians appeared to leave the door open for further action18 the requests for consultations were not specific to livestock and their products and presumably other covered commodities could be affected if challenge were to be pursued however the canadian beef and pork industries led by the canadian cattlemens association cca and the canadian pork council had actively pushed their government to initiate wto challenge cca had argued that cool cost its producers 92 million in losses over the two months following the interim rule and could cost 500 million canadian dollars per year cca had estimated that slaughter steers and heifers were losing 90 per head because us meat establishments do not want to assume the increased costs of complying with new labeling requirements by segregating holding and then slaughtering canadian cattle separately from us cattle the losses included lower prices for all canadian cattle due to decreased us demand as well as the cost of shipping those that are sold further distances to fewer number of us plants willing to take them canadian pork producers expressed similar concerns 19

declines in imports of both feeder cattle those destined for feedlots and fed slaughterready cattle were due to mandatory cool regulations and that imports face big wild card in 2009 for the same reason meyer and steiner wrote that reductions in imports from both mexico and canada came at time when significant devaluation in the value of the peso and canadian dollar normally would have been conducive of increased imports from these two countries under normal circumstances one would expect cattle imports to actually in crease rather than be cut by almost 4022 usdas economic research service ers in its december 2008 livestock market analysis appears to suggest that the currency exchange situation may be somewhat more involved the decline in canadian cattle imports coincided with the rapid depreciation of the canadian dollar making canadian cattle relatively cheaper in us dollar terms but also making canadian beef more competitive on the export market feeder cattle have been remaining in canada imports of slaughter steers and heifers from canada also declined dramatically in september driven by the same exchange rate conditions affecting feeder cattle additionally the past increase in canadian exports of feeder cattle would reduce the current supply of fed cattle in canada to be marketed or exported lowering the number of canadian cattle sent to the united states for slaughter 23 g21g142g149g142g140g157g142g141g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 number of lawmakers appear to agree with some industry groups criticisms of mandatory cool and
