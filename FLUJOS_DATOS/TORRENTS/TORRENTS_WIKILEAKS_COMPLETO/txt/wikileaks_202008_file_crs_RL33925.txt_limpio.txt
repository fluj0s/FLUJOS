regulation of prescription drugs and biologics domestic social policy division drug safety sidebyside comparison of bills in the 110th congress summary members of congress and the public are increasingly concerned about the ability of the food and drug administration fda to ensure that the drugs sold in the united states are safe and effective in november 2004 fda asked the institute of medicine iom to assess the current system for evaluating and ensuring drug safety and to make recommendations to improve risk assessment surveillance and the safe use of drugs iom released the future of drug safety promoting and protecting the health of the public in september 2006 and fda issued its response in january 2007 the following drug safety bills have been introduced in the 110th congress s 468 hr 788 s 484 and hr 1165 although the legislation and the iom report address many of the same drug safety issues the bills differ in their treatment of fda authority to require action and to enforce compliance comparative effectiveness studies and how to fund any additional agency activities for example s 468 hr 788 would strengthen fdas postapproval drug safety activities by creating new center for postmarket evaluation and research for drugs and biologics the other bills would leave these activities where they currently reside in the center for drug evaluation and research all the bills would allow the fda to penalize through civil fines injunctions or withdrawal of marketing approval or licensure drug manufacturers who did not conduct required postmarket studies or who failed to report study results the iom committee recommended that congress provide substantially increased resources to fda to bolster its drug safety activities s 468 hr 788 would authorize appropriations to carry out the bills provisions s 484 would rely on user fees expanding fdas existing authority to use such fees and hr 1165 does not address funding contents background 1

background members of congress and the public are increasingly concerned about the ability of the food and drug administration fda to ensure that the drugs sold in the united states are safe and effective legislators industry the public and fda scientists have raised questions about fdas collection and release of safety data and whether the agency has the authority and resources to ensure adequate research over the marketing life of the pharmaceutical products it regulates in 2004 the regulatory medical and industry debate became very public with reports of cardiovascular hazards posed by the pain medicine vioxx one of several cox2 nonsteroidal antiflammatory drugs then on the market and of children facing increased risk of suicidal thoughts and actions when taking certain antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors paxil and zoloft not only was congress asking whether the manufacturers knew of these risks while continuing to market the drug but also whether fda should have known of the risks and done more to protect the public at the height of public and congressional attention fda asked the institute of medicine iom to conduct an independent assessment of the current system for evaluating and ensuring drug safety postmarketing and make recommendations to improve risk assessment surveillance and the safe use of drugs iom released its report in september 20061 fda issued its response in january 2007 and noted relevant activities the agency has begun and others it has planned2 among the planned activities are those in its proposal for reauthorization of the prescription drug user fee program pdufa iv3 1 institute of medicine iom the future of drug safety promoting and protecting the health of the public alina baciu

act pdufa background and issues for pdufa iv reauthorization by susan thaul crs2 in the meantime several members of congress have introduced bills to address drug safety and fdas role in protecting the publics health report highlights this report provides sidebyside comparison of institute of medicine recommendations in its september 2006 report the future of drug safety promoting and protecting the health of the public food and drug administration announced actions and plans to address problems identified in the iom report s 468 hr 788 the food and drug administration safety act of 2007 introduced on january 31 2007 by senators grassley dodd mikulski and bingaman and representatives tierney and ramstad s 484 the enhancing drug safety and innovation act of 2007 introduced on february 1 2007 by senators enzi and kennedy4 and hr 1165 the swift approval full evaluation safe drug act introduced on february 16 2007 by representative markey the bills and the iom report address many of the same issues often with similar approaches though at times with major differences the iom report addressed only drugs not biological products eg vaccines in keeping with the charge fda gave it fdas response to the iom recommendations therefore relates to drugs but also states that the approach to drug safety is relevant to all medical products all the bills would amend the federal food drug and cosmetic act regarding the regulation of drugs s 484 would also amend the public health service act regarding the regulation of biologics highlighted below are few of the more significant items regarding drug safety fda organization s 468hr 788 would remove the postapproval drug safety activities from fdas center for drug evaluation and research cder and create new center for postmarket evaluation and research for drugs and biologics the center the iom report does not suggest that approach to strengthen fdas postmarket activities nor do the other pending bills fda authority to require action and to enforce compliance the bills and the iom recommendations aim to strengthen fdas ability to make sure drug manufacturers application sponsors appropriately design and conduct postmarket studies and disclose the results to the public s 468hr 788 lays out requirements that the new center for postmarket evaluation and research for drugs and biologics would administer s 484 would achieve this with process it calls risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rems and hr 1165 would allow the secretary to require certain studies the iom recommended and all the bills would allow the secretary to penalize through civil fines injunctions or withdrawal of marketing approval or 4 this report covers title i risk evaluation and mitigation strategies of s 484 it does not cover title ii reaganudall institute for applied biomedical research title iii clinical trials or title iv conflicts of interest crs3 licensure sponsors who do not conduct required studies or complete them on time or who fail to report study results comparativeeffectiveness studies the iom report and the bills address the need for fda authority to require pre and postmarket studies s 468 alone would give fda the authority to require that those studies compare drugs safety and effectiveness with that of other drugs fda funding all three bills would require variety of drug safety activities they differ in how to fund them s 468 hr 788 would authorize appropriations to carry out the bills provisions s 484 would rely on user fees expanding fdas existing authority to use such fees and hr 1165 does not address funding the iom committee not only recommended that congress provide substantially increased resources to fda but noted that all its other recommendations could not be implemented without those resources table 1 beginning on page 4 addresses the range of fda drug safety activities that the iom recommended along with fdas response and activities that the bills would authorize or require the table structure follows the 25 iom recommendations within the five categories of organizational culture science and expertise regulation communication and resources5 5 crs report rl32797 drug
