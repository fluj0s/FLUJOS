in response to severe flooding following series of hurricanes in 1963 1964 and 1965 the key policy objectives of the nfip were threefold 1 reduce the nations flood risk through floodplain management 2 improve flood hazard data and risk assessment by mapping the nations floodpl ains and 3 make affordable flood insurance widely available in communities that adopt and enforce measures to make future construction safer from flooding fiscally the program had been self supporting from the mid1980s until the 2005 hurricanes thes storms exposed serious weaknesses which congress is attempting to address in an effort to return the nfip to financial soundness in the aftermath of the 2005 hurricanes the nfip faced unprecedented financial and regulatory strains the progra m had to borrow 17535

borrowers of requirements making flood insurance potentially available to all homeowners and not just to those in th 100year floodplain as part of the real estate settlement procedures act respa
