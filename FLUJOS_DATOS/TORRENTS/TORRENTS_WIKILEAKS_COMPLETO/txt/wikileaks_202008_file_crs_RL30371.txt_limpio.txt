deposed from power by popular revolt after he refused to concede defeat in an election for the post of president of the federal republic of yugoslavia fry won by his opponent vojislav kostunica the new government suffered great blow in march 2003 when serbian prime minister zoran djindjic was murdered by organized crime figures linked to the serbian security apparatus organized crime extremists within the serbian military and security apparatus and the links between them continue to pose threat to serbias democratic development on december 28 2003 the extreme nationalist serbian radical party won stunning victory in early serbian parliamentary elections but fell short of majority in march 2004 minority government of democratic parties formed government without the radicals however the government depends on the parliamentary support of the socialists milosevics former party who are not in the government but are in position to extract concessions from it democratic forces in serbia received boost from serbian presidential elections in june 2004 which resulted in victory for boris tadic prowestern proreform figure over radical party candidate in yearslong confrontation with milosevic montenegrin leader milo djukanovic seized control of virtually all levers of federal power on the republics territory he sought to rapidly achieve an independent montenegro but opposition from the united states european union and russia stymied these efforts after largely unsuccessful threeyear decentralized union with serbia montenegro voted for independence in referendum held on may 21 2006 montenegros independence has been recognized by serbia the united states the european union and other countries the united states and other western countries have sought to encourage serbia and montenegros integration into euroatlantic institutions however these efforts have been hampered by controversy over the future status of serbias kosovo province serbias failure to fully cooperate with the yugoslavia war crimes tribunal in particular its failure to arrest former bosnian serb army chief ratko mladic and serbias fitful progress in such areas as rule of law and military and security sector reform since milosevics downfall congress has appropriated significant amounts of aid to serbia and montenegro to promote reforms in each fiscal year from fy2001 through

croatia bosnia and kosovo international isolation and the impoverishment of his people serbian strongman slobodan milosevic remained in power for more than decade he did this by maintaining tight control over key institutions such as the police army judiciary and most of the media as well as much of the economy he retained reservoir of support among some sectors of the population such as the elderly and those living in rural areas in part by appealing to serbian nationalism his reign came to an end on october 5 2000 when he was deposed from power by popular revolt after he refused to concede defeat in an election for the post of president of the federal republic of yugoslavia fry won by his opponent vojislav kostunica on september 24 20001 milosevics party the socialist party of serbia sps was also trounced in simultaneous elections to the federal parliament and local governments serbia and montenegro at glance in february 2003 the federal republic of yugoslavia fry was replaced by loose union of the frys two republics simply called serbia and montenegro before milosevics rise to power serbia had two autonomous provinces on its territory vojvodina and kosovo but milosevic eliminated many of their powers currently vojvodina retains some elements of autonomy and kosovo is under administration after montenegro opted for independence in may 2006 the union broke up and each republic is now fully independent country area serbia including kosovo 88 361 sq km montenegro 13812 sq km population serbia 782 million excluding kosovo montenegro 062 million and kosovo 2 million est source the statesmans yearbook 2001 the victor in the election was coalition of oftenfeuding opposition parties called the democratic opposition of serbia dos the dos agreed on joint slate 1 for detailed accounts of the events leading up to milosevics fall see steven erlanger and roger cohen how yugoslavia won its fight for freedom new york times october 15 2000 1 and r jeffrey smith how milosevic lost his grip washington post october 14 2000 1 crs2 of candidates for the federal parliament and local elections they named vojislav kostunica as their joint candidate to run against milosevic for the federal presidency kostunicas main advantages according to many observers were reputation for honesty and his longstanding unwavering opposition to milosevic kostunica former law professor sharply criticized the milosevic regimes cynical manipulation of the law and legal system as well as the often lawless behavior of those close to the regime kostunica holds strongly nationalist views he has been fierce critic of united states and nato policy in kosovo and bosnia this may also have made him popular with many serbs after their victory in federal and local levels the dos swept to further victories in elections for the serbian parliament on december 23 2000 on january 25 2001 the parliament approved dos government led by prime minister zoran djindjic however soon after the dos took power tensions arose between supporters of fry president kostunica and serbian prime minister djindjic these conflicts slowed reforms and disillusioned many serbs who once had high hopes that milosevics overthrow would lead to dramatic improvement in their living standards one key subject of dispute was cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty on june 28 2001 the serbian government transferred milosevic to the icty to face war crimes charges serbian prime minister zoran djindjic defended the transfer of slobodan milosevic and other indictees saying they were needed so that the fry could receive vitallyneeded international aid kostunica condemned the transfer of milosevic as illegal and claimed that he had not been informed of the move beforehand the dss left the serbian government in august 2001 causing the effective breakup of the dos the dos government received another blow on march 12 2003 when djindjic was assassinated by two gunmen as he got out of his car in front of the serbian cabinet office milorad ulemek also known as legija serbian organized crime figure who once served in the serbian security apparatus is on trial for ordering the murder he has already been convicted of the 2000 murder of an opposition leader on the order of the milosevic regime and the attempted murder of another organized crime extremists within the serbian military and security apparatus and the links between them continue to post threat to serbias democratic development and euroatlantic integration current political situation in serbia the instability of the ruling dos coalition led the serbian government to call early parliamentary elections on december 28 2003 the results reflected public disillusionment with the performance of the previous government and resurgent nationalism in serbia by far the largest party in the 250seat parliament is the serbian radical party which won 82 seats milosevics socialist party of serbia won 22 seats democraticallyoriented parties won the remaining seats kostunicas democratic party of serbia dss won 53 seats the democratic party won 37 seats and the g17 plus party won 34 seats the monarchist and moderate nationalist serbian renewal movement in coalition with the new serbia party won 22 seats crs3 kostunica assembled minority government of democratic parties consisting of the dss g17 plus and the spons the dss received the interior and justice ministry posts which are key in the fight against organized crime and corruption g17 plus plays an important role in economic affairs the parliament approved the new serbian government on march 3 2004 the most controversial aspect of the serbian government is its dependence on support from the sps which does not have ministers in the government but provides it with majority in parliament in justifying his overtures to the socialists kostunica asserted that they have reformed themselves since they were in power under milosevic claim that many analysts would dispute critics have charged that the government has had to make concessions to the socialists on several issues in order to remain in power on june 13 2004 serbia held presidential election although the serbian presidency is not powerful post analysts viewed the election as key indication of serbias democratic development and orientation toward euroatlantic institutions victory for the candidate of the extreme nationalist radical party tomislav nikolic would have been viewed as serious setback for serbias path toward integration with western institutions nikolic was opposed by democratic party leader boris tadic and dragan marsicanin of the dss in the first round of the vote nikolic won 306 of the vote tadic took second place with 2737 in surprise result wealthy businessman dragoljub karic won 1823 karic prominent business figure in the milosevic era ran on populist program in blow to the dss and the government their candidate dragan marsicanin received mere 133 of the vote in the june 27 runoff between the two top firstround finishers tadic beat nikolic 5353 to 451 tadics victory was greeted with relief by western governments these results confirmed the growing strength of tadics prowestern democratic party but also continued strong support for the radicals new parliamentary elections must be held by the end of 2007 but many observers believe early elections could take place this year the current government is weak but continues to hang on partly because smaller parties in it know that they may lose all of their seats in parliament when new elections are held the weakness of the government also appears to suit the radicals and socialists who have not yet sought to overturn it however events that may occur later this year may destabilize the government these could include kosovo settlement that results in kosovos independence the transfer of indicted war criminal ratko mladic to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia or scandals over privatization or other issues experts disagree on their predictions for the outcome of possible early elections according to public opinion polls the radicals remain the most popular single party in serbia by wide margin however they may not be able to form majority on their own or with the socialists on the other hand nationalist backlash over kosovo or other issues could put the radicals and socialists over the top the international community would likely strongly disapprove of the participation of the radicals in serbian government an alternative could be for the ds dss and other democratic parties to form government but continuing animosities among their leaders could make this difficult crs4 major political parties and groups in serbia democratic party ds the ds was the largest party in the 20012003 democratic coalition government it established reputation for prowestern pragmatism under its former leader prime minister zoran djindjic this reputation also hurt the party among some serbs who saw it as opportunistic riddled with corruption and too eager to appease the west djindjic was assassinated in march 2003 by organized crime figures associated with the former milosevic regime it suffered substantial decline in support in the december 2003 elections but began to recover its strength when it went into opposition in 2004 its popularity was boosted by the election of its leader former defense minister boris tadic as serbian president in june 2004 democratic party of serbia dss the dss is led by vojislav kostunica formerly yugoslav president and now prime minister of serbia like other democratic parties the dss favors democracy the rule of law particular interest of kostunicas and free market reform but has markedly nationalist orientation it was highly critical of the decision to transfer milosevic to war crimes tribunal in june 2001 and has continued to strongly criticize the tribunal the dss plays the leading role in the current serbian government established in march 2004 its popularity has fallen substantially since it has taken leading role in the government g17 plus formerly nonpartisan economic reform group g17 plus registered as political party in early 2003 it won 34 seats in the december 28 2003 parliamentary elections it is perhaps the most prowestern and proeconomic reform force in the government where it holds key posts in the government dealing with the economy however its strength has declined as the governments popularity has decreased and it may not win seats when new elections are held serbian radical party srs an extreme nationalist party led by vojislav seselj who is now facing war crimes charges at yugoslav war crimes tribunal in the hague although ostensibly anticommunist the srs held posts in the milosevic regime which cost the srs dearly in the 2000 elections however the srs surged in popularity as the prowestern and proreform governments fortunes waned the srs condemned cooperation with the war crimes tribunal government corruption scandals and poor living standards and slightly moderated its warlike antiwestern rhetoric the srs won spectacular victory in the december 2003 elections becoming by far the largest party in the serbian parliament however it did not win majority on its own and is viewed as pariah by democratic parties and is therefore in opposition nevertheless it remains the most popular party in serbia by significant margin serbian renewal movement sponew serbia the spo is democraticallyoriented nationalist promonarchist party led by serbia and montenegro foreign minister vuk draskovic who has had reputation for political unpredictability it formed an electoral coalition with smaller group called new serbia this group could find it difficult to meet the vote threshold to receive seats when new elections are held socialist party of serbia sps the sps is the successor to the serbian branch of the yugoslav communist party under the leadership of slobodan milosevic the party used nationalism to dominate serbian politics from the late 1980s until its defeat in the 2000 elections the sps was further weakened by milosevics transfer to the yugoslav war crimes tribunal in june 2001 the sps won 22 seats in the december 2003 elections even fewer than in 2000 it is not in the government but its support is crucial for the government to have majority in parliament crs5 political situation in montenegro since 1997 montenegro has been controlled by an antimilosevic faction of the local socialist party led by milo djukanovic in october 1997 djukanovic was elected president of montenegro as djukanovic consolidated his grip on power in montenegro cold war developed between montenegrin leaders and the milosevic regime milosevic did not allow montenegro to participate in setting federal policies for his part djukanovic moved to seize control of virtually all of the levers of power in montenegro djukanovic successfully sought relief from western sanctions against the fry and received western aid to boost montenegros economy after milosevics fall efforts by montenegrin leaders to push forward with independence from yugoslavia were stalled by international opposition particularly from the european union in addition to their concerns about the impact montenegrin independence might have on the situation in serbia and montenegro eu officials were also worried that the collapse of yugoslavia could hurt the chances of keeping kosovo as part of the serbia and montenegro union on march 14 2002 eu foreign policy chief javier solana brokered an agreement between serbia and montenegro on restructuring the relationship between the two republics the fry was formally abolished and the country was renamed serbia and montenegro the union of states would have popularly elected parliament president chosen by the parliament and government it would deal with foreign affairs defense international economic relations economic relations between the republics and the protection of human and minority rights the two republics would attempt to reform and harmonize their economies in line with eu standards the agreement allowed either state to declare independence after three years the agreement asserts that serbia would inherit the frys sovereignty over kosovo as laid out in security council 1244 in february 2003 the federal republic of yugoslavia was formally dissolved and serbia and montenegro came into being as the new joint state2 on october 20 2002 montenegro held parliamentary elections dpsled coalition won an absolute majority of 39 of the 75 seats in the parliament an snp led bloc won 30 seats and the liberals won 4 presidential elections were scheduled for december 22 2002 fearing an opposition boycott which could depress turnout and therefore invalidate the vote djukanovic resigned as president on november 26 2002 and was elected to the post of prime minister by the parliament djukanovics concerns about the presidential vote proved correct when the results of the december 22 vote were invalidated due to low turnout after repeat presidential election failed for the same reason in february 2003 former prime minister and djukanovic supporter filip vujanovic was elected as president when third election was held in may 2003 observers have noted that montenegro is small republic with few industries and resources it is highly dependent on tourism trade and allegedly crime since 2 for more on the serbia and montenegro union see crs report rs21568 serbia and montenegro union prospects and policy implications by julie kim crs6 coming to power djukanovic and other montenegrin leaders been accused of complicity with smuggling operations trafficking in persons and other organized crime activities sometimes in cooperation with the italian mafia figures italian police investigated djukanovics possible role in longstanding cigarettesmuggling operation montenegrin leaders claim these charges of criminal conduct by top ranking european officials have been fabricated by domestic opponents and some european countries to undermine montenegrin efforts to secure independence on may 21 2006 montenegro held referendum on independence from the serbia and montenegro union voters opted by majority of 555 for independence just above the 55 threshold set by the government and the european union for the referendums success turnout for the vote was 87 international election observers from organization for security and cooperation in europe osce said that the vote was held in compliance with osce and other international democratic standards in response serbia declared itself an independent state on june 5 and formally recognized montenegros independence on june 15 the two countries will now have to agree on division of joint debts and property serbia inherits the unions membership in international organizations while montenegro will have to apply for membership to them as new country major political parties in montenegro democratic party of socialists dps the largest party in montenegro the dps is the successor to the montenegrin sister party of the socialist party of serbia in 1997 milo djukanovic its leader broke with milosevic taking most of the party with him although comprised of former communists the dps espouses support democracy free market reform and euroatlantic integration it has been beset by charges of corruption liberal alliance of montenegro small opposition political group that strongly supports montenegrin independence political and economic reform and prowestern foreign policy it criticizes the dps for its communist past its lack of commitment to truly democratic montenegro and charges that it has manipulated the economy for the personal gain of djukanovic and his cronies however an alliance with the socialist peoples party in 2002 laid it open to charges of opportunism peoples party of montenegro pp like the dps the pp favors political and economic reform and closer ties with the west however it is more strongly in favor with closer ties with serbia than the dps the pp was member of the governing coalition with the dps until december 2001 when it quit the government in protest against dps plan for montenegros independence social democratic party sdp centerleft party that shares similar domestic and foreign policy goals with the dps it strongly favors independence socialist peoples party snp the snp was formed from the minority faction of the former yugoslav communist party in montenegro that remained loyal to milosevic it strongly favors close ties with serbia and opposes independence crs7 kosovo and southern serbia kosovo was an autonomous province within serbia until 1990 when its autonomy was eliminated by milosevic the move provoked the provinces ethnic albanian majority to nonviolent resistance then by 1998 armed revolt in order to put halt to the conflict including atrocities by serbian forces and restore the provinces autonomy the united states and other nato countries launched an campaign of air strikes against serbia between march and june 1999 in june 1999 milosevic agreed to withdraw his forces from kosovo permitting natoled peacekeeping force to be deployed under the terms of security council resolution 1244 kosovo is governed by mission in kosovo unmik until an autonomous kosovo government can run the province itself unsc 1244 does not say what kosovos final status should be but supports the territorial integrity of the fry which was replaced by the serbia and montenegro union in 20033 unbrokered talks between the kosovo and serbian governments on the future status of the province began in early 2006 and the united states is strongly pushing for the talks to be concluded at the end of 2006 the largely ethnic albanian kosovo government is seeking independence for the province which the serbian government strongly rejects this view is backed by an allparty consensus in the serbian parliament serbian leaders have encapsulated their current position on status with the phrase more than autonomy but less than independence serbia has also put forward decentralization plan for kosovo the plan would set up autonomous serb regions in northern kosovo and other serbianmajority enclaves serbianmajority areas in kosovo would be controlled by local serb authorities with their own police and would be linked with each other and with serbia ethnic albanian authorities would control the rest of the province such plan would have the benefit from belgrades point of view of consolidating its control over northern kosovo where most serbs in the province now live and where important economic assets such as the trepca mining complex are found ethnic albanian leaders strongly oppose the idea for these very reasons to certain extent the serbian plan seeks to strengthen and ratify the existing situation in northern kosovo international officials and ethnic albanians have criticized serbia for supporting parallel structures that cement its control over serbmajority areas at the expense of unmiks authority international officials have also criticized the serbian government for successfully calling on kosovo serbs to boycott kosovo government institutions they have noted that such move isolates kosovo serbs at time when unmik is devolving many of its powers to the kosovo government and kosovos future status is being determined some observers have speculated that serbias hardline stance may be negotiating tactic with possible fallback position that would try to secure partition of kosovo with northern kosovo formally becoming part of serbia and the rest becoming independent however the united states and other members of the contact group have ruled out partition of kosovo serbian leaders may also seek 3 for more on kosovo see crs report rl31053 kosovo and us policy by steven woehrel and julie kim crs8 or be offered other forms of compensation such as easier terms for nato and eu membership or at least increased aid from these institutions and their member countries serbian experts realize that such concessions even if offered by the international community may lack credibility due to enlargement fatigue in many european union countries among other factors4 moreover serbian experts warn that the current political situation in serbia may make any public concessions on its part difficult given the weakness of the serbian government and continued strength of the radicals there are concerns among western observers that if the international community recognizes kosovos independence at the end of this year serbia acting overtly or covertly could assist serbs in northern kosovo in breaking away from the new state perhaps resulting in violence with the help of the international community serbia had success in defusing an insurgency in ethnicalbanian inhabited areas of southern serbia comprising the of municipalities of presevo medvedja and bujanovac in marchmay 2001 nato troops in kosovo permitted the phased reintroduction of yugoslav forces into demilitarized zone bordering kosovo that ethnic albanian guerrillas had used as springboard for attacks on serbian territory under pressure from the international community the guerrillas disbanded in may 2001 western countries pressed serbia to seek peaceful settlement to the conflict by dealing with some of its underlying causes including the ethnic balance of local police and the economic situation in the area in february 2001 serbian put forward peace plan for the region the plan called for boosting the participation of ethnic albanians in local government and police with help from the organization for security and cooperation in europe local elections were held in july 2002 in the region ethnic albanian parties now control the local governments of presevo and bujanovac while serb groups control medvedja however the problems in the area are not completely solved some ethnic albanians complain of discrimination and occasional violence continues in response to boycott call by local ethnic albanian leaders almost ethnic albanians voted in the serbian parliamentary elections in december 2003 local leaders said that the serbian election law made provision for setting aside seats for ethnic minorities who cannot meet the requirement of winning 5 of the vote to enter the parliament final status talks in kosovo could have an impact on the stability of southern serbia some local ethnic albanian leaders have called for their region to be joined to kosovo if kosovo becomes an independent state 4 discussions with experts on serbia october 2005 crs9 economic situation the democratic leadership in belgrade faced daunting economic challenges when it took over from the milosevic regime in 2000 the frys economy suffered from years of economic mismanagement economic isolation and the lingering effects of nato air strikes in 1999 many key enterprises and banks were controlled by regime cronies who managed them poorly and stole large sums from them according to fry officials serbias gross domestic product gdp in 1999 was only 45 of its 1990 level unemployment was about 35 in 2000 conflicts in the former yugoslavia left the fry with over 800000 refugees and displaced persons to care for or about 10 of the countrys population in the final year of his rule milosevic increased the money supply in order to fund reconstruction projects after the kosovo war fueling inflation and the depreciation of the dinar serbias currency the inflation rate for 2000 was 70 the country suffered from high levels of internal and external indebtedness budget deficits at all levels of government including pension and other social welfare arrears amounted to 810 of gdp there was tangle of bad bank debts and interenterprise arrears amounting to 80 of gdp there was also an external debt of 116 billion or about 140 of gdp5 since 2001 the serbian government embarked on comprehensive economic reform program they have conducted prudent fiscal and monetary policies that reduced inflation the fiscal and budgetary systems are being overhauled to make them fairer and more transparent the government ran consolidated budget surplus of 16 of gdp in 2005 the countrys foreign trade regime has been liberalized reform of the banking sector has begun and foreign investment in serbian banks is growing rapidly serbia has moved to privatize some sociallyowned firms but many still need to be restructured and sold off particularly important and difficult example is the serbian state oil firm nis series of corruption scandals have marred privatization efforts nevertheless foreign direct investment fdi has increased rapidly serbia and montenegro took in 148 billion in net fdi in 2005 50 increase when compared to the previous year serbia and montenegro has experienced rapid economic growth in recent years gross domestic product rose by 62 in 2005 and is expected to grow by 50 in 2006 real monthly wages increased 115 yearonyear in february 2006 on the other hand consumer price inflation remains substantial at 166 yearonyear at the end of 2005 unemployment remains very high at 326 of the workforce in 2005 as large companies are restructured more people are losing their jobs although the government has made progress in decreasing regulatory red tape and simplifying labor laws in order to stimulate job growth among small and mediumsized businesses poverty remains problem in 2003 the world bank estimated that 10 of the population of serbia and montenegro was under the poverty line defined as 60 euros about 73 month 5 paper presented by fry deputy prime minister miroljub labus at december 12 2000 donor coordination conference available from the euworld bank website at httpwwwseereconorg crs10 serbia and montenegros economic policies have been supported by the international monetary fund and other international financial institutions in may 2002 the imf extended threeyear 889 million loan to serbia and montenegro after disbursing the final part of 249 million standby loan offered in 2001 the imf has urged serbia and montenegro to push forward with the restructuring and privatization of sociallyowned firms cut public spending and reverse the recent spike in inflation the loan program was completed in early 2006 it is unclear whether serbia will seek another imf loan given the improved state of its external finances although it may do so to secure an international imprimatur for its reforms so as to encourage foreign investment serbia and montenegro has made substantial progress in reducing its foreign debt due in part to debt forgiveness deals with the paris club in 2002 and the london club in 2004 under djukanovic montenegro pursued separate economic policy from serbia during the milosevic period its switch to the deutschmark and later the euro as its currency limited the damage of milosevics lax monetary policies it has pursued sound fiscal and monetary policies inflation remains lower than in serbia at 18 in 2005 montenegros real gdp grew by 41 in 2005 however the republics few industries need extensive restructuring and its economy is heavily dependent on tourism and on trade with serbia and foreign countries privatization has accelerated in the past year spurring large inflows of foreign direct investment nevertheless few big firms remain to be sold off some have complained about corruption in the privatization process6 relations with the european union and nato european union eventual membership in the european union is key objective of the foreign policies of serbia and montenegro the eu has committed itself to admitting serbia and montenegro when they are ready however the path to membership may be long and difficult one in october 2005 the eu announced that it would begin negotiations with serbia and montenegro on stabilization and association agreement saa the agreement would provide framework for enhanced cooperation between the eu and serbia and montenegro in variety of fields including the harmonization of local laws with eu standards with the perspective of eu membership although the european union has not conditioned its aid to serbia on war crimes cooperation eu officials have made clear to serbian leaders that closer relationship with the eu including concluding an

either republic to leave the union within three years eu officials at first pressed the two republics to stay together and to more closely align their economic policies warning that such integration would be necessary if serbia and montenegro wished to secure an saa in the near future or join the european union in the longer term when montenegrin leaders remained firm in their intention to hold referendum on independence the eu pushed for the threshold for the success of the referendum to be higher than simple majority montenegro agreed to 55 threshold and when the referendum was approved on
