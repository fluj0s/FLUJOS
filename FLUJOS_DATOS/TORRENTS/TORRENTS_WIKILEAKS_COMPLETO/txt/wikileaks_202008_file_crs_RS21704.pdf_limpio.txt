handful of communicationsrelated sections of the usa pa triot act and the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act on march 10 2006 the authority of the expiring sections remains in effect only as it relates to foreign intelligence investigations begun before sunset or to offenses or potential offenses begun or occurring before that date thereafter the law reverts to its previous form unless it has been amended in the interim or subsequently renewed the 911 commission mentioned the approaching sunset and thought as general matter that full and informed debate on the pa triot act would be healthy g22g142g150g153g152g155g138g155g162g561g14g138g160g561g7g151g143g152g155g140g142g150g142g151g157g561g21g142g140g157g146g152g151g156g561g152g143g561g22g146g157g149g142g561g11g11g561 the expiring law enforcement sections of title ii of the usa pa triot act involve three communicationsrelated aspects of the federal law wiretapping stored electronic communications and communication transaction records and pen registers and trap and trace devices federal law prohibits the interception of telephone face to face and electronic communications wiretapping subject to certain exceptions including procedure for judicially supervised law enforcement interceptions with the approval of senior justice department officials federal law enforcement authorities may apply for court order approving the use of wiretapping in connection with the investigation of certain serious federal crimes the orders must be narrowly drawn of short duration and based upon probable cause to believe that they will generate evidence relating to the predicate offenses under investigation when the orders expire those whose communications have been intercepted must be notified the procedure for law enforcement access to the content of wire and electronic communications stored with communications providers and to provider transaction records is somewhat less demanding although it generally requires court order warrant or subpoena pen registers and trap and trace devices surreptitiously capture the identity of the sender and recipient of communications the procedure for court order approving the installation and use of pen register or trap and trace device is less demanding still sections 201 authority to intercept wire oral and electronic communications relating to terrorism and 202 authority to intercept wire oral and electronic communications relating to computer fraud and abuse offenses section 201 permits the use of courtsupervised wiretaps in cases involving various terrorism offenses section 202 permits such use in cases of felony computer fraud or abuse here and elsewhere the full extent of the sunset exception 224b is unclear the authority has apparently been used sparingly and in cases where other grounds for wiretapping authority may have existed the justice department argues that the electronic surveillance authority should be available for the full range of terrorismrelated crimes subsections 203b authority to share electronic wire and oral interception information and 203d general authority to share foreign intelligence information subsection b permits the disclosure of wiretapgenerated foreign intellig ence information to federal law enforcement intelligence protective immigration and military personnel for official use permanent authority elsewhere allows for law enforcement sharing permanent authority enacted subsequently allows authorities to share information concerning domestic or international terrorism with federal state local and foreign officials subsection d permits the disclosure of foreign intelligence information discovered in the course of federa l criminal investigation notwithstanding any legal httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21704g23g21g3g561g18g3g22g20g11g17g22g561g3g140g157g561g21g158g151g156g142g157g497g561g3g561g21g148g142g157g140g145g561 g561

department officials contend that to allow sections 203b and 203d to expire would send the wrong signal about the importance of information sharing among investigators section 204 clarification of intelligence exceptions from limitations on interception and disclosure of wire oral and electronic communications section 204 makes clear that the general trap and trace device and pen register prohibitions do not bar use of fisa authority to use trap and trace devices and pen registers to gather foreign intelligence information section 209 seizure of voicemail messages pursuant to warrants the section permits use of search warrant to seize unopened voice mail held by service provider previous requirements of wiretap order were slow burdensome and not compatible with the manner in which unopened providerstored email was handled critics may suggest that compatibility might have been achieved by expanding wiretap order requirements to cover unopened email critics might also question the sections continued utility if more detailed and extensive evidence of successful use is available search warrants can be used to secure evidence of any crime title iii orders are limited to investigations involve serious predicate offenses section 212 emergency disclosure of electronic surveillance section 212 authorizes service providers in emergency situations to disclose customer communications record information and the content of stored customer communications subsequent legislation made the content disclosure but not the record disclosure authority permanent pl 107296 116 stat 2157 200218 usc 2702b7 the record disclosure feature has proven useful in several life threatening situations the same benefits might be available after sunset through the use of search warrant section 217 interception of computer trespasser communications section 217 permits federal authorities to intercept an intruders communica tions within an invaded computer system it requires consent of the system operator law enforcement investigation reasonable belief that the communications are relevant to the investigation and limits interception to the intruders communications statements of support have leaned heavily on descriptions of the authority rather than examples of its use the justice department has stated that the authority has been used comparatively rarely critics might argue that the solution does not seem to match the problem section 217 does not authorize removal of computer hackers bent on denial of service attacks nor does it prevent or punish trespassers instead it eavesdrops on their communications section 220 nationwide service of search warrants for electronic evidence section 220 authorizes nationwide execution of search warrants and court orders for customer communications records and the content of stor ed customer communications search warrants must ordinarily be executed in the judicial district in which they are issued except in terrorism cases the justice department asserts that the authority has proven useful in serious terrorism and other criminal cases the section makes it more difficult for large communications service providers to seek modification of burdensome disclosure orders instead of being able to contest within their home federal district they must challenge in whatever district throughout the country the order originated section 219 which does not expire permits nationwide service of search warrants in terrorism cases section 223 civil liability for certain unauthorized disclosures section 223 creates cause of action against the united states for official willful violations of title iii or fisa 18 usc 2712 amends individual civil liability provisions of titl iii for official unlawful disclosure or use 18

it be made permanent g22g142g150g153g152g155g138g155g162g561g8g152g155g142g146g144g151g561g11g151g157g142g149g149g146g144g142g151g140g142g561g21g142g140g157g146g152g151g156g561 federal law affords foreign intelligence officials authority comparable to that enjoyed by law enforcement officials in some respects there is rough comparability between surveillance wiretap authority under the fisa and under title iii there is rough comparability between fisa physical search authority and search warrant authority in law enforcement context and there is rough comparability between fisa trap and trace or pen register orders and their law enforcement counterparts there are however significant differences one of the most perplexing aspects of the law in the post911 universe is the relationship of the statutory procedures and prohibitions governing wiretap and related investigative tools in the criminal law enforcement world title iii et to those in the foreign intelligence world fisa title iii and its auxiliaries are focused on crime probable cause to believe that predicate offense has is or will occur relevant to criminal investigation whether the offender is an american or not fisa is focused on foreign powers and the agents of foreign powers probable cause to believe that the target is foreign power or an officer employee spy saboteur or terrorist acting on behalf of foreign power whether criminal activity is involved or not the difficulty flows from the fact that an international terrorist may appropriately be the target of an order under title iii et or fisa or both section 206 roving surveillance authority under the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 section 206 permits roving fisa surveillance orders orders need not specifically identify individuals ordered to assist when targets take ac tions to thwart identification specific individuals or locations comparable authority has existed under title iii for some time critics claim the provision is too sweeping perhaps unconstitutionally so subsequent amendment which does not sunset permits roving surveillance by requiring fisa order to identify the location and facilities subject to surveillance only if they are known section 207 duration of fisa surveillance of nonunited states persons who are agents of foreign power section 207 extends the permissible duration of fisa surveillance and physical search orders and extensions 50 usc 1805e 1824d the justice department sees section 207 as time saver that allows for more productive allocation of department and judicial resources critics might argue that more not less judicial supervision is called for section 214 pen register and trap and trace authority under fisa section 214 recasts fisa pen registertrap trace order procedures so that they apply to electronic email and other internet communications as well as to telephone communications the change is comparable in some respects to similar enlargement for law enforcement in 216 which does not expire the section precludes exercise of emergency authority or issu ance in connection with an investigation based solely on the exercise of first amendment rights the section is constitutionally permissible but requires court order nonetheless and is first amendment sensitive critics may argue that the expansion to cover internet use is dramatic that the fisa expansion lacks some of the safeguards found in its law enforcement counterparts and that in terrorism cases the authority available to law enforcement officials under section 216 of the act which does not expire should be sufficient httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21704g23g21g3g561g18g3g22g20g11g17g22g561g3g140g157g561g21g158g151g156g142g157g497g561g3g561g21g148g142g157g140g145g561 g561

intelligence surveillance act section 215 provides access to tangible items under fisa by authorizing ex parte fisa court orders in foreign intelligence as amended international terrorism and clandestine intelligence cases it reverts at sunset to vehicle rent transportation storage rental and housing accommodation business records that pertaining to foreign power or agent other legislation expanding the definition of financial institution for national security letter purposes might be thought to compensate for reduced authority upon reversion grand juries can subpoena the same material with fewer restrictions or protections section 215 fisa orders demand senior official and judicial approval explicit first amendment adherence and congressional reporting in many instances the same material is available using national security letter nsl authority it is only to be used in serious national security cases the authority has been used sparingly and never to acquire library bookstores medical or gun sale records although officials argue it would be mistake to shield from investigation the records of terrorist use of these services on the other hand critics might argue that the section produces an environment of abuse through its elimination of safeguards limited to third parties requires neither probable cause nor articulable facts and need not be limited to items relating to the target of the investigation and through its use of procedure that already carries reduced safeguards use of secret court which does not weigh the evidence and oneway gag orders of unknown breath and duration section 218 foreign intelligence information the wall by virtue of section 218 fisa surveillance or physical search applications need only certify that foreign intelligence gathering is significant purpose for seeking the order rather than the purpose the section makes it clear that wall between fbi crimin and intelligence investigators is unnecessary section 504 of the act law enforcement cooperation does not preclude purpose certification which does not expire may be sufficient to prevent reconstruction of the wall in re sealed case suggests that even prior to the usa pa triot act the wall was neither constitutionally nor statutorily required facially fisa procedure for issuance of surveillance order seems more demanding than title iii law enforcement wiretaps but more accommodating after issuance use of fisa has increased dramatically over the years title iii seems to be seldom used in terrorism cases mostly used in drug trafficking cases the existence of the wall some say is like trying to do one jigsaw puzzle on two separate tables supporters might contend that the wall prevented effective communication and cooperation in terrorism cases removal has been beneficial section 223 civil liability for certain unauthorized disclosures section 223 is discussed above section 225 immunity for compliance with fisa wiretap section 225 establishes immunity for assistance in the execution of fisa surveillance order and perhaps for compliance with any fisa order it encourages cooperation and discourages court challenges section 6001 of p l 108458 individual terrorists as agents of foreign powers section 6001 amends the fisa definition of agent of foreign power to include foreign national who is preparing for or engaging in international terror ism thereby excusing the need to show that the illicit activity is being conducted at the behest or benefit of foreign poweras long as the target is not an american not us person although the justice department believes the section is constitutional there might be some question of whether defining an agent of foreign power as one who need not be an agent of foreign power comes within the keith reservations for agents of foreign power usa p atriot act sections of title ii that do not expire subsection 224a cites several sections and subsections of title ii that are not subject to its declaration of sunset they are httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21704g23g21g3g561g18g3g22g20g11g17g22g561g3g140g157g561g21g158g151g156g142g157g497g561g3g561g21g148g142g157g140g145g561 g561
