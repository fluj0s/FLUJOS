author ize the reproduction distribution and public performance of their work1 historically copyright owners of sound recordings did not enjoy public performance right hen ce when radio broadcaster plays song over the airwaves it pays public performance royalty to the musics composer but not to the copyright owner of the sound recording in 1995 congress enacted the digital performance right in sound recordings act dpra2 which created limited public performance right for sound record ings copyright owners of sound recordings record companies and recording artists now enjoy the exclusive right to control or authorize public performances by means of digital transmission 3 this public performance right is triggere d when sound recordings are transmitted over the internet or webcast compulsory licenses the us copyright act allows one who wishes to use copyrighted material in certain instan ces to obtain compulsory license to do so ordinarily royalties and licenses for th use of protected ma terial are the product of direct negotiations between copyright ow ners and users when compulsory or statutory license is available permitted user need only adhere to statutory requirements including payment of estab lished royalty rates to use the work in 1998 in the digital millennium copyright act dmca4 congress amended several compulsory licensing statutes to provide for and clarify the treatment of different types of webcasting some ty pes of digital transmissions of sound recordings are exempt from the public performance right for example nonsubscription broadcast transmission5 retransmission of radio stations broadcast within 150 miles of its trans mitter and transmission to businesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31626crs2 6 17 usc 114d1 7 the statutory license for

contrast digital transmission by an interactive service does not qualify for any compulsory license nor is it exempt from the public performance right the owner of an interactive service one that enables member of the public to request or customize the music that he or she receives must negotiate license including royalty rates directly with copyright owners but category of webcasting that does qualify for compulsory license is an eligible nonsubscription transmission s ubscription service is one that is limited to paying customers hence webcasters who transmit music over the internet on nonsubscription noninteractive basis may qua lify for the statutory license under 17 usc 114d licensee under 114 may also qualify fo r statutory license under 17 usc 112e to make multiple ephemeral

arbitration royalty panel carp the copyright act creates procedure to set royalty rates for statutory licenses at the behest of the librarian of congress upon the recommendation of the copyright office carp may be convened to take testimony from interested parties and recommend statutory royalty rate carp is made up of three professional arbitrator s at the conclusion of its proceedings it issues report to the librarian th librarian upon the recommendation of the copyright office will adopt the fees proposed by the carp unless based on the record its determinations are found to be arbitrary or ry to copyright law if the librarian rejects the proposed fees he may after an examination of the record and an additional 30 days issue an order settin g them an aggrieved party who is bound by the librarians decision may appeal to the us court of appeals for the dc circuit8 in the case of statutory licenses unde r 114 the librarian initiated voluntary negotiation proceedings to determine reasonable terms and rates of royalty payments for public performances of sound recordings by means of eligible nonsubscription transmissions and transmissions by new subscription services9 voluntary negotiations take place for six month peri od after that party may petition the librarian to appoint carp to establis h schedule of rates and terms binding upon all parties the recording industry assoc of america riaa did so the carp is directed to determin rates based in part upon the following criteriahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31626crs3 10 17 usc 114f2b 11 the report in its entirety is posted online at the us copyright offices website at httpwwwlocgovcopyrightcarpwebcasting_ratespdfsuch rates and terms shall distinguish among the different types of eligible nonsubscription transmission services then in operation and shall include minimum fee for each such type of rvice such differences to be based on criteria including but not limited to the quantity and nature of the use of sound recordings and the degree to which use of the service may substitute for or may promote the purchase of phonorecords by consumers in establishing rates and terms for transmissions by eligible nonsubscription services and new subscription services the copyright arbitration royalty panel shall establish rates and terms th at most clearly represent the rates and terms that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between willing buyer and willing seller in termining such rates and terms the copyright arbitration royalty panel shall base its decision on economic competitive and programming information presented by the parties including i whether use of the service may substitute for or may promote the sales of phonorecords or otherwise may interfere with or may enhance the sound recording copyright owners other streams of revenue from its sound recordings and ii the relative roles of th copyright owner and the transmitting entity in the copyrighted work and the service made available to the public with respect to relative creative contribu tion technological contribution capital investment cost and risk in establishing such rates and terms the copyright arbitration royalty panel may consider the rates and terms for comparable types of digital audio transmission services and comparab circumstances under voluntary license agreements10 in short the carp is statutorily directed to determine royalty rate that approximates the value willing buyer and willing seller would assign to digital public performance and ephemeral copy ri ghts to do so the panel may consider such factors as the impact of the pub lic performance upon the copyright owners commercial interests the nature of the webcasting service and market rates established by voluntar ily negotiated licenses the carps recommendation the report of the copyright arbitration royalty panel entitled in re rate setting for digital performance right in sound recordings and ephemeral recordings was issued on february 20 200211 i t considers proposed rates for two time periods october 28 1998 december 31 2000 and january 1 2001 to december 31 2002 in lengthy opinion based upon thousands of pages of testimony and evidence the carp recommended public perform ance fee of 014 per performance and an ephemeral license fee of 9 of performan ce fees due for internet transmissions by qualifying webcasters and commercial broadcasters for simultaneous internet retransmission of overtheair am or fm radio broadcasts the proposed performance fee was 007 per performance and an epheme ral license fee of 9 of performance fees due fees for noncommercia l broadcasters who webcast ie those not affiliatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31626crs4 12 chart setting forth the proposed royalties

of performance fees other side channels transmissions were proposed at 014 and 9 of performance fees due the carp also recommended minimum fee of 500 per year for each license which would cover both the perfo rmance and ephemeral licenses12 the carps findings are reported in detail and highlight the evidence and testimony found by it to be significant or of little persua siveness sampling of its findings include the net impact of internet webcasting on record sales is indeterminate13 per performance royalty metric is preferable to percentage of revenue option because in part many webcasters are currently generating very little revenue basing royalties on percentage of revenue could result in an undesi rable situation where copyright owners are forced to allow extensive use of their property with little or compensation and14 although previously negotiated licenses are valuable benchmark for market value it was difficult to rely upon them in the case before it because the preexisting agreements were all recen tly negotiated in the context of newly emerge d webcasting industry involving newlycreated rights thus the new licenses were negotiated without benefit of established historical standards15 the riaas negotiation and license agreement with s ophisticated business user yahoo was more persuasive to it than riaa licenses with minor services the librarian rejects th carp recommendations shortly after the release of the carp report many web casting groups predicted that the proposed royalty rates if adopted would kill the development of webcasting including simultaneous streaming of radio broadcasts16 others defend the rates or argue that such predictions are premature on may 15 2002 the senate judiciary committee held hearing to allow parties

httpwwwcopyrightgovcarpwebcasting_rates_finalhtml2002 the librarian upon the recommendation of the copyright office issued an order rejecting the proposed rates18 the librarians decision on june 20 2002 the librarian issued final regulation establishing new rates19 the major differences between the carp recommendations and the ne w rates are as follows performance fees per performance per listener for internet transmission rates for eligible nonsubscription services was reduced from 014 to 007 which is th same rate as that set for simultaneous internet retransmission of overtheair am or fm radio broadcasts ephemeral license fees were reduced from 9 of performance fees due to 88 the carp had recommended different ra tes for internetonly transmission 014 and retransmission of overtheair broadcasts 007 because it concluded that retransmission of radio broadcasts s substantial promotional value in the sales of sound recordings the copyri ght office and the librarian found this reasoning to be arbitrary and unsuppor ted by evidence before the carp reexamining the riaas licensing agreement with yahoo the librarian found that 007 per performance per listener more accurately represents the blended contract rate for all transmissions under the riaayahoo licensing agreement likewise the copyright office and th librarian found that the ephemeral recording license fee under the riaa yahoo agreement was effectively 88 of performance fees due the carp had factored in higher rates from other agreements to set rate of 9 of performance fees finding those agreements unpersuasive the librarian rolled back the rate to 88 the librarians final regulation makes additional adjustments to the carp recommendations for example fees for noncommercial broadcas ters who webcast ie those not affiliated with the corp fo r public broadcasting were proposed by the carp as 002 per performance and an ephemeral license fee of 9 of performance fees due for simultaneous re transmission of overtheair am or fm broadcasts the librarian accepted th 002 performance fee but adjusted thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31626crs6 20 iomedia partners inc v librarian of congress 021224

daily ed oct 7 2002statement of rep sensenbrenneri am happy to report that introduction of this b ill placed burr under the saddle of both the copyright holders and the small webcasters to conclude negotiations on these matters that began last summer since last week the parties have negotiated around the clock they have now arrived at deal that sets new rates and payment terms that will obviate the need for further legal and administrative intervention the managers amendment simply codifies the terms of that deal 23 id at h7048 24 the bill incorporates the definition of webcaster from 37 cfr

the costs of carp proceedings under current law parties to the ratemaking proceedings are responsible for the entire cost of the arbitration in proportions that the carp may llocate small webcasters have argued that they are unable to participate in the proceedings because the costs incurred would be prohibitive hr 5469 the small webcaster amendments act of 2002 introduced in the house by represen tative sensenbrenne r on september 26 2002 hr 5469 initially provided the determination by the librarian of congress of july 8 2002 of rates and terms for the digital performance of s ound recordings and ephemeral recordings pursuant to section 112 and section 114 of title 17 united states code shall not apply during the 6month peri od beginning on october 20 2002 apparently motivated by the proposed rate suspension affected parties ie vocalists recording artists background mu sicians record labels and small webcasters were encouraged to reach negotiated agreement creating small webcaster royalty rate22 passed by the house under suspension of the rules complex technical 30page managers am endment purported to codify the terms of the agreement23 the primary feature of the bill however reflected goal long sought by webcasters namely royalty based on percentage of webcasters revenues rather than on per song per listener basis specifically the bill defined small webcasters as webcasters24 whose gross revenues from nov 1998 to june 2002 were more than 1000000 whose gross revenues for 2003 are mo re than 500000 and whose gross revenues for 2004 are not more than 1250000

fcclicensed noncommercial webcasters but that classification inadvertently excluded nonfcc licensed noncommercial webcasters such as those operating at colleges and universities28 small webcasters are not defined in the law presumably guidance as to the intended class may be gleaned by reference to the initial housepassed version of hr 546929 or the question may be another subject of negotiation between the parties the law lays particular emphasis on the principle that agreement may be admissible as evidence or taken into account in any pending or subsequent administrative judicial or government royalty ratemaking proceeding including litigation appealing the librar ians july 8 2002 order pending before the us court of appeals for the dc cir by wa of explanation the statute

transmission royalty payments to copyright holders and performers31 nonprofit designated receiving agents are permitted to deduct prior to distribution of receipts reasonable costs incurred in administration and calculation of the royalties reasonable costs for the settlement of disputes relating to the collection and calculation of the royalties and reasonable costs for the licensi ng and
