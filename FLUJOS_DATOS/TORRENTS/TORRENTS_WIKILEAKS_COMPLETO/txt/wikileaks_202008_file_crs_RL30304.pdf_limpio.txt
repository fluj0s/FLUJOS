and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30304the federal excise tax on gasoline and the highway trust fund short history summary excise taxes have long been part of our countrys revenue history in the field of gasoline taxation the states led the way with oregon enacting the first tax on motor fuels in 1919 by 1932 all states and the district of columbia had followed suit with tax rates that rang ed between two and seven cen ts per gallon the federal government first imposed its excise tax on gasoline at onecent per gallon rate in 1932 the gas tax was enacted to correct federal budgetary imbalance it continued to support general reve nue during world war ii and the korean war economists know the gasoline excise ta x as manufacturers excise tax because the government imposes it at production ie the producer refiner or importer for efficiency in collection par ticularly in the short run when the demand for gasoline is relatively inelastic economists recognize any increase in the gasoline tax is generally passed forward to the retailer translating into higher retail gas sales price thus the burden for much of the tax ultimately falls on the consumer the highway revenue act of 1956 estab lished the federal highway trust fund for the direct purpose of funding the constr uction of an interstate highway system and aiding in the finance of primary sec ondary and urban routes this act increased the tax on gasoline from two to three cents per gallon each time congress has extended the highway trust fund it has so extended the federal excise tax on gasoline as recently as 1990 and 1993 congress pa ssed legislation dicating portion of gasoline tax revenue for deficit reduction however none of the current 184cent per gallon tax imposed on gasoline is dedi cated to the general fund one tenth of one cent per gallon is dedicated to th leaking underground storage tank trust fund 286 cents per gallon is allocated fo r mass transit purposes and earmarked to the mass transit account within the hi ghway trust fund and the balance 1544 cents per gallon is earmarked to the hi ghway account also within the highway trust fund president bush recently signed the sa fe

gaso line tax in 1919 as of january 1932 all of the states and the district of columbia had enacted legislation imposing tax on gasoline with rates that ranged from two to seven cents per gallon however during the severe depressi on of the 1930s fede ral revenues were sharply reduced and higher expenditures were made for relief and public works programs as result the secretary of the treasury in his annual report for the fy1931 reported that the federal governme nt had incurred budgetary deficit of some 903 million that year this marked th first year in more than decade when federal receipts failed to exceed fede ral expenditures and produce budgetary surplus moreover the secretary of the treasury estimated then that even higher deficits were anticipated in the year s immediately

modifications to the highway trust fund led to the two year extension congress was concerned that without this legisla tion funding would be interrupted thus congress merely delayed decisionmaking until it could gather additional information two years later congress had not yet d ecided on modifications to the trust fund and its relate d taxes the ways and means committee accepted the recommendation of the public works committee and approved an extension of the trust fund and the taxes payable to the fund this fiveyear extension through september 30 1984 became part of the rface

extended the highwayrelated exci taxes including the tax on gasoline in section 8002a3 for four years hence this law extended the tax on gasoline without an increase in tax rate through september 30 1999 in addition under provisions of the act states were permitted to spend their highway trust fund grants on broader range of lternative transportati on modes and related infrastructure needs this was done in re sponse to the argument that highway users benefit from expenditures on mass transit nd other transportation modes because the availability of these travel alternatives alleviates congestion on existing highways which in turn reduces the need to build additional roadways also included in provisions of istea wa s the establishment of new trust fund known as the national

gasoline tax dedicated for deficit reduction was transferred to the high way trust fund begi nning october 1 1995 this additional 25cents ta x rate was extended from oc tober 1 1995 to september 30 1999 the highway portion of the fund receives two cents while the mass transit account is credited with 05 cent of the increased funding in addition obra93 provided for permanent additi onal 43 cents

treasury as previously related provisions of ob ra90 terminated the lust tax rate of 01 cent on december 31 1995 thus the 183 cen ts federal gasoline excise tax rate was in effect from january 1 1996

and discu ssion of the lust tax see crs report rs21201 leaking underground storage tank s program status and issues by mary tiemannreversion from deficit reduction to user tax status during the early months of 1996 the pr ice of gasoline at the pump was rising and renewed interest developed in federal gasoline ex cise taxes three principal views developed the first view was that the 43 cents increase in federal excise taxes imposed under obra93 should be repeal ed proponents of repeal argued that the 43 cents repeal could lead to simila r reduction in gasoline pump prices two camps developed which supporte d retaining the tax so supporters of the tax expressed the view that while the 43cent tax should be retain ed the tax revenues should be returned to the highway trus t fund for longterm capital improvements they argued for increased funding of th nations highway infrastructure others expressed the view that the monies should continue to be collected and used for deficit reduction this camp of supporters argued that the gasoline price increase was temporary and that over the long term prices would trend lower partially in response to this debate the chairman of the house ways and means committee representative bill archer appointed bipartisan group to examine the tax treatment of each of the transportation modes with goal of rationalizing the current myriad tax rules applying to the transportation sector included in the taxpayer relief act of 199727 was provision that returns the general fund portion of the tax back to the highway trust fund this provision first added by senate am endment and modified in c onference provides that the 43cent tax is divided between the hi ghway account 345 cents and the mass transit account 085 cent the provisi on was effective on october 1 1997 thus of the total 183 cents dedicated to the highway trust fund 1544 cents goes to the highway account and 286 cents to the mass transit account28 as consequence the disposition of revenues was altered by the act so that all revenues now accrue to the highway trust fund and none are pplied to deficit reduction consumers experienced price change due to enactment of this provision since the federal tax rate on gasoline remained the same in addition the taxpayer relief act of 1997 reinstated the leaking underground storage tank trust fund exci tax which had expired january 1 199629 the tax was reinstated at its prior tax rate of 01 cent pe r gallon on all types of motor fuels the tax rate change was effective from october 1 1997 through march 31 200530

sent legislation hr 3 to the president which extended trust fund expe nditures through fy2009 and continued the highway related taxes through fy2011 th legislation also included provisions aimed at stopping fuel fraud provided tax exempt financing authority to finance highway projects and railtruck transfer f acilities and modified number of excise taxes both highway and nonhi ghway related presiden t bush signed the safe accountable flexible efficient transpor tation equity act legacy for users safetealu the highway act into law on august 10 20 05 as expected the act extends for six years the highway trust fund excise taxes due to expire in 2005 until 2011 all of the excise taxes incl uding the federal excise tax on gasoline were continued at the prior tax rates the act established the motor fuel tax enforcement advisory commission which is scheduled to terminate on september 30 2009 in other legislation the energy policy act of 2005 extended the leaking underground storage tank lust trust fund financing rate for the same six year period that the highway excise taxes were extended thus the lust tax will expire after september 30 2011 issues in economic theory there are two principles often cited for determining how the burden of tax ought to be distributed the first is the abilitytopay principle which suggests that tax ought to be positively re lated to an individua ls economic welfare the second principle the benefit principl suggests the burden should relate to an individuals return from the government good or service funded by the tax currently an excise tax on gasoline seems to most closely follow the benefits principle in fact the excise tax has commonly been referred to as user fee however this is not the only economic rati onale that could be forwarded in support of gasoline tax some argue that gasoline taxes and energy taxes more generally can be imposed to influence behavior sp ecifically as mechanism to reduce

in market pricesinternalize the costs of social and environmental externalities such as congestion and pollution37 the economic benefits derived from the expenditure of funds for transportation infrastructure while important to the analysis are distinct from the associated costs and benefits related to the method of ra ising the necessary revenues as indicated in figure 1 gasoline excise tax revenues for fy2001 were 206 billion therefore if gasoline consumpti on rates remain uncha nged each additional onecent tax increase would result in an additional 11 billion in revenue per year particularly in the shortrun when the demand for gasoline is relatively inelastic economists recognize any increase in the gasoline tax is generally passed forward to consumers in the form of higher prices as consumers modify their behaviors to respond to the increase in price depe nding upon the magnitude economic theory would predict consumers would purchase less gasoline all else being equal as result producers and retailers may not be able to pass on the entire magnitude of the tax to consumers although consumers woul d likely bear the majority of the excise tax increase on gasoline producers may ve lower net revenue s and thus share some portion of the burden on the following page appears table 1 complete summary of the gasoline tax rate
