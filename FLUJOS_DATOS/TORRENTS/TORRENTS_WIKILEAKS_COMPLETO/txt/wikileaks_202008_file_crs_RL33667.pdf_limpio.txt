provision authorizing the issuance of presidential signing statements article i of the constitution provides only that the president shall sign bill of which he approves while in vetoing measure the president is required to return the measure with his objections to that house in which it shall have originated4 however presidents have issued such statements since the monroe administration and ther is little evident c onstitutional or legal support for the proposition that the presid ent may be constrained from issuing statement regarding provision of law the first controversy arising in this context stemmed from signing statement issued by andrew jackson in 1830 that rais ed objections to an appropriations bill that involved internal improvements5 the bill specifically addressed road examinations and surveys in his signing statement president jackson declared that the road in question which was to reach from detroit to chicago should not extend beyond the territory of michigan6 subsequently issued house report criticized jacksons action characterizing it as in ffect constituting line item veto7 likewise signing statement issued by president tyle r in 1842 expressing doubts bout the constitutionality of bill regarding the pportionment of congre ssional districts was characterized by select committee of the house as defacement of the public records and archives8 perhaps sensitized by this re buke presidents polk and pierce apologized for the issuance of signing statements noting that such action departed from the traditional practice of notifying cong ress of the approval of bill via an oral message from the presidents private secretary9 this conception of signing statement as an unusual instrument was again noted by president grant in 1875 when he declared that his use of si gning statement was an unusual method of conveying the notice of approval10 signing statements remained comparatively rare through the end of the 19th century but had become common instruments by 1950 president truman forinstance issued nearly 16 signing statements per year on average with the figure steadily increasing up to the modern day concurrent with the rise in the number

prevalent over the past 60 years this type of executive action began in earnest during the reagan administration as one aspect of comprehensive strategy employed by the reagan administration to aggressively assert the constitutional prerogatives of the presidency11 signing statements in the reagan administration president reagan expanded the use and impact of the presid ential signing statem ent transforming it into mechanism for the assertion of pr esidential authority and intent president reagan issued 250 signing statements 86 of which 34 objected to one or more of the statutory provisions signed into law12 one key aspect of president reagans approach in this context centered on attempts to establish the signing statement as part of the legislative history of an enac tment and concordantly to persuade courts to take the statements into consideration in judicial rulings this goal was illustrated in memorandum drafted by samuel alit jr then serving in the office of legal counsel olc of the department of ju stice announcing primary objective to ensure that presidential signing statements assume their rightful place in the interpretation of legislation13 to this end attorney general edwin meese iii entered into an agreement in 1986 with the west publishing company for signing statements to be included in the legislative histories contained in its us code congressional and administrative news publication14 this strategy met with degree of success in two major supreme court cases that were decided during this time period in ins v chadha which struck down as unconstitutional the congressional practice of subjecting various executive branch actions to legislative veto the court noted that 11 presidents from mr wilson through mr reagan who have been presen ted with this issue have gone on record at some point to challenge congressional vetoes as unconstitutional15 likewise in bowsher v synar which struck down provisions of the grammrudman deficit reduction act on the basis that they impermissibly imbued legislative branch officer with executive authority the court noted in his signing statement the president expressed his view that the act was constitutionally defective because of the comptroller generals ability to exercise supervisory authority over the president16 while these citations by the court lend credence to validity of signinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33667crs4 16 continued decision in bowsher v synar 17 see n 93 and accompanying text infra 18 pl 98369 deficit reduction act of 1984 st atement by president ronald w

supra at 323statements as constitutional presidential instruments it does not appear that the statements were in fact relied upon in any determinative degree by the court indeed as discussed in further detail below the contents of signing statements do not seem to have factored prominen tly in judicial decisions17 one of the most significant conflicts i nvolving presidential signing statement in the reagan administration arose from th presidents statement accompanying the signing of the deficit reduc tion act of 1984 in that statement the president took issue with provisions of the bill constitu ting the competition in contracting act announcing his vigorous objection to certain provisions that would unconstitutionally attempt to delegate to the comptro ller general the power to perform duties and responsibilities that in our constitutional system may be performed only by officials of the executive branch18 the president further stated that he was instructing the attorney gene ral to inform all executive branch agencies as soon as possible with respect to how th ey may comply with the provisions of the bill in manner consistent with the constitution19 president reagan was specifically objecting to an automatic st ay provision that prohibited the award of government contracts during any peri od where the comptroller general was investigating complaints that an agency had not complied with the competitive bidding procedures required by the act subs equent to this declaration the director of the office of management and b udget omb issued omb bulletin 858 instructing federal agencies not to coope rate with gaos effort s to implement the act20 given that the actions taken by the re levant agencies pursuant to the specific instructions contained in the bulletin directly impacted contractors the issue was ripe for judicial review judicial ruling issued in ma rch of 1985 upheld the conferral of power at issue21 however the administration persisted in its refusals to give effect to the terms of the act acceding only in th face of additional rulings on the issue as well as vote by the house judiciary co mmittee to eliminate funds for the office of the attorney general from the budget22 b signing statements in the ge orge hw bush administration the administration of president george hw bush bush i continued to employ signing statements to further presidential prerog atives issuing 228 signing statements 107 of which 47 raised constitutional or legal objections23 in particular the bush i administration was

by an olc opinion drafted by deputy attorney general william p barr in this memo barr identified ten categories of legislative action he considered constitutionally problematic and noted that the administration had objected to many of these perceived in trusions through the issuance of signing statements24 one category that was consistently acted upon by the bush i administration was protection of presidential authority under the appointments clause of the constitution for example upon signing the national and community services act of 1990 into law president bush issued statement declaring that provisions in the bill establishing board of directors charged with administering national and community services act commission were unconstitutional due to the requirement that certain appointees were to be draw n from pool of nominees forwarded by the speaker of the house of representatives and the majority leader of the senate president bush specifically noted that ch requirement exceeded the authority of congress in the appointment context and d eclared that he would treat the requirement as being without legal force or effect the president further directed the attorney general to prepare remedial legislati on for submission to the congress during its next session so that the act can be broug ht into compliance with the constitutions requirements congress subsequently passed bill remedying the constitutionally challenged provisions additionally upon si gning the dayton heritage preservation act of 1992 into law president bush issued statement objecting to language in the bill that directed the secretary of interior to make appointments of individuals to heritage commission based on the recommendations of local officials stating that since the majority of members are ffectively selected by various nonfederal officials and thus are not appointed in conformity with the appointments clause of the constitution he was signing the bill on the understanding that the commission will serve only in an advisory capacity and will not exercise government power the bush i administration subsequently refused to make any appointments to the commission until this concern was addressed in remedial legislative action in 199525 the bush i administration also continued to pursue strategy of employing signing statements to influence the interpretation of the legislative history accompanying bill however as in the reagan administra tion it is not apparent that these efforts were successful c signing statements in the clinton administration while the policy aims of his administration might have differed president clintons conception of executive power revealed itself to be largely consonant with the philosophical underpinnings of the reagan and bush i administrations26 accordingly president clinton also made active use of signing statements as mechanism to asserthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33667crs6 27 see

office of legal counsel of the department of justice to produce memora nda not only in support of the issuance of signing statements generally but also asserting presidential authority to refuse to enforce unconstitutional statutes regarding the former then assistant attorney general walter dellinger prep ared an olc memorandum asserting that the issuance of signing statements to make substantive legal constitutional or administrative pronouncements was well blished and that these uses generally serve legitimate and defensible purposes28 in subsequent memorandum assistant attorney general dellinger declared that there are circumstances in which the president may appropriately decline to enforce statute that he views as unconstitutional29 in support of this general proposition that mr dellinger believed to be uncontrove rsial the memorandum pointed to what he argued was significant judicial approval and consis tent and substantial executive practice30 it is important to note that while th dellinger memorandum asserted that the president has an enhanced responsibility to resist unconstitutional provisions that encroach upon the constitutional power of the presidency the memo nonetheless acknowledged that the suprem court plays special role in resolving disputes about the constitutionality of enactments accordingly the memorandum advised as general matter if the president believes that the court would sustain particular provision as constitutional the president should execute the statute notwithstanding his own beliefs about th constitutional issue if however the president exercising his independent j udgment determines both that provision would violate the constitution and that it is probable that the court would agree with him the president has the authority to decline to execute the statute31 the memorandum went on to advise that in deciding whether to refuse to enforce provision of law the president s hould weigh the effect of compliance with the provision on the constitutional rights of affected individuals and on the executive branchs constitutional authority with focus on the likelihood of whether that compliance or noncompliance would per mit judicial resolution of the issue32 while this recommendation appears to be based on determina tion that it would be morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33667crs7 33 id at 201 34 see bradley and posner n 12 supra at 326 35 idappropriate to limit refusal to enforce law to situations that would afford the supreme court an opportunity to review the cons titutional judgment of the legislative branch the memorandum nonetheless declar ed that some encroachments would not be justiciable and that in such in stances the president must shoulder the responsibility of protecting the cons titutional role of the presidency33 in light of this conception of presidential power it is not surprising that the clinton signing statements often c ontained broad cons titutional pronouncements similar to those of the reagan and bush i administrations ranging from the foreign affairs power to the recommendation clause regarding the latter in signing statement accompanying the balanced budget act of 1997 president clinton took objection to provision requiring the secr etary of health and human services to develop certain legislative proposals declar ing that he would construe this provision in light of my constitutional duty and authority to recommend to the congress such legislative measures as i judge necessary and expedient and to supervise and guide my subordinates including the review of their proposed communications to congress34 like his predecessor president clinton also guarded presidential appointment prerogatives objecting to pr ovisions he perceived as impinging upon executive authority in that context for example in statement issued along with the enactment of the coast guard authoriza tion act of 1997 president clinton likewise objected to provision of the bill that purported to require the designation of certain commission members exercising executive power from persons recommended by local officials or organizations president clinton declared that the appointments clause does not permit such restrictions to be impos ed upon the executive branchs powers of appointment theref ore i will not interpret this provision of the act as binding and i direct the secr etary of transportation to re gard the designations and recommendations arising from it as advisory only35 while signing statements that raise constitutional objections or signal an intention to refuse to enforce provision in law are usually generalized in nature president clintons statement accompanying the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2000 provides stark exampl of substantive presidential directive being included within statement itself the act established the national nuclear security administration nnsa new semiautonomous agency within the department of energy to manage and oversee the operational and security activities of the departments nucl ear weapons laboratories in his signing statement the president expressed misgivings with respect to structural arrangements within the new agency and the limitations on the secretary of energys ability to direct and contro l the activities and personnel of the nnsa but did not suggest that the legislation raised constitutional issues in particular the president objected to what he saw as the isolation of the pers onnel and contractors of the nnsa from direction by

environmental laws would be fulfilled under the new arrangement the removal of the secretarys direct authority over certain sensitive classified programs and the potentially deleterious effect of the creation of redundant support f unctions in the areas of procurement personnel public affairs legal affairs and counterintelligence to ensure that these perceived deficiencies do not in his view undermin the secretarys statutory responsibilities in the area the president directed the secretary to assume the duties and functions of the new office of under secretary for nuclear security and to

to mitigate the risks to the chain of command between him and subordinate agency personnel pr esented by the legislations redundant functions to the extent permissible under law the president indicated that he might not submit nominee for under secretary for nuclear security until action was taken by congress to remedy the identif ied deficiencies and to harmonize the secretarys authorities with those vested in the under secretary whereas the statement issued by pr esident reagan in response to the competition in contracting act was typical of presidential signing statements in that it contained generalized constitutional objection to provision in bill followed by subsequent particularized and substantive presidentia l action president clintons nnsa statement was uncharacteristically direct laying out the specific actions that were to be taken in order to ensure the vitiation of the provisions president clinton deemed objectionable as noted by professo r philip j cooper this statement did not simply raise generalized constitutional objection or signal an intent to refuse to enforce the provisions at issue but rather constituted an order to do that which the congress had expressly rejected36 d signing statements in the ge orge w bush administration like its predecessors the administration of geor ge w bush bush ii has employed the signing statement to voice constitutional objections to or concerns with congressional enactments or to enunciate the administra tions interpretation of an enactment it deems ambiguous however while the nature and scope of the objections raised by the bush ii administration mirror those of prior administrations the sheer number of challenges contained in the signing statements issued by president bush indicate that the current administration is using this presidential instrument relative to all levels and elements of the executive branch and to aggressively assert presidential prerogatives in its relations with the congress and the judiciary these factors in turn have generated significant degree of controversy regarding the issuance of presidential signing statements at first glance it does not appear that president bush has departed significantly from prior practice in the signing statement context having issued 152 signing statements as compared to 381 during the clinton administration however the qualitative difference in the bush ii approach becomes apparent when consideringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33667crs9 37 see neil kinkopf index of presidential signing

challenge or objection as compared to 70 18 during the clinton administration37 even more significant however is the fact that these 118 signing statements ar typified by multiple constitutional and statutory objections containi ng challenges to more than 1000 distinct provisions of law38 contributing to the controversy has been the high profile of several of the provisions that have been objected to by pr esident bush for instance in the signing statement accompanying the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act of 2005 president bush declared that provisi ons requiring the executive branch to submit reports and audits to congress would be construed in manner consistent with the presidents constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch and to withhold information the disclosure of which could impair foreign relations national security the deliberative processes of the executive or the performance of the executives constitutional duties39 likewise in the signing statement accompanying the law that contained the mccain amendment as part of the detainee treatment act pr ohibiting the use of torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners the president declared that the executive branch would construe that provision in manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the president to superv ise the unitary executive branch and as commander in chief in order to prot ect the american pe ople from further terrorist attacks40 while the number of provisions challenged or objected to by president bush has given rise to controversy it is important to note that the substance of his signing statements do not appear to differ subs tantively from those issued by either presidents reagan or clinton as with those administrations the majority of the bush ii signing statements make generalized objections to perceived encroachments on executive authority41 moreover in almost all instances where president bush has raised constitutional concern or obj ection he has stated that he w ill construe the provision at issue in manner that will avoid his concerns42 relatedly in somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33667crs10 43

generalized assertions of presidential authority to supervise the unitary executive branch44 to federalism limits imposed by the supreme court in united states v printz 45 the bush ii administration has been particularly prolific in issuing signing statements that object to provisions that it claims in fringe on the presidents power over foreign affairs oftentimes with regard to requirements that the administration take particular position in negotia tions with foreign powers provisions that require the submission of proposals or recommendations to congress46 asserting that they interfere with the presidents author ity under the recommendations clause to recommend such measures as he shall j udge necessary and expedient provisions imposing disclosure or reporting require ments on the ground that such provisions may interfere with the presidents aut hority to withhold sensitive or privileged information conditions nd qualifications on executiv appointments asserting infringement on the

while the substance of the bush ii signing statements appear to be comparable to those of previous administrations the nature and sheer number of provisions challenged or objected to indicates that there is none theless qualitative difference to the current administrations use of this instrument as has been widely noted president bush has emphatically endorsed the unitariness of the executive

control over the agency rulemaking process48 and has issued executive orders claiming authority to control the release of presidential records and to classify and reclassify information that

statements june 27 2006energy policy development group to the government accountab ility office leading to the litigation in walker v cheney 50 when viewed through the prism of th administrations actions in these contexts it seems evident that the bush ii signing statements are an integral part of the administrations efforts to further its broad view of presidential prerogatives and to assert functional and determinative control over all elements of the executive decisionmaking process furthermore the dramatic increase in the number of provisions challenged by and objected to by president bush has been widely seen as being aimed at altering the conception of presidential authority not only in the internal operations of the executive branch but with respect to congress the courts and the public as touched upon above the large bulk of the signing statements the bush ii administration has issued to date do not apply particularized constitutional rationales to specific scenarios nor do they contain ex plicit measurable refusals to enforce law instead the statements make broad nd largely hortatory assertions of executive authority that make it effectively impossible to ascertain what factors if any might lead to substantive constitutional or interpretive conflict in the implementation of an act the often vague nature of these c onstitutional challenges coupled with the pervasive manner in which they have been raised in numerous signing statements could thus be interpreted as an attempt by the administration to systematically object to any perceived congressional encroachment however slight with the aim of inuring the other branches of government and th public to the validity of such objections and the attendant conception of presidential authority that will presumably follow from sustained exposure and acquies cence to such claims of power the current administrations expansive assertion of its prerogatives through the use of signing statements has generated significant degree of controversy leading some to call for the enactment of bar to their issuance or for the conferral upon congress of the right to challenge statements in court51 however an analysis of the underlying legal and cons titutional issues suggests that such approaches misapprehend the nature of signing statements generally as well as the nature of the pragmatic and institutional concerns that are posed by the attempts at assertion of executive power underlying the cont roversy over these instruments legal and constitutional impli cations of signing statements as has been illustrated there is long history of presidential issuance of signing statements and these statements provide one way in which president may indicate his intent to refuse to enforce provisi

legal effect as one commentator has suggested where the president has played major ro in drafting or supporting particular statutory provision presidential statem ents should be granted interpretive significance when the president opposed the provision being interpreted however his signing statements lack persuasive authority53 this observation is buttressed by the analysis of the district court in dacosta v nixon which stated that bill when passed by congress and approved by the president establishes the policy of th united states to the exclusion of any different executive or administrative policy and has binding force and effect on every officer of the government matte r what their private judgments of that policy and illegalizes the pursuit of an inconsistent executive or administration policy executive statement denying efficacy to legislation could have either validity or effect54 irrespective of this maxim presidents have repeatedly declared their intention to disregard laws that they view as unconstitutional55 this persistent practice on the part of presidents gives rise to the question of whether president can refuse to comply with law he believes to be unconstitutional the supreme court has not directly addressed this issue but long line of precedent could be taken to indicate consistent view on the part of the court that the take care clause56 imposes duty on the president to ensure that officials obey congresss instructions and conversely that the clause does not imbue the president with the authority to dispense with congressional enactments in kendall v united states ex rel stokes for instance the court declared that where congress has imposed upon an executive officer valid duty the duty and responsibility grow out of and are subject to the control of the law and not to the direction of the president57 underlying the courts rejection of the governments argument that the take care clause carried with it the power to control executive officials was the desire to avoid clothing the president with power entirely to control the legislation of congress to contend that the obliga tion imposed on the president to see the laws faithfully executed implies power to forbid their execution is novelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33667crs13 58 id at 610 59 272 us 52 177 1926 60 343 us 579 587 1952 61 see walter dellinger presidential

the president in myers v united states for instance the court declared that the duty of the president to see that the laws be executed is duty that does not go beyond the laws or require him to ach ieve more than congress sees fit to leave within his power59 likewise in youngstown sheet tube co v sawyer the court declared that the presidents power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be lawmaker the constitution limits his functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of laws he thinks wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks bad60 despite these declarations from the cour t the executive branch has consistently maintained that the president possesses aut hority to decline to enforce enactments he views as unconstitutional61 as enunciated in the dellinger memo62 the department of justice doj has pointed to the courts decision in myers v united states for support for this proposition asserting that si nce the court sustained the presidents view that the statute at issue was unconstitutional without any member of the court suggesting that the president had acted improperly in refusing to abide by the statute the court could therefore be seen to have implicitly vindicated the view that the president may refuse to comply with statute that limits his constitutional powers if he believes it to be unconstitutional63 additionally the dellinger memo pointed to justice jack sons concurrence in youngstown as recognizing the existence of the presidents authority to act c ontrary to statutory command and has likewise cited justice scalias concurrence in freytag v commissioner for the proposition that the president has the power to veto encroaching laws or even to disregard them when they are unconstitutional64 it is not at all clear that the reliance of the doj on these factors would bear the weight of direct judicial scrutiny sp ecifically as noted above the court in myers v united states evidenced clear appreciation of the limits of the presidents authority under the take care clause as such ther would appear to be little support for the dojs conclusion that myers implicitly validated the notion that the president may refuse to enforce laws he deems unconstitutional particularly in light of the fact that the court in myers did not address the presidents refusal to enforce the law at issue as was

first while the concurrence contemplates the allocati on of power between congress and the executive in the event that the president takes measures incompatible with the express or implied will of congress it like the majority opinion in myers does not give any substantive consideration whatsoever to the presidents authority to decline to enforce the law66 second the doj opinion does not address the holding of the majority in youngstown that the constitution limits the presidents functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of laws he thinks wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks bad67 likewise justice sca lias concurrence in freytag while probative does not provide an substantive analysis in support of this proposition and arose in case that di d not involve executive refusal to comply with the law while the court has not had occasion to address the issue directly the cases discussed above could be taken to indicate rejection on the part of the court that the president possesses the power to suspend act s of congress instead establishing that the president is bound to give effect to such enactments pursuant to the take care clause the natural corollary of this proposition as touched upon by the court in youngstown is that the proper course of action for the president when faced with bill he deems unconstitutional is to exercise his article i veto authority68 however as is evidenced by the doj opinion discu ssed above there are competing viewpoints on this issue as such it is not possible to state conclusively that the president lacks any authority whatsoever to decline to enforce laws he deems unconstitutional absent definitive consideration of the issue by the court substantiality of constitutional objections while presidential authority to refuse to enforce laws he considers unconstitutional is matter of significant constitutional importance the issue is ultimately of little concern with regard to th legality or effect of signing statements themselves as the judicial maxims discu ssed above establish there is little evident support for the notion that signing statemen ts are instruments with legal force and effect in and of themselves if an action ta ken by president in fact contravenes legal or constitutional provisions that illegality is not augmented or assuaged merely by the issuance of signing statement commentators argue that this dynamic lends credence to the notion that signing statements have been employed by the bush ii administration not to flatly reject congressional enactments but rather are intended to sensitize other parties to the presid ents conception of executive authority moreover the usage of signing statements as an instrument to expand executive authority generally as opposed to mechan ism by which the president has claimedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33667crs15 summary authority to dispense with the laws enacted by congress becomes more apparent when the merits of the objections that typify signing statements are examined in particular such analysis indicates that while there are instances in which signing statements ar predicated on specific nd supportable concerns the majority of the objections raised for example in president bushs signing statements are largely unsubstantive or are so general as to appear to be hor tatory assertions of executive authority foreign affairs power and executive privilege as noted above foreign affairs legislation has been one of the primary areas in which president bush has repeatedly raised constitutional objections or challenges for example remarking upon provisions of the syria accountability and lebanese sovere ignty restoration act of 2003 that required the imposition of sanctions against syria absent presidential determination and certification that certain conditions had been met by syria or determination that national s ecurity concerns justified waiver of sanctions the president bush declared law cannot burden or infringe the presid ents exercise of core constitutional power by attaching conditions precedent to the use of that power the executive branch shall construe and implement this requirement in manner consistent with the presidents constitutional aut hority to conduct the nations foreign affairs and as commander in chief in pa rticular with respect to the conduct of foreign diplomats in the united states the conduct of united states diplomats abroad and the exportation of items and provision of services necessary to the performance of official functions by united states government personnel abroad additionally remarking upon provisions that required the secretary of state to submit reports regarding syrias compliance with the conditions of the act and that nations dealings with terrorists the president declared the executive branch shall construe this requirement in manner consistent with the presidents constitutional au thority to withhold information the disclosure of which could impair foreign relations national security the deliberative processes of the executive or the performance of the executives constitutional duties this signing statement is typical of the bush ii administrations approach in that it challenges more than one provision of the bill and voices objection across range of constitutional principles while the broad and generalized nature of the presidents remarks make it difficult to determine specific objections that might arise in the implementation of the act it may be assumed that president bush determined that the requirements imposed by congre ss under these portions of the act raised separation of powers concerns to the extent that they could be construed as impinging upon core presidential powers or impairing th presidents ability to protect national security information or delib erations with his advisors regarding the concerns voiced over the executives foreign affair prerogatives it should be noted that the supreme

for instance the court interpreted the separation of powers doctrine as it applied to the grammrudman deficit reduction act under the act the comptroller general was empow ered to review deficit estimates from the office of management and budget and the congressional budget office and to mandate spending reductions to meet specified deficit level this report by the comptroller general would then be forwarded to th president who was required to issue an order enforcing the spending reductions the order would become effective unless congress passed legislation which reduced spending to meet deficit estimates furthermore the comptroller general could only be removed by congress via joint resolution id at 728 the supreme court found that the act imbued the comptroller genera l an official appointed by the president but removable by congress with the power to interpret provisions of the act and to dictate the means by which the executive branch implemented budget reduction

however the presidents citation of this maxim in his signing statement could be seen as hortatory assertion of broad executive authority regarding the condu ct of foreign affairs that does not acknowledge the substantial authority that is likewise possessed by congress in this context specifically while it is generally conceded that there are some powers enjoyed by the president alone regarding foreign affairs70 it is likewise evident that congress possesses wide authority to promulgate policies respecting foreign affairs71 congress has often exercised this authority to determine

concerns regarding certain provisions of the act regarding the setting of conditions for sanctions the presidents signing statement does not raise any specific objections thereto instead the statement makes generalized assertion regarding presidential authority over foreign affairs that appears to be of little substantive weight in light of the dispersed allocation of power between the political branches in this context the presidents statement that the execu tive branch will construe provisions of the act requiring the submission of inform ation to congress i n manner consistent with the presidents constitutional author ity to withhold info rmation would also appear to constitute generalized declaration of executive power given that it likewise does not raise any specific objec tion to the provision or provide any substantive analysis of how its requirements might impinge upon executive authority to the extent that this portion of the sign ing statement might be taken to indicate position on the part of the executive that it possesses an absolute right to withhold documents from congress it should be noted that judicial and historical precedents run to the contrary regarding the duties imposed on the secretar of state under the act it is well established that cong ress may impose reporting requirements upon executive branch officials73 and nothing in the act purports to strip the president of his authority to assert va lid claim of privilege or to withhold documents on the basis of national security regarding claims of privilege with regard to presidential communications the court held in united states v nixon that the notion of privilege is constitutionally rooted nd that when invoked by the president the materials at issue are deemed presumptively privileged74 however the court further held that the privilege is qualified not absolute and may be overcome by an adequate showing of need75 the court in nixon indicated that the presidents authority to protect military diplomatic or sensitive national security secrets was significantly greater than his power to protect the confidentiality of executive communications76 this statement by the court was consistent with prev ious decisions recognizing presidential authority with regard to military and diplomatic matters in cs airlines v waterman corp for instance the court stated that it would be

deference to the executive in this context do not apply to access by congress in united states v american telephone and telegraph co the court of appeals for the district of columbia rejected the argument that the constitution confers on the executive absolute discretion in the area of national security78 in support of this holding the court explained while the constitution assigns to the pr esident number of powers relating to national security including the function of commander in chief and the power to make treaties and appoint amba ssadors it confers upon congress other powers equally inseparable from the nati onal security such as the powers to declare war raise and support armed forces and in the case of the senate consent to treaties and the appointment of ambassadors79 while acknowledging the powers conferre d upon both branches in this context it is important to note that the court in att rejected the notion that disputes over such information were political questi ons beyond the jurisdiction or proper role of court80 rather the court left open the possibility that disputes over information pertaining to national security could be resolved by the judiciary in the event that congress and the executive could not reach compromise on given issue81 thus while the aforementioned cases tablish that the president has inherent constitutional authority to protect the confidentiality of executive communications and national security information it is lik ewise apparent that these powers are not absolute with congress posse ssing concordant authority to investigate and inquire into such matters accordingly it seems apparent that the presidents generalized concerns regarding to the requirements of the act are not buttressed by any underlying definitive right to withhold information from congress these constitutional and legal principles are applicable to almost every other signing statement that raises constitutional objections or challenges to congressional enactments in foreign affairs or executive privilege contexts in that the general assertions of authority disc ussed above are the norm in these statements this signing statement is also typical of the bush ii administrations approach given that there is indication that president bush has in fact refused to follow any of the provisions of the act at issue in fact president bu sh has issued an executive order that both implements sanctions as prescribed in the act and acknowledges the reporting requirements imposed by the secret ary of state without objection

congresss authority to compel and receive information directly from executive branch agencies congress has imposed direct reporting requirements on executive branch officials since the first congress legislation establishing the treasury department required the secretar to report to congress and to perform all such services relative to the finances as he shall be directed to perform83 alexander hamilton serving as the first s ecretary of the treasury submitted reports to the house of representatives pursuan t to this command and began each report with an acknowledgment of the order of the house that had directed him to report84 furthermore prior to the establishmen t of the presidents authority over the executive branch budget process in the budget and accounting act of 192185 each agency submitted its annual budget request directly to congress86 finally the supreme court has long recognized the validity of reporting requirements87 and in ins v chadha 88 the court explicitly affirmed congresss authority to impose report and wait provisions distinguishing them from the unconstitutional legislative veto provisions under review in that case in light of these factors it seems apparent that signing statements objecting to direct reporting requirements represent an attempt to sensitize executive personnel to the wishes of the president and to assert broad conception of presidential power in the face of congressional enactments rather than definite and substantive refusal to enforce congressional enactment legislative veto provisions president bush has also been quite active in issuing signing statements that object to bills passed by congress that impose legislative veto over actions taken by the executive branch presidential action in this context is particularly interesting as it provides an example of context in which the presidents declarations are on solid cons titutional footing as well as the opportunity to analyze two conceptually related arguments that have been raised against the issuance of signing statements generally as noted above the supreme courts holding in ins v chadha invalidated the use of legislative veto by congress by vi rtue of the courts determination that such action violates the bicameralism and presentment clause of the constitution despite this ruling congress has continued to pass legislation imposing facially

provisions prior adminis trations objected to these provisions in signing statements and the bush ii administration has maintained this practice issuing approximately 47 statements th at contain objections to provisions in legislation passed by congress that it cl aims violate the separation of powers principles delineated in chadha 89 an example of this approach may be found in president bushs signing statement accompanying the agriculture rural development food and drug administra tion and related agen cies appropriations act there the president declared that the executive branch shall construe certain provisions of the act that purport to require congressional committee approval for the execution of law as calling solely for tification as any othe r construction would be inconsistent with the principles enunc iated by the supreme court of the united states in ins v chadha 90 while signing statements that raise broad assertions of executive authority and general constitutional objections to bills passed by congress may indicate an overly broad conception of presidential power stat ements that object to legislative vetoes are supported by supreme court precedent relatedly it could be argued that the apparent purpose behind the continued congressional practice of imposing such requirements in turn illustra tes the dynamic underlying th objections and assertions of authority that characterize signing statements despite the apparent facial unconstitutionality of such provisions relatively little complaint has been voiced concerning congresss persistence in passing bills that contain legislative veto provisions the apparent motivation for this practice arises from the fact that while congress and its committees may not anticipate formal legal compliance with such provisions and often do not expect to be able to enforce them pragmatic political considerations oftentimes result in substantive acquiescence by the agencies involved91 in essence the passage of legisl ative veto provisions subsequent to chadha constitutes an attempt by congress to leverage informal compliance from executive agencies the implicit message being that the affected agency may face difficulties in the legislative oversight or budgetary processes if it does not accede to congressional will in this context accordingly presidential signing statement objecting to legislative veto provision rves not only as response to perceived encroachment on executive branch prerogativ but also as declaration that the administration expects and will be supportiv of the rejection of such congressional assertions of authority by affected agencies institutional implications of signing statements the generalized nature of the constitutional objections and assertions of authority that pervade signing statements c oupled with the fact that such instruments do not have any legal force or effect in nd of themselves lends support to the notionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33667crs21 92 see crs report 97589 statutory interpretation gene ral principles and recent trends by george coste llo at p 48 2006 93 id at 49 that the bush ii administration is employing these instruments as means by which it can make broad claims to extensive and exclusive authority this approach necessarily raises questions regarding the impact of signing statements on the exercise of executive authority in relation to the traditional roles of congress and the judiciary statutory construction and the courts with regard to the judicial branch the primary consideration is whether the courts have in fact begun to give degree of determinative weight to signing statements in manner akin to traditional sources of legislative history as noted bove one of the factors that appears to have motivated the increase in the issuance of signing statements beginning in the reagan administration was to encourage judici reliance upon the viewpoints contained therein after persuading west publishing company to include signing statements along with legislative hi stories contained in the united states code congressional and administrative news attorney general edwin meese stated that this inclusion would facilitate the use of signing statements by courts for future construction of what the statute actually means92 despite these efforts it does not appear that courts have incorporated signing statements in the manner hoped for by th reagan administration presumably due to traditional practice as motivated by c onstitutional precepts in particular it could be argued that while there is little support for the notion that the constitution somehow implicitly forbids the issuance of signing statements the nature of the presidents role in vetoin g or approving legislation has nonetheless militated against courts granting interpretive weight to signing statements specifically while the constitution provides that the president is to note his objections upon the veto of bill there is corresponding requireme nt that he announce his reasons for its approval in turn there is constitutionally prescribed procedure by which congress is to consider objections raised by pres ident in formulating response to veto but not for congressional response to signing statement while this dichotomy does not require that courts disregard signing stat ements as there is likewise corresponding constitutional validation of committee reports floor debates and other legislative history93 it arguably lends weight to the notion that presidential signing statements should be discounted when they conflict w ith congressional explanations that have traditionally enjoyed judicial deference in particular well established rule for resolving conflicts in legislative history establishes that when the two houses have disagreed on the meaning of identical language in bill that did not go to conference the explanation that was before both houses prevails in the event that the court turns to the legislative history the rationale is that congressiona l intent should depend upon the actions of both houses accordingly given that congress has opportunity to act in response to interpretati ons set forth in signing statements therehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33667crs22 94 id at 4950 95 clinton v city of new york 524 us 417 1998 invalidating

there is r oom for doubt as to the weight to be accorded presidential signing statement in illumina ting congressional intent president reagans views are significant here because the execu tive branch participated in the negotiation of the compromise legislation united states v story 891 f2d 988 994 2d cir 1989is lessened support for the notion that cour ts should rely upon them to interpret the aim of congre ssional enactment94 related issue arising from this constitutional provision centers on the fact that the president may only approve or veto bill in its entirety the president does not possess inherent lineitem veto authority and it is well established that congress cannot grant the president such authority by statute95 thus it could be argued that if the courts were to give determinative weight to signing statements in negating statutory provisions president would eff ectively possess power analogous to line item veto96 however there is indication th at this has occurred rendering this dynamic of greater interest in relation to the impact of signing statements on executive branch interaction with congress information contained in signing statements may be entitled to more significant judicial consideration if the president or his administration worked closely with congress in developing the gislation and if the approve d version incorporated the presidents recommendations97 this principle can be applied not only to bills introduced at the administrations behest but also to bills the final content of which resulted from compromise negotiations between the administration and congress98 in such circumstances of course signing statements are used to explain rather thannegate congressional action and are mo st valuable as lending support to congressional explanations although signing statements are not gene rally treated as significant part of legislative history by the courts they nonethel ess affect interpretati on by virtue of the effect of directives contained therein on actions taken by administering agencies courts grant high degree of deference to interpretations of agencies charged with implementing statutes premised on the notion that congress has authorized the agency to speak with the force of law through rulemaking or other formal process congress has not authorized the president to speak with the force of law through signing statements so although signing statements ma influence or even control agency implementation of statut it is the implementation and not the signing statement itself that would be measured against the statutes requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33667crs23 99 see costello n 92 supra 100 hamdan v rumsfeld 05154 slip op us june 29 2006 it is interesting to note however that

signing statements might be considered analogous to informal agency actions entitled to respect only to the extent that they have the power to persuade99 ultimately it does not appear that the courts have relied on signing statements in any appreciably substantive fashion as touched upon above the references made to signing statements in the supreme courts decisions in bowsher v synar and ins v chadha were perfunctory in na ture furthermore in hamdan v rumsfeld the supreme court made reference whatsoever to the presidents signing statement in rejecting the contention that the detainee treatment act did not apply to pending habeas petitions of gauntanamo detainees100 impact on congress one of the main complaints lodged by the aba task force in opposition to the issuance of presid ential signing statements is based on the viewpoint that the objections and challeng raised therein improperly circumvent the veto process delineated in the constitution101 according to this argument the president by refusing to veto bill that contains provisions he does not intend to enforce expands the presidential role in lawmaking beyond the constitutional parameters of recommending laws he thinks wise and vetoing laws he thinks bad102 and deprives congress of the opport unity override presidential veto while this pos ition has degree of intuitive appeal in light of the maxims pronounced in cases such as youngstown it could misapprehend th nature of signing statements as presidential instruments as well as the actual substantive concerns that underlie their issuance first as the sign ing statements discu ssed above illustrate it is exceedingly rare for president to make direct announcement that he will categorically refuse to enforce provision he finds troublesome instead the concerns voiced in the statements are generally vague with regard both to the nature of the objection and what circumstances might give rise to an actual conflict the aba task force reports concern on this poi nt also seems to assume that the interpretation and applicati on of congressional enactments is black and white issue when in reality inherent ambiguity in the text almost always allows for competing interpretations of what the provision at i ssue requires given this dynamic it is not surprising that presidents interpreta tion of law as announced in signing statement would be informed by br oad conception of executive authority more fundamentally signing statement does not ve the effect of veto bill that is vetoed does not become law unless reen acted by supermajority vote of the congress conversely bill that is signed by the president retains its legal effect and character irrespective of any pronouncements made in signing statement and remains available for interpretation and application by the courts if the provision is justiciable and monitoring by congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33667crs24 103 aba task force report n 3 supra at 18 see also bradley and posner n 12

acts b308603 june 18 2007 closely related argument also raised in the aba report is that signing statements that raise objections to provisions of an enactment constitute the exercise of lineitem veto103 in clinton v new york the supreme court held that the line item act violated the constitutional requirement of bicameralism and presentment by authorizing the president to essentially create law which had not been voted upon by either house or presented to th president for approval and signature104 accordingly this argument posits that when the president issues signing statement objecting to certain provisions of bill or declaring that he will treat provision as advisory so as to avoid constitutional conflict he is in practical effect exercising an unconstitutional lineitem ve to the counterpoints to this argument are similar to those adhering to the premise that signing statements constitute an abuse of the veto process while an actual refusal of pr esident to enforce legal provision may be characterized as an effective lineitem veto the provision none theless retains its full legal character and will remain actionable either in the judicial or congressional oversight contexts ultimately both of these objections as with the general focus of concern on signing statements as presidential instruments may obscure the substantive issue that has apparently motivated the increased use of the constitutional signing statement by president bush an expansive conception of presidential authority coupled with willingness to utilize fully mechanisms that will aid in furthering and buttressing that philosophy given the general and hortatory na ture of the language that characterizes these signing statements it seems apparent that president bush is using this instrument as part of comprehensive st rategy to strengthen and expand executive authority generally as opposed to f acto line item veto indeed while the breadth and number of provisions calle d into question by president bush draw attention to the institution of the signing statement itsel f professors curtis bradley and eric posner have stated that critics of the bush administrations use of signing statements have not identified single instance where the bush administration followed through on the language in the signing statement and refused to enforce the statute as written105 this declaration is arguably be lied by report from the government accountability office gao that identif ied six provisions of law that were addressed in various signing statements that it determined were not executed as written by the executive branch106 specifically gao reviewed 11 signing statements that accompanied appropria tions acts for fy2006 and identified 160 specific provisions that were addresse d in the signing statements gao then examined 19 of these provisions to deter mine whether the agenci responsible forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33667crs25 107 id at 1 108 id at 10 109 id at 9

by gao as not having been execu ted as written the first three arose from agency failures or refusals to seek committee approval prior to taking certain actions the fourth stemmed from th department of defens dod failing to include separate budget justifica tions to congress on various operations in its 2007 budget submission the fifth stemmed from gao s determination that the dod responded to congressional inquiry in 38 days inst ead of the 21day period specified in law and the sixth example of noncomplian ce stemmed from gaos finding that the customs and border patrol cbp did not relocate checkpoints in the tucson sector every seven days as directed in the relevant appropriations act108 while these examples may be cite d in support of the proposition that presidential signing statements constitute the effective exercise of line item veto it should be noted that gao stated in its report that although we found the agencies did not execute th provisions as enacted we cannot conclude that agency noncompliance was the result of the presidents signing statements109 this statement is significant in that while it may of course be argued that these examples of noncompliance constitute pr ima facie evidence that sign ing statements are being given substantive legal effect under the cu rrent administration the fact remains that the gao report presents particularized information beyond their existence that these departments and agencies were relying on the relevant presidential signing statements as basis to support such noncompliance specifically the gao report does not identify any declarations or documents that indicate that presidential signing statements played role in the actions taken by the aforementioned departments and agencies furthermore it could be argu ed that the scope and nature of the noncompliance in the provisions iden tified by gao militates against summary conclusion that the pertinent signing st atements motivated such noncompliance while the report stressed that gao did not examine the constitutionality of the provisions to which the president objected110 the first three examples cited in the gao report all appear to involve congressional impos ition of legislative vetoes of the type expressly rejected by the supreme court in ins v chadha 111 accordingly both the signing statements and executive noncompliance as to these three provisions appear to be supported by ex plicit supreme court precedent112 regarding the fourth provision the dods justification for noncom pliance was based on its determination that the costs of the covered operations were difficult to predict because of the continuing insurgent activity and that it was thus not able to estimate with great certainty preventing its inclusion in the budget submission113 while the dods submission constitutes failure to comply with the literal terms of the appropriationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33667crs26 114 see gao report n 106 supra at 35 115 see gao report n 106 supra at 35act there is clear evidence that the relevant signing statement played determinative role in th noncompliance and the gao report does not contain any information that serves to rebut the ver acity of the dods reasons for not including the budgetary information as directed th fifth example cited by gao illustrates literal failure on the part of the dod to re spond to congressional inquiry within specified time frame however there are numerous examples of agency failures to meet statutory deadlines irrespective of the presence of correlating signing statement furthermore given the brief delay period 38 days as opposed to the 21 required by law it seems unlikely that this incidence of noncompliance may be successfully described as partmental refusal to enforce the law on the basis of presidential signing statement finally regarding the sixth example identified by gao the cbp justified its noncompliance on its determination that following the congressional directive would be incons istent with border patrol mission requirements the cbp additionally noted that only one location had been approved for some checkpoints in the tucson sector rendering relocation impossible the cbp stated that these checkpoints were often s hut down for short period in an endeavor to satisfy the advisory provision contai ned in the pertinen t appropriations act114 this instance of noncompliance is perhaps th most explicit example of signing statement being given substantive effect by department as the language used by the cbp closely mirrors the presidents declaration in his signing statement that the executive branch shall construe the relo cation provision as advisory rather than mandatory115 however the gao report does not elaborate on this apparent link and does not contain any information that ma be used to evaluate the substance of the cbps justifications for noncompliance thus while the provisions identified by gao may be cited as examples of executiv refusal to enforce the law subsequent to the issuance of signing statement the information contained above could be interpreted as providing reasons for noncomp liance that are not directly attributable to the existence of presidential signing statement in light of these factors some might argue that the bush ii administrations practice of issuing signing statements is beneficial in that the statements alert congress to the universe of provisions that are held in disregard by the executive branch in turn affording congress the oppor tunity not only to engage in systematic monitoring and oversight to ensure that its enactments are complied with but to assert its prerogatives to counteract the br oad claims of authority that undergird the statements in particular while the focus on the institution of the presidential signing statement as source of controversy may be misplaced congressiona l interest in the protection of its own institu tional prerogatives could u ltimately motivate reaction to the bush ii administrations expansive vi ew of presidential authority as expressed not only in signing statements but in ex ecutive orders olc opinions internal white house memoranda and refusals to accede to congressional and legislative branch agency requests for information all of thes tools have been used by president bush to exert control over executive personnel in their administration of statutory obligations and interaction with congre ss additionally the broad and persistent nature of the claims of executive authority forwarded by president bush appear designed to inure congress as well as others to the belief that the president in facthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33667crs27 116 hr 264 110th cong 1st sess 2007 section

may not intrude three bills have been introduced in the 110th congress with the aim of restraining the use of signing statements but it does not appear that any of these proposals would appreciably

source may be used to produce publish or disseminat any statement made by the president contemporaneously with the signing of an bill or joint resolution presented for signing by the president116 this section does not give any indication as to when such statement would cease to be contemporaneous with the signing of bill but under practical interpretation of the term it seems unlikely that this section would impose substantial impediment to the issuance of signing statements this section would also not appear to prevent contemporaneous declarations by executive branch agencies section 4 of hr 264 goes on to st ate that for purposes of construing or applying any act enacted by the congress governmental entity shall not take into consideration any statement made by the president contemporaneously with the presidents signing of the bill or joint resolution that becomes such act this command indicates that the first section ma not necessarily prevent president from issuing signing statement furthermore nothing in the bill would prevent president from simply issuing memoranda or other declarations aimed at guiding agency interpretation and implementation117 bill essentially identical to hr 264 was introduced in the 109th congress118 additionally two identical bills s 1747 and hr 3045 would purport to prohibit any federal or state court from re lying on or deferring to presidential signing statement as source of authority in determining the meaning of any act of congress119 the bills further provide that both the house and the senate acting respectively

classified material s section 3 of both resolutions also provide that any member of the house would be aut horized to request report from the general counsel of the house describing any legal acti ons that could be brought to challenge the presidents refusal to enforce provision of law 125 s 3731 109th cong 2nd sess 2006 126 id at 5unclear apart from the potential constitutional issues adhering to congressional attempts to restrict courts from considering such inform ation there is little indication that signing statements have played any substantive role in influencing judicial rulings120 likewise the impact of provision allowing for the submission of clarifying concurrent resolution is open to speculation any such clarification by congress would not have the force and effect of law and could be viewed by the judiciary as species of postenactment legislative history 121 various other bills were introduced in the 109th congress that would have attempted to constrain the issuance or limit the effect of signing statements hjres 87122 and hjres 89123 would have required the president to provide notification to congress if at the time of enactment of law the president makes determination not to carry out any duly enacted provision of the law and would have established expedited pr ocedures in the house for c onsideration of legislation developed in response to such determination124 the scope of this legislation is not entirely clear as touched upon above it is quite rare for signing statement to contain specific declaration that law will not be enforced furthermore the generalized nature of the language that is employed in such statements would usually make it difficult to assert that the president had made concrete determination to not enforce the law raising the additional possibility that the president would simply ignore this requirement on the grounds that such determina tion had been made finally s 3731125 would have attemp ted to imbue both chambers of congress with legal standing to challenge signing statement providing that any court of the united states would be authorized to rule on the legality of signing statement upon the filing of an appropriate pleading by th united states senate through the office of senate legal counsel and or the united states house of representatives through the office of general counsel for the

prohibited any state or federal court from relying on or granting deference to presidential signing statement as source of authority128 while the broad and continui ng assertions of authority made by president bush in numerous signing statements have the potential to impact congress at practical and institutional level both by discouraging federal officials from engaging in open interaction with congressiona l committees and staff and by arguably discounting the constitutional prerogatives enjoyed by c ongress the aforementioned legislative proposals may be seen as failing to ddress the purpose and impact of these instruments by focusing its efforts on attempting to constrain the president from issuing signing statements that call the validity of its enactments into question congress could leave unaddressed any risks posed to its institutional power by the broad conception of presidentia l authority that arguably motivates their issuance it does not seem likely that reduction in the number of challenges raised in signing statements whether caused by proce dural limitations or political rebuke will necessarily result in any change in presidents conception and assertion of executive authority accordingly more effective congressiona l response might be to focus on any substantive actions taken by the bush ii administration that are arguably designed to embed that conception of presidential power in the constitutional framework conclusion presidential signing statements have l ong historical pedigree and there is discernible constitutional or legal impediment to their issuance while such statements have become increasingly common since the reagan administration and have increasingly been utilized by presidents to raise constitutional or interpretive objections to congressional enactments that increased usage does not render them unconstitutional while the broad assertions of executive authority contained in these statements carry significant implications both practical and constitutional for the traditional relationship between the executiv branch and congress they do not have legal force or effect and have not been utilized to effect the formal nullification of laws instead it appears that recent administrations as made apparent by the voluminous challenges lodged by presiden t george w bush have employed these instruments in an attempt to leverage power and control away from congress by establishing these broad assertions of authority as constitutional norm it can be argued that the appropriate focus of c ongressional concern should center not on the issuance of signing statements themselves but on the broad asser tions of presidential authority forwarded by presidents and the substantive actions taken to establish that authority accordingly robust oversight regime focusing on substantive executive action as opposed to the vague and generaliz ed assertions of authority typical of signing statements might allow congress in turn to more effectively assert its constitutional prerogatives and ensure compliance with its enactments
