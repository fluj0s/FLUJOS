updated background throughout the cold war end strength of the us active duty force never dropped below 20 million personnel and peaked at over 35 million during the korean and vietnam wars1 from 1989 to 1999 end strength dropped steadily from 21 million to 14 million where it has remained force structure dropped even more with active army divisions for example going from 18 to 10 expectations that military requirements would diminish however were not realized us forces deployed to new missions in such places as the persian gulf somalia haiti the balkans and with the recent advent 1 crs report

reflect support elements crs2 of the gwot afghanistan and other farflung places the most recent experience of operation iraqi freedom indicates that us ground forces are stretched thin concerns about increased requirements for smaller force surfaced over 10 years ago initially focused on readiness 1994 defense science board report found pockets of unreadiness attributed to turbulence in the armed forces2 the house armed services committee discerned problems in the field and challenged administration assertions that readiness remained high by 1997 they asserted that the postcold war defense drawdown and the expanding demands of manpower intensive peacekeeping and humanitarian operations are placing at risk the decisive military edge that this nation enjoyed at the end of the cold war 3 other studies highlighted problems stemming from the operating tempo of units optempo and personnel perstempo4 various solutions were proposed many suggested fewer overseas commitments but administration stemmed demands for us forces congress mandated the department of defense dod to compensate soldiers who were deployed too long or too often but september 11 2001 caused that law to be waived technological advances made transforming us forces more combat effective against conventional forces but could not substitute for manpower needed in the unconventional and asymmetric environments httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21754 of stability operations in contrast some charged that the army in particular was resisting such constabulary operations and therefore managed its personnel inefficiently the combat phase of the 2003 iraq war was won quickly with fewer forces than many analysts expected the occupation phase however soon involved some 220000 troops at the first anniversary of combat dod staged the largest troop rotation since world war ii all active army divisions were involved indicators that forces were stretched thin included reserve component and marine corps units committed for over year shorter tours had been the norm many personnel came under stoploss orders that kept them from leaving service were extended in their tours or were ordered to multiple combat tours ceremonial companies from the old guard5 in arlington va were deployed to djibouti and army division was available as strategic reserve air and naval forces were shifted to cover key contingencies6 house bill was introduced to increase the armed forces by 83700 personnel for five years7 various senators proposed either adding one army and one marine division or permanently

could require more air force tactical air control parties and training sorties crs3 army by 10000 soldiers8 decreases to end strength have been proposed whether from internal or external pressure in january 2004 dod responded administration end strength initiative before the house armed services committee on january 28 2004 chief of staff of the army general peter schoomaker testified that he had been authorized by the secretary of defense to increase end strength of the army by 30000 personnel on temporary emergency basis9 he argued that permanent legislated increase would be unwise and unnecessary he asserted that permanent increase would create burden on planned defense budgets in the out years citing 12 billion annually for each increase of 10000 troops some ongoing programs were presented as over time providing more efficient and usable force structure within current army end strength general schoomaker began making organizational changes shortly after he became chief of staff in august 2003 he ordered divisions to create more combat modules by forming four new brigades from their existing three brigades and divisional support forces once implemented this would provide 10 additional brigadeequivalent httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21754 maneuver elements for the rotation base including planned stryker brigades could eventually raise the number of brigades available from 33 to 4810 he is pursuing unit manning policy rather than rotating individuals to deployed units he would also shift from the coldwar mix of combat capabilities to one geared to the less technologically advanced enemies joint operations and stabilitytype operations now faced examples included reducing air defense artillery and ordnance unit strength and increasing military police civil affairs and transportation capabilities the army and dod also sought other ways to glean manpower efficiencies general schoomaker noted that 5000 soldier positions were converted to civilian in 2003 making more soldiers available for deployment and he anticipated finding 5000 positions in 2004 this raised issues about the numbers of civilians and contractors needed by the services another organizational initiative has been rebalancing the mix of active duty and reserve component forces to increase fairness and flexibility in deploying the total force and to allow initial deployments with fewer reserve forces other measures may have potential to reduce military manpower requirements over time such as reposturing us forces overseas and base closings and realignments mandated by the 2005 brac round other than the above measures secretary rumsfeld resisted any efforts to increase the overall size of us military forces even as the iraq war lengthened beyond three years and sustainment of adequate forces there remained difficult other major war 8 joseph c anselmo pentagon plans for bigger better army with spike cq weekly january 31 2004 p 270 9 federal news service

said he plans to expand the overall size of the stressed us armed forces to meet the challenges of longterm global struggle against terrorists11 permanent end strength increase on january 19 2007 after having resisted previous congressional calls to permanently increase the end strengths of the army and marine corps the department of defense announced that it would seek approval to increase the permanent end strengths of the active army by 65000 and the active marine corps by 2700012 this increase in troop strength is intended to eventually ease the significant strains that have been placed on the army and marine corps that have been at war in afghanistan since 2001 and in iraq since 2003 the army plans to create six additional brigade combat teams bcts and two additional patriot missile battalions and the marines plan to create an additional regimental combat team rct from the increased end strength13 these additional troops will also permit both services to fill shortages in existing organizations and create other smaller units that are in high demand pl110181 the national defense authorization httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21754 act for fiscal year 2008 authorizes this permanent end strength increase force size and composition considerations various considerations could influence the future debate the right size and composition for the military addresses military requirements now and in the future the administration acknowledged stresses on the force but long interpreted the situation as spike in requirements that would return to lower more manageable plateau critics counter that the war on terrorism and occupation of iraq could endure for many years and that the continuing potential for sudden major crises such as in korea requires robust us military force14 ones view of the future determines ones idea of acceptable risk other considerations may also influence the debate predicted federal deficits may create pressures to restrain the overall budget and competition between sectors may call forth guns versus butter tensions within dod competition for funding will continue many will argue that personnel costs must be constrained so that

contingency see crs report rs21582 north korean crisis possible military options by edward f bruner crs5 procurement for the transformational weapons of the future will be adequate15 some may be influenced by implications of the end strength debate for particular military installations and defense industry employers another consideration is can we grow the force to create the additional army and marine units that the administration has been authorized while the army and marine corps are currently meeting their recruitment goals it has been reported that many young promising army officers are leaving at an increasing rate and that significant junior officer and noncommissioned officer nco shortages are likely in the future16 without these junior officers and ncos the army may not be able to stand up the six additional infantry bcts and support units that it has been authorized to create what kind of forces do we need specific types of forces needed will be defined by perceptions of future requirements recent experiences and response to current stresses congress influences the type of forces to be acquired by allocating end strength among the four services further refinements occur as specific weapons systems and materiel are developed and procured and through the oversight process httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21754 substantial ground combat forces will likely be needed as efforts in afghanistan and iraq have defined end point and other nations of concern such as iran syria and north korea retain potential for future armed confrontation combat campaigns in both afghanistan and iraq demonstrated the value of us special operations forces sof sof strength is being increased and is particularly important to the war on terrorism but that strength is accounted for within the services that contribute their personnel to sof units17 in iraq the ability of us mechanized infantry and armored forces to survive and prevail against both regular and nonconventional enemy forces even in urban areas was striking to reinforce success some advocate maintaining and increasing units armed with abrams tanks and bradley fighting vehicles18 are specialized units needed19 there have been number of recent proposals to create specialized units to meet the operational challenges of counterinsurgency stabilization and trainingadvisory operations but the army insists that its current force structure is adequate to meet these challenges and that the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan precludes the effective use of these specialized units the marines have recently established marine corps training and advisory group mctag to coordinate form train and equip marine 15 see crs report rl32238 defense transformation background and

capabilities it may also examine force requirements particularly forces applicable to counterinsurgency stabilization and training and advisory missions the review might also recommend joint or servicespecific actions to better address these potential core mission areas to include the formation of units specifically designed to address these mission areas or change the current mix of forces
