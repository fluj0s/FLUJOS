the ec docume nt while noting that the increasing use of oss within mainstream commercial offerings and mixedsource software and solutions makes distinct treat ment of or preferences for oss more difficult to define purpose this present document summarises the work of the oss workgroup it addresses mainly the following elements x1issues x1trends x1barriers x1benefits x1actions scope in this document oss covers x1open source providers oss communities x1service providers for oss integration and support x1oss as part of mixed solutions blending open and proprietary code x12 s tate of the european open source software sector or industry or model this paragraph has been modified to prepare bringing it back to its ori ginal goal which to collect evidence about the oss sector in europe x1 erwin to provide links to sources of data 21 short reminder on oss open source software oss also known as free software libre software foss or floss is software model that was defined by mit sci entist and mac arthur grant winner richard m stallman in the mid 80s1 after maturing in the scientific university and individual entrepreneurial environments oss has meanwhile established itself in the mainstream of the commerci software industry and has become commercially and technologically viable alt ernative or complement to dominant proprietary products and services in some areas2 oss principles and benefits the principles and benefits of open source software are well known for readers not familiar complete papers can be found on wikipedia here httpenwikipediaorgwikiopen_source_software and here httpenwikipediaorgwikifree_and_open_source_software 22 type of actors in oss it can be useful to consider that there are three categories of actors in the oss space x1creators which split in x1pure oss vendors ex redhat ubuntu ebm websourcing exoplatform x1communities ex object web morfeo x1hybrid oss and proprietary ex sap ibm sun novell x1and finally new actors such as fresco sugarcrm jaspersoft pentaho compierre talent their products are open source but 1see httpfsfeuropeorgprojectswipofser for reference 2comment free software was never hobbyist or garage in ori gin its concepts are derived from science and scientific progress and innovation through allowing coi nnovation by all participants i believe the true roots of free software are important and strength so should be mentioned b it is important to avoid the false antonym commercial vs free software because it fals ely implies that the interest of the software industry in free software is not commercially motivated the rephrasing also explicitly counteracts that misunderstanding by emphasising commercial free software x2they are the only one to own the copyright therefore they can have dual licensing model free and not free of course frontiers between categories are blurry actors can belong to several depending on their product and can move from category to category x1software integrators and it service companies x1users including private users and of course companies 23 open source software cannot be 100 free open source vendors cannot operate for free as the quotes and the metrics in the appendix indicate it is important for the open source vendors to have profitable and sustainable business model on their open source based products and services in order to ensure that open source projects will survive in the longterm however users typically do not pay money for software they c an legally get and use for free unless they are forced or strongly encouraged t do so why pay for something that you can get for free as well therefore open source vendors have to find creative ways to encourage users to buy something from them anyway this is exactly what successful vendors such as redha t are doing obtain revenue by offering services such as guarantee of api stability support training etc users have to bare integration costs similarly due to the finer granularity at which open source software becomes available to users it requires spe cial technical integration and maintenance effort which has to be not only paid for by users through support and integration services but which also requires speci care and an appropriate organisation 24 europe oss structural imbalance ideally suited for model of open innovation and collaboration according to some oss has evolved faster in europe than anywhere else in the world possibly because its approach is well suited to an environment of diverse participants of varying sizes as it is predominantly found in europe but w hile much of the innovation and development is european in origin and european experts and contributors are prominent and highly regarded in the community worldwide europe has yet to bring forth an open source champion of comparable size to those operating out of the us3 reasons for this structural imbalance can at least in part be found i n the transformative process that several of the large us it companies have ente red in the late 90s when they began to develop their own oss strategy thi s 3comment too strongly antiamerican sentiments are most likel not helpful so tried to rephrase to keep the notion of the problem intact but rephrase it in more diplomatic way 0development brought about very large mixedmodel companies that often become visible as champions of oss all most of which are based in the us according to one estimate 90 of the business derived from oss is gene rated by noneuropean players4 indeed much of this business is generated by players who have mixed source business models indicating how success for this ecosystem depends on pragmatic approach towards both oss and proprietary software in addition most oss consortia the nonprofit organisations managing oss development and marketing appear to be based in the united states and funded by us it companies at second glance it becomes apparent that strong european ecosystem of organisations exists but lack of strategic focus on these organisations by european players is causing an imbalance of mindshare i n favour of the us europe must address this imbalance in order to maximise the benefits from oss in europe for european developers users and entrepreneurs our strategic focus nee ds to be on the better exploitation of oss in europe the strengthening of the europ ean ecosystem around oss and capacity building initiatives pragmatic marketbased approach is key to europes competitiveness 25 but there is also europe us interdependency even though many european systems integrators offer services and support for open source technologies only few of these smaller companies active ly contribute code back to the open source projects as consequence open sourc projects like linux eclipse and openofficeorg thrive mainly based on t he code contributions coming from larger usbased vendors thus without the contributions of the usbased vendors many european system integrators focussing on open source would not have business on the other hand the addressable market for the contributing usbased vendors would be significantly smaller without the marketing and awareness creation by the european system integrators due to this close interdependency it is important to keep the dynamics and economics of the larger open source world in mind 4 ms comment nessi figures full reference needed is this consistent with comptias claim an estimated 12 billion has been invested by european firms in open source software development fsfe comment this number indeed seems high it is probably true for large corporations but may neglect the impact of smes 3 n open source software strategy for europe issues 311 lack of market confidence lack of market confidence remains however due to concerns such as availability of support skill levels understanding of licence terms and liability oss tends to push the integration function into the hands of users as oppos ed to vendors as is the case for commercial products users are then expose d to issues problems and extra support and integration costs which can be off putting could this lack of market confidence be just matter of perception one could argue that on the other hand service providers capitalise on their own skills to offer packaged solutions as well as granular services at very level of the software stack software communities develop the software and provide support at community level on usually often probono basis open source software usually comes free of charge if one considers the code itself where the generation of revenue takes place is at the scaling or deployment points of the market proprietary vendors charge their users twice once at the deployment phase through support contracts and once at the procurement phase through licensing fees comment paper should focus on oss and not dwell into unsupported and unnecessary statements against proprietary software could therefore the lack of market confidence be more matter of perception than an ontological problem related to open source we agree it is real while recognising that integration of oss in commercial products and services have mitigated the problem and allow ed oss market growth although the state of the art can evolve and problems experienced by use rs can be overcome or transferred to oss servicing companies it is not the cas yet there are real barriers see 33 below which requires action see 35 below patricks comment i suggest to suppress the above two paragraphs which from the comments i got seem to be more controversial than useful 312 european software companies often get acquired by larger usbased companies despite the difficulties that european software startups might have there are indeed european software vendors including open source software vendors yg power to acquire other software vendors in the us europe or elsewhere t he acquisitions of european software companies like stardivision netbeans mysql ab virtualbox and suse by usbased vendors show that successful x3x4european software vendors often get acquired by usbased companies partly due to historic reasons there are far more usbased it companies with large buying power than there are european it companies who can afford to acquire other software vendors which leads to the effect outlined in 23 above european it companies also have fewer alternative growth strategies t han their us counterparts due to smallermore risk adverse venture capital community and fewer ipo opportunities this is not an issue per but if the lack of europe based software companies is seen as an issue it is important to understand the dynamics of the market on should question what are the consequences of this trend it could impai r the so called europe digital independence and also impact jobs regarding the europe digital independence our group thinks it is in general not an issue however there may be situation where particular pie ce of software plays key role in some economic activity or may create security related concerns under certain circumstances regarding jobs we believe that ultimately what matters is where are jobs located if european software or oss companies are acquired by non european firms but if the corresponding jobs stay in europe and if the threat on europe digit independence is minimal then the consequences on europe are limited conversely we know that european software companies can just as well while having their hq in europe decide to grow or move rd facilities to non european countries trends 313 growth of the mixed model by mixed model we mean that more and more companies combine open source with closed source in order to optimize development costs on the one hand and to maximize differentiation on the other hand open source vendors use close d source elements to differentiate themselves from other open source vendors nd to create stronger incentive for open source users to actually buy som ething from them instead of just using the free software closed source vendors leverage open source in order to offer better standards support and to share development costs therefore there is clear distinction between ope n source and closed source anymore since selling support eg linux and advertising space eg google toolbar nd homepage in mozilla firefox are not feasible monetization strategies for all the different open source technologies it is important that open source vendors who are keeping the open source projects alive through their contributions have the freedom to choose the business model that works best for them 11314 growth of the mixed model but still uncertain future open source software represents software model defined by high level of user control over the software in combination with unprecedented often unequalled freedoms to study and innovate upon the software allowing for rapid incremental innovation these benefits have become so associated with the software model that oss is often misunderstood as new development or business model there is wide variety of development and business models built upon s ranging from traditional approaches such as custom development or cots to service based approaches and saas most of the large players have incorporated oss into their strategy resulting in mixed model approac h see 321 avove considering that almost none of these companies had significant oss offerings only 10 years ago it is possible to observe clear trend towards integration of oss in commercial products and services at the current point in time it is impossible to predict when and if that trend will come to an end the future of mixed mode new companies enter the market with models spanning the entire range of proprietary models over mixed models to oss models only time will show which models will be most successful in europe the economic success of firms based on mixed model however suggests it is promising model for the future however additionally as the information economy report 20072008 of the united nations conference on trade and development unctad highlights the ict sector itself is remarkable source of innovation and economic growth but there is strong evidence that ictenabled innovation in other sectors s an even larger impact on the overall economic situation key factors identified by unctad for as part of this process are the commoditisation of software along with open innovation approaches based on oss while oss itself has remarkable innovation benefits it appears necessary to include the broader software industry and ictenabled sectors into the assessment to understand osss full potential for european innovation and economic growth one usually look at oss models in the pure software space but this i s changing more and more companies offer products and services which are not software but rely on software and on open source software in particular google is probably the most visible example software is not its primary source of revenue but google both uses oss produced by others and releases its software as open source and then collects numerous improvement created by others x1erwin and charlotte to look for some measured evidence of models market share 1 315 company funded oss support is gaining momentum having evolved from its original academia origin to viable option for rese arch and development oss has attracted more and more companies to fund and dri ve communities this will definitely accelerate primarily in the area of building eco systems as we see this today in initiatives as eg android if existing projects demonstrate real returns on investment c ompanies will allocate more of their research and development spending in open source communities as return on investment will increase dramatically 316 the mixed model is also true for oss users oss users are companies administrations public institutions schools nd universities soho enterprises end users they usually have to i ntegrate and use different software components to meet their needs proprietary or open source charlotte to provide few lines about unnoticed download and use of oss by companies employees without the top management really knowing 317 oss contributes to software commoditisation commoditisation trend generic software follows an evolutionary trend towa rd commoditisation due to intense competition that level functionalities and added value and open source is generally key factor of this evolution even domains with very hard constraints such as telecommunication systems or mbedded systems requiring expertise and knowhow is now subject to this commoditisation commoditisation benefits users and integrators and pushes competitors to innovate more rapidly andor lower prices or imperils pure noninnovative software vendors the opposition of these types of actors on the oss subje ct is understandable examples comment examples of what commoditization is the opposite of innovation and these areas enjoy innovation even in the products listed below x1os with linux android symbian x1databases with mysql and postgress x1office suites and desktop tools x1internet tools such as servers browsers editors content management suites blog and wiki engines x1languages and ide 12318 mixed model is moving from infrastructure to application layers mixed models are understood as the prevalence of infrastructures making open source and proprietary software coexist and interact together open source software is however seen as making strong inroads in terms of customer adoption in areas previously thought as strongholds of proprietary software business intelligence high performance relational databases etl ex talent cms ex fresco etc 319 oss accelerates dissemination of jure standards open source just as is the deployment of any software implementing agreed specifications is way to promote standards either facto or jure lot of facto standards disseminated through open source implementation early ietf standards w3c open source implementation can be way to accelerate discussion and dissemination of jure standards an open source implementation can help consolidate standard by pointing the inconsis tencies or lack of precisions of some specifications its especially true for interoperability standards barriers 3110 need for oss european digital entrepreneurship the very first step to capture the current open source trends is to have coherent trend and also global vision of trends at the moment this is not always the case most of the proprietary commercial software vendors do have strategy roadmap and vision functional and technical open source is often perceived mainly as an alternative to proprietary software hence the vision is reduced to an implementation roadmap trying to compete with closed source software in terms of features to implement one should think of oss as global phenomena to define strategy in terms of impact and role of oss in the service economy instead of being perceived as running after proprietary solution or as an alternative europe should try to lead and to push an innovative technical vision implemented in open source as this implementation will be in open source all it players promoting or not using or not using open source will then be able to use it as they want without any business discrimination the commission is not the owner of this vision the various actors creators integrators users are for it to grow it requires what we could call an open source digital entrepreneurship attitude meaning that the various communities and actors could maybe better share common roadmap of who does what for which goal in the three aspects creators integrators users 13111 oss european space fragmentation note the following applies to european oss communities not oss vendors the open source software communities do not have the critical mass and are not enough organized to cooperate and share issues infrastructure etc in europe there are number of different open source communities or consortium they all suffer the same issues lack of money lack of reliable i nfrastructure lack of european visibility fragmentation of oss foundations between countries ex ow2 in france morfeo in spain etc furthermore relationships between communities and enterprises and among communities are not always effective yet in that respect the us show better example there is an understanding by us entities that supporting such entities is useful ecosystem maintenance for their commercial environment europe has very healthy ecosystem of organisations some of which are larger than their us counterparts but there tends to be very little strategic unders tanding in european players that focus on collaboration with these players would ini tiate positive feedback cycle for the european area 3112 technical barriers awareness and knowledge of legal aspects about open source software leaves much to wish for successful companies utilising open source i n their business models have the knowledge of how to incorporate open source and its legal obligations in their often combined with proprietary software in their products and services unless awareness of the included open source software and the effects thereof are known company would either be reluctant i n using open source software or simply use it without any governance as the awareness and knowledge of open source software grows the understanding of how to monetize open source will also evolve with new business models and opportunities for companies quality and security barriers open source will never be the solution which will modify the whole economy and the it world open source is not magic the solution will come from an intelligent cohabitation and mix of propriet ary and open source components then it raises issues for users services providers and industries i propose to suppress the above it can create endless debase which do not add to the point which is quality verification how can we be sure that with open source the quality will be at the same level that proprietary solutions are pretending they are this question brings another one which is the definition of quality if we take the point of view of the nessi and industry quality is 1x1technical support and maintenance integrating or using open source in critical environment or application comes with specific constrains such as the ability to react when technical problem happens into the component who can bring the needed support how the maintenance can be done x1security lets take the security as whole without trying to come with specific definition when proprietary software is used we only principally trust what the editor will say the solution is secured what about the open source components how can we be sure the same level of security is implemented who can check this security the above technical barriers are already covered by those oss vendors who have legal compliance guarantees and ipr risk management and protection as part of their offering and sometimes as part of global packaged service including certification indemnification support and service 3113 oss is not part of high education regarding the research and high education in europe there is real officia l programs where open source is specifically mentioned some suggest the open source could be included in some technical and layer school others believe education should cover the broadest possible range of development and licensing models and focus on students ability to become strong work force for the european marketplace as part of their curricula students should become familiar with here is need to encourage greater use of oss software in high education and support oss curricula definition to prepare students to support oss engineering growth in it industry and research 3114 not best capitalisation of oss delivered as part of ec rd projects from funding point of view the commission already funded large number of projects what to do when the projects stop what will be sustai nability of all the productions documents and software is there way to federate what was already achieve in order not t reinvent the wheel in each project why all the benefit from open source is mainly for noneuropean countries 133115 fear of openness obligations and limitation of committed resources using open source software and participate in the development of it forces companies to open up to certain degree working in an open source com munity requires open communication which can be hard to overcome initially for proprietary company in addition there is belief that contributing the code without resources and funding to open source is enough 3116 fair procurement comment this section encroaches on the work of wg 4 and would best be deleted alternatively it should be nuanced and expanded including our edits below experience suggests that lack of interoperability consumes around 3040 of it budgets in both the private and public sector this is not limited to oss but applies to software in general comment undocumented contested and irrelevant should be deleted since in instances when procurement calculation generally does not account for decommissioning or exit costs from particular solution procurement decision for specific solution often can establish strong bias in favour of the vendor of the first solution for all consecutive tenders this violates european legislation which mandates vendor neutrality based on transparency and non discrimination5 comment such general statement is undocumented disputed and irrelevant for the purpose of the paper and should be deleted instead we propose such practices like tenders preferring or mandating oss or narrowly define d open standards can be in conflict with european public procurement legisla tion neutrality and transparency requirements and should be examined more closely examples for this practice were highlighted by recent study6 of open forum europe ofe which scanned 136 tenders for trademarked names concluded that 25 of these tenders were specifically requesting trademarked products in the authors view violating the principle of vendor neutrality on the other hand tenders preferring or mandating open source software or narrowly defined open standards according to the view of leading software trade associations can be in breach of the same neutrality principles

centrearticlesprocurementofe_procurement_monitoring_report pdf 14experience suggests that many such cases remain undetected due to l ack of translations which themselves can constitute violation of eu procurement rules tenders should diligently express an administrations functional requirements while allowing all equivalent solutions to compete regardless of the development and licensing model in full compliance with the neutrality principl and other public procurement law obligations 3117 lack of committed roadmap and lack of fine grain integration support lack of committed development roadmap is in fact barrier of oss that may prevent potential users to integrate them in their mission critic software systems in the other hand theses users may also suffer from forced migration dictated by software editors roadmaps migration costs due to incompatibi lities between versions lack of support for old versions or from delays in the delivery of the product roadmaps the industry suffers chronically from slideware roadmaps that sometimes transforms into vapourware in the other hand oss users may decide which version of software component theyll use and later decide its migration at their own pace though it may then be difficult to find support or to adapt to new functions long term maintenance commitment and lack of strong integrators creators of open source software are less willing to provide long term maintenance commitment but because of the voluntary nature of oss contributions this is less easy this is barrier for adoption even though they have access to the source code users and specially corporate users do not necessarily want to have internally dedicated organisati on developers in order to maintain components which are more supported by their original creators or the cost of it if not shared among users may become prohibitive the same happens with integrated solutions what we mean by int egrated solution is full solution addressing complete user functional need and made of several oss components released by several very different contributing organisations as stated above this requires special integration effort due to the finer grain nature of the components this sort of effort is less visi ble by users of proprietary solutions because it is performed by the vendors as part of the product development this in turn creates maintenance issue since the integration of finer grain components must be tested when new releases of components are include d in 10the integrated solution having an organisation taking responsibility for t he maintenance of the integared solution is not easy components creators cannot because they are responsible of individual components users often cannot or do not want to do it for the same reasons as above therefore the most like ly good candidates for it are the integrators this is obviously part of their m ission and they usually offer such services but they are usually weak in providing long term commitments for competitive cost this weakness is in part l inked to the lack of long term visibility they have on the individual components provided by others in summary number of barriers to wider adoption of oss are linked to the integrator side of oss we lack stronger oss integration services companies and mechanisms by which they could provide the long term commitment requested by users 3118 ipr related issues there were heated debates about patent licensing schemes we provide the following point as an input to workgroup n3 exclusion from standards implementation amoung the workgroup sap and comptia did not agree to the following the procurement issue is aggravated by discrimination against oss in the licensing conditions for some it standards over the past years it has become clear that specific patent lic ensing schemes most importantly the socalled rand 7 terms discriminate against oss implementation this issue complicated the recent antitrust cases in europe and was subject of specific workshop on ipr in ict standardisation8 organised by dg enterprise the workshop revealed fundamental incompatibility of rand models with oss implementations as well as very controversial debate around thi s issue from the perspective of oss adoption9 it could be said that rand conditions fall short of the common patent policy of itut itur iso and iec which states that patent embodied fully or partly in recommendation deliverable must be accessible to everybody without undue constraints there is fundamental incompatibility see footnote 15 examples of such exclusions can be found in various areas one of these areas are the mpeg standards in multimedia where innovation has been drama tically reduced before the recent development of the dirac codec by the bbc as oss provided highquality modern alternative that is not patent encumbered10 unsubstantiated use of ipr threats it is important that effective measures are implemented to protect the interests of both open source and proprietary software 7 rand reasonable and nondiscriminatory 8httpeceuropaeuenterpriseictpolicystandardsws08ipr_e nhtm

level playing field for both software development models while we recognises the legitimate rights of intellectual property right s owners we regret recent incidents of patent holders abuse and unsubstantiated use of their rights against open sourcefree software developers recent development which deserves the careful attention from the commission is the use of unsubstantiated threats of intellectual property rights infringements against those who attempt to develop interoperable software products as an example major software company has publicly stated that it believes linux and other open source software infringes 235 of its patents but has never identified any of these patents vague claims by patent holders that open source software may infringe their patent rights should be obliged to identify supposedly infringed patents or cea to make unsubstantiated allegations this would prevent patents from being invoked to spread fear uncertainty and doubt fud against open source software products in the minds of both developers and users the behaviour of creating fud against open source software solutions should not be tolerated as it amounts to an anticompetitive strategy aimed at distorting conditi ons in the marketplace to the detriment of oss products comment we disagree with several points in this section this paper should not encroach on the work of wg 3 so the section would best be deleted as an alternative it should reuse language from the ict task force ipr report on oss standards and ipr in particular there is general perception that most standards organisations have been successful in establishing ipr policies promoting the participation of maximum number of companies to their work and then covering huge majority of all ipr essential to standards under their rand ipr policy eg itut iso iec isoiec jtc1 ieee etsi dvb oma ansi this prevalent ipr licensing model for standards organisations require participants to voluntarily commit to license their patent claims but recently debate has emerged about the definition of open standards provoked in part by an eu initiative which defined open standard in specific egovernment context the debate also stems from an industrydriven environment involving the adoption andor revision of ipr policies by some internet standards organisations such as oasis uncefact and the w3c11 11 see httpwwww3org and its ipr policy httpwwww3org20040205patentsummaryhtml please note that the w3c policy allow any participant to opt out from the commitment to l icense its patents at royalty free conditions see the oasis ipr policy httpwwwoasisopenorgwhointellectualpropertyphp see the uncefact ipr policy at wwwuneceorgcefactcf_plenaryplenary06trd_cf_06_11epdf the most controversial point raised in these discussions involved the idea of royaltyfree ipr policy rand ipr policy mandates any licensing of essential intellectual property at reasonable terms including either reasonable fee or at cost at the discretion of the ipr holder this debate has created the need for certain standards organisations to clarify their understanding and definition of open standards on the basis of the definitions set out by the itut tsb ad hoc ipr group12 and then by the global standards collaboration gsc initiative to which many ict sector standards organisations participate acif arib atis ccsa etsi isacc itu tia tta and ttc13 it appears that large number of companies have supported the adoption of the itut or the gsc definitions several products in he market already incorporate open source implementati on of randbased standards without any evidence of difficulties or insurmountable barriers for such vendors14 mandates for oss can harm oss on the contrary sap and comptia argue that mandates for oss can harm oss open source has created an interesting opportunity for entrepreneurs as they can start business on top of something that is already available for example many companies15

deployed standards that were adopted by standards organizations with randbased ipr policies httpwwwredhatcomsoftwarerheldetails httpwwwopensuseorgproduct_highlights 15 the exact same thing can be said of proprietary and mixed s ource software ecosystems therefore we suggest deleting 1note by patrick i have suppressed the following two paragraphs as the argument sounds very controversial due to the services of these vendors the overall adoption of open source grows which is good for the various open source technologies as well as the vendors offering products and services for these technologies however the services offered by these entrepreneurs can also be problematic if they cannibali ze the business of the main code contributors for example if small system integrator who does not make any code contributions and vendor who contributes heavily to an open source project both participate in public tender the noncontributing vendor might win the deal simply because it can offer the services at much lower pri ce as it does not have to carry the overhead of the code contributions as consequence the losing vendor might reduce or stop code contributions which would jeopardize the future innovation of the open source technology note by patrick i have shortened the following paragraph as the nature of the mixed model is already described in the trends section potentially as consequence many open software vendors are following hybrid mixed approach these days since closed source features increase stronger incentive for users to actually buy something from particular eg code contributing vendor thus due to the mixed model growth software vendors are combining open source with closed source and as consequence the line between open source and closed source increasingly blurs therefore any preferences or mandates favouring open source may be harmful for all software vendors including most open source vendors for example if an open source vendor monetizes its open source contributions by selling closed source addon components and closed source enterprise editions such vendor will be discriminated or excluded during such publi c tenders this is particularly true when the closed source enterprise editions have been productized under different brand name and thus are not recognized as an open source product anymore thus even though it might sound paradoxal preferences or mandates for open source may harm open source because they reduce the opportunities for the contributing open source vendors to get return on their open source contributions therefore open source preferences or mandates could be counter productive in growing the european software industry end of the sap and comptia statement 3119 other barriers common for all software proprietary or oss the european market is still fragmented compared to the us market it is often easier for software startups to succeed and grow in the us than in europe one of the reasons is the fact that the us offers very coherent and homogeneous market whereas europe is still very fragmented due to language legislation and cultural issues the introduction of the euro as com mon currency has definitely helped lot but compared to the us it is s till more difficult for new software vendors to grow in europe typically software companies with similar ideas grow much faster in the us than t hey do in europe the success of the various social networking platforms might be an indicat or considering that linkedin and facebook are well known internationally w hereas the xing platform founded in germany seems to be known far less outside of germany the silicon valley provides excellent networking opportunities the silicon valley in california has become the place to be when it comes to networking and partnering in the it industry most it companies have an office in the silicon valley and therefore it is easy to connect with potential business partners europe does not have similar networking hub and it is probably difficult to create one from scratch artificially starting new company seems to be easier in the us in the us there seems to be strong culture of entrepreneurship and thus more people try to start their own business at some point in their life in addition the required processes for starting new business seem to be more streaml ined and automated in the us than they are in many places in europe most venture capital firms are located in the us software startups often need external capital in order to grow howeve r most venture capital firms are located in the us and thus also understand the us market much better than the european market therefore usbased start ups often find it easier to find investors than european software companies the us seems to be more attractive to immigrants from india etc x5 most larger software companies have development and support organizations in places like russia india and china apparently more people with it skills from russia india and china are immigrating to the us than they are immigrating to europe as consequence stronger ties seem to develop between these countries and the us than between europe and these countries which potentially gives usbased software vendors an advantage over europebased software vendors 2benefits 3120 oss is growth opportunity for the european ict sector the following applies to software and ict in general it is important to understand the need for europe to embrace and promote open source not for its own sake but for the sake of developing fullblown ict industry lifting the barriers above will help europe maximize its competitiveness arguments while developing sustainable ict sector the absence of the barriers mentioned above will also help the ict ctor gain an edge in key areas and create credible industry players as an alt ernative to the ones existing on the market today software innovation can foster economic growth in europe new innovation in the software sector including in the area of open source software has the potential to contribute significantly to europes economic growth and job creation innovation in the software sector can flourish creating jobs new start up companies and underpinning economic growth in europe if the right policies to promote ict investment skills development and competition will be put i n place as natural consequence of market forces open standards and open source software do and increasingly will play an instrumental role in facilitating the development of new products and arrival of new entrants into the marketplace service economy is now tendency for it in general open source fits very well in this paradigm and it has much to offer and contribute in software as service domain one concern however is that servicebased ict businesses are more vulnerable to the forces of globalization and competition from bric countries global economical crisis represents challenge for open source since it helps to reduce costs comment this seems contradictory innovation and economic as demonstrated also in the unctad information economy report 20072008 oss is can be an innovation enabler in the ict sector and even more so in the even larger ictenabled sector as s uch oss provides unique opportunity for economic development which specifically countries in transition are getting ready to harness for their development to leapfrog their economic development based not entirely unlike countries in transition the european economy is based upon small and medium enterprises sme which are key to innovation and employment for this sector oss can translate s into ubiquity of costeffective software that combines high level of control for the company with rapid innovation and the ability to innovate in all parts of the value chain the software model of oss is characterised by high level of user control over the software in combination with unprecedented freedoms to study and innovate upon the software allowing for rapid incremental innovation these benefits can be particularly relevant to the public sector which often has specific needs of sovereignty over its own infrastructure and strict auditi ng requirements for security and confidentiality reasons these strategic benefits are essential and unique to oss comment disputed see below examples for oss deployment on these grounds can be found in various public bodies in eu member states eg germany where the agency for it curity bsi has been recommending oss on these grounds for several years and worked on projects to address specific needs deployment has taken place not only in the bsi but also the foreign ministry and is ongoing in the cit of munich on the other hand europe has to be wary not to fund oss loosely under schemes that would continue to result or even increase the problem of third countrie s being the ultimate beneficiaries for broad range of innovations resulting from labourintensive and costly research and development proprietary or mixed models are and will continue to be more akin to contribute to europes competitiveness on the demand side both private and public bodies in majority of ins tances select commercial or mixed solutions because they represent the bes t valuefor money proposition in response to their needs public policy should avoid interfering with and on the contrary encourage competition and choice among all various marketbased approaches and solutions 3121 maturity of it ecosystem growing maturity of the it ecosystem can be observed in the form of commoditisation of software and growing relevance of interconnectivity s demonstrated by the discussions around interoperability and open standards as observed in other industries eg car manufacturers these trends will inevitably can lead to an increased reuse and recombination factor where only differentiating components are produced inhouse while generic components are being reused or codeveloped welldeveloped oss ecosystem is an ideal breeding ground for such an economy the increasingly welldeveloped legal infrastructure around oss als thanks to initiatives such as the european publlic license eupl provides solid and reliable foundation for public and commercial activity with clearly established ground rules that fall into more than three basic categories while these trends and their impact seem largely inevitable europe is perhaps in the uniquely favourable position of already having healthy oss ecosystem in place that it can build upon 3122 growth of skilled labour pool whereas proprietary software education is necessarily restricted to s chooling in the use of the particular product but is generally supported by education of programming languages and other basic it skills oss may contribute to deeper analysis facilitating both traditionally education and autodidactic training the strategic use of oss for education in some eu member states16 is beginning to show first results and provides good examples for increased social cohesion and equality of chances facilitated through oss on the other hand it is essential not to foreclose students from learning the skills they need to become t he work force europe needs including education about leading commercial software solutions 3123 understanding integration costs more and more readily available economic analysis of the integration co st can help to avoid unforeseen complications and cost on the user side whi increasing demand for professional integration services for oss fostering growth of the commercial adoption in europe 3124 standards increase interoperability the following two lines suppressed because we agree to group the oss mandate debate in one paragraph only as mentioned above open source mandates would be more harmful than useful for the overall software industry including open source software vendors fortunately the increasing standardization in the it world creates level playing field for all vendors good definition of standards and interoperability can be found in the following eicta white paper httpwwweictaorgindexphpid242id_article81 as the ipr modes chosen at w3c and oasis show transparent and inclusive participation rules most times already lead to royalty free ipr modes 16ie spain 3oasis ipr mode number of oasis tcs royaltyfree on limited terms mode 57 royaltyfree on rand terms mode 13 rand mode 0 the more parties including competitors and users participate in standardization effort the more the different players push for royalty free terms because nobody wants to be put into disadvantageous position therefore open participation and transparent development processes are base recommendation for standardization since the reality shows that the large majority of technology standards is being defined under royalty free terms anyway due to the negotiations of the involved parties there is need for regulatory intervention comment this section encroaches on the work of wg 3 and should be deleted if not it should be replaced with the following language from the ict task force ipr wg report there is general perception that most standards organisations have been successful in establishing ipr policies promoting the participation of maximum number of companies to their work and then covering huge majority of all ipr essential to standards under their rand ipr policy eg itut iso iec isoiec jtc1 ieee etsi dvb oma ansi this prevalent ipr licensing model for standards organisations require participants to voluntarily commit to license their patent claims but recently debate has emerged about the definition of open standards provoked in part by an eu initiative which defined open standard in specific egovernment context the debate also stems from an industrydriven environment involving the adoption andor revision of ipr policies by some internet standards organisations such as oasis uncefact and the w3c17 the most controversial point raised in these discussions involved the idea of royaltyfree ipr policy rand ipr policy mandates any licensing of essential intellectual property at reasonable terms including either reasonable fee or at cost at the discretion of the ipr holder this debate has created the need for certain standards organisations to clarify their understanding and definition of open standards on the basis of the definitions set out by the itut tsb ad 17 see httpwwww3org and its ipr policy httpwwww3org20040205patentsum maryhtml please note that the w3c policy allow any participant to opt out from the commitment to l icense its patents at royalty free conditions see the oasis ipr policy httpwwwoasisopeno rgwhointellectualpropertyphp see the uncefact ipr policy at wwwuneceorgcefactcf_plenary pl enary06trd_cf_06_11epdf 4hoc ipr group18 and then by the global standards collaboration gsc initiative to which many ict sector standards organisations participate acif arib atis ccsa etsi isacc itu tia tta and ttc19 it appears that large number of companies have supported the adoption of the itut or the gsc definitions several products in he market already incorporate open source implementation of randbased standards without any evidence of difficulties or insurmountable barriers for such vendors20 actions foreword the current market is already highly regulated through intellectual property laws it is therefore important that the european union is mindful of such regulation when considering further regulative steps an overregulated market tends to bring inefficiency and there are indicators that the current market may already be overregulated any regulative action would therefore require appropriate change management to give established players sufficient time to adapt and grow at the same time european competitiveness depends upon reduced barriers to entry into the 18 httpwwwituintitutothergroupsipradhocopenstandardshtml 19 for general presentation httpwwwgscetsiorgpresentat ionhtm for the specific

european digital independence should we suggest some actions related to protecting european digital independence although we know it is potentially very rare there may be sectors where key software plays an essential role in the european economy or security up to the point where authorities could consider that they need an alternative actions could such as calling for the development of european oss alternatives for some critical software functions 3126 licensing and ipr promoting european oss licensing schemes about the issues related to licenses for most industries implem enting or using software is always done with legal analysis at the moment there is european and officially validated open source license there is some initi atives like the eupl or some european equivalent of the apache license or cecill project but here the european commission definitely should play more ctive role political impulsion and decision will have to be taken nd implemented for example by all the next open source projects funded by the commission in the fp7 gregory to add osi alignment and to work with georg to improve this paragraph ipr sanity checks setting clear agenda on ipr sanity checks and the ability to deliver legally binding decisions by transparent body is much needed action item comment what does this mean according to some open source will therefore strongly benefit from exante disclosure on patents transparency of the judiciary in charge of software ipr rulings acknowledgement and full integration of alternative ipr modes aside t he rand types by standards development organisation research projects public procurement and publicprivate european entities delivering ipr related assets alignment of eprocurement processes to demand software free from ensure the risk of vendor lockin is evaluated systematic prior art research on open source projects as step of new patent analysis voluntary licences of right regime furthermore we believe that still according to some balanced intellectual property system which accommodates the need for interoperable products in the software sector is prerequisite to an effective european software strategy this camp f avors licensing regime that would ensure wider access to technology essential to achieving software interoperability and that would sufficiently protect access to open standards such as for example voluntary licenses of right regime the patent litigation system should in turn provide the appropriate safeguards to avoid the abusive use of injunctions by patent rights holders against other companies which may effectively distort competition noted by patrick i have not changed the above since after discussion with charlotte i now understand it others believe the current ipr framework essentially provides sound basis to encourage innovation under and deployment of all software models and that marketled standardization is working well also for oss the following lines were suppressed because we agree to group the oss mandate debate in one paragraph only preferences or mandates for particular software development and licensing model this is view rather specific to sap and comptia as explained above open source mandates can have negative effect on ope n source vendors therefore there should be mandates or preferences for particular software development and licensing model 3127 interoperability and standards comment section encroaches on wg 3 and would best be deleted if not put in context of broader software industry views see our edits below protect oss implementation of standards against abusive exercise of ipr according to some i n addition it is fundamental to ensure that open sourcefree software developers and distributors enjoy adequate protection that allows the m to implement standardised technologies protected by patents in wa compatible with open sourcefree software licenses the language of lic ensing terms and conditions for patents essential for the technical implement ation of standardised technologies should be drafted in such way as to ensure 2compatibility with open sourcefree software licenses and to prevent t he abusive exercise of patent rights against open source software developers according to that view t he barriers to entry are particularly harmful in the area of interoperability where inability to implement standards leads to increased cost and reduces the reuse and recombination factor which will be sential for the future it industry for this camp t he european union therefore needs to which extent it can bring european standardisation bodies into line with the stated goals of the common patent policy of itut itur iso and iec others believe the current standardisation environment is already technology neutral and that standardisation should continue to be voluntary and marketled promote open source reference implementation of critical standards some believe m andatory open source reference implementation of critical standards on architectures data format or protocols the implementati on must validate the functional aspects of the standards but may not be usable re garding functional requirements such as performance or resource optimisation others disagree with mandates and support marketbased competition promote the use of open formats for public administration some advocate in favour of mandatory open formats for documents and data provided by administrations to the citizen especially when dealing with security privacy transparency of processes promote open source solutions to process theses open formats others support open document formats but not mandates recognition of consortialed standards standards if defined correctly can foster competition and innovation as explained above most technology standards when appropriate are being defined under rf terms anyway and thus there is need for regulatory intervention i n this area the following has been updated during the brussels meeting however it would be good if global standardization consortia like ecma ietf oasis w3c and wsi were officially recognized in eu standardizati on policy as recommended by the ict standardisation steering group and currently considered by the commission under the review of its ict standardisation policy it would be good if from that starting point the list of recognized consortia would be regularly reviewed and updated but eu 213128 commissions own involvement dg infso and european commissions lastly we believe that dg information society and media should closely focus on open source software both as software development path and business model it is important that open sourcefree software developers and distributors enjoy adequate protection in order to prevent the abusive exercise of patent rights against them dg information society and media should also consider any compatibility issues that exist between the open sourcefree software licensing model and the licensing of patents essential for the technical implementation of standardised technologies ecis strongly welcomes the efforts of dg information society and media to develop european software strategy with respect to intellectual property and standards setting issues arising in the software industry this work should not be regarded as duplicating efforts which other relevant directoratesgeneral of the commission are undergoing the software industry has entirely different requirements in terms of how the patent system or the standards setting develop to other industry sectors hence it is important that dg information society and media focuses more on the special needs of the software industry in addition it is important that the commission actively work on deve loping balanced it policy across europe encompassing all relevant policy areas effecting the software sector in x5 x6x7x8x9x10x5x6x8x8x11x10x12x13x14x15x8x16x5x17x15x14x18x5x8x14x18x10x12x5x12x10x7x10x19x13x16x14 x5

area and the specific research and development efforts of dg infso in the fie ld of oss have contributed in various ways to the growth of healthy european it ecosystem this work should be built upon and projects supporting innovation under all development and licensing models intensified as the public benefit from these projects both in form of available products and services as well as increased reuse and recombination factor are significant patrick to put it elsewhere in the document introduction patricks new note i am waiting for gregorys contribution for 357 to 359 to move it there 3129 procurement policy review some are of the view that there is currently reliable way to assess decommissioning exi st costs from an existing proprietary solution s or proposed 2 openmixed source solutions21 being able to calculate these costs would bring transparency and allow truly nondiscriminatory evaluation of the competing offerings according to that view providing guidance and metrics on how to assess this cost in combination with recommendations on how to reflect strategi c goals for the it infrastructure in tenders would help reduce one of the largest barriers to oss adoption for charlotte exit cost suggest research on how to calculate t he exist cost rephrase the section above others are of the view that tenders should specify functional requirements regardless of its software development and licensing model and allow all equivalent solutions to compete 3130 mandating open source governments or public bodies have the right to mandate open source for their own use the workgroup does not recommend that this freedom be limited conversely the workgroup does not recommend that open source mandates become an obligation for public bodies internal use in europe gregory the three following paragraphs to be merged into single one with three aspect 3131 promote oss consortia to avoid this barrier communities often organise themselves around consortia that provide the end users with single point of contact and critical mass of actors that are involved in given software these consort ia generally include major actors of the industry that are committed in developing et using the products developed by the community at large examples x1apache for web infrastructure x1eclipse for ide x1ow2 for middleware x1limo for mobile x1open handsed alliance behind android 21 to make appropriate comparisons we must be able to evaluat exit costs for proprietary mixed source and open source solutions we cannot simply assume that there are exit cos ts for open source solutions 22x1mozilla foundation section to be rephrased by gregory push for existing oss european communities to cooperate efficiently at european level or even decide to create foundation at european level and not excluding members of the mixed world then patrick to provide an addition open source clearing house like the danish government or european forge oss servicing cmmi 3132 european oss forge if we take the main issues listed above solutions can be seen as actions which should be taken or promoted by the commission about the lack of support and maintenance it can only be done by syste m integrators or open source communities in any case the fork phenomena should be avoided european commission cannot really influence or put specific action on it but could try to put in place organisation and an infrastructure where for example all the european open source components are listed which will foster collaboration and exchanges between actors ie european oss forge 3133 european oss testbed about the quality even if this notion is very subjective the commissi on can propose an environment framework which will be available for each pen source communities and also proprietary and act as test bed which will give testing environment industry can bring their own use case which would be available to qualify components and applications open source is still very sensitive subject the european commissi on will have to take very strong decision to really promote its view and strategy forth dimension to be added about managing label which would rate software the rating could reassure users on the long term roadmap and long term support of communities plus compliance with number of best practises 3134 tax reduction similar to research foundations recommend member states to grant tax reduction for companies that participate or at least donate to open source consortia similar to the ones t hat encourage the participation to research foundations 23135 encourage oss education encourage education based on open source software that enable students to really understand the inner architecture of complex software systems and thus be able to innovate in their field rather than be able to simply use complex software systems have software engineering schools and universities organis their student projects as open source forge and encourage them to support their best production to progressively transform them in products to the educational benefits of the students involved in this kind of projects ope n source is way to focus eskills on real technical and scientific skills rather than mere proficiency on some packaged software charlotte with the help of erwin will provide an addition on what sort of curriculum oss communities not involved enough in oss education business and technical skills combination oss driving license 3136 oss delivery as serviceossaas delivery of software as service could be beneficial for two reasons x1it would let new entrants concentrate on the service delivery using software provided by other organisations or communities x1it would remove part of the lack of market confidence since the software components management would not be the users ultimate responsibility however some barriers related to fragmentation remain which should be removed x1european countries do not always allow individual or company data to be stored outside of the country the commission could recommend the member states to align their rules and allow for hosting anywhere within europe provided that some security and privacy criteria be met x1there is also business fragmentation and very few european actors are able to provide credible paneuropean infrastructure to host such saas services some mechanism yet to be designed could help the emergence of such actors 23137 other actions common for all software proprietary or oss include references to annlee saxenian work turning europe into larger coherent market actions that will lead to larger coherent european market will m ake it easier for entrepreneurs to grow their businesses quickly within europe in addition the easier it is for noneuropean investors to understand the european market the more they will make investments in european software startups continued inclusion of it topics in european research programs in order to make the development of it skills priority for education future research programs like the fp programs should continue to include it research topics in addition the participation in european research programs should be easier eg less paper work so that small software companies can afford to participate as well driving up demand for software within europe the eu can help to drive up the general demand for software for example as part of egovernment strategies at least in theory european software vendors should understand the european requirements better than noneuropean vendors and therefore the increased european demand for software should also foster european software industry fostering networking by leveraging the existing european software vendors for software startups it probably would be useful if the european commission fostered networking between european software vendors and thus created something like virtual silicon valley the solution could be combination of an online networking platform plus annual networking events the platform could connect existing european software vendors european software startups noneuropean software vendors hardware vendors system integrators and venture capital firms further simplifying the process for the foundation of company in order to encourage more entrepreneurs to start their own business the initial company foundation process should be as simple and fast as possible in addition it would be helpful if software startups could be connected wit h venture capital firms eg via virtual platform 23simplifying studying in and immigrating to europe europe most likely would benefit if more it experts and students would want to work in europe at least for number of years as explained above empl oyees from foreign countries often create interesting links to their countries of origin which then can be leveraged for partnerships etc therefore it should bec ome easier and more attractive for it experts and students from noneuropean countries to live and work in europe at least for number of years 24
