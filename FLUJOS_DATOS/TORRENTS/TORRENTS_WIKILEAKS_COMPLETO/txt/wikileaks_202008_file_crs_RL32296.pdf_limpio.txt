incentives program summary the adoption incentives program was created by congress in 1997 as part of an overall strategy to promot safety and expedited permanency for children in state foster care systems the program provides cash payments to states that are successful in increasing the number of children adopt ed from the public child welfare system as currently structured the program consists of three separate bonus payments based on adoption increases above three numerical baselines the thr ee separate adoption bonus payments are based on 1 increases in total adoptions 2 increases in adoptions of children age nine or older and 3 increases in adoptions of children under age nine with special needs states are eligible to receive 4000 for each child adopted over the total adoption ba seline and 4000 for each child age nine or older above the older children baseline states that r eceive bonus for adoption increases in either the total adoption or older children adoption categories may also receive an additional 2000 for each child dopted under age nine with special needs over respective baseline in fy2003 25 states and puerto rico received combined total of 149 million in incentive payments for adoption increases in fy2002 the original legislation expired at the end of fy2003 and was reauthorized december 2 2003 with the adoption promotion act of 2003 pl 108145 since the program was enacted adoptions from the foster care system increased from 31030 in fy1997 to 50950 in fy2002 with majority of the increase occurring in the first three years of the program this level of increase in foster care adoptions during these first three years was largely unanticipated resulting in states earning more adoption incentive bonuses th an the original 20 million appropriation as result congress appr opriated additiona l funds to reward the increased adoptions since the program was enacted in 1997 every state has received at least some adoption incentive payments totalin g almost 160 million states report that because the awards are relatively small compared to their overall child welfare budgets they are able to use their funds in innovative and flexible ways examples of uses for the bonuses include providing additional studies training recruitment and postadoption services the presidents fy2005 budget reque sts 32 llion for the adoption incentives program 11 million below the 43 million reauthorized in december citing recent analysis of child adoption data the administration notes that while the overall number of children be ing adopted has grown dramatically in recent years older children constitute an increasing pr oportion of the total children waiting to be adopted this fact had prompted the admin istration last year to propose an incentive payment specifically for older children nd congress subsequently enacted such bonus effective for those doptions co mpleted in fy2003 at the same time the administration predicts that the great er number of older children who are now waiting for adoption will likely mean slow er growth in the number of adoptions this report provides background informati on and description of

karen spar and emilie stoltzfus domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl322961 the adoption incentives program was one component of the adoption and safe families act of 1997 pl 10589 which made series of amendments to the child welfare and foster care provisions of titles ivb and ive of the social security act the adoption incentives program is authorized by section 473a of the social security act funding for the program was reauthorized through fy 2008 with the adoption promotion act of 2003 pl 108145child welfare the adoption incentives program introduction the adoption incentives program was created by congress in 1997 as part of an overall strategy to promot safety and expedited permanency for children in state foster care systems1 the program provides cash payments to states that are successful in increasing the number of child ren adopted from the public child welfare system as currently structured the program consists of three separate bonus payments based on adoption increases above three numerical baselines the three separate adoption bonus payments ar based on 1 increases in total adoptions 2 increases in adoptions of children age nine or older and 3 increases in adoptions of children under age nine with special needs states are eligible to receive 4000 for each child adopted over the total doption baseline and 4000 for each child age nine or older above the older children ba seline states that receive bonus for adoption increases in either the total doption or older children adoption categories may also receive an additional 2000 for each child adopted under age nine with special needs over respective baseline da ta used to determine these three baselines and state performance in exceed ing them are drawn from the adoption section of the adoption and foster analysis and reporting system afcars which is established by regulati on as mandatory for states 45 cfr 135540 the administrative structure of the adoption incentive program allows all qualifying states with numerical adoption gains to receive incentive payments this contrasts with the high performance bonus awards in the temporary assistance for needy families program which only provi bonus payments to the highest performing states regardless of the number of states showing increases in performance in fy2003 25 states nd puerto rico received 149 million in incentive payments for adoption increases fi nalized in fy2002 states can use their adoption incentive payments for variety of child welfare purposes states report that because the awards are relatively small compared to their overall child welfare budgets they have large amount of flexib ility in the way th ey use the funds examples of uses for the bonuses include providing additional studies training recruitment and post adoption serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32296crs2 this report provides background informati on and description of the adoption incentives program with references to recent legislative action sizes of incentive payments earned nd adoption trends background and legislative history in the mid1980s the number of children in foster care began to climb sharply at time when the number of children who were adopted remained static although majority of the children that entered foster care eventually returned to their homes concern developed in the 1990s about th growing number of children who did not return home and were remaining in foster care for long periods of time at the same time there was growing perception that federal law needed clarification regarding the importance of child safety and that more emphasis needed to be placed on adoption when family reunification became unlik ely in response to these concerns the 105th congress enacted the adoption and safe families act asfa pl 10589 which is considered the most sweeping change in federal child welfare law since 1980 asfa emphasized safety and perman ence for children by seeking to ensure that children were not placed in unsafe homes and to assist efficient legal procedures so that children who cannot return home ma be placed for adoption or in another permanent arrangement quickly as part of asfa congress enacted the adoption incentives program to provide cash payments to states that we re successful in increasing the number of children adopted from the public foster care system as originally enacted incentive payments equaled 4000 for each foster ch ild whose adoption was finalized over certain statespecific base level and an additional 2000 for each special needs adoption above second state specific base level for adoptions finalized in 1998 the baseline was the average number of adoptions in the state from 1995 through 1997 for adoptions finalized in 1999 thr ough 2002 the baseline became the highest number of adoptions in that state for any preceding year beginning with 1997 as originally enacted the law authoriz ed 20 million annually for these incentive payments for fy1999 through fy2003 for adoptions finalized in fy1998 through fy2002 however the in crease in adoptions ex ceeded initial estimates and congress later appropriated f unds above this authorizati on level to ensure all the bonuses could be paid the law also au thorized 10 million to be appropriated for each of fy1998 through fy2000 for technical assistance to states and localities with 50 reserved for technical assistance to the courts to help increase adoptions or other permanent placemen ts for children funds were appropria ted under this authority the original legislation expired at the end of fy2003 and was reauthorized december 2 2003 with the adoption promo tion act of 2003 pl 108145 under the reauthorization states continue to r eceive credit for all increased adoptions of foster care children and receive additi onal incentive payments for increases in adoptions of children with special needs however the special needs payment is now limited only to adoptions of special needs children who are under age nine at the time the adoption was finalize d in addition the adoption promotion act created third incentive payment equal to 4000 for increased adoptions of foster children who are age nine or older at the time of adoption like the original two incentive payments states will have to exceed thei r baseline number of such older childhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32296crs3 2 states may consider child as having specia l needs if the state has determined that the continuedadoptions to earn this payment for all three incentive payments the baseline that states must exceed is revise d each year to the highest annual total of such adoptions since fy2002 pl 108145 also authorized fy2004fy2006 the provisions concerning technical assistance to states and localities including the language reserving 50 for such assistance to cour ts to help increase adoptions or other permanent placements for children provisions of the adoption incentives program states must meet several requirements to be qualified to receive doption incentive payments each qualifying state must have plan approved under title iv of the social security act and provide health insurance coverage to children with special needs for whom there is in effect an adoption assistance agreement between state and an adoptive parent or parents in addition the state must increase its overall foster child adoptions or its olde r child adoptions children adopted without the assistance of the child welfare system are not included in the totals used to determine bonus amounts eligibility requirements for basic foster child incentive payments states are rewarded 4000 for each child adopted above their overall adoption baseline number for adoptions finalized in fy2003 the states baseline is set by the number of total foster care adoptions fi nalized in fy2002 for adoptions finalized in fy2004 and subsequent years the baselin will be the highest previous baseline for any year beginning in fy2002 the basi c foster child incentive payments can be obtained without exceeding either the olde r child or the special needs baselines eligibility requirements for older foster child incentive payments states may also be rewarded 4000 for each child age nine or older adopted above their older child baseline for older child adoptions finalized in fy2003 the baseline is set by the number of such foster care adoptions in fy2002 for adoptions finalized in fy2004 and subsequent years the baseline will be the highest previous baseline for any year beginning in fy2002 older foster child adoption incentives can be obtained without exceeding either th overall or the special needs baselines however if state exceeds its overall baseline it may receive total of 8000 for each of those older child adoptions that were also included in the overall adoption increase ie the state receives 4000 for th older child who is adopted because it exceeded the older child adoption baseline and for the same older child it receives 4000 because that child was part of an overall increase in adoptions eligibility requirements for speci needs incentive payments under current law states are also rewarded 2000 for each child with special needs who is under the age of nine and whose adoption exceeds the special needs baseline for adoptions finalized in fy2003 this ba seline is set by the number of adopted children in fy2002 who were under the age of nine and had special needs for adoptions finalized in fy2004 and subsequent years the baseline will be the highest previous baseline for any year beginning in fy20022httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32296crs4 2 continued child cannot or should not be returned to the home of his or her parents and the child has specific factor or condition that make it reas onable to conclude that the child cannot be placed with adoptive parents without providin g adoptive assistance examples of these factors or conditions include childs ethni c background age membership in minority or sibling group or the presence of factors such as medical conditions or other physical mental or emotional challenges 3 the total number of adoptions in which public agencies were involved as reported by the department of health and human services hhs vary slightly fro m the totals used to determine adoption incentive bonuses this is b ecause submissions for the awards only include state data submitted by may 15 of the following year and must qualify in other ways to be counted toward the award of incentive funds in contrast the total number of public agency adoptions reported by hhs include state data submitted after may 15 of the following year eg cleaned data and additional submissions in this report figure 1 and figure 3 use the same data that hhs uses to report total public agency adoptions all other tables and figures present the official data th at hhs used to determine payment awards for the adoption incentives programunder previous law states could only receive special needs incentive payments if they also qualified for basic incentive payment established on an increase in their overall number of foster child adoptions however changes made by the adoption promotion act of 2003 allow states to r eceive the special needs incentive payments for children under nine if they also qualif for an incentive payment on the basis of either an increase in total foster child adoptions or older child adoptions if state exceeds its older child adoption baseline nd special needs baseline then it would receive 2000 for each of the qualifying special needs adoptions however if state exceeds its overall baseline it may receive total of 6000 for each of the special needs qualifying adoptions that were also included in the overall adoption increase ie the states receives 2000 for the speci needs child under age nine who is adopted because it exceeded the sp ecial needs baseline and for the same special needs child it receives 4000 because that ch ild was part of an overall increase in adoptions recent foster care adoption trends the lack of comparable and reliable adoption data make it difficult to compare adoption trends before nd after the implementation of the adoption incentives program however current data can pr ovide useful information on the number of adoptions in recent years national fost er care adoptions have increased from 31030 in 1997 to 50950 by fy2002 64 increase3 figure 1 shows that public agency adoptions were on the increase before implementation of adoption incentives payments but that sharp increase in those adoptions coincided with the first three fiscal years it was in place fy1997 through fy1999httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32296crs5 50950 31030 2569350889 100002000030000400005000060000 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 fiscal yearnumber of adoptionsfigure 1 trends in public agency adoptions source prepared by the congressional research service using data from the department of health and human services appropriations the history of appropriations for doption incentive payments is somewhat complicated because states as group have finalized more adoptions since creation of the adoption incentives program in 1997 than congress originally for ecasted adoptions from foster care increased 64 between fy1997 and fy2002 in any year if appropriated funds ar not adequate to cover all the funds that states have earned the awards are distributed on prorated basis however congress when necessary has provided additional amount s usually in subsequent years appropriations bills to enable hhs to pay states the full amount of incentive payments earned when congress appropria tes more funds than states earn in particular fiscal year the remaining am ounts are sometimes carried forward to help pay for future adoption incentive payments pl 10589 originally authorized annual appropriations of 20 million for fy1999 through fy2003 for adoption incentive payments for adoptions finalized in fiscal years 1998 through 2002 in addition the law provided for an automatic increase in discretionary budget caps up to 20 million to help ensure that these funds were actually appropria ted for each year in the adoption promotion act of 2003 congress authorized annual appr opriations of 43 million for adoption incentive payments to continue support for future increases in state adoption totals and to provide additional support for the new incentive payments of foster care children nine and older it also r eauthorized for fy2004fy2006 10 million for technical assistance reserving 50 for c ourts to improve ch ildrens movement to permanent homes this authorization previously existed for fy1998fy2000 however congress did not appr opriate any of those fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32296crs6 4 us general accounting office foster care recent legisl ation helps states focus on continuedthe presidents fy2005 budget requests 32 million for adoption incentive payments 11 million below the 43 million authoriz ed level it did not request any funds for related technical assistance c iting recent analysis of afcars data the administration notes that while the overa ll number of children being adopted has grown dramatically older ch ildren constitute an increas ing proportion of the total children waiting to be adopted the admin istration cites this population as less likely to be adopted than younger children and reason to predict slower levels of adoption growth totals than experienced in previous years of the program for further details on appropriations see table 1 table 1 amounts appropriated and awarded for adoption incentive payments to states in

5 subsidy increases 4 general child welfare services 3 and staff 2 carrot among the sticks the adoption incentive bonus cornerstone consulting group inc 2001indicate that states have most commonly used their incentive awards to fund the recruitment of adoptive fa milies and provide pos tadoptive services due to the uncertainty of receiving future adoption in centive awards many st ates were reluctant to use the money for initiatives requiring ongoing revenue such as salaried positions therefore using incentive funds for onetime expenses such as studies training adoption events and the purchase of legal services was common in addition states reported that because the awards were relatively small compared to their overall child welfare budgets they were able to use their funds in i nnovative nd flexible ways state reported that the adop tion incentive bonus was the primary motivator for improving its adoption system th cornerstone report listed the primary concerns of states regarding the incentives as 1 they may give the impression that adoption is the best plan in all cases 2 that states with increased adoptions before asfa may have trouble exceeding their ba selines and 3 the law does not make further changes in the structur of funding for child welfare tables and figures in appendix the appendix contains severa l tables and figures that summarize adoption trends
