independent in 1991 in the l ast vote of january 2000 coalition of centerleft parties soundly defeated the inc umbent croatian democratic union hdz government weeks after the death of franjo t udjman the longstanding leader of the hdz and president of the country to supporters tudjman represented the fat her of croatian inde pendence to critics however tudjman closely resembled nationalist serb leader slobodan milosevic and demonstrated similar territorial designs n neighboring bosnia in 1995 croatia launched two military operations flash and storm to regain control over the krajina croat territory held by rebel ser bs after 1991 the attacks drove out much of the local serb population from croatia and tipped the balanc of forces in bosnia against milosevic and the bosnian serbs tudjman was signatory to and guarantor of the 1995 dayton peace agreement that ended the war in bosnia ho wever he and other hdz leaders came under frequent international criticism for nationalist policies authoritarian leadership and overt support for ethnic croat separatists in bo snia domestically the hdzs popularity eventually declined as the economy deterio rated and as hdz offici als became tainted by corruption scandals the 2000 pa rliamentary and presidentia l votes brought in new sethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21703crs2 1slouching toward respectability transitions online journal prague

of the croatian peoples party hns became president that year the racan government swiftly took meas ures to reform the economy and repair croatias damaged relations with its neighbors and with the i nternational community above all improving the countrys international standing and prospects for eu and nato integration became focal point for t he racan government since 2000 croatia has joined natos partnership for peace pfp program and membership action plan map it has concluded stabilization and association agreement with the european union eu and formally applied for eu membership it also joined the world trade organization wto in 2003 the racan government sought second mandate in the 2003 elections that would enable it to fulfill these goals possibly in its next term economic reforms as well as internationa l support yielded steady growth and other positive indicators in 2001 and 2002 however croatias external debt and unemployment levels remained high corruption scandals also plagued the government though not at the level of the tudjman era and it failed to deliver major prosecution victories from its anticrime rhetoric1 election preview the official 2003 campaign period ran for three weeks from november 5 until the 23rd preelection polls predicted close race between the sdpled coalition parties and the hdz since its fall from power in 2000 the hdz has attempted radical overhaul and reinvention of its image and platform hdz leader ivo sanader emphasized the partys new moderate proeuropean outl ook economic reform and tax cutting plans and support from prominent and mainstream eur opean conservatives during the campaign sanader reversed the partys longstandi ng opposition to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty and pledged full cooperation with the court in principle sanader also called for the ret urn to croatia of ethnic serb refugees uprooted since the 1995 conflict on behalf of the government prime minister racan presented his cabinet as the best means to guarantee the countrys path toward eu membership goal shared by large majority of the population however the coa lition parties opted to compete separately and in an uncoordinated fashion thus dividing allegiances of the centerleft electorate the large number of small centerleft partie s also diluted support for the larger parties prominent campaign issue was the case f former croat general gotovina who has been indicted by the icty for war cr imes related to the 1995 offensive against formerly serbheld areas in croatia the racan government pledged to hand him over to the hague but claimed not to be able to locate him after he went into hiding in mid 2001 despite mounting international pressu re the former croat general remains popular figure in croatia especially among th populations rightwing who view him as national hero and symbol of croatias right to selfdefense strong support for gotovina among hdz followers and local politicians was evident at some hdz rallies2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21703crs3 2continued reporting balkan crisis report 469 november 20 2003 3osce press release november 24 2003croatias electoral system is based on pr oportional representation the country is divided into ten electoral di stricts plus one constituency each for ethnic minorities and the expatriate community mainly in neighboring bosnia election results the organization for security and coope ration in europe osc assessed that the november 23 elections were conducted genera lly in line with intern ational standards for democratic elections the organizatio n said that improvements were needed in election legislation and voting access for refugees3turnout was 69 for the 10 electoral districts in croatia the total

majority all f our diaspora seats went to the hdz the social democrats came in second but combined with th eir four previous coalition partners also came up short of majority initial analyses of the election results proclaimed croatias shift to the right and the dramatic gain in support for the hdz alone ppears to support this claim however manyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21703crs4 observers believe that the rightward shift resulted more from the electorates generic desire for change and sense of frustration with the disparate incumbent leaders than from nostalgia for the problematic tudjman era the racan governments strategic goals for croatia including full integration into euroatlantic institutions continue to be highly popular in croatia and sa nader closely echoed these goals in the hdz platform moreover the margin of difference in voter support between the right and left remains small with the left hurt considerably by its own infighting and fragmentation new government after the vote the hdz reached out to other parties to try to form majority coalition top partner prospects appeared to be the peasant party hss part of the outgoing coalition and the rightwing party of rights hsp some peasant party leaders appeared to favor coalition but the party as whole did not approve such move european union representatives expresse d strong opposition to the possible inclusion of the hsp in croatias government because of the partys extreme nationalistic reputation hsp leaders who insist that their party has reformed have said they would remain in oppositi on instead the hdz resorted to soliciting support from various small parties including the social liberaldemocratic center hslsdc coalition and the pensioners party the hdz also gained support from handful of national minority deputies including the serb democratic independent party sdss in december prime ministerdesigna sanader announced that he had secured enough votes to support minority government on d ecember 23 he presented to parliament his cabinet and outlined the governments policy priorities mainly relating to economic reforms sanaders lack of sufficient coalition partners to secure stable parliamentary majority will leave the hdzl ed government depende nt on its cooperation agreements with parties outside of government key issues the return of the hdz to power after the 2003 elections has prompted some speculation about the sanader governments po ssible areas of continuity or change from the last government hdz leaders wish to distinguish the party from rather than harken its legacy in government in the 1990s prime nister sanader has repeatedly tried to convey the partys transformation into m oderate conservative m ovement that is pro european and rejects radicalism extre mism xenophobia and nationalism the extent of the hdzs transformation may become evident in the governments approach to numerous key issues government stability the hdzs inability to forge majority coalition will make for an inherently unstable government the sa nader government may have t grant concessions on regular basis in exchange for parliamentary support from small parties and individual deputies even minor setbacks in parliament could lead to the governments fall maintaining unity within the hdz could represent another challenge especially if some party members do not approve of their leaderships outlook and directionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21703crs5 the hdzs weak standing may negatively affect the governments ability to pursue its policy agenda croatias overarching goals of nato and especially eu membership will require adherence to refor m policies consistent with eur opean standards observers believe that an hdzled government can only reach its strategic objectives by continuing the pathbreaking work of the previous g overnment however the hdzs dependence on variety of small parties could lead to unpr edictable policies first test for the sanader government is likely to be the budget since planned spending and tax cuts may have to be sacrificed for concessions to othe r parties on costly items such as pensions progress toward eu integration including icty and refugee return issues foremost among the governments priorities is securing croatias path toward eu membership croatia has set 2007 as target d ate for eu entry modeled after the date set by the eu for the accession of romania and bulgaria both of which have held longer association relations with the eu croatia signed stabilization and association agreement saa with the european union in july 2001 the saa has yet to be ratified by all eu member states croatia formally applied for eu membership in february 2003 and submitted its responses to lengthy eur opean commission questionnaire in october the commission is expected to give its opinion on croatias candidacy by mid2004 which may open the door for the council to star t accession negotiations at meeting of eu foreign ministers with their weste rn balkan counterparts in december 2003 eu ministers urged the incoming croatian government to make all efforts toward compliance with eu political and ec onomic conditions for membership in particular the eu ministers cited full coopera tion with the icty the return of refugees to croatia and minority rights as key performance benchmarks cooperation with the interna tional criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty remains difficult issue for the hdz despite sanaders pledges to uphold croatias international commitments th war crimes tribunal r emains unp opular in croatia especiallyamong hdz supporters the specific case of former general gotovina is yet to be resolved moreover new indictme nts are expected to be delivered to zagreb in early 2004 likely against current or former hdz members the situation regarding refugee returns is also problematic according to the high commissioner for refugees about 100000 of 280000 ethnic serbs who fled during the 1995 croatian offensive have returned to croatia during t he election campaign sanader said that he favored refugee returns without outlining any specific plans the refugee issue is complicated by property rights issues the stat us of bosnian croat tenants in former serb homes and implementation of minority ri ghts in return for serb party support in parliament sanader pledged to accelerate p roperty restitution and housing construction for returning refugees regional relations the new croatian government will face many challenges relating to regional affairs especially given the hdzs legacy in neig hborly relations the racan government and president mesic had made concerted effo rt to end direct croatian involvement in bosnias internal affairs and improve bilateral relations d uring the 1990s the late former president tudjman had maintained political and financial ties to the separatist bosnian croat community which hindered the devel opment of an integrated bosnian state thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21703crs6 current hdzs relationship with its sister party in bosnia hdzbih still the strongest party among the bosnian croat electorate may have more complicated facets on the one hand hdz leaders have repeatedly pledge d to respect bosnias sovereignty and independence and the croat electorate gen erally favors this policy on the other hand all of the diaspora votes from bosnia went t the hdz demonstrating the bosnian croat communitys strong political support for the hdz which the hdz may not wish to risk weakening meanwhile the hdz in bosnia may itself be ripe for transformation and image makeover similar to sanaders efforts with the hdz in croatia political relations with serbia appeared to improve in 2003 making his first official visit to serbia in september president sic received public apology from serbia and montenegro president svetovar marovic for all evils committed against croatia in the past mesic reciprocated with an apology for past pain or damage committed by croatia to some observers the symbolic gestures marked the possibility for greater reconciliation between the two countries inc luding closer economic ties and cooperation on refugee returns in 2003 the racan government sparked dispute with neighboring slovenia by declaring an exclusive economic zone in the driatic sea slovenia has strongly objected to croatias claim and its potential impact on slovenias access to the open seas some slovene leaders have threatened to block croatias eu aspirations if this issue is not resolved once slovenia joins the eu in 2004 the previous croatian govern ment promoted closer regional ties in the security arena at the prague nato summit in november 2002 the presidents of albania croatia and macedonia proposed to presid ent bush
