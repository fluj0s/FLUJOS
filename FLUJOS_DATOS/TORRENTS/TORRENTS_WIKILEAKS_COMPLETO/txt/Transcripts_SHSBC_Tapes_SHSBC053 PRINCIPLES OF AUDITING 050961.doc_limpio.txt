principles of auditing lecture given on 5 september 1961 all right this is 5 sept isnt it audience yes right and 61 saint hill special briefing course now i hate to begin on theme like this there are actually so many things to tell you why i dont think itll ever get it done i dont think theyll these things can ever be told you they are just too many so i would like to invite your cooperation and initiative in sweeping up surging forward and synthesizing some of this material as you go theres substitute for understanding and there is understanding without experience nothing was more wonderful than the norths total solution to the black slavery problem of the south they were not encumbered by any familiarity with the problem at all which is an optimum way to enter into any problem of course one is uninhibited by facts and the south of course was totally uninhibited by any facts of what was going on in the north or what that was all about the only familiarity they could establish between them then was war let point out thats terribly terribly apt example because that in essence is an auditing situation where there is understanding or familiarity if you do not permit understanding and familiarity of the preclear with his bank he will go to war and if the auditor does not have understanding and familiarity with the pc and his bank and the mechanics of the mind he will be at war whether he likes it or not the anatomy of hatred is totally based on the anatomy of noncomprehension and noncomprehension is totally based upon lack of familiarity and observation if you want to not comprehend something by all means dont look at it but another condition applies that tremendous amount of pretended knowingness and pretended understanding can arise after one has not observed the ancient example of the wise men and the elephant is very poor example compared to an auditor attempting to audit pc when the auditor has familiarity with the mind out of this you get such idiocies as freudian analysis which is just plain idiocy and after some years will bring the patient who has to be patient that is why you see the term is applied to state you see where by being careful he can still live that is the freudian equivalent of clear that was their goal now clear is brought up to point where he is free to act which is just the other end of the spectrum now the freudian analyst sat there in his analysis on busy busy busy pretended knowingness he knew that the observation of childrens sexual parts brought about insanity well it must have been because he looked in childhood only for sexual incidents and thats the area of the least sex isnt it yeah fascinating so he knew what caused insanity and of course he went on and made people insane the freudians never released it but in the first three months of analysis at one time the astonishing figure of 35 percent suicide resulted never been made public they never validated any gains in spite of the fact that they had the whole field of psychometric tests available psychology is even more idiotic the psychologist is born out of school of science that observed dead tissue the medico has all of his stable data from the area and field of dead tissue the pathologist does observe few bugs wiggling but dead tissue is the source of medicine but there the study of dead tissue ah the psychologist came out of this same field after youve sawed the top of corpses ead off all you can find in skull is brain so they studied it oh i suppose thats better than nothing but let point out something to you that the thing they should have been studying had left and out of this of course we got noobservation of the mind and the fundamentals of behavior because they were not observing what they were processing im not just giving you some tricks of logic here what i tell you is absolute fact that the whole theory of modern medicine is based on study of dead tissue they in medical school all they do is cut up dead bodies they have ball they whittle and chop and classify and thats all very interesting and im sure they learned great deal about anatomy but when it came to the mind and they opened up the skull and found brain they of course studied it and they havent been anywhere since do you realize that field is as vital as it makes progress and science is as vital as it makes progress and it is more vital than that let point out that there has been significant advance in freudian analysis over and above the day of its origin in 1894 and theres been significant advance in the field of psychology since its origin at leipzig germany in 1879 theyve not gone anyplace so obviously they couldnt have been observing what the mind was all about they couldnt have been or they would have found out something now the most novel thing that i introduced into the study of the mind was the observation of living beings very interesting what new thought but youd have to be able to confront motion to do that and you yourself would have to be to some degree man of action youd have to be able to confront some action youd have to be out there slugging it along with the fellows who were sweating and you would never have studied this in any ivory tower and to withdraw to the highest peak of the himalayas and regard with curiosity ones umbilical remains is of course not the way to do it because familiarity ever occurs after while you would start saying well if you stretch somebodys umbilical cord far enough why youll get clear inevitable all right lets take look at this because we can learn great deal from this one fact an auditor has two sources of familiarity two sources in processing there are more sources of familiarity than this in general that he could work with but im talking now about sessions he has the familiarity we call subjective reality and he has as well the familiarity of the observation of preclear and his meter behavior while in session in other words while he himself is in session as preclear he has the opportunity of obtaining familiarity on the data and functions of life and thinkingness and then as an auditor you see he has the opportunity of obtaining an objective familiarity on the behavior and activities and phenomena of the pc as viewed directly with his own eyes and indirectly through the electronic phenomena of the emeter in other words there are two spheres there of observation as far as auditing is concerned naturally there are more spheres theres the sphere of observing life observing living there is the sphere of living as well as observing living of course its rigged so that if you do too much living in this particular society you wind up with too many withholds and after that of course your auditor has lot of trouble trying to get you in session i dont know i think there possibly is some phase of life that is not punished i havent discovered what it is yet but but speaking strictly and entirely in the zone of sessions there are these two sources of observation and familiarity you have an opportunity to become familiar in two zones one as an auditor and one as pc now certain laws govern auditing and if you were in state of mind where you believe that there are too many laws and that you were having to memorize too many laws and that you have to think of too many laws while you were busy doing it then i can tell you that you have vast familiarity on the subject of laws and very little familiarity on the subject of the mind ever stop and think of that now rules can only go so far as to guide you in the path of right and light on the road to making clears they can only go so far the great oddity is that it can be done at all that is the oddity but factually speaking number of rules can deliver into your hands familiarity with what is going on in the pc at any given moment you yourself should be able to experience that or should have experienced it and should have some knowingness on it and the moment that you gain knowingness upon this particular subject the rules will all fall into line and will all have proper value and you will see the reasons for all of them and youll see which ones are important and which ones are not important all of that is very comprehensible you have all been audited this is obvious that you have familiarity with the mind because you have been audited oh ive got crasher for you ive got crasher for about 30 percent of the cases in scientology you have never seen mind thats crasher isnt it that is only the only source of very bad auditing is familiarity with the mind now of course i have got the machine guns out and the cordons divided up in all directions on just one subject and that is clearing and i am doing every possible thing that i can do to improve auditing wherever it is in order to make clears this is my push and to make them faster and more smoothly with minimum number of flubs this is you might say my current crusade we look at broader track i might have some other crusades of much broader significance but right now this is my current crusade and this crusade has been in progress now since the 3rd south african acc so all ive been doing actually is just making better auditors and every time i find another gate opening on this route i am very happy about it indeed and though i myself may sound somewhat condemnatory occasionally just assign it to my urgency on this line i am eager and i would say having actual survey present but just at offhand estimate that at least one third of the auditors in scientology have never become familiar with the mind they have subjective reality on engrams secondaries locks ridges machines circuits time track visio sonic tactile kinetic havent any reality on these things dont exist horrible state of affairs isnt it all right then this requires special technology and the second that we get this technology we of course can advance cases much more rapidly why are cases dragging their heels to clear why why why why why why are auditors being difficult to train why why well theyre only difficult to train in those areas where they do not have familiarity so obviously the technical advance which is most needful at this present instant on this particular crusade and campaign is type of process that will give one great deal of familiarity with the bank and all of its aspects and at the same time you would pick up all the hangfire cleared cases all the cases that are hanging fire on the road to clear are hanging fire because they are not going along the line they should be going in auditing they are walking the far far far perimeter of the crater operating so as not to fall in i dont know how many hours they could do this on current processes but that would be up to the auditor now the processes which we have used in skilled fashion by an auditor who has comprehension of the mind would not possibly permit anybody to do this they would fall in bang that would be it ah but an auditor who has familiarity on the mind will applaud this tightrope walk on the far far edge of the crater and so he makes very sure that the pc never falls in because that is the thing to do to keep out of trouble all of mans wars sicknesses diseases economic disasters political chaoses and anything else which he has assigned to the various plagues of existence come entirely from one area keeping out of trouble if this planet and civilization were ever to vanish perhaps i will come back someday and put sign in orbit on its exact track just single sign planet you see there was planet here once but they were very anxious to keep out of trouble they were awfully careful oh that sounds like grim thing well fortunately im not going to have to do that because were all going to get in and pitch this is for sure but its just this its just this its just that diffidence this withdrawal from session its just that diffidence which makes all that difference youre not supposed to keep pc out of trouble if the trouble is in his bank only trouble youre supposed to keep pc out of is session randomity but youre not supposed to keep him out of bank randomity if hes got bank to fall in you would do grievous crime if you didnt unfasten the nails and bolts on one of the slats of the bridge auditing questions are designed to take the drop and if an auditor is administering them so that drop will occur this must be an interesting session here you have all the questions necessary to plunge somebody into great familiarity with his bank on gradient so that it doesnt overwhelm him and are applying them in such way as to prevent him from falling in by that time you will start misinterpreting rules you will need rules and youll have to misinterpret rules and youll have to do all sorts of things and youll so on and it all becomes very complicated and so forth but your problem is rather interesting problem it is how to keep somebody out of the bank it is how to keep somebody from getting in trouble pc never protests at getting into trouble that presents him with familiarity possible familiarity he never protests against this what he does is protest against measures which prevent him from becoming familiar with the bank you can always count on pc protesting measures which prevent him from becoming familiar with his bank to this degree every thetan is owed considerable compliment they will do this in session but sometimes in auditing they are being kind they are being nice they are being pleasant and they are being confused and they keep the pcs attention out of the bank and you get instant and immediate trouble with capital t where do you get this trouble pcs getting auditing and he knows it well how does pc get auditing hes permitted to walk tightrope far far from the crater and hes never permitted to fall into anything pc goes along well theres an answer to the auditing question theres the answer to the auditing question and so on and the auditor says good and the pc says well theres the answer and the auditor says good and the pc says theres the answer and the auditor says good and the pc says theres the answer and the auditor says good and the auditor knows better than to ever ask him how are you doing what are you looking at where are you going how do you feel about this because if he did the pc might confront his bank and that would be terrible wouldnt it to audit without curiosity as to where the pc is and what he is doing is surefire method of keeping pc from ever getting into any trouble if you never find out anything about whats going on of course you dont have to confront his bank he doesnt have to confront his bank and the time can go up to light years and nobody gets any auditing done see you dont find out whats going on he doesnt find out whats going on here we go here we go now as general rule any mechanism that you introduce into session any mechanism that you introduce into session which permits the pc to avoid confronting his bank or takes the pcs attention out of his bank or takes the pc out of session is going to produce every evil you associate with auditing which is arc breaks heavy problems all these difficulties of auditing theyre all produced on the same common denominator now having learned this common denominator ill try to teach it to you so that you can really see this for what it is the pc objects to not being audited and that is all pc ever objects to now if you just write catalog of how many ways pc could not be audited i will show you then every arc break that pc could have see thats all you have to do thats all you have to do is just deliver auditing and you get back every phenomenon that you associate as an evil pc arc broke pc this pc that pc not insession long grind pc gain pc with lose pc not want any more auditing all of these oh just ad infinitum anything that you could think of that pc is liable to do that you would object to as an auditor is all from the same source it isnt the pc thinking he has auditing it has to be the pc is getting none and as soon as this occurs youve had it the rocket is up the lifeboats are out because everything is sinking with seacocks wide open thats it you audit in such way as to prevent the pc from being insession and youre going to get every single evil that you have ever heard of or seen or experienced in auditing so you just have to figure out how many ways there are that you could do this so you cant lay it out actually one two three and say these are the ways you just have to take it from this general broad observation that is the rule you prevent the pc getting audited and the pc is upset now this goes so far as an evil of this character you always have present time problem with somebodys wife while youre auditing him well whats the basic source of the present time problem it is always that the wife is denying him auditing one way or the other the wife denies him auditing and this creates the arc break get that i dont care what he said she went out with joe and they went to bar and she came home drunk and i had to put her to bed and therefore i am very tired and i am having hard time staying in session because im so tired having been up all night searching the bars of south main street or something of the sort whatever this is it doesnt matter what the pt problem was somebody is preventing him from getting auditing see so that makes pt problem and that makes an upset got it now the reason she does this is another interesting reason which is on exactly the same line is she cant have any auditing just add it up so the grades of cases are those that cant have any auditing those that consider their auditing is being prevented and those who can have auditing now on the first two classes youre not going to get any clearing so the obvious thing is to remedy havingness of auditing that would be an obvious solution to any part of it this fellows old grandma keeps nattering into her teacup all the time about how he is doing this terrible thing of getting some auditing and so forth and so forth and you say well whats the matter with her well you just better sum it up if you want to understand this old girl is she just cant have any thats all why cant she have any well there could be several reasons why but the main one is if you so much as rattled the knob of her closet door an avalanche of skeletons would spill all about the room thered be such nasty pounding and bumping of skulls flying about that there would be terrible dishabille isnt that interesting some of this could simply be noncomprehension somebodys mother i think it was was objecting to girl being audited and was causing all kinds of present time problems and the auditor finally got very clever and crossquestioned this and found out that there was comprehension of anything that was going on and she didnt know what scientology was so he took an old folder we had which gave the dynamics and the laws of dianetics remember the eight dynamics and gave it to the old person and she read it and after that auditing was fine just was simply the randomity of missing datum it was that wild now auditing for herself however would have run into the other barrier she understood all about it now there were eight dynamics and this so gripped her as concept that after that she knew all about it and she became quite an authority the only thing she actually knew was the eight dynamics and she had gotten these totally on having been handed this leaflet i think the leaflet came into bearing on an identical situation or the same situation i mean it came into existence because of that we then started using this leaflet very broadly i remember this instance well it was marvelous people knew all about it there were eight dynamics and they were one and they were two and three and four and five and six and seven and eight and that was it and they knew all about it and that was brandnew and now life clarified for them and everything was fine and it was all good roads and good weather but as far as them getting auditing was concerned this again would have fallen across the skeleton but if theyd gone on theyd read the eight dynamics and theyd gone on its cou only have been skeletons so it could be missing data or too much data that theyre holding on to which again they make data missing for you you see withholds so that third party situation still comes under just that heading scarcity of auditing why is it scarce well it cant be it cant be had either it doesnt exist which is they have understanding of it and therefore it isnt anything or if it did occur why there would be too many social repercussions of one kind or another because theyve got too many withholds so they cant have auditing thats all so you never audit these people unless you practically back them into the corner of the courtyard you see and at gunpoint demand what the withhold is anybody start arguing with today on the subject of scientology out in the broad public something like that im sitting there enjoying my creme menthe or something after dinner and somebody all of sudden somebody jumps on the subject of scientology and so forth oh that oh youre that hubbard oh i see yes i tell you what i would do i wouldnt go any further with the conversation with that we used to say put them in session run an engram and so forth thats still perfectly all right but i would now take different tack i would look at them surprised and say well what have you done and they would say what what have you done that you couldnt tell about what have you done that these people shouldnt know about itd be so non sequitur everybody would be terribly shocked and they would look at they always think youre some kind of swami with bath towel wrapped around your head and theyd how did you know well its fairly easy when you have familiarity with the thing it does something to the eyes every single one of the people present the next time they were in the bathroom would gaze into the mirror all right the pc who is arc breaky or who gets present time problems is in some fashion or other being denied auditing in some way i know this sounds very funny i know it sounds rather monocentric on our part to say that they are denied auditing because auditing is apparently something brandnew that hasnt existed adequate treatment has not existed on this planet period whats your first thought if you fall down and bust your skull oh god doctors oh god hospital bills oh my heavens on earth well theyll probably trepan ooooh whoa wah wah youre not worried about the fact that your car is wrecked near so much as the fact youre now going to be treated isnt that right you get an injury now youre going to be treated you hope you dont get too sick because then you will have to be treated rarh you can see some sawbones coming around and taking cotton wads and sticking them on swabs and sticking them into your nose which wont do anything you know but irritate hell out of your nose you know and monkey with it and say well you take this prescription which you go up to the drugstore where i get cut you see and over here to the chemist and hell fill this thing and then he can put it on national service or something and then after youve gone to all this trouble its just enough trouble just to get some of this swill you see and when you take it it tastes ghastly and you know it wont do anything either confidence in treatment on this planet is at its lowest possible ebb the only planet i know of where it dropped any lower was the marcab confederacy and it dropped much lower in the marcab confederacy the way they taught medicine there they had number of drawers with dead dried tissue in them and theyd drag these drawers out you see and show the students and this is dried head you see and this is tissue thats been affected by tuberculosis and this is this and it was all dried and so forth and that was their total command of medicine the only thing that was wrong with this particular activity is these really were infected tissues and they were still carrying the germ spores which i thought was always little bit rough but i remember giving medical lectures occasionally and any student gave any trouble why id just drop some tubercular tissue on his desk this was all sort of raw but there it got to point where you werent ever permitted to get new body and this is typical of many space opera societies and is getting typical of this one this one will go along too and this society has got it rigged up now where the best treatment for this and that and the other thing you see is to give some fellow an artificial medulla oblongata and wire him up you see for sound and theyre starting this evolution where theyre going to replace the body with the mechanical parts you know that ive told you about before and eventually theyll omit the printed circuit and the things still work and theyll say whats this all right well not to get off onto whole track but youve got point here where treatment is very very poor its guesswork its unpositive it is negligent little girl hurt in an automobile accident here in east grinstead is taken up to the hospital she lies there on cot bleeding for several hours in an anteroom without anybody even coming around to put tourniquet on i mean stuff of this character just goes on all the time treatment has to be done by calloused people because it doesnt treat now the consternation which can spread through hospital by scientologist walking in from bed to bed and doing touch assists and so forth has already been demonstrated on many occasions and it is consternation but nobody can confront it the doctors cant confront it some of the nurses do but never the doctors scientology has done some fantastic things in hospitals well i personally have discouraged it we are not in the field of healing that doesnt say we cant heal better than they can but healing is at such an ebb that if you cure somebody with broken leg i mean that too cure him and hes been in bed for three or four days with this broken leg and theyre getting ready to come in and put souvenir cast on him i think thats why they put casts on things like that its so people can write their names on it and then keep the souvenir the end product of this is what you cured him my god you never heard so many remarks as will be made by doctors which are further off base in your life they are fantastic remarks they are incredible and itll finally sum up to well the leg couldnt have been broken and they will make this remark while theyre looking at their own xray plate i had this advanced to one time little kid was cured of leukemia by an auditor in older days they did much more of it than they do now and the auditor thought boy that medicos eyes are really going to pop out see when he finds this is all negative now it was an interesting engram by the way mothers favorite phrase was itll just turn your blood to water and the auditor pulled this phrase out of the bank and the kid got well that is of course leukemia that was it interesting huh but the medical pronunciamento is the child couldnt have possibly had leukemia because leukemia is not curable just try to wrap your wits around this you know you get kind of groggy you know trying to make all corners of this thing they just throw everything out of existence because they know its not curable and they know themselves are not capable of curing hence their callousness they have to make nothing out of their patients otherwise the treatment would be an overt the psychologist has to make nothing out of man because treating him would then be an overt theyre just lessening the overt is their professional approach ordinarily all right what does all this add up to absence of treatment you have preclears who are trained from not the cradle they have been trained since the roman arena they have been trained since the last pyramid into the nonexistence of treatment well that is then cure auditing but the funny part of it is the very funny part of it is the very large percentage that still hopes treatment can take place that is what is amazing if youre going to be amazed about anything not amazed about the fact that the wogs never whipped themselves up any method of doing anything but be amazed at the fact that after all this people still have hope its never been killed in large percentage of the people now those in whom it has been utterly squashed to get them into any kind of session and so forth oh wow man wow because youre going on total nohave of auditing dont you see but if theres any hope there at all that hope must therefore be rather thin by this time it must be rather raveled and all the auditor has got to do is make motion in the direction of treatment and he arc breaks the pc why because the pcs hope of treatment is already so thin so youre doing at first kind of cheerleaders job you know i am talking about before he gets into session you know you have to kind of reassure him and then when you get him in session let him have treatment all right now how many ways could there be of not letting him have treatment while hes sitting in the pcs chair how many ways could there be first and foremost is not permit his attention to go onto his case and thats practically common denominator of all of them if hes sitting there in the chair dont let his attention go on his case even though hes putting in chair time hes not being audited see and he knows it now the oddity is that the most crude fumbling around with the case itself as long as the pcs attention continues on the case elicits real protest from the pc he never protests about this you run him into some of the juiciest bits that you practically will never be able to get him out of without superheroic auditing see actually you can get him out of anything and he never protests he never really protests but dont let him go into it and hell protest all protests of the pc all difficulties of the pc all stem from this same button i am talking to you about treatment havingness on auditing and when these are even vaguely aided and abetted by the auditor you of course have trouble with the pc you will always have trouble with the pc if youre going to give pcs auditing give them auditing now what is auditing auditing consists of putting pc insession and this has two things able to talk to the auditor and interested in own case now interested in own case infers of course and means attention on his own case so if you wanted to refine this and make that definition of insessionness even more workable you would say attention on his own case and able to talk to the auditor and that would be an absolute necessity so that would be what auditing is auditing is directing the pcs attention on his own case and directing his ability to talk to the auditor that would be the scope of auditing and the only way then you could get into trouble if that is an auditing session the only way you could get into trouble would be take his attention off of his case and make it difficult for him to talk to the auditor and that would add up on both counts to auditing and you would run square into this other button and there is where you get the violence of the arc break it can be pretty explosive and can be pretty violent because actually it is painful to have these things happen but the basics of the pain is is there is auditing so therefore damage might occur which is irreparable you see he knows he believes now the auditing could cure any damage but if theres going to be auditing then the damage isnt curable and this is exactly which way his mind dives so hes in state of anxiety the moment you violate insessionness he is in state of anxiety now there are many other phenomena involved with this one of the phenomena consists of this he is looking at an engram the only space in the engram actually is brought about by his attention on the engram and until the engram is desensitized he will have to keep some space in it to keep the engram off the front of his nose so that if you distract his attention suddenly from an engram the space possibly may disappear out of the engram and he finds the engram on the end of his nose and the engram might have some bite in it you havent bitten him but the engram has by doing what by taking his attention off the engram his attention is on the engram and his attention is on as much of the engram as he is able to put his attention on it at that moment and then all of sudden the auditor betrays him and pulls his attention off of the engram and of course the engram will collapse on him bang its uncomfortable he doesnt like this its physically painful it can be hell develop somatic from it there are various phenomena will occur sensations occur that he doesnt like and now he compounds it with an overt against the auditor one two see now how could the auditor distract his attention how many ways could an auditor distract his attention well once more we have very long list itd be dictionary full of ways there are numerous ways his attention could be yanked out of session one is choosing an auditing room or permitting one to be chosen for one which has action or activity in its vicinity why because youve set up an auditing session then as the stable datum around which action is occurring see that would be one you can get away with lot of that but dont try to audit somebody in the middle of busy street because theres motion going on all around and youll find later that the auditing session is itself kind of an engram why because he got all this motion out of the tail of his eye you see and yet his attention is supposed to be on the case and so forth well you can get away with quite bit of it but youll find out in an operation in hospital which is located in busy traffic area of city is far more serious than an operation in hospital in the country where there is traffic action thats fascinating thats how you make an operation hang up just put hospital right in the middle of four freeways and then put its operating room out in corner of the building you see where youve got the visibility of two freeways now were trying to run the operation and we have hell of time running this operation it seems to be an awful sticky operation we find out it was for removing pimple on the left gluteus maximus you see it wasnt much of an operation but boy is it stuck you see i know that there was now that there was larger scope in terms of cubic area to an engram youd think of the engram as taking place in the operating room probably with scope from the patient to the doctor you see or in the immediate vicinity maybe cubic yard of engram you get the idea whereas factually it isnt even as small as the room which would be something on the order of fifteen or twenty cubic yards of engram you see its more like half cubic mile and as the pc starts running it he becomes aware of more zone and if theres activity in that zone it pins his attention back into the operation one of the interesting ways of running an engram would be to pay absolutely attention to what was going on particularly in the operating room this engram taking place in the corner of the building but just find out what he wouldnt know about the traffic around the hospital youd find all of sudden the engram just goes fling you see its just the traffic around the hospital you see oohhhohhhh boom that was what was holding the engram in place actually the engram wasnt being held in place in the auditing room it was being held in place in the corridor got the idea if pc has had lot of auditing in very busy active environment or area ask them what has been unknown about the activity of an auditing area and youre liable to find their sessions blowing up much faster than on trying to run out auditors get the idea because the auditing sessions were maybe fifty cubic yards of zone and hes only looked at the first cubic yard and he yet he was aware of the activity in fifty cubic yards so the activity in fifty cubic yards pinned him down into the half cubic yard you get the idea environment environment motion in the environment very very interesting study all in itself all right that would be the first thing that you would do about it is guarantee the noninterruption of the session thats the auditors responsibility matter who made the room assignment thats the auditors responsibility all right there are certain physical limitations against certain thing like this but any auditing room youve got around here to give you some area of comparison is fairly quiet thats fairly quiet now theres little interruption but it doesnt usually amount to hill of beans im talking about more motion than that you got the idea it takes little more motion than that to really pound them down and pound them in it takes something like well the most as weve known for long time the most horrible thing you could do to any accident patient would be to throw them into an ambulance open up the siren and drive them at eighty miles an hour and i think that the boys know this down deep and that theyre just lessening the overt of treating him at all basically itd in most quote treatments unquote it would be kinder to leave the fellow lying on the battlefield or at the scene of the accident you know take him over the under the hedge and put pillow under his head and say well are you as comfortable as possible oh yes hes as comfortable as he could get under those circumstances and if he gets well hell get up from the hedge and if he doesnt get well hell die but who introduced this idea of the scarcity of bodies well there isnt any great scarcity of bodies well how all this treatment ambulances you know screaming sirens eighty miles an hour you know traffic areas and so forth and in the bustling reception rooms you know and up elevators and down carriage ways and halls and into room thats gleaming full of all kinds of reflected light you see oh man theyre great theyre great theyre marvelous they got it all taped and then operate him on some kind of gas with oxygen in it or ether with lots of oxygen and have the oxygen tank explode or something like this they do that very often anything to create randomity well id say their mind isnt on their business and we shouldnt make the same mistakes all right so much for the quietude of the room now an auditor who chatters endlessly about other things than the session while auditing pc or chatters at pc in quote breaks unquote about other things than the session of course is actually setting himself up to get the pcs attention off of it that is not very broad error but i have noticed it often enough in hgcs to comment on it youre dragging his attention off of his case in the break and then when he starts session again or something like this well of course the pcs attention is every place the pc most normally wants to keep on talking about his case if you ever noticed during the break well if youre tired of hearing of his case for the moment excuse yourself and go get glass of water he wont object but now in the session itself an ineffective or unworkable process of course is auditing but weve got the technology of this thing pretty well taped and you can almost neglect it just do good technical job use the tools which you have learn how to use them and so forth that is an easy one and that is actually not too much of barrier and yet it is the barrier at which you mostly strain it is not the major barrier of keeping pc insession certainly anything we have had since february run on pc just chosen at random almost and run on pc with inside the limits of what you can do and what you cant do would keep the pc in session im now just talking about smooth sessions dont you see almost anything an old dianetic engram would keep him insession so technical technical is separate compartment to these other things im talking to you about all right our next big hurdle then lets just lay aside technical there it is and its very important and that is what were doing after all but it is not the main source of auditing bustups even when poorly done it is not the main source of auditing bustups because it is auditing its administration of that technical which is the main source of difficulty now we get to our next one our next one and by far the most important one the prediction factor this has all sorts of things such as surprise surprise what is surprise well first and foremost people who have low tolerance for the unknowns are surprised easily much more easily than you would think and the degree that person can be surprised is in direct proportion to his intolerance for unknownnesses the less person has toleration for the unknown the more he can be surprised now what is surprise and the reason im talking about surprise rather than notknow is to give you little better look at it surprise is not having known surprise is not notknowingness surprise is not having known surprise is past tense knownness now ive been trying to crack what surprise was here since 57 and theres what it is its not having known and that gets at the root of every surprise and that just rips up all the surprises on the track zippetybap that is very rapid for running surprises not having known notknowingness what isnt known doesnt run surprises what wasnt known runs surprises you see the fact had existence before he found out about it and he is shocked by the fact that he didnt know about it by some weird prescience of some kind or another when it was going on so therefore the death of uncle zorch is uniformly surprise because uncle zorch died week or so ago and we didnt know it and that is the source of surprise of course the basic anatomy of surprise is elementary it is just change unpredicted so surprise is an unpredicted change that is your technical background definition but how does this register in the mind an unpredicted change is not of any consequence unless there was knowingness present which the pc didnt know and then finds out see like the death of uncle zorch uncle zorch has been dead for week and now he suddenly finds out uncle zorch is dead now he is very surprised you see this amazes him hes surprised whats he surprised about well actually he tries to go backtrack into all that unknowingness of week and of course he gets the impression of himself floundering around for an entire week in notknowingness which is an invalidation of his knowingness and his permeation and that is the only thing thetan ever objects to an invalidation of knowingness then he objects with violence but its on the basis of surprise he thinks of himself as going around all that week he thinks of everything he did that week with uncle zorch dead which of course does what its actually pretended unknowingness he didnt really notknow it during that whole week you see but it was fact that existed someplace of which he was not aware so he gets future that looks like this that all sorts of things he doesnt know about are going on in his vicinity that he will maybe find out about and they will be terrible shock to him see so he starts living in an environment in state of anxiety because he has now had it demonstrated to him clearly and brilliantly that facts not known to him which are quite destructive can exist in his environment without his awareness so he starts fighting the black thetans every night you got the idea see hes sucked back into the whirlpool of unknown yesterdays well the truth of the matter is he knew his environment in those yesterdays but he looks back at them as notknowing the environment so he doesnt know whether he knows it and he doesnt know whether he notknows it and things of horrible portent might be going on at just this very moment do you realize ill give you an example of this do you realize that your nearest and dearest and best loved one right at this exact instant might be in terrible trouble and you wouldnt even know it can you get little spark of anxiety out of that well thats what anxiety is and thats what nervousness is and the fellow whos starting to get nervy about things has simply been taught this lesson that facts can exist without his awareness of them and he moves over as protectionsurvival mechanism over into i had better be very alert because it can happen again you see that facts can exist without my knowing anything about them so therefore i am living in an unknown environment and this by the way is the greatest destroyer of iq there is iq goes down in direct ratio to the amount of unknownness which the individual conceives the environment to hold it isnt how stupid he is its how much unknownness does he conceive to exist there which is quite amusing so this then will also apply to subject fellow cant learn german hes stupid on the subject of german well why is this person stupid on the subject of german well there must be lot of feeling that theres terrible unknownnesses in the zone and area of german i think you take somebody that fought in world war i world war ii and tried to teach them the german language i think youd have ball see after he hes sitting there minding his own business eating his bully beef or something of the sort and all of sudden somebody says well there was an attack yesterday over on company and bill is dead it isnt even really the shocks and shells dont you see its bill is dead but he should have known it yesterday get the idea see if he was any good as thetan this is his selfcriticism hed know these things got the idea he doesnt know these things so therefore hes stupid his his conception of the amount of unknownness on any subject gives you the direct ratio of his intelligence on that subject so in the environment at large you get an additional one which is the amount of unknownness he conceives might exist in the environment at large regulates his intelligence about the environment at large ah you get people in insane asylums where this has gone all the way out and they dont know those walls are there ooohhhhooohhhh might be something else you know ooohhoohh watch them you know and then they get to point where they dont know they dont even dare look at the wall they dont know they dont know about the wall and so forth and uhhhh there might be spooks present and and then they very often will solve this whole problem the anxiety factor when it comes to solution gets to be gruesome indeed they will mock up unknown presences so they can be known presences you see they solve the whole thing they say well the way to conquer all this unknown environment or this unknown about what the people are going to do is just put the people in the environment and we will say they are there dont you see now lets solve it with total delusion i saw such fellow i was up at lowestoft inspecting couple of motor fishing vessels not long ago and there was war veteran there and he came aboard one of them and he was evidently using one of its cabins to change his clothes and he came aboard and he changed his clothes and he went out and with the most vile language was having violent arguments first he tried to have violent argument with the boat guard but this didnt work too well but he had the most violent argument going along and i listened to it and of course everybody said well hes been crazy ever since the war but and so forth and its just something he does and so on but i looked at him rather interestedly from standpoint of exactly what he was doing you know as scientologist would what is this fellow doing you know and he was scolding back at somebody who was reprimanding him probably sergeant very defensive snarling vile violent kickbacks there was obviously somebody in his environment that was just scolding him all the time and reprimanding him all the time and telling him all kinds of things all the time and sometimes the person would be over on the right and sometimes over on the left and hed have to bop and turn in that direction and shake his finger at this fellow and curse him out and say and tell him off really tell him off and hed walk few more feet and the fellow would be over here by now and hed tell him and hed tell him off and so forth well what was he doing he was putting known in an environment which had become intolerably unknown to him he could longer tolerate that much unknown in his environment so he had put known into it in other words he had gone through the line of just merely being insane on the subject of the environment and he was now in pretended knowingness on the environment which was really gone you get the mechanism well thats the mechanism of surprise well this applies to sessions very closely and very directly applies to sessions most of what pc is going through is accumulations of unknownnesses that he suddenly found out and nearly everything hes got in the bank is prevention against being caught unawares again i wont bother to give you any examples of that if youre interested in examples of it look in dianetics modern science of mental health any engram in there that is detailed and you will find out that it is the intolerance of the unknownness that causes the person to get the reactive computation that will act without his finding out about it you see hes got some kind of mechanical setup that any time you see its very dangerous the little fish gets bit in water that has yellow stones on the bottom so of course when he sees yellow stones on the bottom why he must have mechanism now which tells him to get the hell out of there because hes in danger and he just does this automatically and he quote doesnt like yellow stones dont you see unquote so he never goes near yellow stones and this keeps him out of ever being bitten in water where there are yellow stones and then of course he starts to go kind of daffy because the next time he gets eaten up he gets eaten up in water that has blue stones you cant win see thatd be his motto after while do you follow this rationale of how all of this comes about exactly what occurs when pc finds out something in session from the auditor which existed before he discovered it now lets look at mechanism of what could happen in something of that order the pc is sitting there interiorized into his bank all right thats all very well hes sitting there interiorized in his bank and hes going along and hes looking at it and so forth and then all of sudden the auditor reaches over and diddles with the emeter cans and says well the meter is out so we have to stop the session this happens more times than youd think well the pc is given the datum that the meter was out and he didnt know it so there wasnt session when he thought there was one and this has possibly been going on for little while see and the little while that this had been going on of course is an unknown area so thats what pins him in the session not his consequent overt so much as what was unknown got the idea now hes finding out about his case and hes going along fine about his case and he thinks the auditor is satisfied and all of sudden the auditor stops the process the pc thought he was doing all right the auditor didnt think he was doing all right so youve got an unknown thats cometorealize more than surprise but its cometo realize that an unknown has existed an unknown has existed and those are the damaging points of the line theyre not complicated otherwise see this of course surprise is based on change and sudden change is the anatomy of all surprise and so forth but were interested in the more the living phenomena connected with the change the unpredicted character of it what do we mean by unpredicted we mean not known its the not known character of it that is the sticker and thats what sticks them in surprise its not the fact that change occurred that sticks them in surprise its they didnt know it and you better learn that one well as an auditor you can change process fifteen times an hour on pc without damaging him but you can suddenly change process on some consideration he doesnt know about once in two hours and arc break him across the boards see the unknownness he thought he was doing all right all of sudden he isnt doing all right or something like that dont you see he thought he was going to run this thing flat and the auditor isnt going to give him chance the auditor has been sitting there possibly with some critical thought because the pc will add up and put supposed knowingness and all sorts of things in the way and therefore he gets accusative of the auditor hell try to solve this problem whats he trying to do what are all these accusations against the auditor theyre just efforts to solve the unknownness which existed before the fact of change what the hell was all this about before the change occurred you see hes left in zone and area of noncomprehension all right thats very messed up that can get very messed up in session that can go blooeyblooeyblooey do you see what the exact mechanism of it is there all right then you could do auditing along in this style of you could advise the pc well in advance of what you were going to do and what you intended to do and if you did this in way so as not to yank his attention too violently off of what he was doing well itd be fine so your onetwothree would be something on the order of find out what he is doing and then advise him what you are going to do you say well what are you doing what are you looking at what is it thats perfectly all right you can ask him all kinds of questions that you possibly care to along this line what is it what are you doing how is it going how did you answer the question what did it apply to did any picture come up is picture there have you seen any pictures for little while any type of questioning like this of course is directly putting him insession isnt it all right now if we only do this just before we throw in the bridge and end the process this becomes signal that he didnt know the process was going to end at this moment so you ask him how hes doing this can get this silly you ask him how hes doing and hell tell you that he didnt know you were going to end the process he gets upset because he didnt know you were going to end the process see so if pc is getting into that state of thing auditor patter can move over onto this as cure of the notknowingness of the pc and you can say well im not going to end the process just now but how are you doing and what are you looking at you get the difference oh the pcll say well thats all right you know now i want to find out what youre doing because its getting toward end of session i just want to find out what youre doing so that we can get this patched up okay before we end the process why thats okay with the pc too dont you see see that cures his notknowingness all right now you can ask him how hes doing before you tell him to do something and hell be fine but if you start suddenly on an auditing command this isnt ne this doesnt get people into much trouble you start suddenly on an auditing command without telling him youre going to do so or clearing it he will normally go ahead and run the auditing command that is not very fruitful source of trouble about it but if the auditing command doesnt work after you have done that of course he thinks you are impetuous or rash see so this is just one other way that youre denying him auditing now pc is only one kind of victim theres only one victim only one victim complex in pc hes victim of auditing thats the only victim complex hes got matter how many victim complexes show up on his case or motivators or anything else these things are minimal whats important is that hes the victim of auditing and because out of that becomes all your auditing difficulties and were talking about auditing difficulties in this lecture see so its just that one thing its auditing see youre making victim out of him all right now this reads to him on this basis that an unknown exists that he doesnt know about in the session thats why you have to keep the rfactor up pcs know they can sense these things you see and unless you keep them genned in and keep the rfactor in and keep the knowingness factor in and so forth while youre auditing you get into all kinds of trouble thats very mysterious to you and you say what in the name of god is happening i mean what is wrong with my auditing well your auditing might be practically flawless except itd omit these points itd omit the basic point of denying him knowingness see so your auditing becomes an unknown and thats why youve got to keep an rfactor in youre tired you dont want to audit him in very short period of time hes going to find this out and of course that makes new surprise because the mechanics of surprise are there matter how gently the news broke see so breaking the news gently to hell with that just make sure that when an unknowingness is about to occur to the pc you turn it into known as far as youre concerned as an auditor from your viewpoint as an auditor as far as the session mechanics are concerned warn him keep him aware of whats going on got the idea what you are going to do now of course you can err perhaps in being too verbose about telling him what you are going to do but that error is not serious it just consumes little time the error is in trying to make time in an auditing session by omitting this that is the error which causes your arc breaks and upsets omit this why do you say now i am going to audit you see why do you say such things as that except to gen him in now this is the process were going to run well whether you have his agreement or not for gods sakes give him the knowingness now you can audit pc without his agreement but you cant audit him without his knowingness so move your importance from agreement over to knowingness and youll start running awfully smooth sessions get smart at this get real smart at this right at the beginning of session give him whole timetable of the session then keep it tell him what youre going to do step by step keep him genned in as to whats happening now hell relax about the environment because his main difficulty is he thinks the environment is full of unknowns well dont make the auditing session another unknown to him give him the gen give him the gen now arc breaks clear up most rapidly on notknow processes these are killers and you want an arc break process that works man that is one of them but remember that notknow process run in that wise is always run past tense dont ever run it present tense run it past tense what wasnt known you see in this session what wasnt known about what i was doing what didnt i know about what you were doing didnt i you see past tense not what dont i know about what youre doing always past tense always past tense because thats the element of surprise thats where the track is collapsed its that an unknown existed which he found out about and its the findoutabout point that you are hitting now in auditing and that is not the damaging point when you try to clear an arc break youre trying to clear all these findoutabout points the known points and they are not the difficulty in the session the difficulty in the session is the period which preceded it so he is thinking of this notknown always in past tense this doesnt apply to security checking or anything like that i mean youre not interested in were just talking about sessions doesnt matter what tense as this doesnt influence the use of notknow elsewhere you use those past tense or present tense or the other ways you know any way that its supposed to add up im just talking about patching up arc breaks and keeping session running so you keep the knowingness in and keep it in good and heavy and you keep in at the same time fairly predictable activity well that gives it of course model session youre asking in certain order and youre asking in certain ways on the basic bones of session and this is predictable to the pc so an auditing session becomes known to the pc and every time you jump this in any way the pc is liable to object but it is possible to jump it providing you genned him in enough you just gen him in you dont even have to have his agreement just gen him in dont be so propitiative just tell him you know you say im sitting here thinking of doing something else with this particular thing were doing how is it going to you how is it doing well its not doing badly its doing fine im right in the middle of this engram here well do you think theres anything we could do to make it go little faster yeah there possibly is because i sure stuck up here well what are you doing right now well soandso and soandso all right im going to vary the auditing command soandso and soand so and its going to be soandso and soandso now do you think that would get anyplace with it oh yes i think it would well apparently youre seeking his agreement actually youre filling him in see the difference hell never arc break on you on something like that hed know its not that hed agree or not agree its that hed know do you follow that all right now if unknown is that vital in session and if unknown plays this enormous part in the existence of thetan dont you suppose that an unknownness about the constituency size shape general characteristic name rank and serial number of his bank doesnt register on the pc with exclamation points man dont it it really does if you dont know about banks if you dont know about engrams if you dont know about secondaries if you dont know about ridges and you dont know about the time track and youve never collided with any of these things youd carefully skirted that volcano of course youre auditing from what pedestal from the same pedestal that the north declared war on the south youre auditing in the grand vast deserts of the unknown and of course it registers straight across to the pc that you dont know your business and of course after that youll have nothing but trouble with pcs interesting huh so if you dont bother to ask pertinent questions that make sense to the pc and if your questions dont make sense to the pc of course the pc doesnt think you know what youre doing and your ability to control and command session is directly proportional to your familiarity and knowingness on the parts of the human mind directly proportional ah youve long muttered and thought about this of how come i could audit pcs that you might have trouble auditing or how do i get results faster than you do it is basically just that its right on that basis i very often leave pc gasping as to how i found out that this was about to occur well thats an all right kind of unknown thats perfectly all right to him because he now knows something else he knows hes in safe hands even though he doesnt know that there is an arquebus pointed straight at his midriff around the corner why obviously the auditor already knows that the arquebuseer is standing there i even demonstrate this to fellow every now and then i move him up few more minutes i can realize that he just isnt going to go near the part of that engram at all he isnt going to go near that part of the track that there is something there and he is not even approaching it and i keep saying well is there something else there you know which direction is it and so forth yeah well he says i am looking to the left and i say well why dont you look to the right why dont you just look over to the right and of course he gets it straight in the midriff and hes going to say to himself how the hell did he know that arquebuseer was standing over to the right well of course i might or might not have known that the arquebuseer was standing over to the right but i sure know that if hes going to look over to the right hes going to find out more about the engram and how do i know this well because hes looking to the left and it gives you strange aura of omniscience to the pc he feels that you must see all know all well lets give him reverse look lets give him reverse look hes looking at an engram and hes about to get his head chopped off on chopping block and there he is and this is all very grim and so forth and you say well now how about that lock there that youre looking at and so on and so on uh uh look around the room and lets see if you can have something instantly and immediately he thinks youre the most stupid character he ever ran into in his life so therefore the unknownness is resident in the auditor isnt it you didnt ask the right question get familiar with the mind and make the session familiar to the pc and youll be bearcat of an auditor thank you
