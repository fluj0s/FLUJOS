because it is potentially unreliable over time this report provides background information on how the existing trust fund based aviation finance system operates discusses several basic issues concerning aviation taxation and identifies faa programmatic spending from that point on the report focuses on three major issues related to the trust fund first is the question of whether the trust fund will provide sufficient revenue to meet the growing needs of the faas activities and programs second is the controversial issue of how much of the faas total funding should come from the treasurys general fund account the socalled public interest contribution and third is the long standing issue of whether the existing tax and fee system is the appropriate mechanism for producing trust fund revenues or whether an entirely new revenue collection mechanism should be adopted the faa remains firmly convinced of the need to create new aviation funding system with corresponding faa budgetary and administrative changes on february 14 2007 the faa released legislative proposal encompassing this view hr 1356s 1076 introduced by request consideration of reauthorization proposals by

trust fundbased system is adequate for the foreseeable future many of these same groups would even argue that overall federal spending on certain federal aviation programs could be increased in new authorization legislation without new funding mechanism there is also third view which suggests that the current financing system needs to be reexamined because it is potentially unreliable eg events such as september 11 and recessions can have major and unpredictable impact on annual tax and fee collections hence in this view the existing system might not be able to provide the long term consistent source of annual revenues that would allow for the orderly funding of ngats and other faa programs the primary focus of this report is discussion of aviation taxes and fees as they relate to the funding of the principal federal aviation activities overseen and operated by the faa these taxes and fees are frequently referred to as user fees as will be discussed they are not viewed as true user fees in the economic sense and may more appropriately be thought of as proxies for user fees further as will be pointed out there are wide range of federal taxes and fees imposed on aviation system users almost all of which are statutorily linked to federal activities related to aviation but not all of which go to toward funding the faa and its programs 1 this report deals only with the financial aspects of the reauthorization debate for full description of major reauthorization issues see crs report rl33920 federal aviation administration reauthorization an overview of selected provisions in proposed legislation coordinated by bart elias crs2 the aviation tax and fee structure faarelated taxes and fees the debate about how the faa should be funded largely revolves around the concept of user fees there are number of variations as to how user fee is defined useful definition of user fee from transportation perspective was provided in 1953 by the department of commerce office of transportation and is still valid for todays discussion user charge is defined as any charge made to beneficiaries or users of services and facilities directly related to transportation and furnished in whole or in part by the federal government such charge must be paid for use of such service or facility and shall be fixed to recover part or all of the capital operating and maintenance costs of such service or facility the services shall not include cash subsidies mortgageaid or taxaid or certain other activities not confined to transportation or involving transportation only incidentally2 for aviation most of the interest in user fees has been in recovering the costs associated with industry use of the national air navigation system air traffic control atc system user fees can be direct sometimes referred to as payforuse or payforservice whereby an aircraft or operator is charged for specific activity examples of direct charges include radio contacts with atc enroute centers contacts with airport towers and weightdistance charges of the type levied frequently outside the united states the weight of the aircraft multiplied by the distance flown the other type of user fee that can be levied is an indirect fee examples include fuel taxes aircraft registration fees and gross revenue taxes indirect fees and charges are often viewed by economists as proxies for user fees rather than as actual user fees they are normally viewed as imperfect in that the fee charged is often more poorly correlated to the service provided than direct fee would be common example is the existing airline passenger tax where airline passengers flying on the same aircraft are charged fees based on the often very different fares that they paid even though all are using exactly the same amount of airway resources for number of reasons indirect fees are the dominant type of fee in use in the us aviation system today prior to 1970 there were federally imposed charges for use of the federally operated atc system this is not to say that there were federal taxes imposed on aviation there was tax on gasoline and there was transportation passenger ticket tax imposed on airline passengers among others at that time however these taxes were deposited in the general fund of the us treasury where they were available to pay for any government activity and were not designated as offsets to federal aviation activities 2 us department of commerce office of transportation charges for private use of federallyprovided transportation services and facilities staff

various years air transport association does not include 01 cent per gallon leaking underground storage tank lust fee deposited in lust trust fund crs4 by 1970 the concept of user fee based system to pay for federal aviation activities had been discussed for over two decades during that period the federal government considered host of direct and indirect fees and taxes that might be used to pay for aviation services but the congresses and presidential administrations of the period had been unable to reach consensus on any specific approach it was only in the near crisis atmosphere of the late 1960s3 that industry and government were able to coalesce around particular mix of indirect user fees as way to fund needed aviation system improvements on may 21 1970 president nixon signed the airport and airway development and revenue acts of 1970 pl 91258 1970 act which was the origin of the trust fund financing system still in place today the fee system consisted of an 8 airline ticket tax 5 freightcargo waybill tax 3 international departure tax also applied to alaska and hawaii 7 cent per gallon tax on noncommercial primarily general aviation ga aircraft use of gasoline and jet fuel and finally graduated aircraft registration fee starting at 25 per aircraft plus an additional fee of 2 cents per pound on piston powered aircraft of 2500 pounds or more and plus an additional fee of 35 cents per pound on all turbine powered aircraft above 2500 pounds for each pound in excess of 2500 pounds all of the revenues collected from these sources were deposited in newly created airport and airway trust fund also known as the aviation trust fund the 1970 act also transferred revenues from an existing excise tax on tires and inner tubes into the trust fund three and half decades later the same basic framework of taxes and fees with the deletion of the aircraft registration fee and the addition of segment fee an international arrivals tax and frequent flyer tax which can be viewed as an extension of the ticket tax remain the principal sources of income for the trust fund the tax and fee structure and the rates charged however have been modified on several occasions most notably of late by the taxpayers relief act of 1997 pl 10534 which provided the taxing authority that expired at the end of fy2007 table 1 details the tax and fee structure as it exists at the beginning of 2007 nonfaa federal taxes and fees there are other dedicated aviation related fees that are also enumerated in table 1 such as immigration customs and agricultural inspection fees each of these fees predate the aviation trust fund structure imposed in the 1970 act and while dedicated to an aviation related activity they are deposited directly into the us treasurys general funds account4 more recently added are the passenger security fee also known as the september 11th fee and the airline security fee which are direct 3 the late 1960s were notable for wellpublicized delays in airline travel that often resulted in large numbers of aircraft being placed in holding patterns above major us cities these delays and other incidents focused public opinion on the need for the federal government to make significant improvements to the airport and airway system 4 there are few additional federal activities that are viewed by some as having an aviation related purpose that have separate tax and fee structure associated with them and are not discussed in this report for example aeronautical research provided by nasa is funded entirely by us treasury general funds crs5 outgrowths of the events of september 11 2001 these fees imposed on airline passengers and airlines respectively offset to some degree spending by the transportation security administration tsa on its aviation security activities collection of these fees began in 2002 few of the fees discussed here have broad application that goes well beyond aviation the customs border protection service immigration customs enforcement and the animal and plant health inspection service aphis all provide extensive services related to other modes of transportation some of the immigration customs and agricultural related fees unlike the others discussed here are statutorily linked to the cost of providing inspections services that is the fee is modified periodically to provide the agency performing the service with supposed full cost recovery passenger facility charges pfcs the passenger facility charge pfc is collected from airline passengers based on their travel to and from specific airports but it is not actually federal tax rather it is local tax requiring federal approval pfcs were first allowed in 1990 and the original rate of taxation has been modified since because pfcs accrue directly to the levying airport and not to the trust fund they are not discussed in detail in this report5 it should be noted however that pfcs will be part of the faa reauthorization debate airport interests are seeking an increase in the existing 450 per airport departure level although specific level for that increase has not yet been identified depending upon how this proposal is ultimately framed it may be opposed by the airlines who often view any pfc increase as having negative consequences for their fare setting ability who pays the tax with couple of notable exceptions the taxes and fees discussed above are collected by airlines as part of the airline ticket the taxes however are statutorily imposed on the airline passenger not on the airline itself this does not mean that the effects of the tax are borne entirely by the passenger airlines must for example address how much of the tax can be passed on to the consumer in terms of higher fares without negatively depressing traffic although fees as discussed above have an impact on airline travel those fees imposed prior to september 11 probably did not create significant barrier to travel since september 11 however it is argued that the new security fees along with other factors such as securityrelated hassles and delays may be having some impact on travel to the extent that travelers costs are raised and not all costs are directly measurable in dollar terms there is always the possibility of the consumer seeking alternate means of making trip or perhaps foregoing trip altogether for example there is considerable evidence that heightened security since september 11 and its associated hassle factor have reduced short distance flying in markets where driving is viewed as viable alternative the key is what constitutes an acceptable cost not measured strictly in monetary terms from the consumers standpoint 5 see crs report rl33891 airport improvement program issues for congress by robert s kirk crs6 airlines in most cases are collection agents for these fees in many instances an airline bills the passenger for the fee at the time ticket is sold at some specified interval the airlines are required to turn the proceeds over to the us treasury for deposit in the appropriate account during the period between ticket sale and distribution to the treasury airlines are typically allowed to hold these funds in appropriate financial instruments and retain any interest payments made on these instruments by way of example the aphis program requires quarterly payments but the rules are written in such way that an airline could retain some of these fees and earn interest on them for up to four months the ability to retain interest has always been viewed as way to offset an airlines costs of collection the amount of interest that an airline might receive in this manner was not inconsequential during periods of high interest rates at the present time however low interest rates have greatly reduced the attractiveness of using this funding mechanism as way to offset the costs of collection incurred by the airline from the airline industry perspective of the fees shown in table 1 four are directly paid by the airlines the first and smallest in dollar terms is the aphis aircraft inspection fee on aircraft arriving from outside the united states the second fee is 44 cent per gallon tax on jet fuel used by the airline industry of this amount 43 cents is deposited in the airport and airway trust fund with the remaining 01 cent placed in the nonaviation related leaking underground storage tank lust trust fund the third fee is the overflight fee which is normally levied on nonus airlines that are transiting united states airspace this fee is designed to offset the cost of air traffic control services provided to these air carriers during transit although the funds collected are used to fund portion of the essential air services program the last direct fee is the aviation security infrastructure fee asif imposed on the airlines as result of the aviation and transportation security act atsapl 10771 enacted on november 16 2001 the annual fee is limited to the amount that the industry spent to provide security in calendar year 2000 it is worth noting that an effect of establishing this fee was the elimination of the industrys potential future direct costs for increased security because it transfers the security responsibility to the transportation security administration tsa faa major program funding the faa receives the majority of its funding from receipts to the aviation trust fund it also receives an annual appropriation of treasury general funds to pay for the remainder of its activities the trust fund pays for all of the faas airport improvement program aip facilities and equipment fe program and research engineering and development red program it also pays for much of the faas operations and maintenance om program which also receives general funds as can be seen in table 2 annual appropriations for the aip program roughly followed the amounts authorized in the last two faa reauthorization acts air21 pl 106181 and vision 100 pl 108176 but appropriations for the other three programs have not funding for fe tracked the authorization through fy2004 but has since been significantly below the authorized amount annual red appropriations have been well below their authorized levels in each year om appropriations have been higher than the amounts authorized in two years below in crs7 the other four but in only one instance fy2003 did the program fail to grow on yearoveryear basis there are many in the aviation industry and also within the faa who believe that significantly greater funding will be required in the years ahead for each of the four major faa programs these requests come against the backdrop of three years of faa spending in which annual appropriations for the agency increased on fairly modest basis table 2 faa major program funding air21 and vision 100 fy2001fy2006 in millions fy2001 fy2002 fy2003 fy2004 fy2005 fy2006 fy2007 aip tf authorized 3200 3300 3400 3400 3500 3600 3700 oblimit 3193

tf aviation trust fund gf treasury general funds airport and airway trust fund issues the reauthorization debate is likely to focus on three major issues related to the trust fund first is the question of whether the trust fund will provide sufficient revenue to meet the growing needs of the faas activities and programs second is the controversial issue of how much of the faas total funding should come from treasury general funds the socalled public interest contribution major element of which is faas computation of the costallocation amongst aviation user groups and third is the long standing issue of whether the existing tax and fee system is the appropriate mechanism for producing trust fund revenues or whether an entirely new revenue collection mechanism should be adopted crs8 trust fund revenue adequacy there is considerable discussion over the question of whether the existing trust fund revenue stream will be able to provide adequate funding in the years ahead table 3 shows that total trust fund income began rising after fy1999 following the last major reauthorization of trust fund directed taxes and fees by the taxpayers relief act of 1997 pl 10534 it then declined somewhat in fy2000 and dropped precipitously after september 11 2001 as result primarily but not exclusively of the postseptember 11 drop in airline activity the revenue stream did not exceed the fy2001 level again until fy2005 and did not exceed the record fy1999 level until fy2006 which it did just barely throughout this period faa spending has not been reduced to accommodate the trust funds reduced income stream rather faa spending has continued apace mostly by spending down the uncommitted balance of the trust fund which stood at over 73 billion at the end of fy2001 and which was down to around 17 billion by the end of fy2006 when the faa began discussing reauthorization in 2005 the future of the aviation trust fund was listed as key item for consideration6 the faa contends that something needs to be done to either increase the trust fund income stream andor replace it with new funding mechanism all with the goal of preventing even further erosion in the uncommitted balance of the fund for number of reasons detailed at its reauthorization website7 the faa sees little prospect of major increase in revenue from the trust funds existing tax and fee system instead the faa seeks reexamination of the tax and fee system with an eye toward new system that more closely tracks actual aviation industry activity than the current system and that in the process ensures that the trust fund will receive adequate revenues to finance future faa aviation system needs faa funding needs largely unanswered and perhaps unanswerable question at least for the moment is exactly how much additional funding the faa needs in the years ahead certainly the ngats proposal is expensive crs estimates that total fe spending including ngats will require between 69 billion and 76 billion by 20258 but as is pointed out in the discussion accompanying these estimates there are wide range of variables that could further affect these numbers for example these estimates cannot account for potential efficiency gains engendered by ngats technology that might reduce the overall cost of operating the faa at the same time these estimates cannot account for additional costs that might be added by missed deadlines technology problems and cost overruns all of which were conditions that plagued faa modernization efforts throughout the 1980s the 1990s and into the current century

the years ahead it can be assumed that these costs will increase by at least the cost of inflation as they are shown in the crs report mentioned in the previous paragraph historically however events such as major airline crashes terrorism etc have often required additional resource needs for the agency that cannot be easily forecast trust fund revenue estimates the faa position is that the trust fund will not be able to provide adequate longterm agency funding this position is supported by treasury estimates made in the summer of 2006 which suggest that annual revenue increases to the trust fund in the years ahead will be modest at best9 treasurys summer forecast was that the annual increase in trust fund revenue for fy2007 would be 766 million with total receipts for the year amounting to 116 billion increases in future years would be between 710 million and 816 million annually according to treasury projections this leaves the trust fund with total annual revenues of 147 billion in fy2011 according to the faa these increases may be insufficient to fund the faas already identified needs for ngats and other ongoing air navigation program upgrades as well as for expected increases in other necessary faa program activities in the presidents budget submission for fy2008 it appears that treasury has increased its yearoveryear revenue estimate for fy2007 to approximately 937 million over the fy2006 level with further increase of 492 million in fy2008 which is below the annual rate of increase predicted in the summer of 200610 in both fy2007 and fy2008 the budget submission assumes that faa spending will continue to exceed total income in each year11 the budget does not provide any estimates for the period beyond fy2008 an estimate produced by the congressional budget office cbo in september 2006 appears to some to be somewhat more positive about the future of the trust funds finances longterm12 cbos estimate expected that the annual trust fund revenue stream would increase at slightly higher rate than inflation and that the trust fund assuming faa spending only increases at the rate of inflation would have an uncommitted balance of 43

traffic control system statement of donald b marron acting director house committee on transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on aviation september 27 2006 crs12 billion in 2016 in the cbo analysis the trust fund can support about 19 billion in additional spending over baseline levels the 2006 funding level growing with inflation provided that most of that spending occurs after 201013 it should be pointed out that this positive outcome is highly dependant on stable general fund contribution situation that has not always been the case as will be discussed in the next section of this report and on relatively stable growth in inflation and concomitant increase in faa spending subsequent data provided by cbo that assumes general fund contribution in line with the provisions of vision100 results in significantly lower uncommitted balance in the trust fund over the same period in this scenario the uncommitted balance decreases slightly each year from the current level none the less remaining slightly positive through the next decade further estimate produced by the aircraft owners and pilots association aopa predicts that the trust fund will have an adequate revenue stream well into the future14 unlike the faa view aopa and others sharing their perspective believe that rising airline fares and airline activity increased income from fuel taxes and cost reductions from air traffic control atc modernization will be sufficient to result in an unexpended trust fund balance of over 4 billion by fy2011 with the possibility that the balance could be considerably higher there is still another view which suggests that the trajectory of the future revenue stream into the trust fund cannot be predicted with any accuracy thereby making claims about the trust funds future health or lack thereof mostly matter of conjecture at this point an analysis prepared by the airports council international north america acina suggests that there are wide range of possible revenue and spending scenarios for the trust fund in the years ahead some positive many others negative15 from the acina perspective it is this uncertainty that justifies renewed look at the trust fund revenue structure acina however has not aligned itself with specific proposal on how to fund the faa in the future the general fund share and the public interest defining the public interest in the discussion about aviation user fees the term public interest has had multiplicity of meanings over the last six decades in the current context of federal aviation policy the public interest is usually viewed as being synonymous with the general fund contribution 13 ibid p 6 14 httpwwwaopaorgwhatsnewlauserfeeshtml 15 chambers charles r airports council international giving airports the tools to increase capacity presentation at the 86th transportation research board annual meeting washington dc january 22 2007 crs13 much of the public interest debate stems from the economic concept of public good16 some elements of the aviation industry especially general aviation long claimed that the airways system was pure public good and should therefore be paid for exclusively by government public good is normally viewed as something that cannot be produced efficiently in the marketplace the classic example of public good is defense which is normally viewed as something that only government can adequately provide defining public good however is not as simple as the defense example would make it sound whole sections of economics text books are dedicated to the understanding of what constitutes public good what these text book definitions suggest is that product can be public good if it meets several tests the two most important are nonexclusivity and nonrivalry nonexclusivity refers to the fact that one cannot be excluded from benefitting from the good whether one pays for it directly or not nonrival good is one where there are marginal costs associated with producing an additional unit of whatever the good happens to be good that could meet both of these tests without any caveats could be viewed as pure public good good that cant meet this test for any variety of reasons but still might be provided exclusively by government is an imperfect public good the majority of economists who have written on this subject appear to view air traffic control as an activity that aligns best with the definition of an imperfect public good throughout the 1940s 1950s and 1960s many aviation interest groups regarded provision of airways services as public good and did not believe they should be charged for system use as late as 1969 in hearings before the house committee on ways and means the aircraft owners and pilots association aopa was suggesting in relation to the airways system that government programs adopted in the public interest and imposed by law should be paid for by the public therefore such programs should be financed by general taxation not selective taxation disguised as user fees as applied to airway airport and aviation services and facilities provided by government these principles mean that aopa is opposed to financing them through user charges these facilities and services were established in the public interest aopa believes they are still in the public interest17 aopas position could be said to have defined one end of the spectrum in its opposition to user fees an aopa comment during the same hearing that the air 16 the discussion here presents an extremely simplified view of public good for further information see walter nicholson intermediate microeconomics and its application fort worth texas dryden press 1999 p 531 or joseph stiglitz economics of the public sector new york ww norton co 1986 p 599 the information in this section largely derives from these two texts 17 us congress house committee on ways and means administrations proposal on aviation user charges hearings 91st congress 1st session september 1619 1969 us govt printing office washington 1969 p 110 crs14 was provided by nature at cost to anyone left little doubt as to their dislike of user fees18 the 1970 act would in the end reject the position held by aopa instead more orless adopting the view that the public interest was not necessarily the same as public good the framers of the legislation ended up agreeing with the authors of the various faa and predecessor agency reports that the public interest equated to the use of the system by the military and other government aircraft with some accommodation for the value of the system to the public in general whether they flew or not19 it should be pointed out that in the current debate about reauthorization there are longer any groups calling for complete federal funding ie 100 of funding from the treasurys general fund of the system as many did well into the 1970s the general fund share since the existing tax and fee structure was created in 1970 there has been general acceptance of the aforementioned concept that there is public interest component to the operation of the national aviation system from the perspective of federal aviation policy the public interest generally refers specifically to that portion of the cost of the faas operation of the airway system that is appropriated from the treasurys general fund this is the amount that is supposed to equate to what the military government and nonuser beneficiaries also known as societal users of the aviation system might have contributed to the aviation trust fund through the payment of user fees if they actually paid these fees this has been one of the most contentious elements of the aviation funding debate and is likely to remain so in the year ahead in sum many aviation interest groups and congressional authorizing committees believe that the federal general fund contribution to the faas annual appropriation is too small to correspond to the existing and potential military and other public benefits of the airways system conversely the faa omb and other government agencies as well as congressional appropriations and budget committees usually believe the general fund contribution is too large the authors of the 1970 act envisioned that the trust fund would primarily support faa capital programs although there are some who contend that the trust fund was intended only for capital programs several studies have suggested that this was not the case and that the 1970 act allowed trust fund revenues to be spent for noncapital mostly operations and maintenance activities20 since president nixon unsuccessfully sought to fund all faa activities out of the trust fund in the early 1970s tension has existed between those who seek to maximize use of the trust 18 ibid p 125 19 an example of the type of aviation service that provides value to the public in general would be regional air ambulanceevacuation system 20 us congressional budget office

general fund contribution to overall faa appropriations has varied over the last decade ranging from low of 0 in fy2000 to high of 38 in fy1998 and fy1999 in the most recent five year period however the general fund share has averaged around 20 the general fund contribution permeates every aspect of the overall trust fund discussion cbos work for example indicates that stable trust fund contribution in line with the recent annual rate goes long ways toward insuring the health of the trust fund longterm in and of itself interest groups have long sought relatively high and relatively stable annual contribution to the faas budget the figure of 25 is often discussed as target in these discussions but these proposals are best viewed as informal the faa dot and omb have often sought to minimize the trust fund contribution believing as mentioned above that user fees should be the primary source of funding for the faa and that general fund contributions should be limited to the amount comparable to the public use as determined by stringent cost allocation determinations cost allocation the concept of costallocation among system users and nonusers is sometimes contentious element of the discussion of federal aviation user fees especially as it regards the general fund contribution the 1970 act required new cost allocation study that was expected to be much more comprehensive than those done prior to that date this study was supposed to settle many of the unresolved questions at that time about which group should actually pay for which portion of the systems costs the report completed in 1973 achieved few of these goals and instead became target for criticism especially by the ga community the 1973 report suggested that the militarypublic share of system costs was somewhere between 196 and 321 of total system costs21 further the 1973 report created additional controversy by suggesting that share of faa expenditures should be allocated to nonusers of the aviation system22 the principal result of the unhappiness with the 1973 report was call for new one the faa completed new study in 1978 using somewhat different methodology that indicated that the nonuser public interest share of system costs was 264 with the militarygovernment share put at 10123 these findings played an important role in the discussion of what the general fund contribution should be in the run up to reauthorization of the faa that was slated for 1980 but instead took place two years later 21 eastman samuel ewer general aviation and the airport and airway system an analysis of cost allocation and recovery transportation research record 840 washington transportation research board 1982 p 28 22 ibid p 27 23 societal user element was part of the public interest component in the 1978 and 1986 reports but has not been stated in any of the three cost allocation efforts completed since crs16 since 1978 there have been several additional cost allocation studies performed either by the faa or at the faas behest using outside contractors the findings of these studies were not as controversial as those of the 1970s in part this was because congress never chose to specifically link tax and fee rates to the cost allocation results even when the faa and others suggested that it should the cost allocation findings for all of the major studies since the 1970 act are included in table 4 the corporatebusiness aircraft question like the public interest allocation the ga allocation has also been controversial in this instance however the concern has not so much been with the overall ga user group allocation but rather that the definition of general aviation is so broad that it encompasses wide range of users who operate very differently within the atc system of particular concern has been that subclass of ga that operates in the same part of the atc system as the commercial air carriers primarily turbine jet powered aircraft critics of the cost allocation process have often suggested that ga be broken into user subclasses that are better matched to how they use the atc system and in turn their proportional impact on the system in part this is because some observers believe that the existing tax and fee system is not charging high performance ga users of the atc system fees that are commensurate with their use of the system ga proponents however have argued that they are operating in system designed for the air carriers that they would not otherwise need and that they are incidental system users therefore they reject the idea that their activities should be taxed at different ie higher rate table 4 principal faa cost allocation reports allocation of aviation activity by user group by report year in percent 1973 1978 1986 1992 1997

between the costs incurred by the ato for supplying air traffic services and newly proposed user fee system intended to pay for those services the provisions of the faas reauthorization proposal will be discussed later in this report faa believes that the argument for this link is on much firmer actuarial grounds than its previous attempts to link agency costs to taxes and fees this is due to its relatively new cost allocation system cas which for the first time is providing detailed cost information down to the socalled service delivery point sdp24 other improved data sources are also viewed as contributing to an improved cost allocation study finally the faa believes that with its new cost allocation methodology called camera it has created mechanism that can be used repeatedly over time with significant confidence to adjust the user and other fees it is proposing in response to changing industry use patterns the faa believes that costs should be allocated as shown in the table 4 above as can be seen the results differ significantly from those obtained in previous years the faa argues that the new results accurately reflect the industrys current use structure whereas earlier studies done using different methodologies and financial starting points are not directly comparable to the new results the 2007 report differs from previous reports in several aspects the primary change is that it concerns itself primarily with allocating costs associated with its air traffic organization ato activities which it does on fully allocated basis25 some previous reports used total agency obligations and other starting points thereby attempting to allocate costs amongst all faa activities airports research safety and security etc another important change is the assignment of users into two principal groups high performance group all turbine jet powered aircraft and piston aircraft group all piston powered aircraft and helicopters regardless of power source by this action the faa is attempting to better stratify general aviation system users the new cost allocation system suggests that high performance ga turbine aircraft use 97 of system capacity while other ga users should be allocated 59 the faa funding debate in 2005 the faa announced that it was beginning detailed examination of how the agency was funded and whether there could be more appropriate funding mechanism key element of that examination is the issue of whether the existing indirect system of taxation should be replaced by direct charges for specific air navigation services it became clear in 2006 that the faa would seek new revenue system when faa administrator marion blakey remarked that using the existing 24 major complaint about previous cost allocation efforts has been that the faa could not actually provide detailed information about what it cost to operate each of its facilities in real terms the new cas has been created in part in response to demonstrated congressional concerns 25 related faa administrative and overhead costs appear to be included in the allocation process crs18 ticket tax mechanism was system that might as well be tied to the price of milk26 although the elements of the faa plan were still unknown in their totality at that point enough had been surmised that aviation interest groups began actively supporting or opposing various potential elements of direct user fee system aviation interest group perspectives while the faa continued its studies aviation interest groups launched their own preemptive strikes for and against feeforservice system of financing the airline industry through the air transport association ata struck first making its own proposal for new financing system in early march 200627 atas socalled smartskies proposal would be based on direct charges for departures and flight duration that would apply to all aircraft regardless of size or type of use the exception in the ata proposal was that pistonpowered general aviation aircraft would continue to pay only fuel tax by its own estimates the ata proposal could shift an estimated 2 billion of system costs to certain ga sector users primarily corporate aircraft which the ata believes currently underpay for their use of the atc system28 the ata proposal goes beyond just fee structure changes and suggests that the faas air traffic organization become an autonomous part of the agency with the ability to operate without the need for direct congressional appropriations instead the fees collected from aviation system users which would still be deposited in the aviation trust fund would be immediately available to the ato one final feature of the proposal would give the ato the authority to issue bonds for infrastructure improvements backed by expected future fee collections on the same day that the ata made its proposal group of garelated interest groups released statement suggesting that the airlines plan for improving the air transportation system is for them to pay less and control more29 from the ga perspective the ata case that certain ga users underpay for their use of the atc system is incorrect for number of reasons the ga contention is that the current structure of the atc system was primarily created to support commercial airline use and that they are not putting significant additional burden on the atc system as result of their flying activities from the ga perspective fuel taxes remain the most appropriate type of user fee and the atas proposal to remove the atos activities from the regular congressional appropriations process is viewed as undesirable public policy the above discussion is simplification of the very complex and contentious issue about who pays and who should pay for faa aviation services that goes back for at least six decades it should be noted that the discussion of aviation user fees has been almost exclusively conversation between the federal government and aviation industry for example the views of the largest group of current contributors 26 wald matthew w faa seeks new source of revenue in user fees the new york times march 7 2006 p a18 27 bond david fire when

part of the reauthorization debate legislative proposals and options this section discusses the financerelated provisions of the legislative proposal put forth by the faa hereafter referred to as the faa proposal then looks at the comparable provisions of legislation reported by the house hr 2881 and by the senate authorizing and finance committees s 1300 and s 2345 at the time of this update the senate has not yet scheduled floor time for consideration of its reauthorization legislation the faa proposal hr 1356s 107630 in hr 1356s 1076 the next generation air transportation system financing reform act of 2007 the faa proposes the most significant change in aviation finance since the federal program was created by the 1970 act31 the faa proposal provides for three year authorization period fy2008 fy2010 during which the faa would transition from its existing trust fundgeneral fund based financing system to system based on new direct fees and existing excise taxes as well as general fund monies although the trust fund would be continued its overall role in funding the agency is significantly reduced the proposal uses mix of direct fees referred to as user fees by the faa and throughout this section excise taxes and general funds to pay for the faas ato related activities the proposal funds the faas safety activities primarily from general funds but also allows the faa to collect user fees related to its registration and certification activities for this purpose excise taxes would be used to support the continued aviation trust fund which is dedicated primarily toward funding aip but also supports part of red and essential air service eas programs the faa proposal does not set new user fee rates for ato services rather it enunciates framework for how fees can be set and creates an air transportation system advisory board board to assist the faa administrator in establishing appropriate fee levels and mechanisms among other things ultimately however the administrator would be the sole decision maker on fee setting issues the proposal adopts new financial structure for the faa that corresponds to the new program funding regime to facilitate this structure it would create two new accounts in the treasury to receive the newly imposed user fees allows for the 30 the faas proposed legislation and supporting documentation are available at

on march 29 2007 crs20 establishment of reserve fund and allows the faa to issue bonds to speedup fe equipment acquisition agency spending would still be subject to annual congressional appropriations the faa proposal is controversial and several aviation interest groups came out against it almost as soon as it was introduced32 the proposal however has supporters especially the ata which views it as positive step forward33 hearings on hr 1356 which embodies the faa proposal have been scheduled in both the house and the senate proposed tax and fee structure the principal feature of the faa proposal is the creation of direct user fee system to pay for the majority of the agencys costs associated with its ato activities the proposal however does not recommend specific user fee structure instead it lists the criteria that must be considered in setting fee levels and leaves it to the board and ultimately the faa administrator to actually set the fees the proposal would require that the administrator consult with affected parties prior to establishing fee structure but gives the affected parties further role in the process34 ato user fees specific ato user fees could be set for enroute oceanic and terminal area flight activity according to the language in the proposal enroute and oceanic fees can be based on distance traveled or any other method that is consistent with the treaties and international agreements to which the united states is party since much of the rest of the world uses aircraft weight and the distance flown as part of its fee setting process it would appear that similar fee setting regime could be implemented here35 overflight fees for aircraft transiting us airspace would be eliminated and these flights would be subject to the enroute and oceanic fee system fee setting for terminal area activities could be somewhat more complicated because the proposal allows for fees to be differentiated at various locations and at different times of the day factors that could be included in the terminal fee structure may include aircraft takeoffslandings at airports with over 100000 passenger boardings per year aircraft weight operations at large hub airport 1 of total us enplanements time of day or day of week at congested large hubs and different fees for daytime and nighttime operations user fees would be imposed on all commercial users of ato

appear that the board with wide aviation industry representation is supposed to be part of the consultation process although this is unstated in hr 1356 35 the airline industry and groups such as the air cargo industry have traditionally opposed weightbased tax structures crs21 commercial and noncommercial users although ga aircraft will operate outside of the ato user fee system most of the time they are subject to terminal related fees at congested large hub airports the proposal would require that fees be set in relation to the costs incurred for providing ato services in setting the fees mentioned above the faa would be prohibited from using flight altitude as fee setting factor it could offer incentives by way of reduced fees for the purchase and use of equipment that would enhance an aircrafts safe and efficient operation in the air traffic system in addition it could seek sufficient user fee revenues to establish reserve fund to be available if system revenues fail to reach projected levels the ato would also receive funding from excise taxes the proposal suggests that 70 cent per gallon fuel tax be imposed on all ga users kerojet or aviation gasoline of this 564 cents per gallon is dedicated to ato activities and 136 cents is reserved for the aviation trust fund these fees are to be indexed to inflation beginning in 2009 and can be modified by the administrator in future years the faa believes that it is longer necessary to differentiate the tax rate for turbine avgas and piston aviation gasoline aircraft users as has been done in the past because of the much higher fuel use rates of turbine aircraft safety and operations user fees safety and nonato operations activities would be primarily funded by treasury general funds in addition the faa proposes registration fees for specified services at rates detailed in the proposed legislation by way of example aircraft registration would be subject to 130 fee and issuing an airman medical certificate would cost 42 many of the activities listed here were previously provided at nominal fee levels fees are also to be imposed for faa certification activities specific fees for activities such as certification of large foreign repair station or maintenance technical school are not enumerated in the legislation rather the administrator is to set fees at levels that correspond to the costs imposed on the faa for providing the certification service in question trust fund excise taxes the largest source of revenues for the trust fund would come from the 136 cent per gallon fuel tax on all aircraft irrespective of fuel type these taxes are to be adjusted for inflation and can also be adjusted up or down if the faa cost allocation process so dictates the other principal source of funding for the trust fund is by continuation of the international arrivalsdeparture fee which is set at 639 per event this tax can also be adjusted for inflation andor cost allocation reasons although the faa proposal is based primarily on direct user fees there is transition period during which the trust fund would continue to provide some funding for ato and all other faa activities albeit at diminishing level air transportation system advisory board board the faa proposal would create 13member board charged with advising the administrator on user fee and other issues at his or her request the boards membership would include crs22 the administrator department of defense dod representative three members representing the public interest an airport member three airline members representing different size air carriers cargo airline member ga member business aviation member and representative of the aviation manufacturing industry appointment of all members would be made by the secretary of transportation in addition the proposal would prescribe the board members terms and provide guidance on its administrative functioning the board would advise the administrator on wide range of faa programs and activities at the outset however it would appear that the boards principal duty would be to help with the creation of the new user fee system according to provisions of the proposal prior to establishing or modifying fees the administrator shall consult with and seek the recommendations of the type and level of such fees procedure would be established whereby the administrator who has ultimate fee setting responsibility could disagree with the boards recommendations and establish fees by publishing the reasons for disagreement in the federal register should the faa proposal be enacted into law it will be very much up to the administrator to determine how and how much they might wish to use the boards expertise there is nothing in the legislation as proposed that automatically gives the board any power to exercise its advisory role especially in public forum this is because the boards actions would not be subject to the public meeting or any other administrative provisions of title 5 usc further it is not clear that the board would have access to information about cost allocation and other subjects except to the extent that the administrator wishes to make this material available to the board budget and structural provisions as suggested by the new tax and fee proposal the faa would be reorganized from budgetary perspective ato assessed user fees would be deposited into newly created treasury ato account similarly registration and certification fees would be deposited in newly created treasury safety and operations account the trust fund however would remain intact but its role in financing overall federal aviation activities is greatly reduced the new user fees would require new collection system to ensure that they are deposited in the appropriate account the administrator would be charged with developing this system perhaps with the help of the board the faa proposal would give the administrator some enforcement powers to assist in the collection effort long term faa spending would still require annual liquidating appropriation by congress the relationship between the faa and congressional appropriations committees would apparently be unchanged from budgetary standpoint however it appears that the offsetting collections process created by the proposal would remove faa spending from the discretionary part of the budget at least one source has suggested that the new funding arrangement could run afoul of the newly created payasyougo crs23 rules adopted by the house of representatives36 in short it is unclear at this point how the new funding arrangement proposed here would play out as part of the congressional budget and appropriations process congressional finance committees house ways and means and senate finance could lose their existing jurisdiction over some aspects of the faa tax and fee setting these committees would likely retain their jurisdiction over the excise taxes to be deposited in the aviation trust fund but would have role or oversight over the newly established user fees authorizing committees normally have jurisdiction over offsetting collection programs of the type that are proposed for the ato and for safety and operations as proposed however all fee setting powers would reside with the administrator meaning that specific oversight role for the authorizing committees is not defined in the legislation bonding authority the secretary of transportation would have the ability to issue treasury bonds to facilitate rapid implementation of the ngats program up to 5 billion could be issued at interest rates established by the treasury to finance the bonding the secretary could increase user fees by an amount needed to repay the bonds with interest these additional revenues would not go into the new treasury accounts mentioned earlier but would flow directly to the treasury full repayment would be required by the end of fy2017 the concept of using bonds to speed up the acquisition of fe capital items has been discussed for years the dedicated revenue stream to the ato account would make bonding possible as part of the faas program for the first time it has been argued that having this authority would allow the faa to better program its acquisition requirements over an extended period of time as opposed to the potential uncertainty of the annual appropriations process in addition access to additional funds could give the agency the ability to pursue number of technology and equipment upgrades at the same time the main argument against bonding is that the interest payments make it more expensive way to pay for infrastructure than through direct appropriations agency funding the faa proposal would provide overall authorization levels for the fy2008 fy2010 period of nearly 28 billion this number however cannot be meaningfully compared to previous legislation because it excludes much of the funding required by the prospectively user fee funded ato and safety and operations activities these activities would now be linked to actual system costs which cannot be determined this far in advance to the extent that the authorized levels can be compared they suggest significant annual cut in airport improvement program aip and essential air services eas funding from the fy2007 enacted levels observations the proposed faa legislation is seen as ambitious and far reaching encompassing many of the goals delineated by the agency when it started 36 transportation weekly administration faa bill likely violates house payasyou go budget rule february 28 2007 p 13 crs24 its review of the aviation finance system in 200537 the proposal would establish new funding mechanism for aviation activities directly linking user taxes and other fees to the costs incurred for the operation of air traffic and other faa services the faa proposal however contains many provisions that may cause congressional concern the broad delegation of fee setting and other authority to the administrator in particular is likely to be viewed by many as significant transfer of power from the congressional to the executive branch this could be very problematic especially for authorizing committees who could lose some of their existing oversight jurisdiction this problem is especially acute visavis the activities of the board which could largely be hidden from public view by virtue of the boards proposed exemption from usc title 5 regulations the user tax proposal is complex and includes many unknowns the faa proposed legislation as mentioned above leaves the task of actually establishing user fees to the administrator perhaps with the advice of the board making it impossible for system users to have any certainty as to what specific user fee obligations they would face in the years ahead this lack of certainty is likely to make many system users cautious of this proposal even if they believe they might benefit from it this sense of caution is also likely to extend to programs funded out of the trust fund for example the size of the aip appears to be closely tied to revenues expected from trust fund dedicated excise taxes the faa is proposing smaller aip for the years ahead if congress were to increase the aip to just its fy2007 level for the life of the new reauthorization it is quite possible that excise taxes would have to be adjusted upward the faa administrator has stated that this is once in lifetime opportunity to create new aviation finance system to ensure the adoption of ngats38 it is not at all clear that this viewed is shared by majority of the aviation community at this point in the reauthorization debate in 1970 when the existing aviation funding system was created shared sense of crisis seems to have permeated the entire industry that does not however seem to be the case today as result it remains to be seen whether congress will choose to follow the guidance put forth by the faa or choose different path toward reauthorizing federal aviation activities s 1300 the aviation investment and modernization act of 2007 s 1300 srept 110 144 proposes fouryear authorization with modest overall budget increases and larger increases specifically for facilities and equipment fe modernization as reported by the senate committee on commerce science and transportation the bill largely ignores the faa proposal and maintains the existing funding structure for the faa with couple of important caveats first the commerce committee lacks jurisdiction over taxes and fees which are in the domain of the senate committee on 37 httpwwwfaagovregulations_policiesreauthorizationmediafinancing_principles pdf 38 httpwwwfaagovnewstestimonynews_storycfmnewsid8184 crs25 finance this being the case the bill does not include tax and fee provisions although as will be discussed subsequently it does include significant revenue raising element in addition the commerce committee has proposed an oversight board and provided for bonding authority in each instance s 1300 differs from provisions in the faa proposal modernization surcharge the most contentious element of s 1300 is proposal to levy 25 surcharge on flights39 operating in the national airspace system the surcharge is designed to pay for significant portion of faa costs associated with the ngats modernization program revenues collected by the surcharge are to be treated as offsetting collections for congressional budgetary purposes and are to be deposited in new treasurycreated air traffic modernization fund as an offsetting collection the surcharge is under the jurisdiction of the authorizing committee in this case senate commerce spending of these funds is subject to authorization and to subsequent annual appropriation although the bill provides for broad industry collection of the surcharge it exempts large segment of annual flight activity from the fee the major exemptions are for all piston powered aircraft and for all turboprop and turbojet aircraft operating outside of controlled airspace other exemptions are provided for certain intrastate flights alaska and hawaii where neither terminal radar approach control tracon or other faa atc facility is involved in servicing the flight other exemptions apply to military and public aircraft us and foreign air ambulance aircraft agricultural aircraft and canadatocanada flights the surcharge is to be payable to the administrator of the faa the administrator is also charged with implementing the surcharge collection process limited guidance is provided in the bill as to how the collection process might work leaving it largely to the administrator and treasury to establish workable process the bill provides for penalties for nonpayment of the surcharge as reported the provision would provide portion of the annual fe budget beginning in fy2009 at level of 412 million funding for the subsequent two years of the authorization period is provided at 423 million and 436 million respectively related provision in the bill requires that all aircraft filing flight plans with the faa including those exempt from the surcharge include information as to whether or not flight is being operated for commercial purposes for compensation or for hire collecting this information is apparently directed toward filling what many industry observers see as large gap in existing industry data ie determining what portion of ga flights is for commercial rather than personal purposes surcharge issues the surcharge is viewed by the ga community as user fee and is opposed for the same reasons that ga opposes the user fee portions of the faa proposal ie ga believes that it creates marginal demands on the atc system and that its contribution to funding the faa is best handled by the already existing 39 the bill defines flight as takeoff and landing by an aircraft crs26 fuel tax system conversely the airline industry generally supports the surcharge proposal and views it as positive move toward getting all system users and especially corporate aviation to pay for their fair share of atc system costs within the senate commerce committee support for the surcharge proposal was closely split an attempt to strike the surcharge from the reported version of the bill failed on vote of 12 to 11 senator ted stevens having voted initially to abstain on the amendment later changed his vote in order to provide majority for moving the surcharge provision for future consideration on the floor40 in addition to the philosophical questions about the desirability of user fees the question can also be raised about whether 25 surcharge would be sufficient in and of itself to provide the amount of designated modernization funding authorized in s 1300 the answer based on simple analysis of industry data is that this might not be the case41 as result supplemental revenues for the modernization fund may be considered by the senate committee on finance there has already been an open discussion in industry circles about the need to consider possible fuel tax andor other fee increases in order to meet both modernization needs and additional funding needs for other faa activities leveraged financing for next generation air traffic control system bonding authority s 1300 like the faa proposal would provide the faa with up to 5 billion in bonding authority to facilitate expedited spending for ngatsrelated capital projects other administrative aspects of the bonding proposal differ however for example funds would be available for the period fy2009 through fy2025 instead of fy2009 through fy2017 bonds could be used to pay for ngats projects listed as part of the faas capital improvement program cip at the discretion of the secretary of transportation with the approval of the office of management and budget omb interest rates would be set by the treasury repayment would be made from the surcharges deposited in the modernization fund on which repayment would have priority over other types of modernization spending bonding for capital improvements as opposed to using appropriated funds remains controversial concept for the same reasons enunciated in the earlier discussion of the faa proposal air traffic control modernization oversight board oversight board the oversight board that would be created by this bill unlike the board proposed by the faa has real power and some might argue some unusual powers as well s 1300 creates sevenmember oversight board appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate membership consists of the administrator of the faa 40 senate committee approves faa reauthorization transportation weekly legislative services group vol 8 issue 22 may 23 2007 p 6 41 according to the faa there were more than 18 million total flights in the us in 2005 if each of these flights were to be taxed which would not be the case since large segment of these flights would be exempted from the surcharge 450 million might be raised in addition to paying for the modernization fund contribution to fe the surcharge would also be used to pay for up to 5 billion in bonds plus interest issued in accordance with another provision of the bill crs27 representative of dod representative of the public interest the chief executive officer ceo of an airport the ceo of an airline representative from one of the faas labor organizations and representative of the ga segment of the industry the oversight board is assigned number of functions some advisory in nature and some that give the oversight board approval authority over faa actions as stated in the bill these functions are as follows review and advise on faa modernization budget and cost accounting activities review the faa strategic plan provide recommendations on non safety elements and advice on safety elements review atc efficiency and make recommendations based on its performance approve all capital expenditures of more than 100 million related to the atc system modernization approve the faas fe budget prior to its submission to omb approve the cip prior to its submission to congress annually approve the operational evolution plan oep approve the administrators choice of chief operating officer coo for the air traffic organization ato approve the selection of the head of the joint planning development office jpdo the bill requires that oversight board members have certain types of expertise in aviation and organizational subject areas they also must not have pecuniary or financial interest defined by the provision and not be member of group that lobbies on aviationrelated legislation from an administrative perspective the bill allows the oversight board to choose its own chairman and vice chairman makes simple majority of members quorum and allows majority vote of members present to be sufficient for oversight board action also oversight board members are exempt from personal liability laws as concerns their official activities discussion the proposed makeup of the oversight board and its role in the ngats implementation process are likely to raise several questions during further congressional consideration of this proposal one very notable provision here is that the bill gives equal status visavis oversight board activity to the faa administrator and to the representative of faas labor unions this arrangement certainly raises questions about executive branch authority given the proposed structure of the oversight board and its ability to choose its own chairman it is not out of the realm of possibility that the faa labor representative could have certain powers that are normally associated with the executive branch especially as regards budget issues another unusual provision is the requirement that the administrator seek oversight board approval before submitting the fe portion of the annual faa budget to omb this provision can be viewed as an extra step that could potentially slow down the annual agency budget approval process hence the oversight board signoff is likely to require certain accommodations in terms of deadlines etc crs28 questions can be raised about the desirabilitylikelihood of certain of the conditions to be met by potential oversight board members for example it seems unlikely that the ceo of an airline would not have disqualifying financial interest in hisher airline the same type of question could certainly be raised for the airport ceo member and potentially for the ga member further the member representing the public interest is to have fiduciary responsibility to represent the public although how this charge is defined is not detailed in the proposed legislation the bill allows the administrator to withhold certain information and documents from the oversight board if they reveal proprietary or commercial information the members of the oversight board having gone through the congressional confirmation process would normally be viewed as officers of the united states in the same manner as other faa employees certain faa and other designated federal employees routinely deal with this type of information in the normal performance of their duties it therefore seems unusual that such an exclusion of information especially if it provided substantive information relevant to capital improvement projects could be denied to the oversight board s 2345 on november 13 2007 the senate committee on finance reported s 2345 the american infrastructure investment and improvement act of 2007 incorporating the committees recommendations for what is likely to be the revenue title of the senate faa reauthorization bill its proposal makes some changes to elements of the existing tax and fee structure but does not create new user fees as can be seen in table 5 the committee has increased the general aviation jet fuel tax increased the international departurearrival tax and created new tax system for particular segment of the aviation industry fractionally owned aircraft at the moment passengers on fractionally owned aircraft are treated by the tax code in the same manner as airline passengers subject to the airline ticket tax the segment fee and international departurearrival tax the committee bill would instead treat this industry segment as if it were part of the general aviation industry for the purposes of the aviation jet fuel tax but would also impose flat fee departure tax on the aircraft rather than on the passenger all of the additional revenues collected by the changes in taxation would be deposited in newly created account within the treasury and reserved for ngatsrelated activities crs29 table 5 proposed aviation tax and fee changes tax or

exclusively with airline financial issues provisions in the bill seek to remedy an expected fy2009 shortfall in the highway trust fund and create new bonding authority program for intercity passenger rail service it remains to be seen whether the senate will consider these provisions as part of the faa reauthorization bill or consider them separately discussion there is difference of opinion as to the need for surcharge between members of the finance committee and the commerce committee that will need to be resolved before work on the faa reauthorization bill is completed in the senate the two bills can be viewed as competing proposals on how additional financing of the faa should be accomplished the leadership of commerces aviation subcommittee strongly favors the surcharge approach to increasing faa modernization financing and is opposed to the idea of stripping this provision out of the final bill which is the position favored by several members of the finance committee42 in effect the finance committee has largely taken the ga industry 42 national journals congress daily am senate standoff prompts move to extend aviation taxes september 26 2007 crs30 position against user fees the full senate therefore will decide the ultimate fate of the surcharge proposal hr 2881 the faa reauthorization act of 2007 hr 2881 as passed by the house on september 20 2007 seeks higher spending authorizations for fe compared to s 1300 like the senate commerce and finance committee bills the house legislation rejects the faas financing proposals outright hr 2881 provides for some modest increases in federal aviation fuel taxes as shown in table 5 but makes other significant changes in the aviation trust fund tax and fee structure as introduced by the committee on transportation and infrastructure the legislation lacked revenue title the committee did however make recommendation to the ways and means committee that aviation jet fuel taxes be increased from 218 cents per gallon to 307 cents per gallon and that aviation gasoline taxes be increased from 193 cents per gallon to 241 cents per gallon the ways and means committee went along with the recommendation to raise the gasoline tax to 241 cents per gallon but choose to raise the jet fuel tax to 359 cents per gallon hr 2881 also includes provision calling for the adjustment of existing overflight fees flights that do not take off or land in the us these fees are currently used primarily to fund portion of the eas program the faa is to adjust these fees by expedited rulemaking to ensure that the fees are reasonably related to the cost of providing air traffic services for overflights the bill however specifically excludes altitude as factor that can be used in the adjustment of the overflight fees registration certification and related fees hr 2881 includes fees for aircraft registration airman certificates and other types of faaprovided documentation at the same levels proposed by the administration it also provides that these fees may be adjusted over time if the faas cost accounting system indicates that the cost of providing these services to the aviation sector are higherlower than the fee levels established in the bill hr 2881 does not however follow the lead of the administration bill and impose new fee structure for faas new large aircraft certification programs and for other activities such as certification of foreign repair stations discussion unlike the faa proposal and s 1300 hr 2881 is notable primarily for what it does not do the house has decided not to make major aviation tax and fee changes choosing instead to make relatively small changes to the existing aviation tax and fee system the modest increases in fuel taxes supported by documents accompanying the bill indicate that the house feels that the existing tax system needs only minor tweaking in order to support more robust faa spending in the years ahead this view is largely shared by the ga industry but not by other sectors of the industry especially the airlines and airports for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33913
