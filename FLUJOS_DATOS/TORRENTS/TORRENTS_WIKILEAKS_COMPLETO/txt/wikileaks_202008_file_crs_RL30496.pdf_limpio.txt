analysis of data from the survey of income and program participa tion policy implications are discussed in the context of the tax reform act of 1986 and the unemployment compensation amendments of 1992 both of which changed the tax treatment of early distribution from pensionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30496congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received

divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30496pension issues lump sum distributions and retirement income security summary slightly fewer than half of all workers age 21 and older participated in an employersponsored retirement plan in 2003 but not all of these workers will receive pension or retirement annuity from the j obs they now hold many will receive lumpsum distribution from their retirement plan when they change jobs typical 25yearold today will work for seven or more employers before reaching age 65 and could receive several distributions before reaching retirement age lumpsum distributions allow workers to reinvest their retirement assets so that they will continue to grow until retirement however many recipients of lumpsum distributions use all or part of the dist ribution for current c onsumption rather than depositing the funds into an individua l retirement account ira or another retirement plan to encourage individuals to roll over these distributions into another retirement plan congress in 1986 enacted 10 excise tax on pre retirement pension distributi ons that are not rolled over in 1992 congress required employers to withhold for income tax paymen t 20 of distributions that are paid to recipients rather than rolled over into another retirement plan in 2001 congress required that unless directed otherwise by the participant the plan sponsor must deposit distributions of 1000 or more into an individual retirement account according to data collected by the census bureau 518 million workers age 21 or older participated in retirement plans that offered lumpsum distribution as payment option in 2003 this represented 848 of the 611 million workers who were covered by pensi on profitsharing or retir ement savings plan in 2003 approximately 160 million people reported that they had received at least one lump sum distribution at some time in their lives the average mean value of these distributions was 21900 and the median value was 6000 the typical recipient was between 37 and 40 years old at the time of the distribution thus most recipients of lumpsum distributions were more than 20 years away from retirement of survey respondents who reported that they had received at least one lump sum distribution 44 said that they d rolled over the entire amount of the most recent distribution into an ira or other retirement plan accounting for 672 of the dollars distributed as lump sums another 40 of recipients said that they had saved at least part of the distribution in some other way of those who reported receiving distribution after 1992 47 said that th ey had rolled over the entire amount into another plan accounting for 72 of the dolla rs distributed as lumpsums another 38 of this group said that they had sa ved at least part of the distribution lumpsum distributions that are spent rather saved can reduce future retirement income if the lumpsum distributions received through 2002 that were not rolled over had instead been rolled over into accounts that grew at the same historical rate as the standard poors 500 index they would have had median value of 7214 by 2003 for the typical recipient if this amount were to rema in invested it would grow to an estimated value of 31100 by age 65 which woul d be sufficient to purchase level singlelife annuity that would pay 225 in monthly incomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30496

than half of all work ers age 21 and older in the united states participated in an employers ponsored retirement plan in 20031 table 1 not all of these workers however will receive pension or retirement annuity from their current jobs some workers will not participate in their employers retirement plan long enough to earn the right to pension process called vesting others will receive lumpsum distribution from the plan when they retire or when they change jobs typical 25yearold today will work for seven or more employers before reaching age 652 thus most workers can expect to receive one or more distributions from retirement plan befo re reaching retirement age what an individual does with lumpsum distribu tion even relatively small one can have significant impact on his or her wealth and income during retirement lump sum distributions that are spent on curre nt consumption rather than saved for retirement will not be available to augment workers retirement income today most retirees rely on social security for the majority of their income in 2003 more than twothirds 683 of social security beneficiaries age 65 or older received more than half of their nnual income from social security and social security was the only source of income for nearly one out of four 24 beneficiaries over the age of 653 the median monthly social security retired worker benefit in 2003 was 925 per month or 11100 annually workers whose employer sponsors retirement plan have the opportunity to achieve higher standards of living and greater financial independen ce in retirement than those who must rely on social security alone however to the extent that workers spend lumpsum distributions from employersponsored retirement plans rather than save them they may be undermining their future financial security congress has provided incentives for wo rkers to prepare for retirement by granting favorable tax treatment to retirement plans that meet certain requirements as to

joint committee on taxation jcs105 jan 12 2005 other substantial tax expenditures are the exclusion of employer payments for he alth insurance which is estimated to reduce federal tax revenue by 494 billion from 2005 to 2009 the home mortgage interest deduction 434 billion the reduced tax rates on dividends and longterm capital gains 357 billion and the tax credit for children under age 17 232

forprofit employers similar arrangements for nonprofit employers are authorized by 403b and for employee s of state and local governments under 457 6 erisa allows sponsors of retirement plans to choose between two methods of vesting cliff vesting and graded vesting the maximum permissible vesting period differs between defined benefit plans and defined cont ribution plans under cliff vesting in defined benefit plan participant is 100 vest ed after five years of participation but has vested rights to benefit under the plan befo re that time under graded vesting in defined benefit plan participant is 20 vest ed after three years 40 vested after four years 60 vested after five years 80 vested after six years and 100 vested after seven years in defined contribution plan the vesting schedule applicable to an employers matching contributions may not exceed three years under year cliff vesting or six years under graded vesting employers can if they choose vest participants in their

retirement income security act of 1974 pl 93406 popularly known as erisa and the internal revenue code plan that fails to meet the standards set forth in federal law ma be denied the status of taxqualified plan the tax revenue forgone by the federal government as result of the deductions and exclusions granted to qualified retirement plans is substantial according to the congressional joint committee on taxation the net exclusion for employer pension plan contributions and earnings will result in 568 billion in forg one tax revenue over the five fiscal years from 2005 through 20094 this is the largest socalled tax expenditure in the federal budget asset preservation and lumpsum distributions pension plans and retirement savings plans such as 401k plans promote financial security in retirement by encouraging workers to accumu late assets to pre fund their retirement income5 sometimes however retirement assets are distributed before the worker has reached retirement age this can happen in the event that plan is terminated or more commonly when worker moves from one job to another in such cases the present value of the benefit that the em ployee has earned to date his or her accrued benefit is typically paid out in single lumpsum distribution from the plan in the case of 401ktype plan the distribution is equal to the balance in the employees account employee contributions investment earnings or losses on those contributions and the pa rt of employer contributions and earnings in which the employee has become vested6 in defined benefit pension plans lumpsum distribution is required by law to be equal to the present value of the employees accrued benefit the present value calcula tion discounts the stream of benefits thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30496crs4 7 lumpsum distributions from defined benef it plans are discounted both for the time value of money based on specific rate of interest and also for mortality among plan participants 8 under irc 72t the 10 penalty is waived if the distribution is made in series of substantially equal periodic payments based on the recipients life expectancy or if the recipient has retired from the plan sponsor at age 55 or older see crs report rl31770 retirement savings accounts early withdrawals and requi red distributions by patrick j purcell 9 if the distribution is not rolled over within 60 days the 20 withheld is applied to the taxes owed on the distribution if the distribution is rolled ov er within the 60day limit the 20 withheld is credited toward the individual s total income tax owed for the year note that to roll over the full amount after receiv ing lumpsum distribution the recipient must have access to other funds that are at least equal to the amount withheld 10 distributions of 5000 or more require th participants written consent the 5000 limit was established by the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 the amount had been set at 3500 by retirement equity act of 1984 it was originally established at 1750 continuedwould be paid in the future to an amount th at could if invested by the recipient pay an equivalent income at retirement7 lumpsum distributions promote portability of retirement assets for workers who change jobs allowing them to reinvest their retirement assets so that they will continue to grow until retirement transfer of assets from one taxqualified retirement plan to another is referred to as rollover of assets into another plan pension analysts describe preretirement distributions that are spent on current consumption rather than being rolled over in to another retirement plan as leakages from the pool of retirement assets to discourage leakages from retirement plans congress has amended the internal reve nue code to provide incentives for individuals to roll over preretirement di stributions into other retirement plans the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 established 10 excise tax in addition to ordinary income taxes on lumpsum distributions received be fore age 59½ that are not rolled over into an individual retirement account ira or another employers tax qualified retirement plan8 the unemployment compensati on amendments of 1992 pl 102 318 required employers to give departing employees the option to transfer lumpsum distribution directly to an ira or to another employers plan if the participant instead chooses to receive the distribution directly the employ er is required to withhold 20 which is applied to any taxes due on the distribution if the participant does not deposit the dist ribution into an ira or another taxqualified plan within 60 days he or she will owe both regular income taxes and the 10 excise tax on the entire amount of the distribution9 irc 411a11 allows plan s ponsor to distribute to departing employee his or her accrued benef it under retirement plan without the participants consent if the pr esent value of the benefit is less than 500010 the economic growth and tax relief reconciliationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30496crs5 10 continued by erisa in 1974act of 2001 p l 10716 required that if plan makes such distribution and the present value of the benefit is at least 1000 the plan must deposit the distributi on into an individual retirement account unless otherwise instru cted by the participant obviously there may be times when the recipient of lumpsum distribution faces expenses that are more pressing th an concerns about retirement this is especially so when the recipient is in period of unemployment or must pay for the care of relative who is ill or disabled previous research has shown that the event precipitating lumpsum distribution ing ones job for example is key determinant of whether the distribution is rolled over into another retirement plan saved in some other way or spent on cu rrent consumption surveys of employers and employees indicate that the availability of lumpsum distributions has positive effect on employee participa tion in retirement plans consequently congress has sought to encourage recipients to roll over preretir ement distributions rather than requiring that such distributions be rolled ove r into an ira or another retirement plan allowing lumpsum distributions while placing an excise tax on amounts that are not rolled over represents compromise among the competing policy objectives of promoting retirement saving preserving assets until retirement providing access to assets in time of need and assuring that lost tax revenue does not exceed the amount necessary to encourage employer sponsorship and employee participation calculating lumpsum distribution amounts when lumpsum distribution is paid from defined contri bution plan such as 401k plan the amount distributed is simply the account bala nce in paying lumpsum distribution from defined benefit plan however the pl an sponsor must calculate the present value of the benefit that would be payable to the plan participant when he or she reaches the plans normal retirement age when calculating this amount the plan is required by law to use the interest rate that is specified in the internal revenue code irc 417e specifies the interest rate on 30year us treasury bonds as the discount rate to be used by plan sponsors when calculating the present value of plan participants accrued benefit the us treasury stopped issuing 30year bonds in 2001 congress is now consider ing alternative interest ra tes that could be used to calculate the present value of accrued bene fits under defined be nefit plans hr 2803 boehner of the 109th congress would replace the interest rate on 30year treasury bonds as the rate for calculating lumpsum distributions with an interest rate based on an average of the interest rates on highquality longterm and short term corporate bonds the corporate bond ra would be phased in over five years beginning in 2006 interest rates and lumpsum distributions the amount of lump sum distribution from define d benefit pension is inversely related to the interest used to calculate the present value of the benefit that has been accrued under the plan the higher the interest rate the smaller the lumpsum and vice versa under current law lumpsum distributions are calculated using the average interest rate on 30year treasury bonds the interest rate on long term treasury secur ities has historicallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30496crs6 11 pbgc director bradley belt statement to the senate finance committee june 7 2005been lower than the average interest rate on longterm investmentgrade corporate bonds because bond markets generally consider us treasury securities to be free of the risk of default since the tr easury department stopped issuing the 30year bond in 2 001 the intere st rate on 30year treasury bonds that have not yet been redeemed has fallen as the supply of bonds has shrunk bond prices and interest rates are inversely related as bond prices rise bond yields interest rates fall hr 2830 would require plan sponsors to calculate lumpsum distributions using three interest rates based on investmentgrade corporate bonds as result participants of different ages would have their lump sum distributions calculated using different interest rates lumpsum distributions paid to workers nearer to retirement would be calculated using short term interest rate and distributions paid to younger workers would be based on l ongterm rate because shortterm rates are usually lower than longterm rates all else being equal an older worker would receive larger lumpsum than similarly situated younger worker assuming that participant were to take lumpsum distribution at the plans normal retirement age typically age 65 s hortterm corporate in terest rate would be applied to the annuity payments he or she would have received during the first five years of retirement mediumterm inte rest rate would apply to payments the participant would have recei ved in years six through 20 and longterm rate would apply to payments that would have been paid after 20 years because 65yearold can be expected to live about another 20 year s most of the lumpsum would be based on the mediumterm rate in contrast participant who takes lumpsum distribution at age 45 would be 20 years aw ay from the plans normal retirement age all of that persons lump m will be discounted at the higher longterm rate if person took lump sum at say age 59 the distribution would be calculated using the both the mediumterm and longterm ra tes but not the shortterm rate lumpsum distributions and pension plan funding further increases in the proportion of plan participants ta king lumpsum distributions from defined benefit pension plans could have important implications for pension plan funding the executive director of the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc has stated that plan assets ar depleted when seriously underfunded plans allow retiring employees to elect lump sums and similar accelerated benefits11 likewise the us government accountability office gao has reported to congress that because many plans allow lump sum distributions plan participants in an underf unded plan may have incentives to request such distributions for example where participants believe that the pbgc guarantee may not cover their full benefits many eligible participants ma elect to retire and take all or part of their benefits in lump sum rather than as lifetime annuity payments in order to maximize the value of their accrued benefits in some cases this may create run on the bank exacerbating the possibility of the plans insolvency as assetshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30496crs7 12 us government accountability office pension benefit guaranty corporation structural problems limit agencys ability to protect itself from risk gao05360t 13 this includes all participants in defined contribution plans as well as participants in defined benefit plans who reported that the plan offered lumpsum distribution optionare liquidated more quickly than expected potentially leaving fewer assets to pay benefits for other participants12 how many workers are eligible for lumpsum distributions during the first half of 2003 the census bureau asked participants in the survey of income and program par ticipation sipp series of questions on retirement expectations and pension plan coverage according to this survey 85 of the 611 millions workers age 21 or older who were included in retirement plan at work participated in plan that offered lumpsum distribution as payment option13 see table 2 almost all defined contribution plans offer lumpsum payment option the proportion of defined benefit plans offering lumpsum distributions has risen in recent years as many employers have conve rted traditional defi ned benefit pension plans to cash balance plans these are hybrid pensions that have some of the characteristics of defined contribution plans most significantly in that participants accrued benefit is reported as an account balance neve rtheless cash balance plans are funded on group basis and are treated as defined benefit plans under the internal revenue code cash balance plans typically offer lumpsum distributions to departing employeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30496crs8 table 2 percentage of workers whose retirement plan offered lumpsum payment option 2003

source crs analysis of the 2001 panel of the survey of income and program participation ssip how did recipients use their lumpsum distributions research into lumpsum distributions has consistently f ound that the majority of distributions are not rolled over into other qualified retiremen t savings plans but that the majority of dollars are rolled over in other words small distributions are less likely to be rolled over but large dist ributions which account for most of the money distributed are more likely to be rolled over research ers also have foundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30496crs10 15 the other categories listed on the survey were bought car boat furniture or other consumer items used for vacation travel or r ecreation paid expenses while laid off used for moving or relocation expenses used for medical or dental expenses paid or saved for education used for general or everyday expenses gave to family members or charity paid taxes and spent in other wayshowever that most recipients of lumpsums saved at least part of the distribution even if none of the money was ro lled into another retirement plan of those who reported to the census bureau that they had received at least one lumpsum distribution 44 said that they had rolled over the entire amount of the most recent distribution into another taxqualified plan such as an ira see table 4 these transactions accounted for 67 of the dollars distributed as lump sums not shown in table of those who re ported receiving distribution after 1992 47 said that they had rolled over the entire amount into another plan accounting for 72 of the dollars distributed as lumpsums after 1992 rolling over lumpsum distribution into another taxqualified retirement plan is the most efficient way to preserve these assets for retirement because direct rollovers are not subject to taxes ta x penalties or empl oyer withholding nevertheless it is not the only way to save lumpsum distribution survey participants who reported th at they had not rolled over the entire amount of lump sum distribution were asked what they did with the money eighteen options were listed and respondents could i ndicate more than one if th ey used the money for more than one purpose survey pa rticipants were asked only how they used the money not how much was used for each purpose nine of the categories listed fit the standard

the census bureau last collected information on the disposition of lumpsum distributions from pension plans in 1998 in the 1998 survey 359 of respondents repor ted that they had rolled over the entire amount of the most recent lumpsum distri bution they had received into an ira or another employersponsored retiremen t plan the data displayed in table 4 show that 443 of the respondents to the 2003 rvey reported having rolled over their most recently received lumpsum distribu tion while these figures may appear to represent substantial increase in the percen tage of recipients who chose to roll over their lumpsum distributions between 1998 and 2003 they primarily reflect changes in participant behavior that had already occurred by 1998 in the1998 census bureau survey 359 of respondents reported that they had rolled over their most recent lumpsum distribution into another retirement plan of 70 million people whose most recent lumps um distribution occurred before 1993 only 292 reported that they had rolled over the entire amount into an ira or another retirement plan of 73 milli on people whose most recent lumpsum distribution occurred between 1993 and 19 98 424 reported that they had rolled over the entire amount into another plan16 in the 2003 census bureau survey 443 of respondents reported that they had rolled over their most recently received lumpsum distribution into another retirement plan of 47 million people whose most recent lumpsum distribution occurred before 1993 38 had rolled over the entire am ount into an ira or another retirement plan of another 47 million people whose most recent lumpsum distribution was received between 1993 and 1998 492 reported that they had rolled over the entire amount into another plan finally of 67 million people whose most r ecent lump sum distribution was received after 1998 452 reported that they had rolled over the entire amount into another plan17 the increase from 359 of lumpsum r ecipients reporting rollover in the 1998 survey to 443 of recipients who repor ted rollover in the 2003 survey largely reflects changes in behavior that had ready occurred by 1998 in the 2001 survey the percentage of individuals who repor ted rolling over their most recent lumpsum distribution was actually lower for distributions received after 1998 or later than it was for distributions received between 1993 and 1998 when comparing the disposition of recently received lumpsum distributions in the two surveys the percentage of distributions that were ro lled over into another plan was only slightly higher in the 2003 survey than in the 1998 survey in 1998 424 of respondents who had received lumpsum distribution within the last five years reported that they had rolled over the full amount of the distribu tion into another retirement plan in the 2003 survey the comparable figure was 458 an increase of just 34 percentage points thus the higher overall percentage of recipients who reported having rolled over their most recent lumpsum dist ribution in the 2003 survey 443 as compared to 359 in the 1998 survey results mainly from the fact that much larger proportion of the distributions repr esented in the 2003

much retirement wealth was lost from lumpsums that were spent ra ther than saved older workers are more likely than thei r younger colleagues to roll over lump sum distribution of any given size into an ira or other retirement plan for example according to the sipp among workers who received distribution between the ages of 25 and 34 only 392 rolled over the tire amount into an ira or other retirement plan of those who received distribution between the ages of 45 and 54 516 rolled over the entire amount see table 4 younger workers however are more likely to receive relatively small lumpsum distributions because they generally have fewer years of service and have lower annual earnings than older workers among participants in the sipp who had received at least one lumpsum distribution the average m ean value of the most recent distribution was 21895 average values differed shar ply for amounts that were ro lled over versus those that were not among recipients who had rolled over the entire amount the average distribution was 33810 those who had not rolled over the entire distribution received lumpsums with mean value of 12420 see table 3 although younger workers often r eceive relatively small lumpsum distributions substantial amounts of retiremen t wealth can be lost by spending rather than saving even small sum especially in the case of workers who are many years from retirement to gauge the size of the potential loss in retirement wealth among people who reported that they had not rolled over their most recent lumpsum distribution the congressional research service crs calcula ted the amounts that these individuals could have accumulated if they had rolled over their entire lump sums into another retirement plan for each individual who had not rolled over the most recent lumpsum distribution crs cal culated the amount that would have been accumulated by 2003 if the entire lumpsum had been rolled over in the year it was received the estimates were based on two possi ble rates of return the annual interest rate paid by 10year us treasury notes in each year since the year the distribution was received and the total annual rate of return of the standard poors 500 stock index in each year since the distribution was received if all of the respondents w ho reported that they had not rolled over their most recent lumpsum distribution would have instead rolled over the full amount into fund that earned an interest ra equal to that paid by 10 year us treasury notes the distributions would have attained mean value of 37427 by 2003 if the lump sums had been rolled over into investments that grew at rate equal to the total annual return of sp 500 index the distri butions would have had mean value of 41272 by 2003 as noted earlier the mean value of lumpsum distributions is skewed upward by the effects of relatively small number of very large distributions consequently the typical distribution is more accurately portrayed by the median if all of the distributions that had not been rolled ove r into another retirement plan had instead been rolled into retirement account that wa s invested in stocks that matched thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30496crs15 18 based on level singlelife annuity purchased at age 65 at 4125 19 the longrun nominal interest rate assumed in the 2005 annual report of the board of trustees of the social s ecurity system was 58 total annual rate of return achieved by the sp 500 i ndex the lump sums would have had median value of 7214 by 2003 if i nvested in bonds that earned the rate of return paid by 10year us treasury not the median lump sum would have been worth 6930 by 2003 what would these amounts have been worth at retirement if we consider age 65 to be retiremen t age the typical individual who had received distribution but did not roll it over into another retirement account was from 27 to 30 years away from retirement in the year that he or she received the distribution their mean age in the year that they recei ved their distributions was 38 their median age in the year of the dist ribution was 35 in 2003 the year of the survey the median age of these individuals was 46 as noted above the median value of th lumpsum distributions that were not rolled over would have reached 7214 by 2003 if they had been invested in broad based stock market index f und assuming future averag annual rate of return in the stock market of 8 46 yearold individual who invested 7214 for 19 years would have accumulated 31130 by age 65 at current interest rates this would be enough to purchase lifelong annuity that would provide income of 225 per month18 if the lump sums that were not ro lled over had been rolled into an account paying the same rate of return as 10year treasury notes they would have reached median value of 6930 in 2003 assumin g 46 yearold individual invested 6930 in bonds for 19 years at an average rate of return of 58 it would grow to 20230 by age 6519 this would be sufficient capital to purchase lifetime annuity that would provide monthly income of 147 what factors influen ce the rollover decision older recipients and those who receive largerthanaverage lump sums are relatively more likely to roll over their distributions into an ira or other taxqualified retirement plan in other words both th recipients age and the amount of the distribution are positively correlated with the probability that lumpsum distribution will be rolled over into another retirement plan simple descriptive statistics such as these however can be misleading because they show the relationship between only two variables for example between age and the likelihood of rollover or between the amount of the distribution and the likelihood of rollover in fact there are many variables that simultaneously affect the rollover decision and some of them have strong in teraction effects on each other in other words the decision to roll over lumpsum or to spend it is affected not just by the recipients age and not just by the size of the distribution but by both of thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30496crs16 20 the tax reform act of 1986 placed 10 ex cise tax on pension distributions received before age 59½ that are not rolled over into another retirement plan the unemployment compensation amendments of 1992 required empl oyers to offer direct rollover option to departing employees and to withhold for income taxes 20 of distributions paid directly to recipients results were similar in second m odel that included all recipients of lumpsums regardless of age in the year of distributi on or the year the distribution was receivedfactors and many others this decision like all economic choices is made in the context of numerous considerations to study the relationship between the ro llover decision and set of variables suggested by both economic theory and previous researc h crs developed regression model in which the dependent or response variable could have two possible values 1 true if the entire lumpsum distribution was rolled over into another retirement plan and 2 false if any of the distri bution was used for any other purpose the independent vari ables we tested were the individuals age in the year the distribution was received race sex ma rital status level of education presence of one or more children in the family home ownership monthly income the amount of the lumpsum distribution and the year the distribution was received in the model we restricted the sample to lumpsums received after 1986 by people under age 60 in the year of the distribution results of the model are shown in table 6 20 interpreting the regression results we used logistic regression or logit for our analysis this is form of multivariate regression that was developed to study relationships in which the dependent response variable can have only limited number of values such as yes true or false in this model the dependent variable indicates wh ether lumpsum distribution was rolled over into another retirement account 1 yes 2 the model measures the likelihood of observing the dependent variable having valu of 1 yes when particular independent variable is changed given that every other independent variable is held constant at its mean value the model estimates coefficient also called parameter estimate for each independent variable and calculates the standard error of the estimate the standard error measures how widely the coefficients are lik ely to vary from one observation to another in general the greater the absolute value of the parameter estimate the more likely it is to be statistically significant statistical significance is expressed in confidence intervals that are measured as the 10 level 05 level and 01 level if variable is significant at the 05 confidence level for example there is only oneintwenty chance that it is not related to the dependent variable in the way that the model has predicted the model also generates for each independent variable statistic called the odds ratio the odds ratio is measure of how much more or less likely it is for specific outcome to be observed when particul ar independent variable is true x1 than it is when that independent variable is false x0 for example in this model home ownership is measured as having value of 1 if the recipient of lu mpsum distribution was homeowner and 0 otherwise in table 6 this variable is shown as having an odds ratio of 169 this means that the dependent variable is 69 more likely to have value of 1 rollover yes when the dependent variable own home has value of 1 yes as when it has value of 0 in other words other things being equal and measured at their mean values recipient of lumpsum distri bution who owned or was buying home was about 69 more likely than renter to have rolled over the entire lump sum into another retirement planhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30496crs17 21 we designated 3500 as the upper limit for the smallest category because most of the distributions in this analysis occurred in years when 3500 was the largest amount that an employer could pay to departing empl oyee without securing written consentour analysis of data from the sipp found that the variable with the strongest relationship to the likelihood that lump sum distribution was rolled over was the amount of the distribution in the regression model lumpsum distributions were divided into four size categories less than 3500 3500 to 9999 10000 to 19999 and 20000 or more21 all amounts were adjusted to 2003 dollars relative to distributions of less than 3500 the probability that distribution was rolled over was positive and statistically significant for all larger distribution amounts lump sums of 3500 to 9999 we re 63 more likely to be rolled over than lump sums of less than this amount lumpsum distributions of 10000 to 19999 were 102 more likely to be rolled over than lump sums of less than 3500 distributions of 20000 or more were 329 more likely to be rolled over than were distributions of less than 3500 the variable indicating the year the distribution was received had positive and statistically significant relationship to the probability that lumpsum distribution was rolled over into another retirement pla n other things being equal lump sums received in 1993 or later were 38 more likely to have been rolled over than those received between 1987 and 1992 race was also significant variable on th model white recipients of lump sum distributions were 96 more likely than nonwhite recipients to have rolled over their distribution into an ira or other re tirement plan on the one hand this result may be seen as troubling because the regression model controls for the effects of other variables such as income and education that correlate with race on the other hand given that access to financial information and advice is partly dependent on ones occupation and industry of employ ment it may be possible to influence savings behavior through pub lic policies such as subsidizing the distribution of information to workers about the longter m consequences of spending rather than saving preretirement pension distribution home ownership and being married were positively and significantly related to the probability that lumpsum distribution was rolled over homeowners were about 69 more likely to ve rolled over their most recent lumpsum distribution purchasing home is itself form of investment and controlling for the effects of income homeowners have what economists call revealed preference for saving and investment compared to rent ers other things being equal married individuals were 35 more likely than unm arried persons to have rolled over lump sum distribution into retirement plan the presence of children in the family however had negative relationship to the probability of rolling over distribution people with children under age 18 were 30 less likely to have rolled over distribution compared to people with ch ildren the likely reason for the negative impact on rollovers of children in the family is that people with children face numerous expenses that childless individua ls do not these additional financial responsibilities could make th preservation of lumpsum distribution lower priority than it otherwise would behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30496crs18 age in the year of the distribution education and average monthly income were included in the model in broadly defined categories recipients were grouped into four age categories according to when they received their most recent distribution under 35 35 to 44 45 to 54 and 55 or ol der relative to recipients under age 35 workers aged 35 to 44 and those aged 45 to 54 were 28 and 29 more likely respectively than the youngest group to have rolled over their most recently received lump sum recipients aged 55 and olde r were 48 more likely than those under 35 to have rolled over their most recently received lump sum distribution recipients were cla ssified into three groups designating their highest year of education up to 12 years of school 1 to 3 years of college and 4 or more years of college having completed college bore significant and positive relationship to the probability that lump sum was rolled over relative to those with high school education or less recipients with 1 to 3 years of college were 27 more likely to have rolled over their distribution into an ira or other retirement plan college graduates however were 206 more likel than those with just high school education to have rolled over their most recent lumpsum distribution this result could be considered encouraging to the prospect that savings behavior can be influenced by efforts to educate workers about the importance of saving pension distributions for their needs during retirement the sipp collected information about respondents current earnings but not their earnings in the year they received their most recent lumpsum distribution current earnings were entered into the regression model as proxy for income in the year the distribution was received the respondents average monthly income in 2003 was grouped into three categorie s under 2000 2000 to 3999 and more than 4000 on an annualized basis these groupings correspond to yearly earnings of under 24000 24000 to 48000 and more th an 48000 respectively relative to recipients with monthly earnings of less than 2000 those who had earnings from 2000 to 3999 were neither mo re nor less likely to ve rolled over their most recent lumpsum distribution into an ira or other retirement account the sign for this variable was positive but the coefficient was not statistically significant having monthly income of more than 4000 was significantly and positively related to the likelihood that distribution was rolle d over individuals with monthly income of more than 4000 were 101 more likely to have rolled over their most recent lump sum the variable indicating the recipients sex was statistically significant but just barely at the 10 level other things being equal men were 15 less likely than women to have rolled over their most recent lumpsum distribution into another retirement planhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30496crs19 table 6 disposition of lumpsum distributions

half of lumpsum distributions from retirement plans have been rolled over into iras or another employersponsored plan about twothirds of the dollars distributed as lump sums have been rolled over increases in the pr oportion of distributions that are rolled over followed both the imposition of an excise tax on nonrollovers by the tax reform act of 1986 and the tax withholding and in stitutional rollover mechanisms mandated by the unemployment compensation amendments of 1992 however the percentage of recently received lumpsum distributions that were rolled over into another plan was only slightly higher in the census bureaus 2003 survey than it had been in the 1998 survey in 1998 424 of respondents who had received lump sum distribution within the last five years reported that they had rolled over the full amount of the distribution into another retirement plan in 2003 the comparable figure was 458 an increase of just 34 percentage points in the percentage of recent distributions that were rolled over into another retirement plan many recipients of lumpsums who did not roll over their distributions into an ira or other retirement plan saved at least some of the money in another way while 44 of recipients rolled over the entire am ount another 40 used at least part of their lumpsum to purchase home or busine ss invest in stocks or bonds or to make deposit to savings account thus 84 of ll recipients saved at least part of their lumpsum distribution however taking di stribution and saving part of it is not taxefficient way to save distributions received before age 59½ that are not directly rolled over into another tax qualified retirement plan ar subject to both ordinary income tax and 10 additional tax while the lumpsum distributions th at were not rolled over tended to be relatively small with median value of 4000 compared to median value of 12000 for lumpsums that were rolled over most were received by workers who were more than 20 years away from retirement consequently many of these distributions could have grown to substa ntial amounts had they been rolled over into iras or other retirement plans among the sample of lumpsum recipients examined in this report those who did not roll over their most recent lump sum distribution gave up retirement wealth with an estima ted median value of 31000 at age 65 if it had been invested in stocks or 20000 if it had been invested in bonds the tax policies that cong ress has adopted toward early distributions from retirement plans represent compromise among several competing objectives including encouraging participation among em ployers and employees in these plans promoting the preservati on of retirement assets allowing participants to have access to their retirement savings when they would otherwise face subs tantial economic hardship and assuring that the tax preferences granted to pensions and retirement plans are not used for purposes ot her than to fund workers future financial securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30496crs21 if any one of these objectives were pa ramount devising the most effective policy would be relatively straightforwar d undertaking if preserving retirement assets were the only importa nt consideration congress c ould require all distributions from pension plans to be rolled over into another account and held there until the individual reaches retirement age stricter limits on access to retirement funds before retirement however could inhibit empl oyee participation in retirement savings plans this in turn could result in mo re people being unprepared for retirement than currently results from some preretirement distributions being spent rather than saved likewise allowing easier access to retirement savings could help people meet other important expenses but only at th expense of less financial security in retirement given the competing demands that congress faces in devising tax policy for preretirement distributions from pensions and retirement savings plans the most likely outcome is that these policies will continue to represent compromise among competing objectives policy analysts who have studied the effects of federal tax laws on the disposition of lumpsum distribu tions have suggested several options for consideration including changing the tax rate or the withholding rate on lumpsum distributions that are not ro lled over having the tax rate vary with the age of the recipient or with the size of the distribution requiring at least pa rt of the distribution to be rolled over directly in to another retirement plan nd encouraging plan sponsors to educate recipients about the importance of preserving these distributions so that the funds will be available to provide for their financial security during retirement
