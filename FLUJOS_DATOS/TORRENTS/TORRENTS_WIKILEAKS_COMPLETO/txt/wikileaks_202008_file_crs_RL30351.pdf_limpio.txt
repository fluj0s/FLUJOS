government and finance division updated january 11 2001 abstract the purpose of this report is to describe the potential eﬀects on saving of moving from the current hybrid incomeconsumption tax structure to primarily consumption based tax the current tax treatment of selected saving instruments is described as well as the potential aﬀect of consumption tax on their attractiveness to the saver many believe that implementing consumption based tax will encourage more saving however saving incentives under the present income tax already encourage long term saving thus the report suggests that moving to consumption tax might not produce the anticipated increases in savinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30351congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congressreceived

divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30351consumption taxes and the level and composition of saving summary many proposals for tax reform would shift the base of taxation from income to consumption two arguments for consumption tax are frequently made one consumption tax is argued to encourage saving at least more so than the current income tax and two consumption tax is often considered more efficient means of tax collection in this paper the merits of these arguments are analyzed to accomplish this the present income tax is compared to generic consumption tax by definition consumption tax does not include nonconsumed accretions to wealth in the tax base hypothetically each individual has savings account where unspent income accumulates over the course of the year all net gains to the account are deducted from wage earnings and net losses to the account added the resulting total is the individuals consumption and represents the taxable base the appropriate tax rate is then applied to the derived annual consumption all saving is in effect free from taxation however the added saving incentive or lack of disincentive implicit in move to consumption tax may not be as large or effective as anticipated the current tax code already favors saving through variety of income tax advan tages for non consumption further to the extent consumption tax does ease the tax burden on saving evidence is ambiguous on the magnitude of response that would occur thus shift from the current income tax to consumption tax may not produce as large gain in saving as some theorists suggest it would however likely result in reallocation of existing saving among different saving vehicles the purpose of this report is to explore the current tax treatment of nonconsumed income and to analyze the likely effect on saving specifically retirement saving of adopting consumption taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30351contents saving under current tax laws compared to consumption tax 2 social

overview by james m bickleyconsumption taxes and the level and composition of saving this report examines how the composition of saving might change with the introduction of consumption tax specifically the report analyzes the possible impact of consumption based tax system on various forms and levels of saving1 in 1999 annua l personal saving in the united states was 22 percent of disposable personal income much lower than in other developed economies2 another measure of saving gross saving as percent of gross national product averaged 171 over the 1990s 1990 to 1999 significant decline from 209 in the 1960s 1960 to 19693 the cause of the relatively low saving rate is frequent topic of study for economists as well as policy makers many economists suggest that the design of our tax code alters the saving decision perhaps partially explaining the relatively low saving balances in response policy makers have introduced legislation in several recent congresses which taxes consumption instead of income hoping to encourage more saving as well as improve economic efficiency4 logically if individuals can either consume or save and consumption is taxed and saving not then saving should increase and consumption decline under consumption tax several forms of consumption taxes which are thought to encourage saving have been proposed in past years three prominent proposals in previous sessions include the nunndomenici usa tax 104th congress s 722 the armey flat tax 106th congress hr 1040 and the tauzin retail sales tax 106th congress hr 2001 this trend may well continue through the 107th congress review of tax reform legislation in the 106th congress can be found in crs issue brief ib10013 major tax issues in the 106th congress summary the stylized consumption tax analyzed for this report can be modified to resemble any of the above proposalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30351crs2 5assuming that the retirement plan qualifies for such treatment while 401k salary deferrals are thought to be elective employer contributions these amounts are subject to the payroll taxhowever the added saving incentive or lack of disincentive implicit in move to consumption tax may not be as large or effective as thought the current tax code already favors saving through variety of income tax advantages for non consumption further to the extent consumption tax does ease the tax burden on saving evidence is ambiguous on the magnitude of response that would occur consumption tax however likely would result in reallocation of existing saving among different saving vehicles the purpose of this report is to explore the current tax treatment of nonconsumed income and to analyze the likely effect on saving specifically retirement saving of adopting consumption tax the first section describes the current tax treatment of various saving vehicles and analyzes the effect on particular saving instruments when moving to typical consumption tax the second section reviews the current literature addressing the effectiveness of saving incentives and the last section offers some concluding comments saving under current tax laws compared to consumption tax the present federal tax structure has two basic vehicles for revenue collection payroll tax and an income tax first step in understanding the preferences for each saving vehicle is to identify the location along the income and expenditure cycle where the tax preference is applied the payroll tax is applied at the earliest stage when wages are paid and the employer and employee each pay an equal share here deferred compensation such as employer contributions to pension plan are not included in wages and thus are not subject to the payroll tax5 this is the first tax preference for long term saving the remainder of the paycheck including the employees share of the payroll tax is considered taxable income for the income tax some wages paid after the payroll tax can however avoid the income tax income as typically defined in economics includes all accretions to wealth over the tax year and as such includes capital income as well as wage income the second tax preference appears at this stage the inside buildup arising from investments in certain tax favored retirement accounts including iras generally are not included in the income tax base alternatively most investments in liquid nonretirement vehicles do not enjoy such treatment and are subject to the income tax the third tax preference arises from the tax deferral of some deposits into retirement accounts all else equal rational taxpayers prefer to pay taxes later rather than sooner the simplest example is an ira where up to 2000 single filer may be deductible and thus not subject to the income tax for an individuals in the higher marginal income tax brackets this advantage translates into significant tax saving when the funds are withdrawn at retirement the income tax is applied usually when the taxpayer resides in lower marginal tax bracket variation of this advantage is the backhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30351crs3 6see samwick andrew tax reform and target saving nber working paper 6640 july 1998 he recognizes the same tax preferences taxfree refers to the fact that annual gains to the fund are not taxed 7in addition to providing different tax consequences short and long term saving are motivated by different objectives 8economists refer to these effects as the income and substitution effects respectively 9another aspect is the overall objective of the tax reform we assume throughout this report that the tax change is revenue neutralloaded roth ira where instead of deposits being income tax free withdrawals are income tax free summarizing the current tax code has three primary tax preferences for saving payroll tax exemption tax free inside buildup and tax deferral on funds deposited until savings are received6 the tax preferences generally apply to long term saving rather than short term savingfor example to pensions and not bank deposits and accordingly the next section focuses primarily on long term saving instruments7 moving to consumption tax would have two countervaili ng effects the removal of the disincentive on short term saving eg time deposits such as certificates of deposit will appear as an increase in future income the rate of return is now higher given interest earnings are not taxed and individuals may respond to the tax cut with increased consumption today and lower saving in other words less needs to be saved today to meet future expenditure targets conversely the consumption tax will also raise the price of current consumption and lower the price of future consumption saving taxpayers may sacrifice current consumption for future consumption which is now less expensive this move away from current consumption would counter the income genera ted push for greater consumption today which effect dominates dictates what happens to overall savings8 some observers believe that retirement saving or more generally long term saving will decline and short term saving increase as short term investments gain tax equivalency another layer of analysi s might explore the generational effects of the two principal forms of consumption tax9 wage tax and retail consumption tax are theoretically identical for the young the same level of revenue can be raised through collecting fixed percentage of wage payments or fixed percentage of consumption expenditures the only difference being the rate of taxation the consumption base is smaller thus the fixed percentage would have to be higher to raise the same level of revenue assuming there are two types of taxpayers older and younger where the older generation is dissaving and the younger saving the type of tax will have differential effects on these cohorts retail consumption tax would increase the burden on the older americans who are dissaving and the younger generation would enjoy relatively lower tax burden wage tax would have the opposite effect where older americans assumed to be living off of accumulated wealth would recognize tax reduction to be paid for by the younger cohort thus underlying the analysis is the potential for differential distributional effects generated by the style of consumptionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30351crs4 10us social security

participated in some type of retirement other than or in addition to social security in 19931994 source ebri databook on employee benefits 4th edition washington dc employee benefits research institute 1997tax chosen for ease of exposition this paper assumes taxpayers do not change their consumption patterns over the lifecycle following is more detailed review of savings vehicles categorized by their tax treatment the current tax preference if any of the vehicle is described then the anticipated effect of consu mption tax on the vehicle is discussed theoretically assets in vehicles previously tax advantaged will shift to vehicles now on equal footing in the tax code the list is by means comprehensive social security social security is perhaps the most commonly known source of retirement savings social security is funded by the payroll tax where almost every working american contributes 765 of their salary before income taxes to the social security trust fund the 765 is composed of 62 for old age and survivors disability insurance oasdi retirement up to adjusted gross income of 72600 1999 tax year and 145 for medicare hi which applies to all wages regardless of income employers match the employee contributions calendar year 1998 payroll tax contributions to the oasdi portion of the social security trust fund were approximately 430 billion and the hi portion collected 124 billion10 social security benefits are often not taxed however higher income individuals gradually lose tax free status of their social security benefit disbursements the current tax code favors social security savings however the return is lower than most other retirement vehicles even considering the privileged tax status if payroll tax funding for social security remained under consumption tax balances in the social security trust fund would become partially dependent upon the employers choice of employee compensation without the ability to predict employer tradeoffs between deferred compensation and wage compensation the net impact on the social security trust fund are difficult to project taxfavored employersponsored pensions11 employersponsored pensions do not cover as many participants as the nearly universal social security system though majority of working adults have some type of retirement benefit other than social security12 these plans usually enjoy all of the tax preferences outlined earlier however to maintain their tax preferred status most employer sponsored pensions are subject to nondiscrimination regulations to ensure that highly compensated employees are not disproportionately favored in the pensionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30351crs5 13the minimum participation test which does not apply since 1997 to defined contribution plans requires that at least 50 employees participate in the defined benefit plan if small employer then the greater of 40 of employees or two employees must participate 14referred to as cliff vesting which implies that 100 vesting occurs at one point in time as opposed to gradual increments program some plan types usually for small businesses need not comply with nondiscrimination regulations nevertheless to maintain tax preferred status most plans generally must satisfy the coverage and nondiscrimination tests13 defined benefit pension plans defined benefit pensions provide target income for the employees retirement often these plans are integrated with social security to provide given retirement package that meets target income both employer and employee contributions are dedu ctible within limits the limit on deductible contributions are calculated based upon the future benefit distributions generally to remain tax favored the annual indexed retirement benefit cannot exceed 100 of the participant s average compensation over the three highest consecutive years of compensation in addition to the benefit limitation the computed average annual compensation cannot exceed the indexed dollar amount of 130000 for limitations ending in 1999 if the caps are binding on an individual the benefit package is often augmented by another nontax favored retirement arrangement for almost all defined benefit pension plans full vesting must occur within five years of continuous employment or seven years under graded vesting the vesting requirement is designed to keep the employee with the company long enough to cover much of the firms initial human capital expenditures if substantial portion of retirement earnings are held contingent upon remaining with the firm for the vesting period then the firm can potentially recover some of the training and hiring costs invested in the employee however the same objective could be achieved without holding retirement contributions until employees are vested lump sum payments after benchmark number of years of employment are arguably more efficient method of remuneration for loyalty the present income tax favors retirement fund vesting over the lump sum design through the deductibility of annual pension contributions and the exemption from payroll taxes for example assume that company x contributes 5 of an employees salary to defined benefit pension for five years at which time the employee becomes fully vested14 if the employee were to leave before becoming vested the funds residing in the pension fund remain in the pension trust the present five year limit on cliff vesting allows company x to effectively shelter avoiding taxation earnings in retirement plans for up to five years alternatively lump sum distribution under the current income tax is less desirable from the firms perspective given the inability to shelter periodic contributions as is the case with pension contributions consumption tax would treat loyalty incent ives more equally reducing the advantage of deferred compensation although the existence of the payroll tax would still discourage the lump sum apparatus and favor the deferred compensationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30351crs6 15another factor is the administrative cost of retirement plans assuming lump sum plans are not subject to the pension benefit guarantee corporation pbgc premium and non discrimination rules they may be less expensive to administer the pbgc is analogous to the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic which insures bank deposits 16if pension contributions are still exempt from the payroll tax they would still be favored over wage payments consumption tax proposals are mixed in their treatment of the payroll tax flat taxes and value added taxes generally leave the payroll tax intact 17though not explored in depth another factor to consider is the role of antidiscrimination continuedretirement vehicle however the diminution of the tax advantage may induce shift from retirement pensions to lump sum distributions15 another complication affecting the defined benefit pension system when shifting to consumption tax is the effect on the insurance agency overseeing defined benefit pension plans in response to the expected decline of new participant enrollment the pension benefit guarantee corporation pbgc may need to increase premiums to compensate for funding shortfalls the increase in administrative costs of maintaining the benefit plan would further discourage this style of compensation in summary focusing on employer behavior shift from the present income tax to consumption tax could lead to lower retirement savings in general as employer defined benefit pension contributions are longer as tax advantaged without the impetus of employer contributions and incen tives employees with more saving flexibility may not choose the same level and time profile of saving that currently characterizes defined benefit pensions defined contribution pension plans for these plans the most common of which are referred to as 401k and 403b plans employer contributions up to the statutory limit of 10000 are deductible business expenses and the total contribution including the employees share is limited to the lower of 25 of pay or 30000 annually employees defer taxes on accumulated interest and principal until funds are withdrawn after age 59½ early withdrawals are assessed 10 excise tax unless the participant has died become disabled taken an early retirement after age 55 or incurred excessive medical expenses transfers to other tax deferred retirement accounts may also be exempt from the excise tax the 401k and 403b plans popularity stems from the comprehensive tax advantage and the shift of potential investment risk and return from the employer to the employee under the consumption tax if pension contributions are included in the tax base as in the usa tax employers and employees will longer enjoy the tax advantages of contributing to 401k plans and as such employees will likely opt for direct wage compensation16 the impact on saving will depend upon how individuals choose to spend the additional income if the pension plan were inducing saving beyond the employee s target the income effect would dominate and saving would decline on the other hand if the employee would save more if not for the strictures on 401k balances then removing the liquidity constraints may induce greater saving albeit possibly short term saving17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30351crs7 17continued laws presently in the tax code generally retirement plans must follow guidelines that ensure lower income workers are offered similar retirement benefits of the higher income workers to achieve equality between low and high income workers employers will often induce the low income employees to contribute to retirement plan replacing the current income tax with consumption tax would remove the lowincome worker forced saving 18according to the invest ment company institute 1998 table 4 in 1997 42 of iras were in mutual funds 38 in brokerages 13 in banks and 7 in life insurance companies 19the deductibility phase out is complete when income for single filer reaches 43000 and 63000 for joint filers the range of values increases until 2005 for single filers and through 2007 for joint filersin summary employer sponsored defined contribution plans will more than likely decline in popularity with consumption tax wages and pensions deferred compensation under the consumption tax are treated much more equally than under the present income tax if the equality is extended through the elimination of the payroll tax the dampening effect on defined contribution plans is even more extreme with both defined benefit and defined contribution plans the typical consumption tax eliminates all pecuniary incentives for employer sponsored pension plans as such the likely effect on this style of forced saving when moving from the current income tax to consumption tax would be to reduce long term saving however the reallocation from employer sponsored plans to those initiated by the employee would partially compensate for the impact on employer sponsored plans taxfavored personal saving taxfavored personal savings gain their advantage through their deferral of income taxes and on their tax free inside buildup the deferral can have an added benefit for those who avoid taxes while still in the higher tax bracket and pay taxes on deferred income when they enter lower tax bracket in contrast to the employer contributions to employee pensions contributions to personal accounts are subject to the payroll tax ie are not deductible and amounts above statutory limits are included in the income tax base the following section focuses on the income tax treatment rather than the overall tax liability incorporated into the return of the asset individual retirement accounts iras funds designated as an ira account are typically invested through banks mutual funds or securities firms18 these plans are not salary deferral plans and as such employers have little direct influence on the amount held in these accounts individuals with wage income can contribute up to 2000 per year in an account before income taxes prior to reaching the age 70 ½ however there is an income cap for full deductibility for those with an employer plan to maintain full deductibility from gross income the maximum adjusted gross income agi in 2001 for single filer is 33000 and for those filing jointly 5300019 without the deductibility from income taxes the sole advantage of the ira is the tax deferral of accumulated earnings until distribution after the age of 59 ½ most early withdrawals are assessed 10 penalty variation of the above account is the roth ira roth ira allows for after tax contributions which grow without any future tax liability like tax exempthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30351crs8 20falsely constrained meaning that they would have contributed more if not for the contribution limit for more information see engen eric m william g gale and john carl scholz do saving incentives work brookings papers on economic activity number 1 1994 p 136 data are from the mid 1980sbond the annual contribution limit is the same as the standard ira 2000 but unlike the traditional ira contributions are allowed after age 70 ½ also the income phase out of deductibility is set much higher for the roth iras for single filers the phase out begins at an agi of 95000 and is complete at 110000 the phase out range for joint filers is agi of 150000 through 160000 distributions are tax free if the account is held for at least five years and the individual is over age 59 ½ if those conditions are not met early withdrawals of funds not previously taxed are included in gross income and assessed 10 penalty however withdrawals are treated as coming first from taxed contributions younger investors in lower marginal tax brackets would benefit the most from roth ira contributions under consumption tax one could think of all saving as an ira without limit except that you could not use existing assets to finance contributions to analyze the effect of switch to consumption tax on the level of assets in iras it is informative to subdivide savers into two types those saving at the ira limit and those not saving at the ira limit for those at the limit it is reasonable to assume that they have additional assets beyond the ira more than likely those additional assets are not receiving the taxfavored treatment inherent in iras however in return for lack of tax advantage these assets are often more liquid and may have an after tax return relatively close to the ira the change to consumption tax will then bestow the tax preference upon these assets which were previously not tax favored which in turn induces shift from iras to these accounts one might then expect limit savers to abandon iras for the now more lucrative liquid assets the savers that have not reached the annual ira limit probably do not have significant discretionary saving beyond the ira nevertheless they are also likely to switch to accounts that exhibit greater flexibility and rates of return although the transi tion may not be as seamless as for those with other taxable saving accounts already in place whether the entire ira balance is shifted is dependent upon the countervailing income and substitution effects alluded to earlier these savers will be induced to save more if ira illiquidity were the predominant reason for saving less than the limit the increased liquidity of saving in general would appear to these savers as an increase in the attractiveness of saving however if they are saving for target the income effect would dominate and saving would decrease as the rate of return has increased in summary with the limit on deductibility for iras removed those that are presently contributing the maximum amount will likely save in different accounts those that are not contributing at the limit may save less as the income effect dominates for target savers engen gale and scholz 1994 calculate that only 57 of all ira contributors were falsely constrained by the contribution limit20 this finding indicates that those who would react the removal of the limit are in the significant minority of ira savershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30351crs9 21indeed one could make the argument that all consumer durables are tax favored although true homes represent much larger expenditure and are most often considered assets 22see capozza dennis r richard k green and patric h hendershott taxes mortgage borrowing and residential land prices in aaron henry j and william gale eds economic effects of fundamental tax reform first edition 1996 the brookings institution p 196 they estimate that prices will fall by approximately 10 life insurance life insurance policies are free from taxation of the inside buildup also employers are allowed to deduct life insurance premiums if the business is not direct or indirect beneficiary though relatively insignificant in terms of total assets invested this form of saving does benefit from the current income tax rules consumption tax would expand the deductibility of contributions though other saving instruments with greater flexibility and would compete for assets previously held in life insurance owner occupied housi ng the primary income tax advantage of owner occupied housing is the absence of tax on imputed rental income that is occupiers of their own home do not pay tax on the stream of residential services the home in effect provides comprehensive income tax would include such income the best way to exhibit this is through an example first assume two individuals purchase homes next to each other if they trade places and rent to one another then they both would claim their rental income as regular income21 the absence of tax on the imputed rental income creates an advantage for owner occupied housing over other types of investment there are two other tax preferences for housing relative to other consumer goods often cited albeit for itemizers income tax exemption for mortgage interest payments and deduction for local property taxes paid another advantage of housing investment is the ability to exclude capital gains taxes on sales gains from home sales after may 6 1997 are not included in taxable income capped at 250000 for single filers and 500000 for joint filers the strongest condition for receiving this tax break is that the taxpayer must have lived in the old house for at least 2 of the 5 years before the sale to exclude the capital gain home ownership is clearly strongly favored asset under the current income tax with consumption tax where taxes are paid when funds are removed from saving account the effect on housing stock is uncertain the financing and prices of homes however will adjust home purchases can be financed with either debt or equity drawing down financial assets to purchase home with equity becomes expensive because the consumption tax will apply to net change s in the savings account balance buying house with debt on the other hand becomes relatively more lucrative paying off the mortgage appears as net gain to the saving account and can lower tax liability many may even refinance homes to take advantage of this tax prefere nce as for the price of housing capozza green and hendershott suggest that the price of housing will decline as the previous tax advantages including the mortgage interest and property tax deductions are eliminated22 indeed with lower prices long term adjustments may include decline in the stock of housing or slower growth than would have taken place under the present tax systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30351crs10 23however many mutual fund families have tax advantaged funds that invest in income tax free municipal debttaxed personal saving the current income tax does not have any provisions that favor the following types of investments however the capital gains tax that applies to them in some cases has been gradually reduced thus decreasing the tax liability over time equities corporate equities have perhaps the least favorable income tax treatment corporations are taxed on net income and thus indirectly so are the shareholders in addition dividend payments and realized capital gains that occur throughout the year are taxed again through the individual income tax the double taxation of shareholders investment in corporations discourages this type of saving however the potential return of equity investments has been significantly greater over the long term than other investment options investment in equities by individu als directly or through mutual funds may become more popular under consumption tax in theory however equity prices under flat tax style consumption tax would decline in value generally new capital investment is immediately expensed under the flat tax which raises the effective rate of return of new capital relative to old capital thus existing equity prices of firms with old capital should drop to compensate for this lower relative return in addition pension funds which currently hold mix of equities bonds and cash may shift away from equities into less volatile assets such as bonds to reflect the generally risk averse nature of individuals presently pension managers design pension plans with long term growth objectives in mind which on most accounts includes significant share of assets held in equities when individuals have greater role in asset alloc ation decisions it is uncertain whether they will choose the same profile of assets possibly risk averse individuals will choose less volatile asset mixes which could possibly imply smaller share of equities the increase in demand for direct ownership of equities resulting from their new found tax preference may be accompanied by drop in demand for equities as short term saving arrangements with less volatility become more prevalent and equity prices in general decline in short it is difficult to predict which effect will prevail financial intermediary instruments short term saving accounts such as certificates of deposit cds traditional passbook savings accounts and retail non retirement mutual fund accounts generall do not possess any income tax advantages23 the liquidity offered by these savings vehicles explains much of their popularity if the relative tax disadvantage of short term savings accounts were eliminated the level of saving in these accounts would almost surely increase under consumption tax assets held in these accounts will clearly expand as their tax disadvanta ge vanishes with the consumption tax however the additional funds in these accounts may not represent new saving rather shift from previously tax advantaged accounts such as iras and other retirement accounts httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30351crs11 24somewhat paradoxically existing capital owners may not fare as well thus capital intensive industries may not initially benefit from move to consumption taxdirect business investment capital investment by small business is in sense saving entrepreneurs invest with the hopes that the business will earn rate of return that exceeds that of other potential investments the tax code does little to encourage such investment other than immediate expensing for capital expenditures by small businesses and accelerated depreciation deductions for tax year 2001 24000 of business investment in qualified property generally equipment is considered business expense which is essentially consumption tax treatment this limit rises to 25000 in 2003 and is available only to qualified small businesses once 200000 worth of qualified property is put in place the provision is gradually phased out if all business investment were to qualify as saving under proposed consumptio n tax the usa tax for example assets held in business investments should theoretically increase consumption tax would appear to encourage new investment as capital purchases are immediately deductible without limits under our present income tax the deductibility is roughly stretched over the life of the investment through depreciation thus there could be an increase in new business investment when moving to consumption tax given the front loaded deductibility24 economic theory would also predict the consu mption tax to encourage capital investment over labor thus saving in the form of business investment eligible for expensing would likely increase under consumption tax summary the current tax code clearly favors some types of saving over others most economists would suggest that the variety of saving instruments available has complicated the tax code and created disto rtions in taxpayer behavior one could argue that current tax provisions serve to encourage those who would not save for retirement to do so others contend that inducing individuals to move into illiquid retirement saving may not necessarily be desirable there are two general points to keep in mind one the relative tax treatment of various saving vehicles would change under consumption tax therefore the distribution of saving would also change and two since some saving is already tax favored its relative treatment may not be greatly improved by any of the contemplated changes following is review of current literat ure addressing the individuals saving decision generally there are macroeconomic issues such as the national saving rate and micro economic issues such as individual choice of saving instrument tax reform which introduces some variant of consumption tax has implications for both branches of researchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30351crs12 25carroll chris topher bufferstock saving and

economic activity number 1 1994 and carroll christopher d and andrew samwick how important is precautionary saving review of economics and statistics vol 80 3 august 1998 pp 410419 have all explored precautionary balances or buffer stock saving 26the amount held as buffer is some target portion of permanent income saving literature review the purpose of this literature review is to explore the effect on saving when moving from the current income tax to stylized consumption tax certainly the answer is dependent upon how individuals respond to change in the relative price of saving especially retirement saving much of the existing literature on retirement saving has focused primarily on the affect on saving of some external change in the tax rules affecting particular saving incentive others have explored more general question that is what happens to saving when the rate of return changes both branches of the literature are relevant to the analysis of consumption tax where all saving vehic are treated equally though not addressing precisely the same question previous literature can still be used successfully as guidepost for explaining what might happen when consumption tax is introduced tax reform and saving literature recently academic interest in retirement saving under consumption tax has intensified research by christopher d carroll and andrew samwick introduced an expanded life cycle model to explain the potential effects on saving when moving to consumption based tax25 the basic lifecycle model is motivated by the observation that individuals have lifetime earnings profile that begins relatively low rises to peak around midlife then declines after retirement consumption on the other hand is relatively constant over time perhaps growing gradually as one ages thus to maintain constant consumption throughout retirement individuals should save for retirement during their peak earnings years in carroll and samwicks expanded specification saving can also be motivated by the desire to hold bufferstock of saving or precautionary balances26 the inclusion of precautionary balances which are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates reduces the overall sensitivity of saving to changes in the rate of return an increase in the rate of return of saving be it through more favorable tax treatment or changes in market conditions thus does not have the same impact on the level of saving as would be the case in the absence of buffer stock saving the higher return allows for the same future balances to be achieved with smaller annual contributions according to samwick switching to consumption tax which increases the rate of return of all saving would then not increase saving as significantly as some havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30351crs13 27see

significantly higher than those who do not save fact consistent with the argument that saving is normal good the tax break is then enjoyed by those that are relatively well off which would tend to flatten the progressivity of the income taxsuggested samwick concludes that the theory and evidence presented in this paper strongly suggest that this tax reform will result in reduction in private saving27 the inclusion of precautionary balances or as some suggest income uncertainty is not altogether new engen and gale refer to previous analysis noting that the effects of consumption taxes within stochastic lifecycle model model that includes for example uncertainty about future income unemployment disability or illness yields increases in saving that are as much as 80 percent smaller than those produced by certainty lifecycle model28 the analysis of samwick agrees in principle with the proposition that the saving sensitivity to the rate of return is not as strong as the lifecycle hypothesis would suggest29 to that end engen gravelle and smetters compare estimates of the saving response to change in the rate of return which accompanies consumption tax reform30 two of the dynamic tax models examined are based on the lifecycle hypothesis one with precautionary saving the other without the inclusion of precautionary balances or earnings uncertainty yields gains in savings and output that are only half the size of the gains when uncertainty is turned off31 the analysis of samwick and the finding of engen gravelle and smetters serve as evidence that the change in saving under consumption tax is dependent upon how interchangeable long term saving is with precautionary saving it is then not surprising that consistent theme throughout the saving incentive debate is whether or not the funds flowing into tax preferred accounts represent new saving on the one hand if growth in the tax preferred accounts is new saving then the incentive is effective on the other hand if the funds are simply transferred from other saving accounts then the incentive simply benefits those who are already saving32 further if the tax expenditure were funded through public debt the saving incentive may actually reduce national saving by way of reduced federal tax revenueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30351crs14 33see hubbard r glenn and jonathan skinner assessing the effectiveness of

saving vehicle literature the two saving vehicles most commonly studied to identify the saving response to tax changes are the ira and the 401k these saving devices are differentiated in mechanics as well as participation profile iras are personalized retirement accounts where the employer has little if any direct role in contributions 401ks on the other hand are contingent upon employer sponsorship and thus are influenced directly by employer behavior as for who participates hubbard and skinner 1996 note that households who contribute to ira accounts tend to be wealthier older and have higher incomes than those who do not33 the literature reviewed below is structured to reflect the prominent role the tax treatment of iras and 401ks have had in explaining what happens to savings when the price of doing so changes both sides of the debate present rather vigorous arguments to support their views iras venti and wise assume that individuals choose between three avenues for their income tax preferred saving iras regular saving and consumption if tax preferred saving is not perfect substitute for regular saving then the introduction of saving incentive an ira will necessarily be funded partially from reduction in consumption using data from the consumer expenditure survey they find that if the ira limit were raised about twothirds of the increase in ira saving would be funded by decrease in current consumption and about one third from reduction in taxes only very small proportion would come from other saving34 there are two related criticisms of this study one arises from the fact that as the individual saving decision function is modeled all nonira investment is assumed to be relatively homogeneous35 in reality nonira saving can be any manner of saving some very similar in objective to an ira and others very dissimilar clearly those components which are dissimilar will tend to drive the lack of substitutability and ultimately the venti and wise results better specification as suggested by gravelle would group iras and other illiquid long term saving together as an argumen t in the decision function which recognizes that iras will be perfect substitutes for s2 long term saving but not necessarily for consumption or short term saving 36 with this specification whether ira balances represent new saving is uncertain the second criticism arises from the observation that many ira contributors do so at the limit individuals contributing at the limit usually the financially well offhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30351crs15 37poterba james m

an ira the fact that they contribute at the limit is tacit confirmation that the saving incentive is not marginally effective in inducing additional saving with the consumption tax where all saving is tax preferred the comparative tax benefit of ira style saving is effectively removed consequently the marginal incentive to save becomes independent of the relative prices of different saving vehicles rather the choice is between consuming or saving directly not between tax preferred and nontax preferre d thus the literature describing the effects of the incentive effects of iras relative to other types of savin g is not directly applicable when analyzing the changes in saving upon move to consumption tax what can be gleaned from the ira literature is how individuals respond to changes in the rate of return of nonconsumed income when offered the ira option which increased the rate of return of saving there is consensus among economists about the effect on overall saving however there is shift from other types of saving into retirement saving the second vehicle the 401k requires slightly different analysis 401ks poterba venti and wise support the belief that incen tive induced saving is actually new saving37 utilizing the feature of 401k plans that eligibility is contingent upon the employer they compare the level of financial assets of non eligible to eligible workers if the 401k incentive is effective then the level of financial assets of eligible workers should exceed that of noneligible workers controlling for income and demographic characteristics they show that for 1987 the ratio of total financial assets of eligible employees to noneligible was 162 and in 1991 22238 workers eligible for 401k programs appear to be lured into saving more than their ineligible counterparts this evidence is quite convincing but there are potential flaws engen gale and scholz provide series of arguments that question the above experiment39 they do not disagree with the general assumption that 401ks will increase saving for some though they do dispute the size of the effect following are their arguments one comparing cohort which is eligible for saving incentive plan with an otherwise similar cohort which is not eligible for saving incentive plan biases upward the effect of saving incentives it is likely that the eligible cohort has sought out and remained with an employer that offered the 401k saving plan thus the eligible cohort has systematically stronger taste for saving than other households40 two the poterba venti and wise approach examines total assets as opposed to net assets it is conceivable that individuals have assumed more debt tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30351crs16 41again for more comprehensive review of the national saving literature see

financial markets themselves have changed significantly over their period of study thus limiting the reliability of the estimates four the level of saving in 401ks is pretax which overstates their value and finally the poterba venti and wise approach ignores the total compensation package when comparing individuals by income eligible workers are also receiving matching employer contributions which should be considered income when comparing individuals based upon income even though the benefit is deferred compensation it is still compensation and should be included as income national saving literature41 another perspective on the debate is the effect on national saving incentives the estimated revenue loss on saving incentives is 562 billion in 199842 some have argued that this amount if financed through larger budget deficits or smaller surpluses actually reduces national saving43 to counter this argument martin feldstein suggests that the appropriate method of estimating the cost and benefit of saving incentives in his study the incentive is the ira which accounts for 33 billion of the above tax expenditure estimate is to include the growth in investment that produces taxable revenue stream at the corporate level44 through including this revenue feldstein finds the cost of iras in terms of tax revenue lost is offset by about onethird over the first five years and twothirds over the first ten years45 engen gale and scholz again provide counter argument to the above findings46 they argue that the estimates above are inflated for several reasons perhaps the most contentious is the feldstein assumption that at least half of ira saving is new saving an assertion that is refuted by other studies sited earlier with such uncertainty concerning the degree to which ira balances represent new saving predicting tax revenues well into the future is difficulthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30351crs17 the evidence in sum taken in sum the literature does not definitively support the proposition that the use of tax incentives for saving increases private or national saving at least in the short run the contentious debate is not surprising economic theory suggests that the tradeoff between the income and substitution effects associated with tax cut for saving yields ambiguous results what we do know is shift to consumption tax will effectively remove the preference for illiquid ira contributions and encour age shift to short term liquid saving if individuals are as sensitive to the favorable tax treatment of iras in positive direction as suggested by venti and wise then removal of the relative preference for iras will diminish their popularity however as noted above the applicability of the estimates provided by research into the incentive effects of iras is questionable the literature concerning 401ks would also seem to suggest that upon removal of the tax preference for retirement plan contributions assets held in these accounts would likely decline given the lack of employer encouragement through matching contributions as for saving incentive effects on national saving it appears that consensus in the literature has not been reached conclusion generally an efficient tax regime minimizes the distortion of taxpayer behavior consumption based tax which eliminates the peculiarities and preferences inherent in the treatment of saving would eliminate many of the saving incentives presently in place in place of those incentives the consumption tax would instead offer broadly applied incentive to save critical question explored here is whether the existing incentives accomplish similar objective if the current array of incentives in the present income tax are effective then the consumption tax will not significantly encourage more saving when they are removed even though the potential increase in efficiency arising from less distortion in taxpayer behavior might be reason enough for its proponents to endorse consumption based tax it is not clear that saving under consumption tax relative to the present income tax would actually increase beyond existing levels what is fairly certain is that the allocation of saving assets will adjust short term saving will increase and previously tax favored long term saving such as retirement will actually declinehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30351crs18 references aaron henry j and william
