domestic social policy division january 17 2008 abstract guest worker programs are meant to assure employers eg fruit vegetable and horticultural specialty growers of an adequate supply of labor when and where it is needed while not adding permanent residents to the us population they include mechanisms such as the h2a programs labor certiﬁcation process to avoid adversely aﬀecting the wages and working conditions of comparable us workers if changes to the h2a program or creation of new agricultural guest worker program led growers to employ many more aliens the eﬀects of the bracero program might be instructive although the 19421964 bracero program succeeded in expanding the farm labor supply studies estimate that it also harmed domestic farm workers through reduced wages and employment the magnitudes of these adverse eﬀects might diﬀer today depending upon how much the us farm labor and product markets have changed over time but their direction likely would be the

depending upon how much the us farm labor and product markets have changed over time but their direction likely would be the same this report will be updated as warranted background the nation has had long history of gu est worker programs targeted at the agricultural industry which have enabled fa rmers to temporarily import foreign workers to perform seasonal jobs without adding permanent residents to the us population unsuccessful attempts were made during the past few congresses to amend the h2a program the only means currently available to employers who want to legally utilize aliens in temporary farm jobs recent interest among some members of congress in broadbased guest worker prog ram has renewed efforts to enact legislation that relates specifically to the agricultural sector1httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95712crs2 2 in this report workers referred to as us or domestic include nativeborn and foreignborn individuals authorized to work as well as unauthorized aliens in the united states 3 crs report rl30395 farm labor shortages and immigration policy by linda levine hereafter cited as crs report rl30395 farm labor shortages and immigration policy arguments for and against an agricultural guest worker program the elements of the debate concerning an agricultural guest worker program have changed very little over the years its principal points are twofold whether there is an adequate supply of workers in the united states to fulfill the widely fluctuating labor requirements of some farmers and whether the temporary admission of liens to perform seasonal farm jobs adversely affects the labor market prospects of domestic workers2 growers of perishable labori ntensive crops eg fruit vegetable and horticultural specialty products whose demand for directly hired and contr act workers typically peaks during the harvest season argue that they need access to foreign labor because insufficient us workers are available at that time they assert that importing workers to perform seasonal farm tasks does not harm us wo rkers because the two groups do not compete in other words they contend that domestic workers are largely unwilling to perform the farm work in question even if higher wage s were offered them domestic workers it is claimed have more attrac tive alternatives to seasonal farm employment eg nonfarm jobs arguably are less strenuous and dirty as well as more stable and prestigious without access to foreign labor grower advo cates maintain that crops could not be harvested consumer prices would rise due to the reduced supply of usgrown produce and the nation would become more dependent on lowwage foreign competitors for portion of its food supply farm worker advocates contend that if growers raised wages and improved working conditions more domestic workers would be willing to accept seasonal farm employment they assert that the employment and wage prospects of domestic workers are depressed by additions to the us labor supply through guest worker programs it is argued that these programs also harm similarly employed us workers by weakening incentives to develop and adopt innovations that improve their working conditions and laborsaving technologies that increase their productivity and hence the wages of smaller workforce opponents of tem porary alien worker programs further declare that growers prefer foreign over domestic workers because the former are not covered by the same laws as domestic workers eg migrant and s easonal agricultural worker protection act unemployment insurance and social secur ity are less demanding due to lower wages and poorer working conditions in their home countries and are easier to control because they cannot easily work for another us em ployer if the grower terminates them the remainder of this report focuses on the impact an agricultural guest worker program might have on us workers th adequacy of the domestic supply of farm workers is addressed in another crs report3httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95712crs3 the labor market effects economic theory fundamentally the debate ove r the effect on us workers of temporarily admitting foreign workers centers on whether an increas in the supply of labor reduces the wages and employment of domestic workers econo mic theory can help clarify this debate before the entrance of foreign workers to the us labor market the amount of labor that domestic workers are willing to supply to employers is represented by the curve labeled s1 in figure 1 it is upward sloping because workers are willing to supply more labor services in response to higher wages employers demand for labor is represented by the curve labeled d which slopes downw ard because employers are willing to employ more workers at lower wages equilibrium in this labor market occurs at point where those willing to work for wage w1 equals employer willingness to hire at that wage in the absence of foreign labor then u s farm employment is equal to e1 and us farm workers wage rate is equal to w1 the addition of foreign workers expands the total quantity of labor at any given wage rate this is represented by the rightward shift of the supply curve to s2 with the additional labor repr esented by the difference between s1 and s2 this increase in the labor force will only find employment if the wage falls for only at lower wage will employers be willing to hire more workers thus equilibrium after the importation of labor occurs at point b where the wage rate of domestic and alien farm workers drops to w2 and employment of domestic and alien farm workers expands to e2 in summary the theory of s upply and demand predicts that the wage rate for all workers falls from w1 to w2 after the entrance of foreign workers to the us labor market as result of the drop in wages total employment expands from e1 to e2 domestic employment contracts from e1 to e3 and alien worker em ployment is equal to e2 minus e3wage rate w1 w2a

and immigration policy because the lower wage w2 makes farm work less rewarding some domestic workers likely will look for jobs outside the agricultural sector employment of domestic farm workers accordingly will decline from e1 to e3 while the total employment of foreign workers e2 minus e3 expands portion is at th expense of the farm jobs formerly held by domestic workers e1 minus e3 this is called the displacement effect the size of the displacement effect depends on the shape of the labor demand and domestic labor supply curves along with lower domestic employment in agriculture the presence of foreign farm workers reduces the amount of wages that accrue s to domestic farm workers because the addition of foreign workers also expands output agricultural prices are expected to fall and thereby benefit us consumer s including domestic farm workers the h2a program authorized under the immig ration and nationality act at section 101a15hiia as modified by the immigration reform and control act of 1986 irca pl 99603 the h2a program wa s begun in 1952 it allows an unlimited number of foreign workers to temporarily enter the united states to fill seasonal farm jobs at employers who demonstrate the existence of labor shortages by undertaking recruitment requirements prescribed by the us department of labor dol as part of the dols labor certification process farmers applying for ad mission of h2a workers must offer to pay them and domestic workers the higher of the federal or state minimum wage prevailing wage or adverse effect wage ra and to provide fr ee governmentapproved housing to outofarea domestic as well as h2a workers4 principally east coast growers of perishab laborintensive crops who largely did not utilize the bracero program were the origin applicants for h2a workers the h 2a program was able to escape the heavy criticism levelled agains t the bracero program primarily by keeping low profile5 in other words there were great many more braceros than h2a workers when bot h the bracero program 19421964 and h2a program 1952present were in effect the bracero pr ogram is discussed below more recently program data show that dol certification of foreign workers for employment at grower applicants genera lly has been on the rise since fy1999 from 41827 in that year the number of h2a job certifications reached 59112 in fy20066 despite the increase in dol certifications the number of h2a workers remains quite small compared to the 1 million hired farm and agricultural service workers employed in 20067 thus even if the labor certif ication process has not operated as intended to protect similarly employed us workers the h2a programs low utilization suggests that its overall impact on the domestic farm labor force has been minimal however the reliance on the h2a program of tobacco fruit eg apple peachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95712crs5 8 for information on the bracero program see u s congress senate committee on the judiciary temporary worker

in barry chiswick ed the gateway us immigration issues and policies washington american enterprise institute 1982 note the wage loss associated with the bracero program was incurred by authorized and unauthorized farm workers since both groups were incl uded in the labor supply estimateand tomato vegetable eg onion and squash and grain gr owers in some states eg north carolina virginia kentucky idaho ca lifornia and texas might have had more substantial effect on domestic farm workers in certain local labor markets proposals to modify the h2a program eg changing labor certification seemingly would make it easier for growers to temporarily employ foreign workers farmers as consequence would likely impor t more h2a workers than they had previously given authorized aliens potentially greater share of the hired and contract farm labor force as result of changes to guest worker policy it appears that the effects of the bracero program on domestic farm workers are more re levant than the unqua ntified effects of the h2a program the bracero program at its peak in 1956 the bracero program allowed some 445000 mexican workers to take temporary j obs in the us agricultural industry8 the few studies that tried to empirically estima the labor market impact of the bracero program are examined below morgan and gardner examined sevenstate area in which more than 90 of braceros had been employed to estimate th impact of the program on the wage and employment levels of hired farm labor its effect wa s found to be consistent with economic theory the bracero program increased total farm employment reduced employment of domestic farm workers and lowered the farm wage rate morgan and gardner concluded that the wage loss to all nonbracero farm workers was 6 to 7 of total wages paid to farm workers in th bracerousing states between 1953 and 1964 or some 139 million per year in 1977 dollars us farmers were found to have gained from the program by being able to hire about 120000 more workers at 1520 cents less per hour than they would have in the prog rams absence such large employment response about 26 to much smalle r decrease in wages less than 9 is consistent with the informal observation that braceros were substitute for mechanization notably in high plains cotton and that the end of the program substantially accelerated the mechanization of texas cotton this is also the period in which the tomato harvester came into widespread use in california9 wise examined the experience in california for two heavily bracerodependent crops to determine whether us workers would accept farm jobs if wages were raised he estimated that small increase in wages would bring about larger increase in the supply of domestic farm workers in winter melon production 1 in crease in wages was associated with 27 increase in the domes tic supply of labor in strawberry productionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95712crs6 10 donald wise the effect of the br acero on agricultural production in california economic inquiry v xii no4 december 1974 hereafter cited as wise the effect of the bracero on agricultural production in california 11 john d mason the aftermath of the bracero study of the economic impact of the agricultural hired labor market of michi gan from the termination of public law 78 phd diss michigan state university 1969 hereafter cited as mason the aftermath of the bracero

bracero years social science quarterly v 61 1 june 1980a 1 increase in wages was related to 34 increase in the domestic labor supply10 similarly mason found that small increase in wages paid by the formerly bracero dominated pickle industry in michigan induced larger increase in us workers willing to pick the crop11 at least for the midtolate 1960s then these findings appear to refute the notion that increased agricultural w ages would not have prompted many more domestic workers to accept farm employment wise additionally found that termination of the bracero program led to decrease in total employment an increase in us farm worker employment and an increase in wages on strawberry and melon farms in california more precisely he estimated that without bracero labor from the mid1950s to mid1960s domestic farm worker employment in california would have been between 51 in strawberry production and 261 in melon production higher and wa ges would have been between 12 in strawberry production and 67 in melon production higher12 while mason estimated that shortly after the bracero pr ograms demise farm wages rose significantly in michigan he was unable to determine how much the absence of bracero labor or other variables contributed to the increase13 in contrast jones and rice found that the trend in farm wages did not chan ge significantly in four southwestern states between the 1954 1964 bracero pe riod and the 19651977 postbr acero period14 although the latter study would imply that the bracero programs end did not have an impact on farm wages the lack of discernible wage ffect might be explained by the replacement of braceros with unauthorized liens which effectively would have left the supply of labor little changed in summary the limited empirical research on the impact of the bracero program on us workers suggests that while the pr ogram successfully expanded the supply of temporary farm labor it did so at the expens of domestic farm workers as measured by their reduced wages and employment althoug h the magnitudes of these adverse effects might differ today depending on the extent to which us farm bor and product markets have changed over time their direction likely would be the same
