oios assessed the unhcr operation in somalia as ave rage it was adequately run but although the majority of key controls were being applied the ap plication of certain important controls lacked consistency or effectiveness in order not to compr omise the overall system of internal control timely corrective action by management is required programme management for the three partners reviewed reasonable assu rance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accord ance with the subagreements except for danish refugee council drc at norwegian peoples aid npa

was not supported not budgeted for and not author ized by the representation the representative is requesting mrrr to refund the supported amount totalling some us 24000 oios assessed that project financial monitoring was not always effectively performed as evidenced by the deficiencies noted at implementing partners the lack of quarterly spmrs and their verification against implementing

final financial reports summarizing expenditure under qips were not submitt ed by implementing partners supply management assettrak had not been updated for years and sy stematic and comprehensive physical verification had been carried out except for rec ent but incomplete physical count made at the representation for those assets recorded the net book values were overstated given that depreciation was calculated the representation has now started the physical cou nts and taken corrective action at all levels including the corr ect calculation of net book values of assets procurement undertaken by implementing partners nee ded improvement competitive bidding was not always observed and appropriate supporting documents were generally lacking the representation has formally requested implementing partners to comply with the requirements of competition and to adequately document their pro curement transactions training on unhcr procurement procedures has also been provided to key implementing partners security and safety unhcr somalia was rated as moss compliant staff mbers had successfully completed the mandatory security training administration in the areas of administration and finance the unh cr office in somalia generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and proce dures and controls were operating effectively during the period under review however some improvement and strengthening of internal controls was required the representation made profits and losses over the operations of the united nations common air services to which unhcr was member along wit h three other agencies net profit of some us 21000 was generated in 2004 but not reflected in the fmis system due to the lack of guidance from headquarters for the acco unting of such profits the representation explained that it would consult further with dfsm n the issue of accounting for lossessurpluses of the uncas operation entries in the fmis accounting system were not alwa ys supported by adequate documentation many entries were made on the basis of email commu nications with field offices and the supporting documents were only submitted much later with evidence of verification of those documents the representation indicated that appropriate corre ctive measures have been taken travel was often undertaken with prior travel au thorisation by the representation information about such travels was only received up on submission of the travel claims to the branch office the representation has initiated appropriate measu res and indicated that in future travel claims would be settled unless prior travel authorization is issued during 2001 and 2002 unhcr staff in hargeisa were provided free accommodation in unhcr guesthouses without corresponding reduction of solar oios estimated that the solar overpayments in 2002 alone amounted to some us 120000 since the beginning of 2003 staff are longer accommodated in unhcr gue sthouses

operations in somalia the audit was conducted in accordance wit h the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing oios r eviewed the activities of the unhcr representation in somalia based in nairobi kenya and its suboffice in hargeisa and of three of its implementing partners 2 oios previous audit of unhcr in somalia wa s conducted in october 2000 the review focused on the 1998 and 1999 activities cove ring expenditure of us14 million the main issues raised by the audit pertained to the ck of appropriate legal instruments for quick impact projects and the inadequacy of financial re porting monitoring and evaluation of quick impact projects oios found that these issues had still not been ad equately addressed 3 somalia remained without functioning rec ognised central government since the fall of the government of siyad barre in january 1991 d espite the establishment of functional authorities in the northwestern and northeastern pa rt of the country the central and southern zones remain affected by inter and intra clan confl ict the main thrust of the unhcr programme in somalia was to promote the voluntary r epatriation of somali refugees to northern somalia to assist their reintegration an d to facilitate the voluntary repatriation and reintegration of refugees wishing to return to sout hern somalia while providing international protection and assistance to urban refugees and asy lumseekers 4 the findings and recommendations contained in this report have been discussed with the officials responsible for the audited activitie s during the exit conference held on 24 august 2005 summary of preliminary findings and recommendations was shared with the representative in august 2005 the comments wh ich were received in september 2005 are reflected in the final report the representative has accepted the audit recommendatio ns made and is in the process of implementing them ii audit objectives 5 the main objectives of the audit were to ev aluate the adequacy and effectiveness of controls to ensure reliability and integrity of financial and operatio nal information effectiveness and efficiency of operations safeguarding of assets and compliance with regulations and rules letters of i nstruction and subagreements iii audit scope and methodology 6 the audit focused on 2003 and 2004 programm activities under projects 03 04absomrp370 with expenditure of us 56 millio n our review concentrated on the activities implemented by norwegian peoples aid n pa expenditure of us 327000 danish refugee council drc expenditure of us 485000 and ministry of resettlement 2 rehabilitation and reconstruction mrrr expendi ture of us 427000 we also reviewed activities directly implemented by unhcr w ith expenditure of us 09 million 7 the audit reviewed the administration of th representation at nairobi and at hargeisa with administrative budgets totalling us 11 milli on for the years 2003 and 2004 and assets with an acquisition value of us 11 million and current value of us 193000 the figures however were unreliable given that the assettrak s ystem was not uptodate the number of staff working for the unhcr operation in somalia wa s 41 this included staff on regular posts united nations volunteers and staff on miss ion 8 the audit also followed up on findings and recommen dations made in the 2000 oios audit regarding the implementation and monitoring f quick impact projects 9 the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations review of implementing partners 10 for the three partners reviewed only for drc could reasonable assurance be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and di sbursed in accordance with the subagreements for npa and mrrr oios assessed t hat the accounting and internal control systems established for the unhcr subproje cts were inadequate with expenditure inflated at npa and number of forged supporting documents found at mrrr 11 the audit certificates covering the 2003 s ubprojects were available for npa and mrrr with unqualified audit opinions expressed h owever given the various shortcomings and weaknesses noted at both partners oios questioned the extent and quality of the work carried out by the external audit firms for drc the audit certificate was still not available at the time of the review npa 12 the transaction reports and ledgers genera ted by npas automated accounting system did not reconcile to the final spmr submitted to hcr oios noted that the spmrs had actually been prepared on the basis of undocumented calculations and cost allocations this practice was less than reliable as it gave audi t trail and was unacceptable from an experienced international ngo consequently oios found that the expenditure reported in the 2003 spmr had been overstated by some us 3100 0 which resulted from various calculation and compilation errors 13 in addition oios found that the basis for the calculation of overhead costs the entire 2003 expenditure was inappropriate as npa did not directly implement unhcr sub projects but rather operated as an umbrella agency for various local ngos given that some us 235000 out of expenditure totalling some us 327000 was transferred from npa to local ngos for the implementation of the unhcr sub projects oios pointed out that this amount should be subtracted from the calculation of overhead costs according to the 3 unhcr manual chapter 5 section 51 when an inter national ngo acts as an umbrella agency covering the activities of several smaller l ocal ngos the value of the activities performed by the local ngos should be subtracted fr om the calculation of the overhead costs on this basis oios calculated the allowable overhe ad costs to be some us 4564 instead of the reported amount of us 14081 an excess of som us 9500 oios recommended that the representation recover from npa total of some us 40000 representing the overstatement of expenditure and disallowed overhea d costs 14 the representation indicated that npa has been requ ested to reimburse the over charge however npa has in turn requested that the amount be offset against their 2002 claim of some us 45000 representing the last 2002 instalment as per the subagreement which had not been transferred to them oios advised the representation to find out whether the alleged instalment was actually paid or not an d verify whether the reported 2002 expenditure was bona fide unhcr expenditure and in cluded the claimed amount in accordance with budgetary provisions if the repre sentation clearly establishes that the amount was owed to npa then it should consider off setting the recovery us 40238 against npas claim us 44738 recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in somalia should obtain vidence and establish whether npas claim that unhcr owes i t us 44738 is valid in which case it should consid er offsetting the overstatement of expenditure totalli ng us 40238 if evidence cannot be obtained the full mount should be recovered accordingly rec 01 15 npa did not adhere to the clauses of the s ubagreement to submit interim spmrs the first interim report which was due in july 200 3 for the period ending june 2003 was only submitted in march 2004 well after the end of the subproject 31 december 2003 oios found that most of the reported 2003 expenditu re was actually incurredpaid for in may and august 2004 well after the submission of the f inal spmr in april 2004 spmr oios noted that neither of the two and only spmrs submit ted to unhcr reflected actual payments and that most of the expenditure could t be traced to npas books of accounts according to npa the expenditure was actually repo rted on provisional basis in the spmr and that actual payments were made later in deed oios traced the last unhcr instalment of us 66624 made on 29 april 2004 to n pas bank statements and noted that the amount was only spent in september 2004 five m onths after the end of the subproject 16 oios noted that the expenditure was neithe r always authorized nor properly supported at all times in many instances the only documentation supporting the expenditure consisted of financial reports from the local ngos excel tables pictures etc which were attached to payment vouchers there was evidenc of authorisationapproval of the expenditure on the payment vouchers which in many cases were only signed by the staff requesting the payment andor sometimes the accoun tant oios understands that in light of the various shortcomings already noted in 2004 the representation has discontinued the partnership with npa 4 b mrrr 17 while mrrr accounting system was assessed as satisfactory oios identified number of weaknesses in the internal controls and f ound evidence of numerous forgeries on the documentation supporting the expenditure many of the invoices attached to the payment vouchers were double submissions of the carbon copy of previous invoices with clear signs of erased invoice numbers andor invoice dates for example invoice numbers 2477 and 2478 amounting to us 2051 and us 2184 respectively w ere first used under pv b722003 dated 4 november 2003 and charged to unhcr carbon c opies of the same invoices were again used to charge unhcr under the same budget li ne under pv b1132003 dated 30 november 2003 there had been clear attempt to c onceal this using whiteout correction fluid to change invoice numbers from 2477 to read 247 and from 2478 to read 78 erase last and first digits of the original invoice numbe rs the month was also manually changed to read month 11 from month 08 on both invoices 18 there were several such examples with mrr r using whiteout correction fluid to conceal forgeries which resulted in an overcharge of at least some us 12000 oios could not exclude the possibility that many more of such forgeries had taken place and would remain undetected in addition significant numb er of payments were not properly supported for example the payments of staff allow ances totalling some us 14000 was not evidenced and expenditure totalling some us 1200 0 charged to the spmr had neither been budgeted for nor authorized by the representation oios recommended that the representation recover from mrrr total of some u s 24000 and obtain adequate documentation supporting expenditure totalling some us 14000 19 the representation indicated that letter has been drafted requesting mrrr to reimburse total of some us 24000 and that the l etter would be transmitted officially upon receipt of the final audit report the representation also indicated that mrrr has be requested to provide adequate documentation support ing the payments or refund some us 14000 if the documentation cannot be produced recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in somalia should request mrrr to reimburse some us 24000 representing overstate d and unsupported expenditure under subproject 03 04absomrp370 further mrrr should provid adequate documentation supporting payments totallin g us 14000 if the documentation cannot be produced t his amount should also be recovered rec 02 c drc 20 oios assessed that the accounting system nd internal controls at drc were generally satisfactory though improvement was required in th area of banking procedures report preparation and procurement drc indicated during the audit that appropriate cor rective measures would be taken to address the issues ident ified the representation also wrote letter to drc requesting improvement in those areas drc informed the representation during subsequent meetings that the requested impro vement has now been implemented 5 b other programme issues 21 oios assessed that proper project financia l monitoring visits had not been carried out in 2003 and 2004 as evidenced by the lack of proje ct financial monitoring reports and the serious deficiencies noted with npa during the audi t lack of interim spmrs as required in the subagreement lack of final spmr inability to reconcile the spmrs to npas books of accounts lack of proper supporting documents etc the representation gave comments on these shortcomings 22 in addition oios noted that the represent ation extended the ending date of sub projects andor revised subproject budgets without issuing supplementary subagreement according to unhcr manual chapter 4 supplementar agreement is required in situation where for instance the implementation or the liqui dation period of the subproject is to be extended or the total financial requirements of th subproject budgets increase or decrease the representation has issued memorandum requesti ng that the relevant rules for extending the subproject duration andor increasin gdecreasing of the subproject budget be adhered to in future recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in somalia should strength its project financial monitoring and ensure that weaknessesshortcomings at implementing partners ar identified on timely basis and appropriate corre ctive actions taken accordingly rec 03 quick impact projects qips 23 qips were implemented through memorandum f agreement moa signed with partners andor contractors with funds released by instalments and recorded under direct implementation by unhcr the selections of the pro jects were made jointly with the counterpart governmental agency the line ministri and the communities based on need assessments carried out by line ministries oios n oted that although the moas specifically required that the ngoscontractors submit final fin ancial reports upon completion of project activities such reports were actually produced in many instances only the receiptsinvoices were attached to the project docu ments which in oios view could not allow proper financial monitoringverification th is issue had already been raised in oios 2000 audit report and we regret to note that this shortcoming remains to be corrected while the reporting requirement should not be as st rict as normally required from implementing partners under subproject agreement oios felt that final reports the ngoscontractors implementing the qips should produ ce summarized expenditure supported by proper documentation the representation indicated that letter would be written to the concerned partners requesting compliance with the m oa and that the issue has already been discussed with its suboffice in hargeisa 24 oios found during its site visits of qips implemented that some project activities had not always been completed within the agreed period or needed strengthened monitoring of the work done for example the construction of an operational theatre was completed only after about ten months following the due completion date the delay was mainly due to the fact that the qip was cofunded by the host country at some 50 percent but the payment had not materialized also serious construction defect s were noted on the construction of 6 perimeter wall 950 meters long resulting from po or workmanship that should have been detected had the bill of quantities boq been ade quate reviewed 25 the representation indicated that in future it wo uld only engage in project activities that depend on the successful completion of the inp uts of other partners if it is clear that these complementary inputs would be provided in r eliable and timely manner to ensure the successful completion of the project within reaso nable timeframe the representation further indicated that adequate technical review of boqs and supervision of the work done would be strengthened to minimize construction rela ted defects emergency assistance to tsunami victims in somalia 26 an estimated 650 km of somalia coastline w as affected following the december 26 tsunami which mainly hit south east asia the effe cts in somalia included the loss of lives destruction of shelters houses water sources and loss of productive assets in particular fishing boats and equipment unhcr provided its as sistance in two phases under phase one which was the emergency phase running from jan uary through march 2005 emergency shelters and nfis were provided to affected househo lds along with the implementation of eight qips projects oios estimated that the imple mentation rate of the first phase over 70 percent was satisfactory 27 under the second phase the focus was on t he longerterm goals of rehabilitation and development which was continuation of the emerge ncy phase under the same project whose enddate was extended to december 2005 oios noted however that at the time of the review only two tsunamirelated qips were under im plementation overall the expenditure from january through june 2005 was some us 288000 which represents only 26 percent implementation rate which in oios view was low gi ven that by end june 2005 half the calendar year 2005 had already elapsed 28 the representation explained that the low implement ation rate was due to delays by habitat in coming up with framework prior to full resumption of the rehabilitation phase in addition the ship used by wfp to carry nf is was hijacked in june 2005 and had still not been released at the time of the review this has further slowed down the implementation the representation subsequently inf ormed that habitat has meanwhile undertaken the necessary works that held up impleme ntation of unhcrs tsunamirelated rehabilitation projects and that wfp managed to ccessfully transport the nfis which have now been distributed the representation indic ated that the project activities have been completed and that the project is closed c supply management procurement 29 the procurement procedures by implementing partners required some improvement at mrrr several payments were made for transport contracts with evidence of any competitive bidding while at drc there was gener lack of proper supporting documents relating to procurement in many instances there w ere purchase orders requisitions evidence of competitive bidding or of the receipt f materials purchased for example water pumps were procured locally for total of some us 20000 with only handwritten acceptance notes to support the expenditure the representation indicated that letter was 7 sent to the partners requesting them to adequately document their procurement transactions and to ensure compliance with the requirements of c ompetition the representation subsequently indicated that training on unhcr procu rement procedures has been provided to key implementing partners b asset management 30 the assettrak system had not been updated for years hence the representation did not have sufficient control over its assets phy sical inventory was carried out in july 2005 but this was far from complete as it did not inclu assets in the custody of implementing partners and field offices the situation was simi lar at the suboffice in hargeisa somalia where the assettrak system had not been updated ce 2000 and systematic and comprehensive physical verification had been carrie d out since the same year moreover for those assets previously recorded in the assettrak s ystem oios found that the net book value of the assets was overstated as depreciation wa s calculated although the items had been procured several years back given that assettrak normally automatically calculates depreciation values this meant that the system was either not properly set up or that the staff member was not adequately trained to operate the sy stem the representation has now undertaken comprehensive physical inventory of it s assets and has provided evidence of this the representation subsequently explained tha t corrective actions have been taken at all levels including physical inventory taking and th correct calculation of net book values 31 in 2003 and 2004 local asset managemen t board lamb had been established at the representation in kenya or at the suboffice in hargeisa while at the representation in nairobi cases requiring submission to lamb had been referred to the lamb established by the branch office in kenya cases at the suboff ice in hargeisa had not always been given proper attention consequently there was number of assets groundedno longer usable including vehicles generators outdated telecom quipment etc some dating back to as far as 1995 with actions taken these assets had b een using parking space in the already crowded suboffice compound and needed to be submi tted to lamb for disposal oios noted one instance where unhcr vehicle was involv ed in an accident in spite of police report declaring the other party guilty of reckless driving there was evidence of any action taken by unhcr against the third party the vehicle had not been repaired for over 10 months and the required standard forms gs45 and gs 46 had not been prepared in may 2005 lamb was established at the branch office in corporating other somalia offices including the suboffice the representation subsequently stated that lamb meeting was convened in december 2005 and that it is planned t hat by january 2006 all corrective action concerning old assets would have been taken in rela tion to suboffice hargeisa recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in somalia should ensure t hat the physical inventory now undertaken is fully complete d and that the assettrak system is updated accordingly p roper follow up should also be initiated on all cases of assets loss damage or groundedno longer usable with submissi on of the required forms gs45gs46 to the lamb rec 04 8 d security and safety 32 according to mission report from the sen ior regional field safety advisor who conducted an assessment of the minimum operating curity standards moss in 2004 the so hargeisa was 90 per cent compliant with moss bu t remained not compliant in certain areas which were subsequently satisfactory address ed according to subsequent assessments by undss somalia oios was however concerned with t he presence of wet fuel stains and dripping diesel drums in the vehicle parking areas which was also the fuelling area apart from newly arrived staff all staff had successfull completed the required online security training with certificates kept in personnel files 33 the asset focal point agreed that due to the flamma ble nature of fuel and the close proximity of motor vehicles most of which also tain fuel there was need to undertake security measures the representation indicated th at actions were being taken to avoid any danger posed to assets and human life by flammable commodities like fuel administration 34 in the areas of administration and finance the unhcr representation in somalia generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under review there was however need for improvement in certain areas united nations common air services uncas 35 unhcr is member of the united nations co mmon air services jointly operated by four agencies namely wfp undp unicef and unhc r the entity operates on the basis of sharing gains and losses arising out of tr avel occupancy for each flight and was formed in an attempt to bring down travel costs whi ch would sometimes amount to up to us 800000 per annum when unhcr operated its own plane between djibouti and hargeisa 36 according to the representation significa nt cost reductions were achieved as result of this arrangement in addition to the savings mad uncas also allows unhcr to operate under security conditions in which other commercial carriers such as ethiopian airways would not operate thereby ensuring continuity in i ts operations this includes travels within somalia and to nairobi as well as medical evacuatio ns 37 however oios assessed that there was ne ed to address various accounting issues mainly in the area of profit and losses arising fro m the uncas operation these profitslosses were calculated on monthly basis and shared amongst the members through reduction or increase of the monthly travel invoice s the accounting treatment of the profitslosses had been concern at the representa tion with guidance received from headquarters and this resulted in an inconsistent treatment of the profits and losses for example for cases where loss was incurred the t otal amount utilization cost share of loss was posted to account code 242 travel but the situation was more complicated when payment or lesser amount was due as result of net profit surplus with posting being more difficult the recording of the surplus could not be done against the abod under the new mrsp 9 38 while much of the surplus was eventually ffset against expenditure account code 242 travel by december 2004 there was still surplu s of some us 30000 available according to uncas records but this was not reflected in hcrs fmis system the surplus was eventually used up offset against the travel invo ice for january 2005 however although payment should have been made in view of the surplu s available the representation made payment of us 25242 which resulted in yet anot her share of surplus of us 21650 not reflected in the accounting records the represent ation explained that the payment was made in order to comply with donor requirements under th comprehensive plan of action which required the submission of supporting documents sho wing evidence of payment of travel costs 39 oios noted number of other unclear accou nting entries pertaining to profits and losses with yearly surplus balances carried forwar d from year to year since at least 2002 without proper guidance on how to report on them t he decision of accounting treatment for these rather unusual transactions was left to an ad ministrative clerk alone who had used various accounting treatments that did not always l eave proper audit trails on the payment vouchers in oios view the calculation of losses and surpluses made by uncas on monthly basis and submitted to board members shoul d have been made and reported only at yearends and as far unhcr is concerned should have been dealt with centrally at hqs this would ensure that the abod is not affected at field level especially given that cash was actually distributed to uncas members oios re commended that the representation consult with dfsm and with other uncas members on t he possibility for uncas to prepare annual financial reports with unhcr s annual share of losssurplus dealt with at headquarters level 40 the representation explained that it would consult further with dfsm on the issue of accounting for lossessurpluses of the uncas operat ion but pointed out that during recent board meeting other members of uncas felt that the accounting issues raised were specific to unhcr and thus required tailormade solution suited to the financial working of the agency given that other agency had problem with the current practice recommendation head2right the unhcr division of financial and supply manageme nt should provide guidance to the representation in so malia on the proper accounting treatment of monthly lossess urpluses generated from the uncas operation rec 05 inadequately supported accounting entries 41 entries in the fmis system were not always based on actual supporting documentation oios noted several instances where ccounting entries had been made on the basis of email communications with field offices with the actual financial summaries submitted much later for example in august 2004 c ash payments totalling us 28190 were made at field office bossaso and payment voucher was raised accordingly on the basis of email communication with supporting document vailable this was also the case in october 2004 under payment voucher 17p2000 for us 9888 in addition for supporting documents subsequently submitted there was evid ence that they were subsequently crosschecked with the relevant emailed financial d ata oios noted that some of the 10 documentation provided by certain field offices was incomplete lacking for example invoices purchase orders contracts etc 42 the representation explained that problems with acc ounts and supporting documentation mainly occur with its field office bo ssaso and that the responsible field assistant has been alerted to these serious shortco mings on many occasions the representation further pointed out that corrective measures have been taken including the consolidation of its presence in the puntland state with all financial field transactions now undertaken from there 43 oios acknowledged the fact that the lack f administrative staff notably the post of an administrative officer had led to gap in admi nistrative functions at the supervisory level to effectively deal with administrativefinancial i ssues and that this had often led the representative to assist in the role of administrat ive officer however with the appointment of new administrative finance officer to provid services to bo somalia as well as the office of the coordinator and the regional service hub oios felt that this should improve the situation the representation pointed out that the new adminis trative officer currently providing some support services to bo somalia is ssigned to the regional support hum and that he would not be able to cope with the subs tantial level of support required for offices in the field hence the need for full time admini strative officer remained travel 44 oios noted internal controls weaknesses in this area there were number of instances where travels had been undertaken with prior travel authorisations except for the suboffice in hargeisa which had its own abod the representation was responsible for authorizing all travels in the field but oios foun d that the representation was only informed of the travel after these had already taken place information about such travels was received only once travel claims were received at the branch office the representation explained that in number of previous occasions staff had b een instructed that official travels were to be undertaken unless prior authorization was ob tained and that letter has been written to remind them of these instructions the represen tation further indicated that in future travel claims would be settled if prior travel uthorization was issued solar 45 at suboffice hargeisa oios found that th rules over solar entitlements had not been adhered to since solar was introduced in janua ry 2001 staff had been accommodated in unhcr guesthouses free of rent and utility costs while at the same time being paid the full solar rates according to iomf om 912000 dated 28 february 2000 and iomfom 122004 dated 23 january 2004 when acc ommodation is provided by the organisation free of charge the applicable rate of deduction 50 percent unless the housing is substandard in which case the deduction is 25 per cent should be made from the solar oios found it unusual that unhcr administrative and finance officers consistently disregarded these instructions oios calculated th at in 2002 alone the noncompliance with the rules resulted in solar overpayments of some us 120000 beginning in 2003 however staff members are longer accommodated i n unhcr guesthouses 11 46 given that three years has elapsed since t hen oios did not request retroactive recovery but reminded that in accordance with par agraph 9 of sami 20058 dated 17 august 2005 future noncompliance with implementat ion of solar reductions will result in recovery of overpayment from the staff concerned nd that it may moreover result in managers be held accountable for the financial loss to the organization v acknowledgement 47 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and cooperation extended to
