from ben santer santer1llnlgov to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re coverage date thu 21 feb 2008 171222 0800 replyto santer1llnlgov xflowed dear phil quick question do you happen to have percentage land coverage mask for the hadcrut3v data and if so does this exist as netcdf file with best regards ben phil jones wrote ben email to dick reminded had another phone call and id forgotten first file is the coverage second is program that reads this file channel 1 file is 36 by 72 5 by 5 degs it will start at 8590n for the 36 subscript for 72 it is either dateline or greenwich cheers phil at 1653 15022008 you wrote dear dick im forwarding an email that i sent out several days ago for the last month ive been working hard to respond to recent paper by david douglass john christy benjamin pearson and fred singer the paper claims that the conclusions of our ccsp report were incorrect and that there is fundamental discrepancy between simulated and observed temperature changes in the tropical troposphere douglass et also assert that models cannot represent the observed differential warming of the surface and troposphere to address these claims ive been updating some of the comparisons of models and observations that we did for the ccsp report now using newer observational datasets among them noaa ersstv2 and v3 as you can see from the forwarded email the warming rates of tropical ssts are somewhat different for ersstv2 and v3 ersstv3 warms by less than v2 do you understand why this is with best regards and hope you are well ben benjamin d santer program for climate model diagnosis

contenttype multipartmixed boundary060600010907080200090109 dear folks sorry about the delay in sending you the next version of our manuscript i decided that i needed to perform some additional calculations i was concerned that we had not addressed the issue of differential warming of the surface and troposphere an issue which douglass et had considered our work thus far shows that there are fundamental inconsistencies between simulated and observed temperature trends in individual tropospheric layers t2 and t2lt but we had not performed our paired trends test for trends in the surfaceminust2lt difference time series this is much tougher test to pass differencing strongly damps the correlated variability in each pair of surface and t2lt time series because of this noise reduction the standard error of the linear trend in the difference series is typically substantially smaller than the size of the standard error in an individual surface or t2lt time series this makes it easier to reject the null hypothesis of significant difference between simulated and observed trends in the ccsp report the behavior of the trends in the surfaceminust2lt difference series led us to note that comparing trend differences between the surface and the troposphere exposes potential discrepancies between models and observations in the tropics so it seemed wise to reexamine this differential warming issue i felt that if we ignored it douglass et would have grounds for criticizing our response ive now done the paired trends test with the trends in the surfaceminust2lt difference series the results are quite interesting they are at variance with the abovequoted finding of the ccsp report the new results i will describe show that the potential discrepancies in the tropics have largely been resolved heres what i did i used three different observational estimates of tropical sst changes these were from noaaersstv2 noaaersstv3 and hadisst1 its my understanding that noaaersstv3 and hadisst1 are the most recent sst products of ncdc and the hadley centre im also using t2lt data from rss v30 and uah v52 here are the tropical 20n20s trends in these five datasets over the 252month period from january 1979 to december 1999 together with their 1sigma adjusted standard errors in brackets uah v52 0060 0137 rss v30 0166 0130 hadisst1 0108 0133 noaaersstv2 0100 0131 noaaersstv3 0077 0121 all trends in degrees cdecade the trends in the three sst datasets are by definition calculated from anomaly data that have been spatiallyaveraged over tropical oceans the trends in t2lt are calculated from anomaly data that have been spatially averaged over land and ocean it is physically reasonable to do the differencing over different domains since the temperature field throughout the tropical troposphere is more or less on the moist adiabatic lapse rate set by convection over the warmest waters these observational trend estimates are somewhat different from those available to us at the time of the ccsp report this holds for both t2lt and sst for t2lt the rss trend used in the ccsp report and in the santer et 2005 science paper was roughly 013 degrees cdecade as you can see from the table given above it is now ca 017 degrees cdecade carl tells that this change is largely due to change in how he and frank adjust for intersatellite biases this adjustment now has latitudinal dependence which it did not have previously the tropical sst trends used in the ccsp report were estimated from earlier versions of the hadley centre and noaa sst data and were of order 012 degrees cdecade the values estimated from more recent datasets are lower and markedly lower in the case of noaaersstv3 0077 degrees cdecade the reasons for this downward shift in the estimated warming of tropical ssts are unclear as carl pointed out in an email that he sent earlier today one important difference is that post 1985 noaaersstv3 directly ingests bias adjusted sst data from avhrr big change from v2 which didnt use any satellite data directly avhrr is strongly affected in the tropics by the pinatubo eruption in 1991 if the bias adjustment doesnt completely account for this the trends could be changed another possibility is treatment of biases in the buoy data it would be nice if dick reynolds could advise us as to the most likely explanation for the different warming rates inferred from noaaersstv2 and v3 bottom line the most recent estimates of tropical sst changes over 1979 to 1999 are smaller than we reported in the ccsp report while the t2lt trend at least in rss is larger the trend in the observed difference series noaaersstv3 ts minus rss t2lt is now 0089 degrees cdecade which is very good agreement with the multimodel ensemble trend in the ts minus t2lt difference series 0085 degrees cdecade ironically if douglass et had applied their flawed consistency test to the multimodel ensemble mean trend and the trend in the noaaersstv3 ts minus rss t2lt difference series they would not have been able to conclude that models and observations are inconsistent here are the observed trends in the tropical ts minus t2lt difference series in the six different pairs of ts and t2lt datasets together with the number of hits rejections of the null hypothesis of significant difference in trends and the percentage rejection rate based on 49 tests in each case pair trend 1sigma ci hits rejrate hadisst1 ts minus rss t2lt 00577 00347 1 204 noaaersstv2 ts minus rss t2lt 00660 00382 1 204 noaaersstv3 ts minus rss t2lt 00890 00350 0 000 hadisst1 ts minus uah t2lt 00488 00371 28 5714 noaaersstv2 ts minus uah t2lt 00405 00403 25 5102 noaaersstv3 ts minus uah t2lt 00175 00370 15 3060 multimodel ensemble mean 00846 things to note 1 for all pairs involving rss t2lt data the multimodel ensemble mean trend is well within even the 1sigma statistical uncertainty of the observed trend 2 for all pairs involving rss t2lt data there are very few statisticallysignificant differences between the observed and modelsimulated differential warming of the tropical surface and lower troposphere 3 for all pairs involving uah t2lt data there are statisticallysignificant differences between the observed and modelsimulated differential warming of the tropical surface and lower troposphere even in these cases however rejection of the null hypothesis is not universal rejection rates range from 30 to 57 clearly not all models are inconsistent with the observational estimate of differential warming inferred from uah data these results contradict the model inconsistent with data claims of douglass et the attached figure is analogous to the figure we currently show in the paper for t2lt trends now however results are for trends in the surfaceminust2lt difference series rather than showing all six pairs of observational results in the top panel ive chosen to show two pairs only in order to avoid unnecessarily complicating the figure i propose however that we provide results from all six pairs in table as is visually obvious from the figure trends in 46 of the 49 simulated surfaceminust2lt difference series pairs are within the 2sigma confidence intervals of the noaaersstv3 ts minus rss t2lt trend the light grey bar and as is obvious from panel b even the douglass et sigmase encompasses the difference series trend from the noaaersstv3 tsrss t2lt pair i think we should show these results in our paper the bottom line use of newer t2lt datasets rss and ts datasets noaaersstv3 hadisst1 largely removes the discrepancy between tropical surface and tropospheric warming rates we need to explain why the observational estimates of tropical sst changes are now smaller than they were at the time of the ccsp report we will
