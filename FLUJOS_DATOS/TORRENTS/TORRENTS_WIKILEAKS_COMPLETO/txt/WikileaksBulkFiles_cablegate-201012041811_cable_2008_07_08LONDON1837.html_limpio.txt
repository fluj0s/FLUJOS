foreign office sees brownmedvedev talks leading to warmer ukrussian relations classified by political counselor richard m mills jr for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary prime minister gordon brown and russian president dmitry medvedev used their first oneonone meeting at the g8 summit to build friendly rapport rather than score points on smaller contentious issues said the foreign office fco to members of the diplomatic community according to the fco brown and medvedev both expressed frustration at the stalled dialogue between the two governments and pledged to reopen toplevel lines of communication they agreed on several issues including support of postkyoto framework reformation of international institutions and increased dialogue on climate change at the same time the pair did not dwell on more controversial issues such as kosovos independence and the litvinenko murder the fcos overall assessment of the meeting was positive and the fcos russian office sees in medvedev leader more open to domestic liberalization and cooperation with britain and the west than was his predecessor 2 sbu summary continued though the brownmedvedev meeting touched on important international issues the fco said the most important outcome were signs of thaw in toplevel ukrussian relations as an example they pointed to conversations with the russian government regarding zimbabwe and progress in gaining moscows support for some g8 action encouraged by the prospects of improving relations under medvedev the fco believes that now may not be the time to renegotiate items such as the russiaeu partnership and cooperation agreement pca and that better agreements with moscow may be reached later if medvedev can successfully liberalize parts of russian society end summary litvinenko 3 cnf pm brown briefly brought up the litvinenko murder case and the extradition request and medvedev apparently sought to bury the matter by referring to it as legal issue medvedev said that it was sad affair but that it should be matter left to the courts fco reported that transformative dialogue occurred and that progress was made on the issue 4 cnf in separate meeting on the day of the briefing cabinet office director general margaret aldred confirmed to the dcm that the brown meeting had been fairly relaxed and not strained aldred said the cost of the fallout to hmg from the litvinenko issue was an end to close cooperation with russian intelligence fsb on counterterrorism and other global issues visas and diplomatic relations 5 cnf brown and medvedev made little progress on the issue of diplomatic visas which are still being restricted by both countries as part of the fallout from the litvinenko case the fco reported that medvedev was apparently upset over reports in the british media appearing the same week as the g8 meeting on russian espionage activities in the uk 6 cnf according to the fco hmg has had good reasons to refuse many russian visa requests hmg officials see real intelligence threat from russia in addition to china and regret missed opportunity in the late 1990s and early 2000s to assess these intelligence threats fco officials explained that the russian government is still restricting visas to uk diplomats that hmg is not be able to fully staff its embassy in russia and that local russian hires have been harassed by the fsb accordingly hmg is restricting the number of visas issued to russian officials the fco reports that hmg had proposed deal on easing visa restrictions but that russia is requiring that hmg consult with the fsb on any mutual visa agreement hmg continues to refuse to engage directly with the fsb pending resolution of the litvinenko murder case british petroleum 7 sbu medvedev confirmed to brown that he had met with russian shareholders of tnkbp and indicated to them that they could seek legal recourse through russian courts if they had concerns with how the joint venture was operating international institutions london 00001837 002 of 002 8 sbu medvedev brought up the need for major reform of international institutions one of the pms main international initiatives medvedev told brown that international financial institutions need to be more engaged in managing the global credit crunch british council 9 sbu medvedev told brown that while russia longer views the british council in russia as den of spies there still exist legal issues regarding the british councils activities in russia medvedev implied that politicians are not in position to discuss what is or is not legal and that russian courts will make the final decisions regarding the british councils russian operations kyoto protocol 10 sbu medvedev indicated to brown that russia might be willing to support 2012 postkyoto framework but expressed concerns about the rapid industrialization of china and india and its potential to undermine any international agreement on carbon emissions fcos analysis medvedev is not putin 11 cnf fco officials expressed optimism that medvedev will bring partial liberalization to russian political life they see signs of slow break with putin including the former presidents failure to attend the g8 summit the retirement of several highranking putinappointed generals and the appointment of antoly chubais liberal and close medvedev ally to the presidency of rosnanotech which fco views as huge kremlin slush fund on the other hand several of putins men are still in the upper echelons of the kremlin though the fco believes that they will be removed over the next few years 12 cnf fco officials said that the eu should hold off on signing new pca which expires at the end of 2008 and wait to see if medvedev liberalizes parts of russian society before agreeing to longterm commitments the fco stressed that the next few years should be geared towards improving upperlevel ukrussian relations and that highlevel visits are the way forward hmg is planning several visits to russia in the fall and will receive highlevel russian officials early next year visit londons classified website httpwwwintelinksgovgovwikiportalunit ed_kingdom lebaron
