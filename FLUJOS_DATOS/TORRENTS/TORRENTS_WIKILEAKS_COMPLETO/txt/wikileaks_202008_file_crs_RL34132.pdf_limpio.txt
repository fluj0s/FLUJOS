agriculture appropriations usda activities the us department of agriculture usda carries out widely varied responsibilities through about 30 separate internal agenci and offices staffed by some 100000 employees usda is responsible for many activities outside of the agriculture budget function hence usda spending is not synonymous with farm program spending similarly agriculture appropriations bills are not limited to usda and include related prog rams such as the food and drug administration and the commodity futures trading commission but exclude the usda forest service usda estimated that its outlays in fy2007 would be 93 billion food and nutrition programs comprise the largest mission area with 55 billion or 60 of the total to support the food stamp program the nutrition program for women

marketing and regulatory progra ms 2 and food safety 1 nearly twothirds of the outlays for natural resources programs goes to the forest service about 54 billion wh ich is funded through the interior appropriations bill the forest service included with natural resources in figure 1 is the only usda agency not funded thr ough the agriculture appropriations bill usda defines its programs using missi on areas that do not always correspond to categories in the agriculture appropriations bill for example foreign agricultural assistance programs are separate title title v in the appropriations bill but are joined with domestic farm support in usdas farm and foreign agriculture mission area compare figure 1 with figure 2 conversely usda has separate mission areas for marketing and regulatory progra ms and agricultural research but both are joined with other domestic farm support prog rams in title i agr icultural programs of the appropriations bill related agencies in addition to the usda agencies mentioned above the agriculture appropriations subcommittees ve jurisdiction over appropriations for the food and drug administration fda of the departme nt of health and human services hhs and in the house the commodity future trading commission cftc an independent financial markets regulatory agency these agencies are included in the agriculture appropriations bill because of their historical connection to food and agricultural markets however food nd agricultural issues have become less dominant at these agencies as medical and drug issues have grown in fda and non agricultural futures markets have grown at cftc their combined share of the overall agriculture and related agencies appropriations bill is usually less than 2 see title vi in figure 2 mandatory vs discretionary spending mandatory and discretionary spending are treated differently in the budget process congress generally controls spending on mandatory programs by setting rules for eligibility benefit formulas and other parameters rather than approving specific dollar amounts for these progra ms each year eligibility for mandatory programs sometimes referred to as entitlement programs is usually written into authorizing law and any individual or entity that meets the eligibility requirements is entitled to the benefits authorized by the law the 2002 farm bill and its expected successor the 200708 farm bill hr 2419 determine most of the parameters for this mandatory spendinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34132crs4 spending for discretionary programs is controlled by annua l appropriations acts the subcommittees of the house and sena appropriations committees originate bills each year that provide funding to c ontinue current activities as well as any new discretionary programs approximately 80 of the total agriculture and related agencies spending is classified as mandatory which by defi nition occurs independently of annual appropriations table 1 the vast majority of usdas mandatory spending is for the following programs the food stamp pr ogram most child nutrition programs the farm commodity price and income suppor t programs authorized by the 2002 farm bill and various disasteremergency appropriations the federal crop insurance program and various agricultural cons ervation and trade pr ograms mandatory spending is highly variable and driven by program participation rates economic and price conditions and weather patterns figure 3 although these programs have ma ndatory status many of these accounts receive funding in the annual agriculture appropria tions act for exam ple the food stamp and child nutrition programs are funde d by an annual appropriation based on projected spending needs supplemental appropriations ge nerally are made if these estimates fall short of required spending the commodity credit corporation operates on line of credit with the treas ury but receives an annual appropriation to reimburse the treasury and to maintain its line of credit the other 20 of the agriculture and related agencies appropriations bill is for discretionary programs ma jor discretionary programs include certain conservation programs most rural

prohibits usda from closing or developing plan to close any fsa county ffice before new farm bill is enacted this is slightly less restrictive than the housepassed bill which would have continued statutory nguage inserted in the fy2006 appropriations law that restricted the ability of us da to close any county office without public hearings and notification to congress or closing county offices until six months after new farm bill is enacted the senate reported bill did not address county office closure this restriction on county office clos ure reflects language in sta ndalone bills

farmers unable to obtain credit from commercial lender usda provides direct farm loans and also guarantees the timely repayment of principal and interest on qualified loans to farmers from commercial lenders fsa loans are used to finance farm real estate operating expenses and recovery from natural disasters some loans are made at subsidized interest rate an appropriation is made to fsa each year to cover the federal cost of making direct and guaranteed loans referred to as loan subsidy loan subsidy is directly related to any interest rate subsidy provided by the government as well as projection of anticipated loan losses from farmer nonrepaym ent of the loans the amount of loans that can be made the loan authority is several times larger than the subsidy level for fy2008 the enacted appropriation fo llows the senate bill and provides 1486 million to subsidize the cost of ma king an estimated 3427 billion in direct and guaranteed fsa loans this represen ts an 86 decrease in loan authority from fy2007 but is not as low as the administration requested table 5 direct loan authority decreases 56 from fy2007 all accounted for by decrease in direct operating loans even though direct farm ow nership loans increase guaranteed loan authority decreases 97 with nearly equa l decreases in guaranteed ownership and unsubsidized operating loans over the past decade congress and the administration generally have devoted more resources towards the guaranteed loan program so the increase in direct farm ow nership loans is contrary to this trend new funds or authority are

the ccc over the years particularly for ad hoc farm disaster payments for direct market loss payments to growers of various commodities in response to low farm commodity prices and for animal and

through cong ressional appropriati on so that its 30 billion borrowing authority debt limit is not depleted congress generally provides this infusion through the annual usda appropr iation law because most of this spending rises or falls automatically on econo mic or weather conditions funding needs are sometimes difficult to estimate in recent years the ccc has r eceived current indefinite

obligations for these programs and activitie s those under the au spices of the food stamp act child nutrition programs the wic program commodity assistance programs like the csfp and federal nutrition pr ogram administrative costs is when fy2007 figures are made available likely to be less 541 billion the difference between appropriation and spending amounts is accounted for by unused contingency appropriations eg 3 billion for food stam ps lower costs than were anticipated when the appropriations were proposed or made and expected carryovers into fy2008 offset by spending financed fro m money available from prior years and other usda budget accounts eg permanen t appropriations used for commodity purchases for school meal programs the enacted appropriation for fy2008 woul d provide total of 60 billion for domestic food assistance about 700 million more than the 593 billion requested the enacted law total differs from the administrations request primarily because of added money for the wic program and the csfp it exceeds the amounts in the house and senate bills largely because of new funding for the wic program for fy2008 the house and senate bills would have appropriated total of 597 billion for domestic food assistance about 400 million more than requested as with the enacted law the house and senate differed with the administration over wic and csfp funding the administration proposed domestic f ood assistance appropriations totaling 593 b illion for fy2008 23 billion increase from fy2007 with major exceptions for the csfp proposed from

including 3 billion contingency reserve nd 6070 million to cover new food stamp costs attendant on termination of the csfp see later discussions of commodity assistance programs and special program initiatives this repr esented an incr ease of about 16 billion over fy2007 the enacted ppropriation esse ntially adopts the administrations request incl uding the reserve fund with one exception it rejects the proposal to end the csfp and thus slightly reduces its food stamp appropria tion when compared to the administrations request to 37916 the house and senate also lowered their appropria
