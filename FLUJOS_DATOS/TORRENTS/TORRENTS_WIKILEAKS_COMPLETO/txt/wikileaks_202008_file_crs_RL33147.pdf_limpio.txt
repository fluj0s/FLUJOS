beha lf and consular officers ie representatives of government who promote the governme nts commercial in terests and provide assistance to its citizens located in anothe r country stationed in other states to ensure that such channels of communication are preserved states receiving foreign diplomats and consular officers have long accorded such persons with certain privileges and immunities on the basis of comity reciprocity and international agreement1 as political and economic contacts betw een states have grown customary practices regarding diplomatic and consular immunities have increasingly been codified via bilateral or multilateral agreement these agreements not only describe the specific privileges and immunities to be accorded to foreign diplomats and consular officers by receiving state but also specify those privileges and immunities owed to other members of diplomatic and consular missions as well as towards the family members of mission members in recent decades international organiza tions have been viewed as means by which states may conduct mu ltilateral relations and coope rate on issues which are transnational in scope in order to ensu re the autonomy of such organizations and prevent any member state from unreasona bly interfering with organizational functions many international organizations and their employees have been accorded certain privileges and immunities by their member states these privileges and immunities are typically similar in scope to those accorded to foreign diplomatic missions this report describes the privileges and

empl oyees of international organizations may be waived by the sending state or the appropriate intern ational organization with or without the consent of the individual involved11 on the other hand certain individual acts may lead to waiver of immunity for example the initiation of civil proceedings by an otherwise exempt individua l may preclude him from invoking immunity with regards to directlyconnected counterclaim12 another example of this type of personal waiver is the relinquishment of all immunity by consular employees and staff who undertake private gainful employ ment in the receiving state13 still another example is when foreign person accorded immunity wishes to become lawful permanent resident of the united states in whic h case the person must waive the rights privileges immunities and exemptions he would otherwise accrue on account of his occupational status14 finally note that even where an individual enjoys immunity from jurisdiction person harmed by the immune individua l nevertheless may have recourse to compensation under one of two statutes firs t the diplomatic re lations act requires that 1 each diplomatic mission in the united states including

united states ratified the convention in 1970 as with the ioia the conventi on on privileges and immunities uncpi does not define the term employee or fficial though this is perhaps of little concern because the convention provi des immunity only to those categories of officials beyond the secret arygeneral and all assistant secretary generals designated by the secretarygeneral to receive protection under the convention34 the convention also does not define experts on missions who receive immunity under the convention however an advisory decision by the international court of justice

generally speaking the officials and representa tives covered by the convention are given the same privileges and immunities as those the us accords to diplomats under the diplomatic convention with

officials are immune only for official acts38 headquarters agreement in 1947 the united states entered the h eadquarters agreement with the united nations the headquarters agr eement unhqa primarily
