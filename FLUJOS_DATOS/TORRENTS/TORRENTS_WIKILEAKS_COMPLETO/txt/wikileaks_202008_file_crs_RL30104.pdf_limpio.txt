developments relating to the protection of both creative and noncreative databases including the europea n union directive the trips agreement the wipo copyright treaty an d consideration of proposals for new international treaty in the field of databas protection background international protection for databases and other collections of informatio n engenders essentially the same issues relating to standards scope conditions an d duration of protection as those raised at the national level the threshold issue is the standard of creativity required to justify protection under existing copyright laws and copyright treaties the berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic work s hereafter berne convention is the preeminent treaty in the field of copyrigh t4 protection countri bound by the 1948 brussels text and subsequent versions of the berne convention are obligated to protect collections of literary and artisti c works such as encyclopedias and anthologies which by reason of the selection r arrangement of their contents constitute intellectual creations 5 the references to litera ry and artistic works and intellectual creations mean that the berne convention may protect certain creative databases but presumably does not extend to protection for ncreative databases moreover the specific reference to collections of literary and artistic works may call into question copyrigh t protection for databases that consist f noncopyrightable data elements the specific examples of protected collections enc yclopedias and anthologies which consist of individual copyrightable contributions confirm the doubt about protection fo r collections of noncopyrightable material in fact however the most valuabl databases frequently comprise noncopyrightable data elements that are selected arranged or organized in way that creates economic valuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30104crs3 efforts to include trademark protection standards in the earlier tokyo round of th e6 gatt were not successful by the time of the uruguay round the united states with the support of the european union was able to make the case for inclusion of intellectua l property s tandards because intellectual property has become major part of modern highly developed conomies computer software and databases comprise essential components of modern economic systemsas consequence of the perceived deficiencies of the berne convention in the protection of database s several avenues for additional protection for databases have been explored in recent years some of these efforts have led to new internationa l agreements that clarify protection for databases u nder copyright laws the possibility of another new treaty primarily directed at protection of noncreative databases remains under consideration these recent multilateral and regional efforts to clarify berne conventio n copyright standards or fashion new international protection for databases include 1 the creat ion of minimum standards of intellectual property protection under the auspices of the 1994 general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt which became the world trade organization 2 the creat ion of new copyright treaty the wipo copyright treaty which has links with the berne convention and essentially serves to update the berne convention wi th respect to the use of copyrighted works on the internet and in digital electronic environments in general 3 the issuance of directive on databases by the european community which both harmo nizes copyright protection for databases within the community and creates new sui generis form of protection against the unlawful extraction or reutilization of the contents of databases and 4 further consideration of proposals to create new multilateral database treaty under the auspices of wipo database protection under the trips agreement the first success in clarific ation of international database protection came in the form of the intellectual property standards forged by the 1994 uruguay roun d agreements under the gatt the issue of i ntellectual property ip standards was placed on the agenda of the urugu ay round largely at the insistence of the united states prior to th uruguay round negotiations the gatt which of course deals with obligation s related to trade in good s and to some extent trade in services had not encompassed obligations related to intellectual property whose righ ts are intangible in nature the6 inclusion of ip stan dards on the gatt agenda recognizes the increased importance of intellectual property protection to the wellbeing of any modern economy in thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30104crs4 the trips agreement constitutes annex 1c of the marrakesh agreement which also7 establishe d the world trade organization

108 stat 4809 act of december 8 1994 the united states did t8 have to make any changes in its copyright law concerning protection of databases however since the law was consistent with the trips

under the fasttrack tra negotiations procedure the congress agreed to the 1994 gatt agreements including the trips agreement and enacted implementin g legislation on december 8 1994 known as the uruguay round agreements act of 1994 uraa 8 the trips agreement established minimum standards of protection in virtually all fields of intellectual property with respect to databases the trips agreement explicitly requires that compilations of data or other material must be protecte d against unauthorized copying if the selection or arrangement of the data or othe r material constitutes an intellectual creation 9 the refere nce to compilations of data or other material improves the level of protection for databases under the trips agreement in c omparison with the existing berne convention the literal text of the berne convention protects onl compilations of works that is material that is independently copyrightable unlike data elements which are frequently not independently copyrightable this is critical clarification of the obligation to protect databases since high percentage of databases are not compilations of works if the obligation to protect databases extends only to those databases that constit ute compilations of works the protection accorded datab ases is seriously eroded from the viewpoint of producers and owners of databases10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30104crs5 continued10 notwithstanding the literal text of art icle 25 of berne 1982 committee of governmental experts did conclude at an international meeting

protect original creative compilations of data has been settled trips article 10211 trips article 9212 implicit in the idea of protocol was the likelihood that the convention could b e13 upgraded for some countries and not for others while that option theoretically exists when the convention is revise d the protocol device might have made it more feasible for smaller number of countries to agree on the upgrade of the convention the berne convention was last revised at paris in 1971copyright protection for compilations under the trips agreement does t extend to the data or other material itself nor does protection extend to ideas 11 procedures methods of operation or mathematical concepts as such12 wipo copyright treaty the wipo copyright treaty originate d in wipo work program to update the berne conve ntion this work program which began in 1989 was known as th berne protocol process since it was conceived as mechanism to modernize the berne convention through protocol without engaging in full revision of th convention the original purposes were to make explicit in the berne convention13 that computer programs and databases must be prot ected as copyright subject matter and generally to update the convention with respect to use of copyrighted works in digital electronic environments the united states later sought to have updated protection for sound recordings included in the berne protocol process in this attempt the united states wa s opposed by the european union and other countries who do not protect soun d recordings under copyright law ultimately decision was taken in 1992 to split the berne protocol process into two phases an update of copyright protection and preparation of possibl new instrument ie treaty concerning protection of the rights of performers and producers of phonograms ie sound recordings this dual copyright and new instrument work program culminated in th adoption of two new intellectu property treaties at wipo diplomatic conference which met in geneva switzerland from december 220 1996httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30104crs6 article 20 of the berne convention permits such special agreements involving berne14 members but only if the agreement improves the level of copyright protection for authors the senate also gave its assent to ratification of the second treaty the wip o15 performances and phonograms treaty since

including clarification of unite d states copyright law in digital electronic environments with respect to database protection article 5 of the wipo copyright treat essentially tracks the language of the trips agreement concerning creativ databases this new intellectual property treaty establishes an obligation to protect compilati ons of data that result from the application of intellectual effort copyright protection does not extend to the content itself unless the content is independently work of the intellect in which case the content enjoys separate copyright the 1996 geneva diplomatic conference also adopted an agreed statement whose purpose is to encourage consistent interpretation of the database protectio n obligations under berne the trips agreement and the wipo copyr ight treaty the statement reads as follows the scope of protection for compilations of data databases under article 5 of this treaty read with article 2 is consistent with article 2 of the berne convention and on par with the relevant provisions of the trips agreement european union database directive background as part of its program for harmonizing the laws f the members of the european

directive 969ec of the european parliament and of the council on the lega l20 continuedthe purpose of the directive was both to harmoni ze the protection of databases within the european union and also to create an additional sui generis form f protection to exceed the protecti on available under copyright laws the effect of the directive was to narrow slightly the protection available for the structure of th database under the copyright laws of certain countries especially the unite d kingdom and ire land and to lesser degree the netherlands and at the same time to create new protection for the rights to extract and reutilize the contents of th database harmonization of copyright protection for databases was identified as major barrier to full development of an information market within the european union the united kingdom and ireland extended copyright protection to databases in general under the sweat of the brow or indu strious effort standard applied to directories by lower appellate courts i n the united states before the supreme court decision in the feist case the netherlands applied similar standard to directories the remaining members of the eu apparently applied higher standard of originality that required an intellectual creation to justify copyright protection at least one eu member germany may have been inclined to apply an even higher standard of originality than that ultimately adopted under the database directive the european commissions review of database protection also led to th conclusion that copyright law alone was not an adequate vehicle for databas protection since protection frequently does n ot extend to the contents of the database where the contents consist of uncopyrightable data elements moreover the amount of copying of the databases structural elements sele ction or arrangement of the data elements required to prove infringement might be too burdensome under ordinar copyright principles the difficulty of proof seems compounded in the case of computerize d databases selection may be arguably lacking since automated databases tend to be comprehen sive in scope arrangement may not be copyrightable feature f computerized databases since ny arrangement or coordination is provided by search engine software systems which are typically supplied by outside vendors to th database producer19 unfair competition law might have filled in some of the gaps in copyrigh t protection for databases but the commission opted to propose sui generis right to extract and reutilize the elements of database the final database directive was issued by the european union in march 1996 with required implementation date of january 1 199820httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30104crs8 continued20 protection of databases adopt ed

paragraph 14 of the findings22 article 1 3 of the eu database directive23the new extraction right for databases wa s lauded by some american producers of databases but also proved highly controversial because the eu limits the extraction right to those countries that extend reciprocal database protection to eu databas producer s united states copyright law in the post feist era seems consistent wit h the copyright principles enunciated in the eu database directive new legislatio n would be required however to create sui generis extraction right comparable to the extraction right in the eu directive in part as response t the eu database directive bills were considered in the 104 and 105 congresses but not enacted which would have created new federalth th protection for databases in the united s tates for 15 years essentially under principles of misappropriation hr 354 closely similar bill is now pending in the 106t h congress these proposals to create protection for noncreative databases while21 supported by most database producers have engendered opposition in the unite d states from the educational scientific and library communities and from som database producers the eu database directive consists of preamble of 60 paragraphs whic h states important fi ndings and includes many substantive principles the main text of the directive contains 17 articles which are divided into 4 chapters scope copyright sui generis right and common provisions unlike most internationa l instrume nts the findings of the eu directive have binding force for the members of the eu general scope the definition of the term database appears in paragrap h 17 of the findings and in article 12 of the main text database shall mean collection of independent works data or other

protection databases must by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents constitute the authors own intellectual creation 25 copyright protection f or databases under the directive does not extend to their contents but copyright is available for independent works that result from th authors own intellectual creation the presumed authors of databases are the natur persons who create them but the member states by legislation may provide that the database author is the lega l person designated as the owner of rights in the database the economic rights i n26 collective works belong to the person holding the copyright 27 the exclusive rights granted to database copyright owners which are specified in article 5 of the directive are the rights ordinarily accorded owners of othe r copyright subject matter these are the rights of reproduction adaptation publi c distribution and public communication display or performance the reproductio n right specifically applies to temp orary or permanent reproduction in whole or in part the distribution right is exhausted by an authorized first sale of copy of the database within the european community the permitted exceptions to the exclusive rights may include 1 acts by lawful users which are necessary for ccess to the contents of the database and to engage in normal use of the contents 2 reproduction of nonelectronic database

for database copyright is highly important the main focus of the eu database directive rests with the ne whttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30104crs10 eu database directive paragraphs 6 and 7 of the findings30 article 7 1 of the eu database directive31 ibid32 article 7 2 of the eu database directive33form of protection relating to extraction and reut ilization of the uncopyrightable data elements that comprise most databases chapter iii of the directive establishes this right primary justification for the sui generis right is that this new form f protecti on is needed to encourage development of databases within the europea n union absent uniformity in the ws of unfair competition and case law interpretation of existing laws 30 the 1992 draft directive was more rooted in principles of u nfair competition and would have protected against unfair extraction from database for commercia l purposes following the period of examination consideration and debate the final directive was modified to reflect property right basis this modification in part responds to the perceived difficulties in harmonizing unfair competition laws within the european union major difference between unfair competition and propert right approaches to protection of intellectual property is that the unfair competition right would apply only in competitive situations property based right may apply in noncommercial contexts such as educational or scientific research or teachin g although uses by nonprofit entities are often the subject of exceptions to the right basic right unlike copy right protection the sui generis right is not predicated on minimum standard of origi nality in essence the sui generis right is based upon the sweat of the brow or industrious effort standard that was once applied t copyright for certain databases in the united states and in the united kingdom but has now been abandoned under those copyright laws sui gene ris protection for databases under the eu

applies to public distribution or any transmis sion of the databases contents both rights are subject to exceptions or limitations of course one limitat ion is imbedded in the definition of reutilization the first sale of copy of the database exhausts any right to control resale within the european community term of protection the sui generis right endures for 15 years following the year of completion of the database if the database is made publicly available before expiration of 15 years from completion the 15 year term is measured from the period of public availability35 revisions of the database qualify for new period of protection if there is substantial change including changes that result from the accumulation f successiv additions deletions or alterations which would result in the databas being considered to be substantial new investment the changes and the nature36 of the investment are to be evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively persons eligible for protection article 11 1 specifies that database makers or owners who are nation als of an eu member state or have their habitual residence within the european community are eligible to claim protection under the sui generis right the sui generis right can also be claimed by business entities with busines s presence in the community which is evidenced by central administration or permanent

ca n become eligible for this sui generis protection only if their country of nationalit concludes special agreement with the council of the european union acting upon proposal from the european

directive43agreement is entered into the term of protection extended to the foreign databases shall not exceed the 15 year term of the directive40 the condition of reciprocity applies only to the sui gene ris right it does not and could not apply to the provisions in chapter ii on copyright since the bern convention which also binds the members of the european union prohibit s reciprocity as condition of copyright protection except with respect to comparison of the term of copyright and protection of applied designs limitations or exceptions lawful user may generally extract or reutiliz insubsta ntial parts of the contents of database however the repeated an d systematic extraction andor reutilization of insubstantial parts which the directive indicates implies conflict with the normal exploitation of the database shall not be permitted 41 lawful user of publicly available database may not perform acts whic h conflict with normal exploitation of the database or unreasonably prejudice th legitimate interests of the database maker42 these provisions regarding lawful database users apply both in the case f copyright protection for the structure of the database and to the sui generis right article 9 of the directive specifi the exceptions to the sui generis right these are expressed as options which the member states may legislate at their discretion these exceptions can be made available to lawful us ers of publicly available databases to permit use of substantial parts of t he database the permissible exceptions are 1 extraction for pri vate purposes in the case of nonelectronic databases 2 extraction for purpos of teaching or scientific research to the extent justified by the non commercial purpose provided the source of the information is credited and 3 extraction andor reutilization for purposes of public security or administrative r judicial procedures it is notable that exceptions to the reutilization right ar permitted only for essentially governmental purposes the final database directive makes provision for compulsory licensing fo r use of dat abases although form of compulsory licensing had been proposed in the 1992 draft directive however it is possible that narrow compulsory licensing that has already been tablished by case law within the european union will continue to be applied to database protection moreover the european commission will review the possible anticompetitive eff ects of the database directive at three year intervals and if necessary may recommend the establishment of compulsory licensing to cure any abusive competitive practices 43 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30104crs13 wipo database treaty proposals as discussed earlier wipo had been working since 1989 to update the berne convention to improve protection of copyrighted works in digital electroni c environments and explicitly to protect computer software and databases until th european union developed it s database directive discussion of database protection under the auspices of wip had essentially been confined to copyright protection of databases in february 1996 as wipo made plans to convene diplomatic conference to consider copyright proposals to update the berne convention and possible ne w instrument for sound recordings the european commission proposed expansion of the diplomatic conference to consider proposal for sui generis protection f databas the european commission proposal tracked its own legal directive n databases it basically proposed treaty establishing noncopyright protection fo r noncreative databases under the principle of industrious effort or substantia l investment of resources at followup meeting in may 1996 the united states countered with its own proposal for sui generis database protection which was similar to the europea n commissions proposal in principle but differed concerning protection fo r governmentproduced databases the united states proposed an option to den protection and term of protection 25 years in the united states proposal th united states also proposed national treatment as the basis for protection of foreign databases and provisions relating to freedom of contract wipo then prepared draft database treaty by drawing upon the europea n commission and united states proposals and circulated the draft in august 199 6 along with the drafts f or two other treaties the draft database treaty was formally placed on the agenda for the december 1996 diplomatic conference at geneva switzerland ultimately the governments at the 1996 geneva dip lomatic conference decided to postpone consideration of database treaty to subsequent diplomati c confere nce the substantive provisions of the draft database treaty were neve r discussed at the diplomatic conference the governments decided that there had been insufficient time to consider the specific proposals relating to database protectio n apart from copyright laws also the threeweek p eriod allotted to the conference did not realistically provide enough time to consider three separate treaties the 199 6 diplomatic conference adopted the wipo copyright and performances an d phonogra ms treaties but postponed the draft database treaty for possibl consideration at later diplomatic conference wipo has pursued consideration of new protection for databases by holdin g followup informational meetings i n september 1997 and september 1998 the next wipo meeting is scheduled for may 1999 the proposal for database treaty has proved controversial in the unite d states proposals for new database protection in the united states were consideredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30104crs14 pl 105304 october 28 199844by the 105 congress both separately and as part of the process of implementing theth two wipo treaties adopted by the 1996 diplomatic conference the databas proposa l was eliminated by the house and senate conference on the wip implementing legislation the digital millennium copy right act of 1998 closely44 similar bill has been reintroduced in the 106 congress as hr 354th given the preeminence of the united states as producer of databases it i s likely that new diplomatic conference will not be convened to consider possible database treaty until or unless the united states is prepared fully to support proposal for new database treaty conclusion database products and services have great economic significance t industrialized societies both at the national and international levels computerize d databases are transported electronically across national borders through the internet and other computer networks almost in the blin k of an eye as consequence of their economic significance the adequacy of protection for databases at the international level has received substantial attention in number of different venues one key issue relates to the standard of originality or creativity required t sustain copyright protection in databases in the past some databases were protected by copyright under principle of industrious effort rather than creative effort i n general this issue has been resolved internati onally and in the united states in favor of requirement of intellectual creation and rejection of the industrious effor t standard under copyright law the 1994 agreement on traderelated aspects f intellectual property rights under the world tra organization and the 1996 wipo copyright treaty both set minimum standards for copyright protection of databases based upon standard of creative effort the absence of copyright protection for noncreative databases has led t national regional and international proposals for new sui generis forms f protection the european unions directive on the legal protection of databases effective january 1 1998 mandates implementation of new sui generis form of protection for databases within the european union premised on industrious effor t or investment of resources wipo proposal for new database treaty was placed before the 199 6 geneva diplomatic c onference but the governments postponed consideration of the database treaty to future diplomatic conference wipo has held followu p informational meeting s and another informational meeting is planned for may 1999 further progress toward new database treaty presumably is dependent upo n development of an international consensus about the need for additional protection and about the basic principles und erlying any new intellectual property protection for noncreative databases the position of the united states on the need for additionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30104crs15 protection and the scope of such protection under its domestic laws is likely to be critical element in determining the course of future international developments
