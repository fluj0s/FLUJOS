closed down your embassy well weve caught him in fact we also arrested two days ago two of his top assistants saleh went on to say that these arrests show the seriousness and honesty of his services and the political will at the top for full cooperation with our friends the americans you on the other hand said saleh dont move on our requests saleh reassured us that his cooperation and the cooperation of his services would continue matter what now wheres our stuff 2 s saleh did not waste time for his usual quidproquo tactics so wheres my stuff we have requested equipment and weapons for our csf counter terrorism unit said saleh we have suffered important and costly losses in saada and we need your help please tell washington that this is urgent i respond to you immediately when you
