bridge publications inc newsletter selfdeterminism the most desirable state in an individual is complete selfdeterminism such selfdeterminism may be altered and shaped to some degree by education and environment but so long as the individual is not aberrated he is in possession of selfdeterminism so long as he is selfdetermined in his actions he adjusts himself successfully to the degree that his environment will permit such an adjustment he will be more forceful effective and happier in that environment than when aberrated the basic individual is not buried unknown or different person but an intensity of all that is best and most able in the person the basic individual equals the same person minus his pain and dramatizations l ron hubbard this excerpt was taken from the book the dynamics of life by l ron hubbard the goal of man the goal of man the lowest common denominator of all his activities the dynamic principle of his existence has long been sought should such an answer be discovered it is inevitable that from it many answers would follow it would explain all phenomena of behavior it would lead toward solution of mans major problems and most of all it should be workable such an answer has been discovered it is the dynamic principle of existence is survival the goal of life can be considered to be infinite survival man as life form can be demonstrated to obey in all his actions and purposes the one command survive it is not new thought that man is surviving it is new thought that man is motivated only by survival that his single goal is survival does not mean that he is the optimum survival mechanism which life has attained or will develop the goal of the dinosaur was also survival and the dinosaur isnt extant anymore obedience to this command survive does not mean that every attempt to obey is uniformly successful changing environment mutation change in the form or nature of something and many other things work against any one organism attaining infallible survival techniques or form what would be the optimum survival characteristics of various life forms they would have to have various fundamental characteristics differing from one species to the next just as one environment differs from the next this is important since it has been but poorly considered in the past that set of survival characteristics in one species would not be survival characteristics in another the methods of survival can be summed under the headings of food protection defensive and offensive and procreation there are existing life forms which lack solutions to these problems every life form errs one way or another by holding characteristic too long or developing characteristics which may lead to its extinction but the developments which bring about successfulness of form are far more striking than their errors the naturalist and biologist are continually resolving the characteristics of this or that life form by discovering that need rather than whim governs such developments the hinges of the clam shell the awesome face on the wings of the butterfly have survival value the goals of man then stem from the single goal of survival through conquest of the material universe the success of his survival is measured in terms of the broad survival of all the dynamics every individual is made up of central thrust through existence this drive this thrust through existence is survival it is the effort on the part of the organism to survive we call the urge toward survival dynamic as this urge becomes enturbulated put into state of agitation or disturbance or influenced by outside forces it is either suppressed or it is diluted with other peoples purposes that is to say other people force their purposes on the individual in either way the dynamic itself becomes to some slight degree enturbulated as the survival dynamic is cut back or as it is entered or acted upon by other influencesother people and the regular suppressors of life such as the absence of food clothing and shelterthis dynamic can become more and more enturbulated until it is headed toward death or succumb exactly in the opposite direction the dynamic goes toward succumb in the exact ratio that it is enturbulated it goes toward survival in the exact ratio that it is clean and clear that is regarding it as just one dynamic if we take look at this dynamic through magnifying glass we find that in this one thrust there are actually eight thrusts or eight dynamics the first dynamic is the urge toward existence as ones self it is the effort to survive as an individual to be an individual to attain the highest level of survival for the longest possible time for self here we have individuality expressed fully the second dynamic is the urge toward existence as future generation it has two compartments sex and the family unit including the rearing of children the third dynamic is the urge to survive as part of group with the individual himself furnishing this motivation any group temporary or permanent political or social is part of the third dynamic and each one is third dynamic the fourth dynamic is survival through man as species whereas the white race would be considered third dynamic all the races of man together would be considered the fourth dynamic the fifth dynamic is the urge to survive for any and every form of life these would include all living things whether animal or vegetable anything directly and intimately motivated by life it is the individuals effort to survive to make life survive the sixth dynamic is the urge toward existence as the physical universe it is the drive of the individual to enhance the survival of all matter energy space and timethe component parts of the physical universe which we call mest the individual actually has thrust for the survival of the material universe the seventh dynamic is the urge toward existence as or of spirits anything spiritual with or without identity would come under the heading of the seventh dynamic this is separate from the physical universe and is the source of life itself thus there is an effort for the survival of life source the eighth dynamic is the urge toward existence as infinity this is also identified as the supreme being this can be called the infinity or god dynamic find out how to become happy and prosperous on all of your
