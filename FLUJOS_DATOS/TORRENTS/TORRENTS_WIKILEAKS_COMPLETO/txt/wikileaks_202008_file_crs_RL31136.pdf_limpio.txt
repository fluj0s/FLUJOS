summary on july 17 2001 president bush proposed that the world bank implement plan where half of all its assistance to the worlds poorest countries would be grants rather than lowinterest loans he said this would enable the bank increase its levels of assistance for education health and other programs aimed at poverty alleviation it would also keep poor countries from falling further into debt the increased funding would be tied he said to clear and measurable results the international development association ida is the part of the bank that currently makes lowcost loans long repayment periods very low service charge to poor countries ida loans are funded with money contributed annually by donor countries although there has been widespread support for the concept of ida grants among other donors multilateral agencies and the public many have indicated that they prefer much smaller program than the president has proposed many are concerned about the longterm financial impact large grant program might have on ida ida funds substantial portion of its new lending 40 of all commitments planned during the period 19992001 with repayments from prior loans these are often called reflows over time if reflows are not available to help cover the cost of future ida assistance the cost of the world banks concessional aid program to poor countries will gradually rise the president did not indicate in his original proposal that the administration would support increased funding for ida to help support the cost of new grants in december the administration said it would be willing to raise the us contribution level by up to 18 if certain institutional changes were made in the world bank but it did not link the projected increase to the issue of grants some people are concerned that the grant proposal is ultimately plan to defund the world bank to bring about the ultimate termination of ida either because it is too costly to donors or because it does not have sufficient funds in 2000 congressionallyappointed study panel the meltzer commission made several proposals to replace world bank ida loans with grants one of these would create large grant program funded with new contributions to address poverty alleviation and policy reform issues second proposal though would basically dissolve the world bank and use its residual assets to fund special program at cost to anyone addressing global needs many of those with reservations about the presidents proposal hear echos of the meltzer commissions recommendation particularly the second recommendation in his grant plan the issue is being negotiated in the series of talks currently taking place on terms for new replenishment ida 13 of ida resources in the foreseeable future the costs and the benefits from 50 grant program are not dramatically different than those available from the present ida program most of the costs and benefits occur thirty to forty years hence in context which may or may not be similar to that faced by developing countries today some analysts believe that the underlying controversy may be less about ida finances and more about influence in the international financial institutions should the europeans develop common policy front on ifi matters as they have in this case they will be the largest single member country and their leadership role will be substantially

to genoa for meeting with the top leaders of the seven leading industrial countries g7 president george w bush called on the world bank and other multilateral development banks mdbs to provide major share of their assistance to poor countries in the form of grants rather than lowcost loans speaking before several hundred world bank employees bush claimed that his plan would help poor countries without adding to their heavy burden of debt i propose he said that up to 50 percent of the funds provided by the development banks to the poorest countries be provided as grants for education health nutrition water supply sanitation and other human needs this would be he said compassionate conservatis m at the international level alluding to protestors who have been calling for major cancellation of debt owed by poor countries the president said that his proposal doesnt merely drop the debt it helps stop the debt the increased funding would be tied the president said to clear and measurable results 1 the white house noted later that the president sought to convert to grants half the money the bank lends to poor countries annually through its concessional loan facility the international development association ida few countries borrow both from ida and from the banks regular loan window the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd because these blend countries would not be eligible for grants the presidents plan would actually involve only about 40 of total ida funding grant program would have clear benefits the administration argued for economic development and longrun poverty reduction besides spokesmen said grant program would allow better assessments exante of project effectiveness grants could be tied to clear and measurable policy instruments to require more prior commitment to achievement of program goals and to link the actual payment of the grant to clear expost output measures2 the administration did not explain athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31136crs2 2continued it claimed that the presidents proposal would make possible major new increase in funding for education this would be consistent it noted with the presidents theme that child should be left behind that every child must be educated it is often difficult for the worlds poorest countries to generate the economic returns with which to pay back funds borrowed for education and other development priorities the department observed it makes little sense either for the borrower countries or the mdbs to be financing projects with loans that cannot be repaid it said more assistance could be provided with grants it argued for health education nutrition water supply and sanitation projects in poor countries benefitting children in subtle change it noted that under the presidents proposal up to fifty percent of ida assistance to the worlds poorest countries could be provided in the form of grants rather than loans emphasis added us treasury

july 18 2001 p a1 the time what the president meant by the comment that grant aid should be tied to ex assessments or that the payment of the grant should be linked to expost output measures the presidents summit colleagues had little comment on his proposal the g8 called on the world bank and other mdbs to take further steps to help poor countries3 they did not mention however the issue of ida grants in separate communique the g7 countries the major mdb donor countries comprising the g8 less russia said that they might be willing to discuss the concept further we support meaningful replenishment of ida and in that context we will explore the increased use of grants for priority social investments such as education and health they made comment on the president proposal4 separately many other g7 countries expressed opposition to the plan its not something that we agree with indicated beverly warmington spokeswoman for the british department for international development the world bank is actually bank and there are development agencies to give grants its important that the world bank work alongside them instead of competing with them5 michael hofmann director general for germanys ministry of economic cooperation and development was also quoted as saying that he thought an important element was missing from the presidents proposal if it had been accompanied by an announcement that the president would ask congress to increase the american contribution by specific amount he said then the whole thing would have had very different melody if none of the g7 countries really want to increase their ida contributions he said such suggestion can mean only one thing reducing the business of the bank the french noted that while they supported the idea of grants the us proposal went further than they could support the german government told meeting of worldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31136crs3 6 sanger david 2001 rich nations offer hand but the

budget authority which is available for many years and can be drawn by ida when needed outlays to help fund disbursements for ida projects by contrast according to world bank sources the germans vote money each year for their share of idas expected annual disbursements considerable care must be taken to match the amount voted with the amount ida will actually need to draw in the coming year from

example of ignorance about ida finances or ploy to cut the world bank down in size he suggested that the effort to expand the flow of grants through ida might be an attempt by the administration to cover the fact that the united states was reducing its overall level of bilateral foreign aid7 others questioned whether the ida donor countries would be willing to contribute the additional funds necessary to make the new plan feasible8 columnist milan vesely claims that the new proposal was posturing he noted that condoleezza rice the presidents national security advisor had said that the grant plan would have financial impact on ida for ten years he observed that she had not said when or whether the administration planned to ask congress for money to help fund future costs9 nancy alexander spokesperson for an ngo critical of globalization suggested that when combined with the world banks proposed private sector development strategy the presidents plan for ida grants poses

unsustainable debt by poor countries said spokesmen for the two organizations and it would make maximal use of development funds however the plan is viable only if donors agree to offset the cost of reduced repayments to the world bank resulting from the conversion of loans to grants the united states could be most persuasive in its advocacy of grant program they said if it would make an upfront commitment of funds to allay suspicions that its proposal was merely posturing in support of the worlds poor while continuing to starve them for development resources they noted that compared to the

additional funding for the next replenishment13 this report explores the different ways switch from ida loans to ida grants might affect recipient and donor countries and the ida program itself the report looks at the role which debt repayments for old loans now play in funding idas current loan program and identifies some arguments for and against switch from loans to grants it also discusses some earlier proposals for shifting ida to grant basis and suggests issues that may be relevant to reaching an agreement among the donor countries on this matter initiation of program of ida grants might offer opportunities for increased flows of assistance for education health and other social programs however as discussed below the operational effects of shift from ida loans to grants may be felt only in the second decade after the change occurred and its full impact would be phased in slowly over period of up to 40 years grant program might allow donors to require that recipients give them more opportunities for monitoring program implementation than might be available for programs financed by loans however it might also force the donors to choose between increasing their contribution levels or seeing the ida program shrink in size likewise the change might offer recipient countries some relief from their debt payment burden over the next forty years since they would not have to repay the grant the efficiency of grantfunded programs might be enhanced but the recipient country might also feel less ownership for programs when it has little say in their implementation some observers believe that this may have negative effect on its willingness to continue funding for the program or to keep the original policies in place once the donor withdraws and the program becomes its responsibility the difference between loans and grants the terms for ida loans the world bank provides assistance to its countries through two loan windows legally they are separate organizations though in fact they share common staff management policies and rules the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd lends mainly to middleincome countries using funds borrowe d at commercial rates in world capital markets most ibrd borrowers have annual per capita incomes well below the 5280 ceiling on eligibility ibrd loans are repayable over 10 to 20 year period at interest rates slightly higher than those the bank pays to borrow funds the international development association ida by contrast makes loans to the worlds poorest countries most ida borrowers have annual per capita incomes well below the 885 ceiling for eligibility some small countries mostly island countries with marginally higher income levels and low creditworthiness may

specific projects in some years balance of payments support through structural adjustment loans sectoral adjustme nt loans and reconstruction or rehabilitation loans may comprise upwards of quarter of ida lending article v section 3e says that in special cases ida may make foreign exchange available for local expenditures this is regular element of many ida loans and is embodied in the ida rules allowing potential suppliers in the recipient country marginal advantage in price when they seek through international competitive bidding contracts to supply goods for ida projects 16 edward mason and robert asher the world bank since bretton woods the brookings institution washington dc 1973 the discussion here is based on chapter twelve an account of the history and operations of ida qualify ida loans are funded with money contributed by donor countries the united states presently contributes about 20 of idas new resources as idas uncommitted funds are used up the donors negotiate new plans every three years to replenish its resource s ida lends without interest and with principal repayments stretching after 10 year grace period over 20 to 30 years the borrower pays 34 of 1 service charge to ida which the world bank uses to cover ida administrative costs there is grace period for the service charge obligation except for fast disbursing adjustment loans which go out over 1 to 3 years ida loans are disbursed over period of 8 to 10 years as work on their projects is completed an earlier debate on loans or grants there is impediment in the ida articles of agreement to grants the ida articles specify that financing by the association shall take the form of loans however subsequent language authorizes ida to provide other types of financing in special circumstances deciding whether such circumstances exist is the responsibility of the executive board14 perusal of the ida articles and ida operations will show that number of activities possible only in special circumstances local cost financing or nonproject assistance for example are now common if sometimes implicit procedures15 as edward mason and robert asher noted in their official history of the world bank ida is simply fund administered by the world bank16 it was created because most poorer developing countries could not afford to borrow from the ibrd us government advisory board headed by nelson rockefeller and panel of experts at the united nations both proposed in the early 1950s establishment of new international development agency or authority to provide assistance on grant basis for activities that were desirable on social grounds but could not bear the full burden of loan finance eventually the proponents abandoned the concept of grants in favor of concessionalrate loans on the expectation that this would be more acceptable to the prospective donor countries httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31136crs7 17 ida articles of agreement at article v section 2 18 the articles specify that the executive board shall be responsible for idas general operations ida articles of agreement at article vi section 5 of the ida 19 see for example comments to this effect in alan beattie give and take european continuedida originated in proposal by senator as mike monroney dok in 1958 to create new international body that would finance development in poor countries by lending to them excess foreign currencies of other poor countries that were currently owned by aid donor nations though economically impractical the monroney plan was transformed by the eisenhower administr ation into an agency capable of making hard currency loans to poor countries on easyrepayment terms monroneys original concept loans of excess foreign currencies though dead letter is included in the ida charter some donor countries supported monroneys idea that ida loans might be repaid in local currency as mason and asher note the ida charter did not foreclose it but use has been made of the provision authorizing such loans world bank management was reportedly more opposed originally to the concept of ida loans than it was to ida grants fearing that concessional loan window would confuse potential bondholders and drive up the cost of ibrd capital officially ida provides aid in the form of credits in order to distinguish it from ibrd loans during negotiations on the ida articles of agreement many prospective donor countries spoke in favor of the concept that ida should have the authority to make grants mason and asher report that the united kingdom france canada and the netherlands were leading advocates of this view while the united states was in staunch opposition the ida charter specifies that all the assistance provided by ida from original subscriptions must be used for loans but it holds open the possibility that resources from future replenishments may be used for grants if specifically authorized by the donor countries at that time17 decision to make grants as noted above an ida grant program may be created only with the consent of the donor countries as expressed in the new replenishment agreement the banks board of executive directors has the authority to determine when special circumstances exist but it has independent authority to create formal grant program18 twothirds vote of the donor countries is needed to approve new replenishment for ida the administration will need broad support from other countries to bring about the establishment of an ida grant program in recent decades the united states has provided about 20 of idas new resources but for historical reasons it has 148 voting share altogether the principal donor countries have 613 voting share in ida as practical matter it is extremely unlikely that developing countries would oppose new replenishment for ida as noted before though most other donor countries are at best lukewarm in their support for major ida grant program the poor countries would likely also look askance on the suggestion if they believe it would reduce the flow of aid they receive from the bank19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31136crs8 19continued countries are worried that us proposa ls to replace half of the world banks loans to some developing countries with grants could undermine the organization financial times london july 20 2001 p 20 20 this assumes loan with ten year grace period and thirty years for repayment of principal the annual repayment figure would be higher for ida loans with shorter repayment terms however these comprise minority of all ida assistance at one time ida replenishment agreements could not go forward without the consent of the united states and therefore the consent of congress in recent decades however the us contribution share had declined to the point where it longer has facto veto over ida replenishment plans the united states also has limited leverage with other donors on these matters in 1997 other ida donor countries indicated that if the united states did not bring its payment arrears up to date they might create new international agency to replace ida the united states would not be invited to join many in the united states believed that this would have serious negative implications for us foreign policy congress appropriated 1035 billion in fiscal 1998 to fully clear the ida arrears many observers doubt that the united states will be able to persuade other donor countries to adopt an ida replenishment plan whose provisions they do not support comparing the cost of loans and grants because of the grace period ida receives reflows from its loans for 10 years in that respect ida loans are the same as grants beginning in the 11th year and continuing for the life of the loan however ida receives stream of repayments of principal roughly for 30 year loan 33 of the amount lent initially20 those repayments can be and are used to fund new ida loans if the ida donor countries wanted to keep the ida loan program at constant level in nominal terms 6 billion year for example they could reduce their contributions annually at the end of the 10 year grace period by an amount equal to the new repayments being received ultimately ida would be able to provide constant nominal level of assistance to borrower countries without any new contributions by donors by contrast if the donors want an ida grant program to stay at constant nominal level they would have to contribute the same amount each year for as long as the program exists one might also compare the difference in the cost to the donors if they decided to keep the ida program at constant 6 billion annually for 20 years and to close it thereafter if ida were grant program the donors would need to contribute 6 billion annually total of 120 billion during those two decades by contrast if ida were loan program they would need to contribute 105 billion to support the same size program since reflows would pick up some of the cost during the second decade the donors could then choose what to do with the repayments ida would continue receiving thereafter if they chose to have the funds returned to them rather than assigning them for another purpose the donors would receive 105 billion in reflows during the next 30 years httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31136crs9 21 see for example remarks to this effect in newsday poor nations need more grants but who will pay

recipient countries the nettransf er of resources from an ida grant program to the recipient countries would be 100 since repayments are expected by contrast on face value basis the net transfer of resources from an ida loan is zero since all the money lent must be repaid this calculation overlooks however the time value of money because the repayment terms for ida loans are very easy there is substantial grant element to ida loans the net present value of the repayments from an ida loan must be discounted substantially because of their negligible interest cost and their long payment terms world bank accountants estimate that the grant element of an ida loan in 2001 was 44 or 47 or 67 depending whether the comparison is made to g7 official borrowing private borrowing or the standard 10 discount rate used by the development assistance committee dac of the oecd grant program is onetime transfer of money by contrast the ida loan program is revolving fund thus it can recycle the grant element of its loans indefinitely as the repayments from old loans are used to fund new loans the real value of idas future loans will likely be lower in the future because of exchange rate fluctuations and inflation each subsequent ida loan would have positive developmental impact so long as the projects are effectively designed and implemented for grants the money that would have been used for loan repayments would stay in the country its developmental impact will depend on the government and the economys capacity for making effective use of those resources idas repayment record some supporters of the presidents proposal argue that ida should shift its assistance program to grants as they believe there is little likelihood anyway that idas existing loans will be repaid21 mary ellen countryman white house assistant press secretary for foreign affairs told the press that presidents plan is simply plain speaking lets call it what it is lot of the loans arent getting paid back anyway22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31136crs10 23 world bank annual report 2000 washington dc 2000 volume 2 p 88others point out however that by and large ida has good repayment record seven countries are currently overdue in their loan payments together afghanistan congozaire congo republic liberia myanmar somalia and sudan are 469 million in arrears much of this balance has been accruing since the early 1990s 1988 for liberia23 the total amount lent to these countries was 38 billion most of which is not yet due at the end of its fiscal year 2000 ida had 858 billion in disbursed loans outstanding to all borrowers those seven countries currently have effective government or their government is at serious odds with most of the rest of the world the world bank expects that as has been the case before they will settle their overdue obligations once their current problems have ended or new government takes the helm the world bank stops making disbursements on its existing loans and it ceases all consideration of possible new loans when country becomes 6 months or more in arrears many ida borrower countries have real sources of international credit other than the world bank in their argument that ida loans are not repaid the advocates of grants may be referring more to the hipc program heavily indebted poor countries hipcs may qualify to have much of their debt owed to bilateral creditors and multilateral banks forgiven qualifying for hipc assistance remains though it has been expedited for 20 countries in the past year rigorous process among other things countries need to be current on their loan payments and adopt major programs of economic policy reform hipc debt is being forgiven not because the borrowers are not paying but because the donors are concerned about the human and development costs that will ensue as the debtors continue to service their debts except for debt expunged through hipc the world bank does not forgive loans reflows as share of ida usable funds the amount which ida is receiving annually in principal repayments for prior loans has grown substantially in recent years ten years ago during the world banks fiscal 1991 ida reflows totaled 274 million in 2000 by contrast the flow of principal repayments totaled 920 million by 2005 the amount will likely rise to 195 billion as will be discussed below substantial share of those future reflows has been earmarked to fund new projects that have already been approved the inflow of these resources has enabled ida to shift greater part of the cost of funding its future loans onto reflows reducing the amounts required from donor countries donors make their contributions in the form of noninterest bearing non negotiable promissory notes the balances on those notes are encashed as ida needs money to fund the disbursements on its existing loans overall in 2000 ida had cash flow of 56 billion supporting its current disbursement program of this 920 million was from reflows and 468 billion was drawn from the donors outstanding promissory notes on this basis in terms of its total operations ida loan repayments currently account for 20 of the resources available to fund ida lending operationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31136crs11 24 in effect the current arrangement resembles plan proposed earlier by the author both assume that future reflows can be pledged for use today either because they will not be needed in the distant future because of developmental success or because they will be in replaced by increased donor contributions if these assumptions are not well founded then the advisability of both plans may be subject to doubt see jonathan sanford feasibility of world bank interest subsidy account to supplement the existing ida program world development 167 1988 p 787the figure is different however for projects funded from the ida 12 replenishment plan in that replenishment contributions from donor countries comprise about 60 of the funds available to fund ida loan commitments approved during the period 2000 to 2002 loan repayments account for the remaining 40 the pool of ida reflows earmarked to help fund loans funded with ida 12 resources does not include only the repayments ida expects to receive during that three year period it also includes major share of the loan repayments that ida will receive during the following decade during which it will be making disbursements to implement ida 12 loans24 reportedly the ida donor countries plan to use this same procedure in future replenishments to help reduce the budgetary cost to them from the ida program at some point though they will likely find that most of the loan repayments scheduled for receipt during future replenishment period will have already been earmarked to fund loan commitments from earlier replenishments if successive threeyear ida loan plans are funded in part with reflows that are scheduled for receipts during the next eighttoten years the stream of uncommitted reflows will soon be exhausted presumably at some point the donors will need to decide whether the existing size of idas loan program should be maintained through increased payments or whether it program should shrink to level that can be supported solely by the donors contributions president bush did not propose that idas existing loan portfolio should be converted retroactively into grants the world bank is writing off through the hipc program some ida debt owed by poor countries however thought has been given to writing off all the ida debt owed by all countries reflows would continue to be available from earlier ida loans the current talk about grants concerns the nature of idas future aid program earlier proposals for ida grants general support for the concept the concept of ida grants had been under discussion for some time there seems to be broad base of international support for the basic concept that some ida assistance should be provided on grant terms until president bush made his proposal however few proposals seemed to contemplate that large share of ida resources would be allocated on such terms the ida eleventh replenishment agreement ida 11

the hipc program until late 2001 at least most of the donor countries participating in talks about new replenishment of ida resources ida 13 had reportedly been willing to consider grant program involving perhaps 10 to 20 of ida funds meanwhile bank president james wolfensohn reportedly favored the idea of an ida grant program totaling up to 1 billion annually25 us secretary of the treasury lawrence summers proposed at the world bankimf annual meeting in september 2000 that ida should provide more grant assistance to its recipient countries specifically he said precautions should be taken to avoid loading up heavily indebted poor countries hipcs with new debt once the hipc program had reduced their foreign debt to sustainable levels further restraint on concessional lending may also be warranted he said including though greater recourse to grant financing ida should also put more emphasis he said on education health and other social programs summers did not put number on his recommendation treasury officials suggest however that in private discussions summers was advocating 20 grant level at the time26 discussion of an ida grant program has taken place in context where to an increasing degree most foreign assistance is given to lowincome countries on grant basis on the average between 1971 and 1973 55 of the official development assistance oda the rich countries provided to poor countries on bilateral basis took the form of grants27 between 1988 and 1989 grants comprised on average 78 of their bilateral oda by 1999 almost 90 of the bilateral oda from the richer countries was grant aid28 for many ida donor countries all of their bilateral foreign assistance is provided on grant terms congress has spoken favorably on the question of ida grants in 2000

directs the treasury secretary to give high priority and to vigorously advocate the adoption of policies during the current talks about the terms for new replenishment of ida resources which would enable ida to provide grant assistance rather than loans for countries eligible for hipc debt relief the house appropriations committee said in the report h rept 107142 accompanying its legislation that ida should provide allgrant assistance to each hipc beneficiary country for three year period following its hipc decision point the committee also said that it agreed with the recommendations of the meltzer commission see below with respect to its support for multilateral debt forgiveness under certain conditions and conversion of ida into an agency making poverty alleviation grants it is not clear from the report language whether the committee believed that all ida assistance to all countries should be provided on grant terms or whether such grant assistance should be limited solely to hipc countries meltzer commission proposals the commission report the presidents proposal was also proceeded by other proposals seeming major reductions and sometimes elimination in the international financial institutions ifis most prominent among these was the march 2000 report of the international financial institution advisory commission chaired by allan h meltzer29 meltzer is an economics professor at carnegie mellon university to some observers many of the arguments voiced by the president the points about increased effectiveness and expost evaluation for example resemble those made earlier by that panel us treasury department officials maintain that the administrations proposal for 50 ida grants was not derived from the meltzer commission report rather they argue it is based on sound development principles linking them together they say is guilt by association the ifi advisory commission was created in 1998 as part of legislation enacted that year authorizing us participation in the most recent quota increase of the international monetary fund the eleven members of the panel were appointed by the house and senate leadership six by the republican majority and five by the democratic minority the commission issued its report on the strength of an 8 to 3 vote although one member signed both the majority and minority reports many of the commissions recommendations and findings were controversial among other things it proposed that the world bank should cease making loans except inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31136crs14 28 the commission said that until the african development bank was ready to assume full responsibility for development lending in its region the world bank should continue making ida loans to african countries it also said that

two kinds of grant programs were mentioned31 the commission recommended that the bank replace its loan program with program of grants aimed at alleviating poverty and promoting structural reform32 it would not fund the traditional types of development projects healthcare primary education and physical infrastructure were mentioned as possible areas of emphasis focusing on the poorest countries those with per capita annual income levels below 2500 it would be funded by contributions from the industrialized countries the new program would be costly the commission said and the amount of money requested from legislatures to fund explicit grants should rise in addition it said that the united states should significantly increase its support of effective programs to reduce poverty the six dollars per capita currently spent is too much for ineffective programs but too little for effective programs33 the commission also proposed that another grant program should be created terminating and replacing the existing world bank34 under this plan the bank would transfer all or most of its callable capital assets to the regional mdbs to help them broaden their responsibilities the world banks paidin capital and retained earnings would be transferred however to special trust fund the income generated by that trust fund would underwrite grant program addressing global public goods these include environme nt communicable disease intercountry infrastructure systems development of agricultural technology and the creation of improved managerial and regulatory practices the commission did not say how large it thought the program should be in 2000 ibrd paidin capital totaled 114 billion and retained earnings totaled 19 billion if this were invested in us government bonds at 5 the yield would be in the range of 15 billion annually in both cases in what may be the commissions most innovative concept the grants would be channeled through private suppliers who would be reimbursed for their costs only if independent auditors found that they had met specific quantitative performance goals which had been agreed to in advance if the goals were not achieved the service provider would not be paid in both plans reimbursement would be on sliding scale declining as share of total costs as the income level and credit rating of the recipient country increased programs in the poorest countries would get 90 subsidy those in the most prosperous would get 10 subsidy thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31136crs15 local government would have role in the actual implementation of the programs but it would be expected to pick up the cost not covered by these grants the two plans outlined by the commission were intended to hold program managers to higher standard of accountability and performance than is the case today this might increase the efficiency and costeffectiveness of programs the donor countries might also be able to require that the implementing agencies allow them to monitor programs funded by grants more closely than might be possible for programs implemented by governments and funded by loans critics contend that there are possibly serious drawbacks to these plans for example they say it is doubtful that many private organizations would be willing to implement ida grant programs if they have to provide the money to carry out the programs themselves with real guarantee that they would be reimbursed later few charitable organizations have such deep pockets the cost of borrowing money to implement these programs based solely on the prospect of contingent guarantee may be prohibitive too many things can go wrong the original goals of the project may prove unattainable close monitoring by donors may complicate the process or factors beyond the implementing agencys control may hinder success forprofit contractors might be willing to take the risk critics note but the cost likely substantial of that risk would need to be built into the price they would charge the international agency in any case assistance programs channeled through private organizations will still need the permission and cooperation of governm ents private organizations particularly those who are paid only if they succeed may be vulnerable to demands by corrupt government officials or requirements that funds be spent for suboptimal purposes in addition perhaps for legitimate reasons governments may be reluctant to pay their share of the costs if they have control over program operations the plan for grant program addressing global public goods might be valuable undertaking particularly if it could be done at cost to contributors however the use of world bank resources in this manner would have major opportunity costs in terms of other alternatives not pursued the world bank and the regional banks already address many of these issues particularly health in their current loan programs international agencies such as the global environmental fund world food program and world health program address many types of global problems the amounts available to fund grant program for global public goods would also be much smaller than that envisioned by the commissions plan critics argue the regional banks would be unable to make much use of callable capital transferred to them by the world bank unless it was accompanied by the associated paidin capital callable capital alone would not be sufficient basis for expanding the regional banks borrowing programs without matching paid in capital and additional reserves such borrowing would increase their exposure too much lending funded in this manner could lead to reductions in their bond ratings transfers of paidin capital would be needed before the regional banks could expand their operations and replace the world bank as the commission recommendedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31136crs16 35 world bank articles of agreement at article vi section 5 article v section

earnings may also be less than expected the banks articles of agreement say that if the ibrd terminates operations any funds remaining after all the banks debts have been paid shall be returned to the member countries this presumably includes the accrued net income of the bank as well as the paidin capital there is assurance particularly if major countries disagree with the plan that many assets would remain after the breakup to fund global trust fund35 subsequent proposals some observers have expressed concern that the bush administration ultimately seeks the adoption of plan for ida somewhat along the lines recommended by the meltzer commission if so they wonder what effect this might have on future us policy towards the world bank and ida their concern was heightened by the appearance in the week following the presidents speech of proposal to shut down the world bank and to use its assets to finance grants on july 26 2001 the wall street journal published an oped article by meltzer and adam lerrick his principal advisor on the commission36 it argued that idas loan program should be replaced by selffinancing grant system meltzer and lerrick note that ida currently has 108 billion in rich country contributions on its balance sheets partly in loans and partly in cash37 they argue that ida could invest these cash balances at what they claim is conservative rate of 8 producing perpetual income stream which might be used to fund 86 billion in new grants every year without any further need for donor contributions it is unclear whether they believe the full assets of ida should be invested in this manner now or if the cash should be invested now and the reflows should be invested later as they are received both approaches are implied in their article they say the world banks resistance to their proposal is motivated by intransigence institution arrogance and its lack of basic arithmetical skillshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31136crs17 38 the face value of idas disbursed loan portfolio is about 866 billion according to world bank accountants its fair market value in june 2001 was between 46 billion and 49 billion the face value of the portfolio must be discounted not only for net present value but also for credit risk seasoning multilateral and sovereign risk preferences and other factors the promissory notes from donors and the idas liquidity pool its remaining assets are fully committed to finance existing loans if someone buys those loans the price would presumably be reduced to offset these undisbursed but committed funds as ida has already agreed to use them to cover the ida share of projects currently being implemented new owner would presumably acquire this obligation as well as the funds thus the value of idas cash resources must be discounted in manner similar to that used for outstanding ida loans including the discounted value of these funds would bring the total up to about 56 billion see world bank ida special purpose financial statements june 30 2001 p 24the concept outlined in the meltzerlerrick plan may be feasible however critics argue its potential benefits should be compared with those available through continuation of the existing program and that the amount of assistance which might be available through their plan is likely to be smaller than they presume idas assets could be invested as meltzer and lerrick propose but the fair market value of idas portfolio is much smaller than they suggest ida does not have the contractual authority to recall its loans or to demand early payment of the balance due if it wants to turn its loan portfolio into cash those assets will have to be sold to another party according to this interpretation if ida were able to sell its assets and the purchasers paid what the bank considers the fair market price it might be able to get 56 billion which it could invest38 ten year us treasury notes currently yield 5 investing the full 56 billion on noload nocost basis ida might be able to realize something like 28 billion annually to fund future grant program on grantequivalency basis this is less than half the size of the current ida program it is also about onethird the amount that lerrick and meltzer believe might be available from implementation of their plan two other considerations might be assessed first potential purchasers may be unwilling to pay the amount the bank considers to be the fair market value of ida assets they may worry that the former ida borrowers will be less inclined to pay the new private owners of their notes since the new owners are unlikely to make them future concessional loans in that case the amount generated by the proposed investment scheme would be less than that estimated above second idas assets likely are worth more if ida remains functioning organization than they would be if it were liquidated in the former case the debtor countries are more likely to pay and ida would not need to discount the value of its assets as it uses loan repayments to fund future loans professor meltzer has spoken out strongly in favor of the presidents proposal though he has given it his own interpretation the plan will work he says and claims by bank spokesmen that donations would have to increase dramatically are incorrect despite what they say the grant proposals would be more efficient that is they

january 10 2002countries could borrow the rest commercially because they would have the banks guarantee39 it might be noted that under this interpretation of the presidents plan countries would pay commercial interest rates for half the money they used to fund project and ida grants would fund the rest on average the combined rate they would pay would be higher than the world bank and other mdbs now charge for their ordinary nearmarket rate loans presumably if the world bank guarantees the repayment of the commercial loans the recipient countries would have to pay the bank its usual fee for such service brett schaefer also stated in report prepared for the heritage foundation that clearly the time has come for the world bank to implement performancebased grants the administration should make sure he said that new funding for the next ida replenishment would be used for the grant proposal he also proposed that the administration seek agreement among other ida member countries for an arrangement to use existing ida resources for the grant proposal as they are repaid he said that congress should prohibit any future us participation in ida replenishment plans until ida implements the grant proposal he said that 873 million would be available to fund grants if the full resources of the next ida replenishment presumably 11 billion were invested at 8 for that purpose40 schaefers proposal would also go well beyond that proposed by president bush he would have the existing ida program which lends 6 billion year replaced by grant program about 15 its size less if as suggested by critics more realistic interest rate for investments were used and allowance is made for reflows already committed to support previously approved ida loans the administrations argument for grants us treasury department officials deny as noted earlier that the current us proposal for 50 ida grants is based in any way on the meltzer commission report they note that treasury secretary paul oneill was strongly critical of the meltzer commissions findings in his required report to congress discussing steps taken to implement the recommendations of the meltzer commission41 virtually every argument and finding was refuted they argued in detail the developmental effects of ida need to be enhanced treasury argues the other donor countries say they want to do more says the principal us negotiator but except for the united states none seem willing to increase their contributions grant program would intensify idas impact at relatively modest indirect cost to donors the world bank found that 40 ida grant program would reduce repayments by approximately 570 million year in the decade following the end of the 10 year grace period see below he mentioned considering the overall cost ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31136crs19 42 interview with william schuerch february 6 2002funding ida he argued this would be rather modest price to pay he noted that with the decline in commercial interest rates in recent years the grantequivalency of ida loans has fallen substantially to about 65 he calculated from much higher levels in the 1980s in many instances he argued grants are more appropriate way of providing assistance for longterm needs investments in social sector programs are crucial but their growth effects are not realized until many years in the future consequently they generate little income to help countries repay the loans which financed them increasingly he maintained most foreign aid is provided on grant terms some 99 of the official development assistance that dac countries provide to very low income developing countries now takes the form of grants many of the countries most resistant to ida grants give most or all of their bilateral aid to poor countries as grants he noted that while the united kingdom was strongly opposing the concept of ida grants the uk chancellor of the exchequer gave speech in ottawa supporting the establishment of new multibillion dollar trust fund to address through grants millennium development goals he also recollected that scandinavian country now opposing ida grants had advocated 100 grants decade earlier there is intrinsic reason to believe he argued that repayments for ida loans needed to be recycled through the world bank for them to be used effectively for development purposes arguably he maintained if the policies and institutions of recipient countries are sufficient their governments and private sector should be better able to make effective use of the income and benefits generated by ida projects to promote their own development in any case he asserted the argument that ida has an excellent repayment record is misleading in the past decade the g7 countries and others have agreed to forgive most or all of the repayments due from earlier bilateral aid loans to heavilyindebted poor countries ida has become in effect preferred creditor the donor countries have been willing to forego repayment of their old bilateral loans in order to ensure that debts to ida can be repaid since ida has bondholders like the ibrd who must be repaid and since the countries forgiving bilateral debt are the same ones responsible for most ida contributions he argued idas high repayment record is not an accurate reflection of its financial situation there is relationship the treasury department asserts between the presidents proposal for 50 grants and the world banks private sector development strategy treasury is taking its policy leadership from the presidents speech at the world bank on grants stated the official principally responsible for implementing us policy42 that speech has list of purposes for which grants might be used education health water and sanitation and couple other things that list does not include private sector activities or private provisioning of services he indicated that the ida deputies had agreed during their negotiating sessions that nobody

we would look to give more bilaterally instead france germany and japan have indicated by contrast that with the declining international value of the euro and yen they cannot afford to contribute the

four points first it asserted the current system makes more effective use of the limited aid funds which are available to help poor countries reflows from old loans are major element of the procedure for financing ida with grants there would be gap billions of dollars year in the third and forth decades that would have to be filled by major increases in donor contributions it seems reasonable to assume that there will be an ongoing need for ida finance it stated on this basis we should be taking long term view ida should remain loan program the statement argued because this enhances ownership and promotes effective cooperation among donor agencies the world bank and the other international development agencies should work in partnership not in competition clear and selective strategy for

reduction strategy process grants should be reserved for special situations such as postconflict recovery or regional programs to combat infectious disease where idas normal loan program might be inappropriate finally the british disputed the argument that ida countries could not afford to repay ida loans the statement noted that idas repayment record has been very good ida loans provide bridge it said between grants and nonconcessional borrowing by demonstrating that they can repay concessional loans countries help lay the groundwork for their future entry into the regular

poverty reduction such as school enrollment rates people with clean water sustained productivity growth per capita incomes and poverty rates the united states invited other countries to explore ideas

settlement of the outstanding issues the other donor countries were reluctant to go to or much beyond the 10 level while the united states held firm for the 50 goal the other countries had clear

for all idaeligible countries substantial differences in the financial impact on ida were noted however in certain cases grants limited to certain uses softening the terms and perhaps waiving the service charge the bank was able to present figures showing that only 10 of total ida resources would be needed while 50 of the projects or programs in the group could be made available on grant terms for the categories reserving ida grants for lowincome however the share of total ida resources devoted to grants was upwards of 20 and for the uspreferred option the total was for reasons explained above about 40 the bank later reported that the uspreferred idaonly grant program would have major outyear costs during the first decade it said the cost to donors would be about 30 million annually during the second decade the average annual cost would be 570 million in the third decade if the donors want to maintain ida at its existing level another 18 billion annually in new contributions would be required during the forth decade to keep ida the same size the donors would need to contribute an additional 35 billion annually56 where to go from here critics hear in the proposal by president bush echos of the plans put forth by professor meltzer and his colleagues the conditional reimbursement plan mentioned in the presidents original speech payment to the private supplier of services unless goals are achieved is similar to that proposed in the meltzer commission the presidents call for more ida aid for education health and poverty alleviation programs reminds many of the commissions plan to scrap the world banks other loan priorities in favor of special concentration on poverty alleviation and global public goods also by not discussing publicly the longterm costs or us additional contributions the president seemed to suggest in his speech that major ida grant program could be instituted at little or cost to the donor countries the treasury departments later

pp 78 58 see gci growing dangers of service apartheid op cit 59 john donaldson quoted in anna willard usa to stand firm on world bank grant proposal reuters august 6 2001 60 john taylor quoted by willard op cit the meltzer commission plan were not publicized or given much public emphasis in any case it was and remains unclear how the departments negotiating position comports with the goals announced in the presidents speech concern on this score is compounded by statements by some supporters of the presidents plan for example schaefer says that in all respects the grant system proposed by the meltzer commission would be superior to the current world bank lending system he believes that president bush has endorsed the meltzer plan in the next sentence he says that the bush administration recognizes this fact in the presidents july 17 proposal the presidents plan is he says variation of the meltzer commission proposal57 the global challenge initiative gci longtime critic of the imf and world bank picked up on this point many of the opponents of the us grant proposal see the us as potentially destroying the world bank and supplanting it with small grantgiving agency that spearheads outputbased aid schemes it stated it observed that this model had been proposed earlier by the meltzer commission grant program linked to outputbased aid and broad emphasis on privatization in the health education and clean water sectors would substantially reduce future access by poor people to public services and open the field to unregulated activity in these and other areas by foreign investors gci concluded58 world bank official was quoted as telling the press in mid2001 that the presidents decision to put specific number on his proposal for ida grants was distracting59 from this perspective it raised many extraneous issues and made the negotiations on the issue more difficult when he announced figure much larger than those the other countries had considered concern on the part of other donors about the size implications and possible hidden motives behind the presidents seems widespread from another perspective though the presidents bold announcement pushed the discussion into new areas which might not have been explored otherwise john taylor the current undersecretary of the treasury is quoted as saying that the one half figure is not negotiable and the other donor countries need to come around to the us position we will go all the way to bushs proposal i dont see it as bargaining situation60 this may be an effective strategy as final decision on the ida replenishment must be reached in early 2002 so there will be time for national legislatures to act during the year many people believe the administration is less desirous than are other donors of achieving large replenishment on the other hand taylors firm language may be negotiating ploy some observers note especially in the light of ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31136crs26 parallel us campaign to win broad multilateral support in its efforts to combat international terrorism there would appear to be grounds for compromise on this issue in money terms the two sides seem far apart in other ways however the difference between the parties may be smaller ida lent about 213 billion for health education social protection and water and sanitation projects about 32 of the total likewise ida lent 287 billion in 2001 to countries with per capita income levels below 350 annually this comprised about 41 of the total if half that assistance had been provided on grant basis either 15 or 20 of ida resources would have been required either approach could be the basis for splitthedifference type compromise there might be room for functional compromise in addition to modest grant program the replenishment might provide that major share of idas loans to very poor countries would be repayable in local currency this would retain the principal that loans must be repaid and with maintenance of value provision the value of the repayments would be retained the local currency could be used for loans to the issuing country covering local cost financing recurring costs or other similar activities in effect though loans these repayments would not require that countries find foreign exchange to cover the cost of projects whose economic benefits will not be realized until many years in the future likewise there might be room for procedural compromise which allows everyone to do what they want instead of the ida 13th replenishment being single account the donors could establish two subaccounts with contributions to either being counted as contributions to the replenishment as whole the funds contributed to ida 13a would be used to fund loans as in the past those contributed to ida 13b would be used to fund grants if the other donors channeled 10 of their overall contributi on to the grant account and the united states contributed its entire share the amount available for grants would comprise 28 to 31 of the total replenishment depending on the final us share the grant component would be even larger if other countries contributed larger share or if the world bank put the entire amount it usually contributes from ibrd net income into the grant account the latter might be done on the understanding that funds would be used for projects fighting aids and other endemic diseases for assistance to the poorest and for programs addressing global public goods all have been priority concerns of the bank and ida in recent years there might even be room for hybrid compromise half the idas loans to poor countries might be made on conditio nal basis where the repayments are automatically waived each year as contractual right so long as the borrower meets certain specified criteria for instance repayment would be required if the recipient continued to meet the education health poverty reduction or other performance requirements in the original loan plan this would facto convert future loan repayments into future grants and establish 40 year incentive plan for recipient countries from the us perspective it appears that the administration may need an agreement where 50 of some type of ida assistance will be allocated as grantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31136crs27 otherwise the new ida 13 replenishment bill may face renewed criticism in congress as well as opposition by the administrations conservative supporters by contrast with 50 agreement of some type the administration might be able to present the replenishment plan as victory and demonstration that the world bank can be reformed this would be particularly so if the new replenishment required broadly supported institutional changes or the adoption of improved methods for monitoring project implementation and outcomes from the perspective of the other donor countries by contrast it would appear important that any agreement for ida grants should not threaten the financial integrity of the program one possibility might be an ida 13 replenishment plan in which larger share of the new resources comes from donor contributions and smaller share comes from the advanced commitment of future reflows more reflows could be scheduled for use in financing new loan commitments only when they were actually received this would leave available for future ida replenishments larger share of the remaining future reflows on this basis any longterm negative effects that grant program might have on ida finances would be limited in their impact and would be spread out over longer period of time several other observations might be made first it is not clear how much grant money the poor countries could afford to receive particularly if the assistance requires increased spending for social sector programs grants will relieve countries of the need to budget for repayments however they can add to countries budgetary costs in other ways the mdbs usually finance the import costs of projects the borrower normally pays the local costs as well as the recurring costs for programs or projects once they are established the recipients would have to find room in their national budgets often difficult task for these costs health and education programs generally require larger proportional inputs from the recipients than do many other kinds of projects if the recipients cannot afford the counterpart and recurring costs of new health and education programs it may be inappropriate for ida to set aside large sums for grants to sponsor them second concern about the longterm implications of the banks prospective private sector development strategy need not be an impediment to adoption of grant program president bush said in his original speech that performance based assistance should be part of his proposed grant program however it is not evident from his speech and subsequent administration statements that all ida grants need be provided on this basis if the parties were willing the new replenishment agreement could provide that none or only small portion perhaps up to 10 of ida grants could be used in this manner third the growth effects of different types of programs may merit consideration treasury secretary oneill said earlier in 2001 that he believed the mdbs should put less emphasis on peripheral matters and more stress on programs that encourage economic growth and increased productivity investments in human capital through education health and related programs will improve the productivity of labor in the long run however investments in infrastructure power transportation etc and capital facilities may boost efficiency levels and promote growth and development somewhat faster likewise programs promoting economic policy reform better governance stronger institutions and recovery from war or natural disaster can havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31136crs28 strong mediumterm growth effects also improvements in infrastructure and reform are more likely to stimulate inflows of foreign investment unless the donors expand the size of the ida program more ida assistance for humanitarian programs will necessarily mean less assistance for other types of programs fourth steps may be required to protect grant programs from competition from an ida grant program the terms and objectives of an ida grant program will need to be coordinated with those of the development programme world food program and other international grantmaking programs some critics of the presidents proposal worry about mission creepa concern that ida might compete or undercut the other agencies if it has sizable grant program however there is great deal of overlap and similarity among the multilateral banks and the development agencies these days in the types of programs they all finance the world bank may have made incursions into the other agencies turf but there seem to have been at least as many incursions in the other direction as well supporters of the existing arrangement argue that an ida loan program is desirable if only because it teaches borrower countries that the repayment of debt has positive consequences however questions have been raised as to whether the principal difference between ida and the development programs should be their repayment terms and not in the types of activities they support or the skills and priorities they bring to the table ida loans or ida grants the issue of overlap among the international aid agencies is one which merits closer examination fifth attention might also be paid to the equity effects of future changes in idas repayment formula the world bank has suggested for example that ida might harden some of its repayment terms in order to offset the costs of grant program caution should be exercised regarding plans for gearing up the creditworthiness of borrower countries or for promoting efficiency in ida operations in themselves these may be worthy concerns countries may enhance their creditworthiness if they are able to pay gradually increasing interest rate for their ida loans the efficient use of ida resources may also be improved if less needy countries pay more for ida loans however if the proceeds of the higher ida interest costs are used to defray the costs of ida grants then some of the cost of the grant program will have been shifted from the rich donor countries to the poor countries who are only slightly better off than their poorer neighbors sixth the claim that recipient countries will be more likely to waste ida resources if they receive assistance in the form of grants rather than loans might be questioned this argument seems to presume that the banks normal oversight mechanisms would break down or the bank would be more willing to fund weak projects through grants than it would through loans there is evident reason why the bank would use different standards for evaluating or implementing grant projects than it would for loan projects likewise there is way of knowing beforehand whether the bank will make better use of ida resources if it gets them back as loan repayments than the recipient will do if it had them as grant nobody knows whether the governments of idarecipient countries will be wise or foolish thirty years from now an appropriate concern might be whether the poor in those countries are the principal beneficiary of the activities funded by the hypothetical loan repayments in any case future country performance issues can be addresse d at least as easily through the banks country review process as through future loan programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31136crs29 seventh it seems apparent to most observers that little real progress can be made in discussion about ida grants if other participants harbor serious reservations about the longterm motivations of the united states from press reports and discussions it seems that some countries worry that the presidents grant proposal would defund ida substantially increasing the future cost of the program and possibly leading to its closure or substantial reduction in size few people seem to know about the administrations statement in december 2001 that it might support an 18 increase in us contributions progress in the negotiations might be enhanced if all donors were willing to discuss and include language in the final report describing their longterm plans and expectations in particular they might state whether they believe their countries future contribution levels to ida should increase as decline in future reflows diminishes the amounts of money ida has available to support new loans or whether they believe the ida program should shrink in size as the inflow of future debt repayments gradually declines in many respects it appears that the controversy about ida loans and grants is not really one about ida finances the costs and benefits of grant program would be phased in gradually and would become significant only thirty to forty years hence the real benefits from grant accrue not at the time of the award but at the time the repayme nts for the alternative loan would need to have been made in fact ida could reduce its assistance levels to former grant recipients by amounts comparable to the hypothetical loan repayments and countries would have the same amount available in future years to fund new development projects as they would have if all assistance had been financed through loans whether or not they would use it wisely and for antipoverty purposes is different concern the world bank reports that grant program would require billions of dollars in new annual contributions from donors thirty or forty years hence if ida is to be kept at the same level as before this presumes that the donor countries continue to include 50 grant provision in future replenishments it also assumes that the demand for development aid will be as great forty years from now as it is today and the world bank will need those ida reflows in 2040 to fund new ida loan programs whose repayments would stretch to the end of the century and fund new loans going well into the next all these contingencies are speculative if they were agreed on basic principles the donor countries and the bank should be able to work them out over the coming decades on another level the controversy seems to be not ida finances but the donor countries relative influence in international agencies until recently the united states has been the predominant voice and influence within the world bank increasingly however it seems that the other donor countries are becoming more assertive in their views in part this may be due to concern about the direction of us policy in part though it also seems function of their growing relative size already it appears that the european countries are devising their policies more in consultation with one another than in separate consultations with the united states should the countries of the european union ever develop common policy position they would be in effect the largest single member country in the bank the debate on ida grants seems to presage situation where influence in the multilateral banks will be more evenly distributed and where unless the united states makes major efforts to increase its financial support and to reshape the way it tries to influence policy thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31136crs30 europeans in particular will seek and find larger role what effect this may have on the organization and operations of the multilateral agencies remains undetermined
