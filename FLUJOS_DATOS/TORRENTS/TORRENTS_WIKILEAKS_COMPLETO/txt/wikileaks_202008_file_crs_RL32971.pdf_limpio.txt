appointme nt authority and traditional notions of judicial independence and has b een the subject of recent litigation6 textual issues two fundamental textual issues inhere to any consideration of the recess appointments clause the first point of inqui ry in this regard is what constitutes vacancy that may happen during the recess of the senate if the term happen is interpreted as referring only to vacancies that occur during recess it necessarily follows that the president would lack aut hority to make rece ss appointment to vacancy that existed prior to the recess conversely if happe n is construed more broadly to encompass vacancies that exist during recess the president would be empowered to make recess appointment to any vacant position irrespective of whether the position became vacant prior to or during the recess of the senate while this issue was source of controversy in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries long line of attorn ey general opinions nd judicial decisions have adopted the broader interpretation of the clause attorney general william wirt serving under president monroe concl uded that the phrase encompassed all vacancies that happen to exist during the recess declaring that this seems to the only construction of the constitution whic h is compatible with its spirit reason and purpose7 this interpretation was first adopt ed by federal court in the 1880 decision in re farrow 8 and has adhered in judicial opinions on the issue in the modern era similar interpretive difficultie s adhere to the meaning of the phrase the recess of the senate an opinion issued by ttorney general knox in 1901 concluded that the phrase applied only to adjournments between sessions of congress commonly referred to as intersession recesses in reaching this determination knox placed significant weight on the use of the defin ite article the in the recess appointments clause emphasizing that it will be observed that the phrase is the recess9 the opinion further concluded th at if recess appointments were allowed during periods other than an intersession recess nothing would prevent an appointment from being made during any adjournment as from thursday or friday until the following monday10 this position was abandoned in 1921 in an opinion issued by attorney general daugherty that declared that an appoi ntment made during 29 day recess was

where palpable abuse of discretion might subject his appointment to review13 subsequent attorney general and department of justice office of legal counsel opi nions have continued to support the constitutionality of intrasession rece ss appointments with more recent pronouncements on the issue asserting that the clause encompa sses all recesses in excess of three days14 congressional action since the early history of the republic congress has established statutory framework designed to protect the senates constitutional role in the confirmation process for instance the federal vacanci reform act of 1998 which governs the filling of vacancies falling outside the sc ope of the recess appointments clause establishes which individuals may be designated by the president to temporarily perform the duties and functions of vacan t office and the length of time designee may serve15 the original version of the vacancies act was enacted in 186816 and the legislative roots of such

any recess appointee whose nomination has been voted down by the senate19 the provisions governing recess appoin tments are designed to protect the senates advice and consent function by confining the recess appointment power of the president by targeting the compensation of appointees as opposed to the presidents recess appointment power itself these limitations act as indirect controls on recess appointments and their constitu tionality has not been adjudicated the court in staebler v carter noted in dicta that if any and all restrictions on the presidents recess appoin tment power however

allocco on appeal alloco argued that his conviction and sentence should be set aside on the basis that judge cashin was not constitutionally empowered to preside over the trial24 in particular allocco argued that the president lacks authority to appoint temporary judges b if such appointments are per missible temporary judges may not preside over criminal trials and c the president lacks authority to fill vacancies in the judiciary that arise when the senate is in session25 addressing these arguments in united states v allocco the court of appeals for the second circuit began its analysis by stating that the recess power given to the president in article ii section 2 is expressly made applicable to all vacancies and the vacancies are clearly vacancies in the offices described in the appointments clause which could otherw ise be filled only with the advice and consent of the senate26 based upon this construction th court rejected the notion that judicial vacancies were implicitly excluded from the recess appointments clause by virtue of the nure and salary protections c onferred upon judges in article iii accordingly the court held that since the r ecess appointments clause empowers the president to make recess appointments of judges it necessarily follows that such judicial officers may exercise the power granted to article iii courts27 the court likewise rejected the argument that the presidents recess ppointment power does not extend to offices that become vacant wh ile the senate is in session declaring that such an interpretation would create executive paralysis and do violence to the orderly functioning of our complex government28 united stat v woodley in united states v woodley the court of appeals for the ninth circuit considered challenge to the

adhering to the practice stating that while the members of both the legislative and executive bran ches are sworn to uphold the constitution the courts alone are the final arbiters of its meaning33 the panel went on to note that long line of supreme cour t authority indicated that great weight was to be given to historical practice but declared that such reasoning longer however repres ents the thinking of the court34 the panel cited the supreme courts then recent decision in ins v chadha striking down the legislative veto for the proposition that any practice matter how fully accepted or efficient is subject to the demands of the constitution which defines powers andsets out just how they are to be exercised35 accordingly the panel held that while judicial recess appointments were widely accepted and could be seen as contributing to judicial effi ciency they were nonethele ss unconstitutional as such appointmentsoffend the explicit nd unambiguous command of article iii that the judicial power be exercised only by those enjoying life tenure and protection against diminution of compensation36 the ninth circuit voted to rehear the case banc 37 ultimately rejecting the

espoused the supreme courts declaration that all provisions of the constitution are to be deemed of equal validity39 and further noted that while article iii speaks specifically about the tenure of federal judges article ii is equally specific in ddressing the manner of their appointment40 accordingly the court concluded that there is reas onto favor one article over the other41 in support of

ins v chadha rendered reliance on histor ical practice inappropriate the court specifically noted that the legislative veto was recent practice barely 50 years old the use of which does not reach back to the days of the framers such as the practice at issue44 the court further stated that the legislative veto is an impermissible statutorymethodology unsupported by an expre ss grant of

whose nomination has been conf irmed but concluded that the power bestowed upon the president by article ii co mpelled it to therefore view the recess appointee not as danger to the indepe ndence of the judiciary but as the extraordinary exception to the prescriptions of article iii46 the decision in woodley was accompanied by vigorous four judge dissent that closely mirrored the panel decision in arguing that the direct conflict between th recess appointments clause and the tenure and salary provisions of article iii s hould be resolved in favor of the fundamental constitu tional values of judicial independence and separation of powers stating that such principles m ust prevail over peripheral concern for governmental efficiency and uncritical acceptance of historical practice the

serve on the fifth circuit on january 16 2001 during an intersession recess and appoi nting william h pryor to the eleventh circuit on february 20 2004 on the seventh day of ten day intrasession recess50 in statements accompanying the appointments the president noted that the selections would fill vacancies that had been designated as judicial emergenc ies and further pronounced that the appointments were justified in light of unprecedented obstructionist tactics in the senate that were in the view of the president inconsistent with the sena tes constitutional responsib ility and injurious to our judicial system while both appointme nts gave rise to criticism the pryor appointment was particular ly controversial having occurred during brief intrasession recess while there have been over 300 r ecess appointments to article iii courts only fourteen have been intrasessi on with the eleven day recess giving rise to the pryor appointment constituting th shortest period of time in which an intrasession judicial recess appointment has been made intrasession recess appointments were rare pr ior to 1943 when recesses during congressional sessions became more common it appears that pres idents made intrasession appointments only three times prior to 1943 in 1867 dur ing 73 day recess in 1921 during 27 day recess and in 1928 during 13 day recess of these the only

was considered banc by the eleventh circuit in evans v stephens 52 the court began its analysis by analyzing the structure of the recess appointments clause determining that the text of the united

congress to two sessions one congress had four sessions and several including the first had three sessions therefore even if the phrase the recess of the senate meant only recesse s between the sessions of the congress which we do not accept there could easily be more than one such r ecess per congress id at 1225 n7 appointments stating that while historical evidence one might not render them constitutional this historical practice l ooked at in light of the text of the constitution supports our conclusion in favor of the constitutionality of recess appointments to the federal judiciary54 as in woodley the court acknowledged that there is some tension between article iii and the r ecess appointment of judges to article iii courts but rejected the argument that the tenure and salary protections of article iii trump the r ecess appointments clause sta ting that the conflict between these equally important constitutional provisions is not irreconcilable the temporary judges appointed under the recess appointments clause are an exception to the general rule of article iii55 the court buttressed this determination with consideration of the purpose of the recess appointments clause stating that it was the intent of the framers to keep important offices filled and government functioning56 accordingly the court declared that while judici recess appointees lacked the protections enjoyed by confirmed article iii judges we accept the framers thought that what might be intolerable if prolonged was acceptable for relatively short while57 the court next turned to the question of whether intrasession recess appointments are constitutionally permissible declaring that it focused first on the language of the constitution and then on hi storical precedent and the purpose of the clause the court held that president bu sh appointed judge pryor during legitimate senate recess that is during recess within the meaning of the recess appointments clause58 acknowledging that historical and textual arguments could be made to the contrary the court stated that such arguments were not strong enough to persuade it that the presidents inte rpretation was incorrect and pronounced that it instead accepted that the recess originally and through today could just as properly refer generically to any one intr asession or intersessi on of the senates acts of recessing that is taking break59 the court was further persuaded by historical precedent establishing that twelve presidents have made more than 285 intrasession recess appointments and by its determination that the purpose of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32971crs10 60 id at 1226 61 id at 1225 62 id at 1227 63 id at 1229 barkett j dissenting 64 id at 1231 65 id at 1233 66 judge barkett touched upon the i ssue of intrasession appointments nonetheless stating continuedclause is less satisfied during an in trasession recess than during recess of potentially even shorter duration that comes as an intersession break60 the court was likewise untroubled by th brief duration of the intrasession recess giving rise to the pryor appointment the constitution on its face does not establish minimum time that an authorized break in the senate must last to give legal force to the presidents appointment power under the recess appoi ntments clause and we do not set that limit today although president has not before appointed judge to an article iii court during an intrasession r ecess as short as the one in this case appointments to other offices offices or dinarily requiring senate confirmation have been made during intrasession recesses of about this length or shorter furthermore several times in the past fairly short intrasession recesses have given rise to presidential appointments of judges to article iii courts61 having determined that the clause allo wed for recess appointments to the federal judiciary even during an intrasession recess the court c oncluded its opinion by declaring that it was not persuaded that the president exceeded his constitutional authority in any way that causes judge pryo rs judicial appointment to be invalid we conclude that judge pryor may sit with this court lawfully and act with all the powers of united states circuit judg during his term of office62 the decision in evans was accompanied by dissent from judge barkett arguing that the plain meaning of th recess appointments clause mandates restrictive interpretation of the term happen63 analyzing the text of the clause and surveying series of eighteenthcentury di ctionaries judge barkett argued that the question of when vacancy must occur ad mits of very little ambiguity accordingly the plain meaning rule compels the conclusion that the constitution means what it says the recess appointment power of article ii is good only for those vacancies that happen while the senate is in recess64 judge barkett went on to assert that the text of the clause viewed in light of the purpose of the recess appointment power and separation of powers princi ples mandated further that the president only be empowered to make appoi ntments during the recess in which they occur65 the dissents position in evans rendered it unnecessary for it to address the constitutionality of judicial recess appointments or the va lidity of intrasession recess appointments given that the vacancy fille d by pryor did not occur during the recess in which he was appointed66httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32971crs11 66 continued that the text of the constitution as well as the weight of the historical record strongly suggest that the founders meant to denote only intersession recesses id at 1228 n2 67 id at 1235 68 see n20 and accompanying text supra 69 the court appears to contemplate this in evans v stephens stating that to our knowledge congress has never attempted to diminish the pay of recessappointed judge while he was in office whether such an ttempt would be constitutional is itself an open question id at 1224 n6 70 see n57 and accompanying text supra 71 see n14 and accompanying text supra while judge barketts dissent does not specifically consider article iii or intrasession appointments the rationale underlying his disse nt is applicable to both contexts according to judge barkett literal interpretation of the recess appointments clause was necessitated by the real concrete concern that the understanding of the recess ppointment power embraced by the majority will allow the president to repeatedly bypass the role the framers intended the senate to play in reviewing presidential nominees67 the potential for such injury to the senates prerogatives in this regard is arguably magnified by judicial acceptance of intrasession appointments specifically the broad interpretation of the presidents authority under the recess ppointments clause adopted by the eleventh circuit could be seen as lending credence to th proposition that cong ressional restrictions on the presidents recess appointment power are constitutionally impermissible68 this determination would arguably be particularly applicable in the judicial recess appointment context in light of article iiis prohib ition on diminution of judicial salary69 if such an interpretation adheres it could give rise to dynamic whereby the president would have gal and constitutional basi s upon which to completely bypass the senate confirmation process specifically the authority to make intersession or intrasessi on recess appointments to any position coupled with the invalidity of the statutory restrictions di scussed above would enable the president to make successive recess appointments durin g short recesses with the practical effect of enabling an appointee to serve throughout the course of an administration without submitting to the senate confirmation proce ss such prospect might be viewed as particularly problematic for article iii purposes as it would allow ccessive recess appointments of judges arguably beyond th relatively short period of service deemed appropriate for such appointees by the court in evans 70 accordingly the holding in evans could be seen as implicitly approving the department of justices assertion that the recess appoi ntment power extends to ll vacancies and all recesses with the single arguable exception of minimis breaks of three days or less71 such an interpretation builds upon the maxims delineated in allocco and woodley and arguably transforms the recess ppointments clause from the supplementary and auxiliary mechanism discussed by hamilton into more significant grant of presidential power httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32971crs12 72 evans v stephens 125 sct 1640 2005 on the same day the supreme court
