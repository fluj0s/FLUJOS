consideration of the issues through the 105 congressth summary the 104 and 105 congresses actively considered legislation to alter the 40 th th hour workweek under the fair labo r standards act flsa and to modify the acts overtime pay requirements these initiatives proposed alternative work scheduling options for the private sector such as compensatory time off compressed scheduling and flexible credit hours in the 104 congres s hearings on workhours regulation were conducted in theth house of representatives and in the senate respectively on hr 2391 ballenger and s 1129 ashcroft on july 30 1996 the house passed hr 2391 comp time the measure was not considered by the senate in mid1996 president clinton proposed flexible workhours legislation going beyond the flsa by urging expansion of th family and medical leave act 1993 sent to congress in the fall of 1996 th clinton proposal was not acted upon modificat ion of the 40hour workweek standard was urged by the industry oriented labor policy association and the flexible employment compensation and scheduling coalition flecs among oth er groups and individuals it was opposed by the aflci by certain womens advocacy groups with other

intermittently through two congresses march 19 95 to early 1997 produced sharply differing opinions was such legislation needed if so what form should it take and wou ld the proposed measures have the effect of setting aside the 40hour pre overtime pay st andards of the flsa and in the process vitiate worker protections central to the debate was worker choice would participation in an alternativ workhours program and use of earned comp time or credit hours etc be at th discretion of the worker or at the direction of the employer conversely how much worker protection with regulatory and

introductory comment speaking generally th fair labor standards act flsa of 1938 as amended through the years requires that worker recei ve not less than oneandonehalf times his or her regular rate of pay timeandahalf for hours worked in excess of 40 per week within 40hour workweek taking into account the terms of any collective bargaining agreement that might be in place the employer is allowed reasonabl flexibility any configuration of hours is permitted within the 40hour weekly pattern eg 5 d ays of 8 hours 4 days of 10 hours 2 days of 20 hours so long as the total hours worked do not exceed 40 in single week within that context flexible hours of work compressed scheduling and comp time are permitted by the early 1990s just over 76 million nonsupervisory employees were covered by the overtime pa provisions of the act1 beginning in the late 1960s various initiatives were proposed that would have altered workhours regulation with respect to federal employees permitting wide r flexibility ie alternative work scheduling in 1978 congress adopted legislation setting in motion period of experimentation with flexible and compressed wor k scheduling for federal employees an initiative that became permanent after 1985 that same year the us supreme court ruled that employees of state and loca lhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97532crs2 governments were protected by the fair labor standards act following publi c discussion and hearings congress amended the flsa to allow state and loca l government employers to offer compensatory time off instead of cash overtime pay to their wo rkers given these public sector precedents some suggested simila r arrangement for private sector employers in march of 1985 and for number of years thereafter senator malcol m wallop rwyo proposed legislation setting aside the 40hour workwee k requirement of the flsa to allow employers with worker consent to trade overtime hours worked for subsequent paid timeoff comp time the workers would hav accrued comp time on straight time basis ne hour of overtime worked ie hours worked in excess of 40 per week for one hour of paid comp time this would have freed employers from the overtime pay timeandahalf requirements of the flsa thus reducing their labor costs the workers would have lost the added cash value of overtime pay timeandahalf while the income earned through working extr hours in excess of 40 per week would have been deferred that is taken as pai d time off whe n it would not disrupt the employers business the legislation was not enacted but interest in changing the flsa 40hour workweek standard for th private sector remained by the mid1990s such legislation was again under active consideration in the 104 congress senator ashcroft introduced s 1129 providing inter alia th for comp compressed scheduling and flexible credit hours hr 2391 wa s introduced by representative ballenger more limited proposal that would hav extended the comp time option available to state and local government employers to those of the private sector the house subcommittee on workforce protections conducted series of hearings dealing with broad spectrum of workhours issue s march june october and november 1995 hr 2391 was passed by the house on july 30 199 6 hearing on s 1129 was conducted by the committee on labor and human resources february 1996 in the 105 congress senator ashcroft introduced s 4 somewhat modifiedth version of his earlier proposal representative ballenger introduced hr 1 bil l similar to that approved by the prior congress in february 1997 hearings wer conducted both in the house and senate the language of these proposals evolved as the bills have moved through th legislative process th eir purpose however seems to have remained constant here after brief introduction we follow sequentially consideration of alternativ scheduling through the hearings of the 104 and 105 congresses the concepts setth th forth in the house report on hr 2391 1996 and

he stated the functions of the workplace and th demographics of the workforce have changed dramatically in order to remai n competiti ve mr ballenger said every us firm is looking for ways to increas flexibility and productivity meanwhile emp loyees are looking for ways to juggle work family and personal needs all too often the flsa serves as an impediment to these goals conversely representative owens the subcommittees rankin g4 minority member affirmed that the flsa already allows flexible work scheduleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97532crs4 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings

subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 33358adding the real issue is not flexibility the real issue is fairness and payin g americans for the work they do5 consideration of flexible hour s options began with testimony from the industry oriented labor policy association lpa an lpa report reinventing the fai r6 labor standards act to support the reengineered workplace october 7 1994 part of the hearings record seemed largely to set the tone for what would follow the lpa analysis argued that the flsa with its workforce protections was old and outofdate in the realm of labor law s holding position nearly comparable to that of the dead sea scrolls the flsa it charged discourages progressiv employment practices such as allowing employees to deviate from the standard 40 hour workweek and paying employees for overtime with timeandahal f compensatory time rather than cash7 industry demand for employee time the lpa noted may be somewha t unpredictable one week may involve consid erably less than 40 hours and the next week may involve considerable more and thus an mployee who works 50 hours one week mus t be paid overtime even if he or she only works 30 the next n alternative had occurred to the lpa if the act were to operate with monthly or quarterly focus thi s wouldnt occur thus an employer c ould allow an employee to only work 10 hours one week and then make up for that time later in the month by for example working three 50hour weeks in addition to this concept compressed scheduling the lpa urged comp tim option presented as worker friendly it observed the lack of flexibility imposed by the flsa when compensating employees for overtime work adds to th employers burden by making it di fficult to keep costs down factor it noted in establishment of comp time option for local government employees to assume that businesses strug gling to compete in todays global marketplace do not also bear substantial financial responsibilities

significantly different than they were in 1938 and the flsa as currently written is one of the thi ngs that has outlived its usefulness and demands renovation9 with similar focus j thomas higginbotham of the american institute f certified public accountants had written to chairman goo dling of the full committee urging enactment of comp time legislation employees would be able to receive one and onehalf hours of compensator time off in lieu of overtime pay we believe that employees should have thi s option to ensure that there is mutual acceptance on the part of both employer and employee there should be an agreem ent between the employer and employee prior to the performance of the work higginbot ham urged that comp time should be used by the employee within on year in order to prevent excessive accumulation of such hours10 june 8 1995 chairman ballenger opened the june hearing by affirming tha t flexible schedules are high on the lis t of issues of major concern to most employees and that the flsa in its current form works against flexibility in the workplace the act he s aid stands in the way of companies who attempt to utilize flexibl human resource strategies in order to allow workers to pursue more fulfillin g combinations of work family life and other interests11 representative owens viewed the issue differently today we begin full press attack on the 40 hour work week and overtime he queried what is the motive for attacking the 40 h our week and for attacking overtime we can only conclude that it is monstrous employer greed tell mr chairman mr owens aske d rhetorical ly how will we justify giving employers sole custody over th employees work schedule by allowing them greater flexibility beyond the 40 hou r work week we cannot justify any of these actions he argued for they are blatant exploitation of the american worker mr owens explained overtime provisions are under attack and we will be told that it is too much to ask employers to pay employees one and half times their hourly rate for overtime we will be told that private sector work ers want to receive compensatory time off rather than money for their overtime the questions are will the employees b given an opportunity to choose will they have d iscretion as to when they take the time and who will ensure that the employees in the private sector receive th compensatory time they are entitled to if the company goes out of businesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97532crs6 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 17017112 house subcommittee on workforce

arlyce robinson administrative support coordinator for computer science s corporation of falls church virginia ms robinson urged increased workhour s flexibility the flsa she noted was intended to protect us maybe 50 years ago it did but in the modern workplace it prevents flexibility13 kathleen m fairall senior human resource representative the timke n company manufacturer of roller bearings

group of businesses and organizations representing wide variety f industries which are here seeking to bring the fl sa into the 1990s she observed14 the fair labor standar ds act is depressionera legislation created in the 1930s to protect american workers from uncaring employers but times have changed and the act has not ironically many of the provisions of the act now serve as an obstruction rather than protection of employee interests comp time she suggested was an option obstructed by the flsa m experience has been ms fairall observed that most people would prefer t have the time off with pay rather than receiving the overtime check for man people the time spent with family or friends or outside interests is mor important than the cash15 others expressed similar views robert j niedzielski director of huma n resources development for tighe industries inc of york pennsylvania like ms fairall spoke for shrm he argued that the flsa had become convoluted an d arcane as the work

hearing expressed concern about the alleged family friendliness of th projected comp timecompressed workhours initiative edith rasell an economis t with the economic policy institute washingtonbased research and policy group19 argued that employers already have incredible flexibility ie flexibility within 40 hour workweek and in excess of 40 hours per week if they pay timeandahalf she added that imposing long hours of work is hardshi p on employees hardship that the flsa was intended to reduce in her prepared statement ms rasell noted if the overtime pay requirement is relaxed variability in scheduling is likely to become more common at their employers discretion some hourly workers may gain greater flexibility in taking time off from work but at the cost of losing the regularity and predictability of their work schedules ms rasell presented survey data which s he observed indicated that putative worker support for comp timecompressed work hours option in place of traditiona l overtime pay might be overstated20 michael leibig an attorney specializing in flsarelated cases argued tha t21 many of the complaints of inflexible workhours requirements have resulted from lack of understanding of the provi sions of the act it may also result he suggested from desire f flexible hours advocates to circumvent the essential purposes of the flsa some of the witn esses leibig noted have talked about problems of women and families and men and families parents and families and said that if they could use compensato ry time they could spend more time with their family but h ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97532crs8 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 20820922 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 21323 comp time is allowe d within 40hour workweek but this could be considered flexibility24 rather than comp time within the meaning of the proposed legislation house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 21525 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 20921026maintained the real problem is that americans are working more than 40 hours week and therefore dont have time to spend with their families the goal of family oriented people should be t get the work week back under control so that people have sufficient time in his opinion weakening the requirement that the wor k week stay short is not likely to cause more time off in his prepared text h e22 affirmed constant pressure for increasing hours of work is damaging an d disruptive it ought to be and is against the law of the fed eral fair labor standards act23 leibig po inted out that the flsa has since its inception disallowed payment in comp time i n lieu of cash arguing that institution of comp time option would24 fundamentally undercut the act system w hich allows work to be paid for by the adjustment of hours obviously undermines the forty hours of work standard of the act it allows the individual employe r to make an arrangement with an individual employee which results i n avoidance of th cash overtime rights of all other employees were comp time to be allowed without very clear restrictions on it the forty hours of work standard of the act would become dead letter when in 1985 the comp time option was legislated for state and local government employers he recalled it was recognized that extension of the comp time rule to the private sector would make enforcement of the hours of work standard next t impossible italics added25 aside from matters of compliance lei big expressed concern about extending to private sector employees the concept of deferred compensation allowed in comp time format for state and local government employees the main reason that compensatory time can work in the public sector but not in the private sector however is that every year thousands of private sector companies go out f business and if you allow compensatory time they will have an additional liability for the compensatory time banks that are built up for their employees if you allow compensatory time you are undermining the provisions of the fair labor standards act i n the private sector that require that pay be done on timely basis you are basically allowing the postponement of pay you are not reducing the cost of employment at all you are just allowing it to b postponed and in the private sector that raises particular problems26 but leib ig suggested weakening of the flsa might be the point of the comp timecompressed scheduling campaign he charged httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97532crs9 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 21321827 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 22222328the strategy is one which has selected key provisions of the flsa without which general enforcement would be difficult attacked each of those provisions in isolation attempted to establish the irrationality of the provision taken i n isolation and thereby gain series of amendments to the act which take n together would gut enforcement and effectively undermine the forty hour wor k week each of the provisions under challenge was originally placed in the fls regulatory scheme in response to specific employer tactics by which the basi c overtime provisions of the act might overwise be easily avoided moving on leibig contended number of american employers the flexibl work coalition are engaged in mounting argument favoring five reforms to th flsa to make the act more flexible and more modern in fact he concluded those reforms reflect exactly the strategies which employers seeking to avoid th forty hour work week standard have used since the 1930s these reforms would so weaken the national hours of work standard as to make it unenforceable27 questioning from the subcommittee questionin g of the witnesses was deferred till all had testified since number of flsarelated issues were before th subcommittee questioning moved in different directions representative ballenger addressed several questions to ms rasell concerning the quality of the polling data she had presented and which suggested that flexibl scheduling may not be priority or even popular issue for workers but th dialogue turned away from polling techniques to choice and to control ms rasell the question i think would be if there was an option who would exercise the option if i chairman ballenger i think youd have to have an agreemen t between the employer and employee ms rasell exactly exactly chairman ballenger i think thats the way we intend to tal k about the law ms rasell but if the employer wanted to take compensatory time instead of overtime pay just because i wanted overtime pay i might not get it and so chairman ballenger but its got to be an agreement between the employ er and the employee otherwise you are going to end up with plant thats not going to work ms rasell sure i think the feeling was that the employers have more power than the employees do and the choice would be more likely to be theirs than the employees28 representativ fawell directing his comment to mr leibig and speaking as lawyer declared the act ar cane though someone who may specialize in it andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97532crs10 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 22522629 house

23131 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 23123232teach it and live it may find the flsa relatively simple he asserted that th average hardworking administrator and workers are really befuddled by it an d confused there is he stated an awful lot of confusion out there representative29 miller of california interjected not being familiar with the law should not be reason to repeal the law30 represe ntative woolsey raised number of technical issues that seemed t suggest that the comp time option might not to entirely attractive to employers in her experience as human resources professional sh stated it was way more costly to have people take time off rather than pay them for their time and half because they took an hour and half for every hour they worked and we needed tha t productive work force she noted the use of comp time made scheduling ver difficult31 advocates of flexibility had consistently urged the shift of policy in terms f choice but choice for whom ms woolsey queried we have to look at the choices for the employees to make it work for them and if we give them those choices im going to question whether it will work for th employ er at all because if we give the employee the choice of cash or bankin g their time and banking time and not knowing when they are going to use it you have control over your scheduling who has the final say on when tha t compensatory time can be taken beyond choice per representative wo olsey found that the biggest challenge that my employees had w as notice of overtime they didnt mind working overtime but they needed prior notice of overtime she explained the employer is going to have to b responsible for notifying so people can have their child care if they are students they c an know when they get to go to school so theres lot thats going to fall on the employers shoulders that i dont think anybody thats recommending this is even thinking about it is not going to b simple she acknowledged that the option could work for the employees just fine it could work for the employer but she expected that it would be complicated32 here mr romerobarcelo of puerto rico turned to ms fairall of the timken company and the flecs coaliti on he reviewed the concept of banked hours ie working up front and deferring leave and pay until later and asked if the employe r would be expected to pay interest on these deferred earnings ms fairall i dont know ill have to defer that question tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97532crs11 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 23223333 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 23334 mr leibig an attorney was not associated with the coalition35mr romerobarcelo it hasnt been considered has it ms fairall continuing i dont know sir mr romerobarcelo because if they dont pay interest fo r that half of an hour mr leibig in the public sector they dont mr romerobarcelo when they are talking abou t compen satory time they are not talking about paying interest to th workers on the compensatory time i havent heard about it so imm ediately the employer is already making some money out of the compensatory time that it wasnt making before33 still engaged with ms fairall mr romerobarcelo raised the issue of choice was it her contention he asked that the employee would have the right to us accrued comp time when he wants it or is it that the employer would hav something to say about when the comp time is used ms fairall sir i think they would have to it would be mutually agreeable scheduling i mean they couldnt come up tomorrow and say i want to take tomorrow off as my compensatory time but on mutually agreeable time i think that t here would be an agreeable time the employer and the employee together would agree mr romerobarcelo when he gets paid the time and hal f does the employer have anything to say about when he should spend this money ms fairall sir mr romerobarcelo so in other words thats anothe r limitation to the employee where he has something that belongs to him but he cannot dispose of it somebody else has to agree with how hes going to dispose of it so hes got another limitation its like mortgage on his time34 at that juncture mr romerobarcelo returned to an issue raised in testimony by mr leibig mr romerobarcelo supposing the employer closes shop and liquidates he says oh hes lost money or hes just skimmed off th profits but he just says he lost money he even files for bankruptcy tha t happens very often what happens then to that compensatory time who pays for it ms fairall im

public employees mr romerobarcelo oh yes it is i can answer that it is one of the first mr leibig salary is first chairman ballenger well im not sure i was just going to ask but mr romerobarcelo observed sometimes ther not even money for wages very often that happens so theres another danger for the employees36 harkening back to the opening observations of representative ballenger about what workers want ie flexibility and to the polling data from ms rasell mr romerobarcelo summed up when you talk about many employees preferring that option they dont always know all of the economic effects of what they ar saying or what they are accepting he continued for the employee its better to h ave that time and half pay he can be cajoled and foole d into believing its better for him but its not better for him and this is something that we should realize we are not doing favor to the employees37 the ballenger bill hr 2391 as introduced on september 21 1995 representative ballenger introduced hr 2391 the compensatory time for l workers act of 1995 section 7 of the flsa deals wit h overtime pay section 7o with the ap plication of overtime pay standards to employees of state and loca l governmen ts hr 2391 as introduced would have broadened section 7o of the flsa to make its comp time option available with some technical modification to the entire workforce hr 2391 would permit the substitution f compensatory time off at rate not less than 1 12 hours for each hour of employment for which overtime compensation normally required ie timeandahalf p rivate sector employees could not accrue more than 240 hours of compensatory time comp time under hr 2391 could38 not be carried over from one 12month period not necessarily calendar year t another but rather if unused had to be cashedout paid for by the employer at timeandahalf rate such cash payment must be made for unused compensator leave later than 31 days after the end of the 12month period hr 2391 required the employer to allow the employee to draw dow n compensatory hours within reasonable period after making the request to do so if the use f the compensatory time does not unduly disrupt the operations of th employer the bill did not define reasonable period nor did it offer guidance for defining unduly disrupt under current dol implementing regulations designed for state and loca l governme nt

should reasonably and in good faith anticipate that it would impose an unreasonable burden on th agencys ability to provide services of acceptable quality and quantity for the public during the time requested without the u of the employees services40 these regulations however relate to the particular circumstances and culture f public sector employment41 the hearings resume during the fall of 1995 the hearings on flsa overtime issues resumed hearing on october 25 focused primarily on issues not addressed in the ballenger bill on november 1 the subcommittee returned to the issue f comp time with final hearing on hr 2391 this time the members were working with specif ic legislation before them further the ashcroft bill had been introduced in the senate and although s 1129 was quite different from hr 2391 the senate bill provided the subcommittee with additional options in an opening statement for the record chairman ballenger acknowledged there are s ome who will say that changes to the law which give employees greater flexibility are really an effort to take protections away from employees but h stated employees want flexibility i believe that we should allow employers an d employees to work out these types of issues themselves recognizing that ther must be protections in the law against coercion42 the lead witness at the november hearings was pete peterson senior vic president for personnel with the hewlettpacka rd company speaking for the flecs coalition he described the coalition as an industry group that strongly support s hr 2391 as valuable first step in reshaping the flsa to fit todays workplace needs43 the ballenger bill peterson began would permit employers to offer employees the option of comp time he noted the significant point is that employe r would be required to offer compensatory time and likewise employee would be required to take it peterson member of the board of directors of the labo

affirming this kind of flexibility would help employees juggle their job child care and other responsibilities along wit h community and leisure activities he cited poll conducted for the employmen t policy foundation which found that three quarters of the respondents said the would favor proposal that allows hourly employees to choose to take their time andahalf overtime compensation in the form of paid time off in closing h e45 reiterate d the flecslabor policy association position the provisions of th flsa made sense probably when the act was passed original ly in 1938 but it is time to take l ook again at how the flsa can help the needs in the nineties an d beyond46 representative owens raised the issue of choice whether the comp time option would truly be voluntary for the employee many employees feel he noted tha t choice would rest with the employer and not with the worker it is really the employer because employee is going to do anything whic h displeases his employer if the message is communicated from the employer i really want you to take compensatory time nd not opt to take overtime pay thats the way employees are going to proceed turning to peterson of hewlettpackard mr owens asked what measures do you feel we can take to ensure that employees choice of compensatory time is trul voluntary would employers be willing to give writte n statement to the employee that it is you r choice and i will accept either choice that you make peterso n responded calling the option winwin situation he added i think that it would have to be clear that it is voluntary program on bot h sides its voluntary on the part of the employer to offer it in some cases offering of compensatory time is just not going to be able to fit with the needs of the business so i think it needs to be voluntary in that regard it also ne eds to be very clear that its voluntary on the part of employees as t whether or not they take the overtime in pay or compensatory time so whethe r or not there is requirement that employers put something i n writing of that nature im not sure its requiredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97532crs15 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 pp 44544647 house subcommittee on workplace protections hearings 1995 p 44648 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 45149while he was willing to consider the possibility of written agreement peterson saw more reason to have written state ment from the company concerning comp time than with respect to any other provisions of the flsa47 mr owens then turned to the issue of trol will workers he asked be able to take compensatory time off at time when its to their advantage it meets thei r family needs et cetera or will they so have to take it off at the convenience of the company he characterized the problem that he saw workers facing as th employer has the upper hand in terms of demanding that workers do it in way which is more profitable for the company they cant despite the seeming voluntar situation have an equal role in the decisionmaking peterson thought that type of thing is something that could be worked out he also expressed concern abou t business realities we do have to make sure that businesss needs here ar brought into the picture in response to representative woolsey peterso n48 affirmed it cant be jus t the employee saying i want to take it comp time right now matter what there are some business need si tuations that would make that difficult49 attorney leibig retu rning as the closing witness on the comp time issue noted that dol regulations governing comp time for the public sector had been mor confused than first mig ht appear and had led to litigation after explaining some of the problem areas he urged that if the comp time option were to be made available to the private sector it should be don carefully and more carefully than it was done in the public sector leibig suggested number f possible changes in hr 2391 as introduced he urged that it should be clear that compensatory time not be able to be required as condition of employment he explained one of the things tha t some employers in the public sector have done is said sic an agreement can be implied you agree to work with i offe r compensatory time therefore i have an agreement with you and that s happened regularly in the public sector there has been great deal of litigatio n about it he pointed to potential confusion with respect to the bills provision allowin g the comp time issue to be dealt with either under collective bargaining agreement or in the absence of such an agreement by direct agreement between management and workers he noted technical disti nction between having collective bargaining agreement in place or merely having representative pointing out that if you have certified representative under collective bargaining you cant have direc t agreement with employees he suggested that the matter was ambiguous an d needed clarifying languagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97532crs16 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 pp 45545950 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 46351 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 45952the legislation as introduced provided for cashi ng out of workers comp time bank banke d hours upon termination of employment leibig noted that in th courts termination has often been equ ated with being discharged but that the term would not necessarily cover retirement or voluntary separation he urged that th term cessation be substituted there m ay arise questions as to when comp time may or must be used and at whose discretion the provision allowing use of comp time wh ere it does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer is fine he suggested as far as it goes but that leaves other quest ions if an employee has accumulated substantial amount of comp time can the employer insist that it be used and if so at time designated by the employer i f the employee is consciously building up comp time for particular purpose eg hun ting season he may not have the right to utilize that comp time if the employer finds it inconvenient or disruptive or if the employer mandates prior use of hours during slack period leibig noted major difference between com p time and money if you got money u take it and put it in your pocket or put it in the bank and spend it if you have compensatory time you have record in the employers sic books it is important that the employer cant force you to spend tha t compensatory time by making you take one hour off or two hours off he suggested language assuring that where the employee has compensatory time he shall not be required by the employ er to use up his compensatory time absent his agreement he thought the putative desire of employees for comp time migh t diminish if they were made to understand that it would be used at the employer s discretion and not theirs leibig turned to the issue of banked hours and bankruptcy in the privat sector bankruptcy is regular thing every year thousands of companies go out of business it is important he suggested that the legislation make clear that thi s banked comp ensatory time is debt owed by the employer to the employee that has the same preference in bankruptcy that wages would have had50 he voiced other concerns the committee he thought should be mindfu l of the tax loss of the change made and of the potential for tax avoidance some51 employers might be deceived by the fiscal implications of comp time use compensatory time banks will show on the employers balance sheet if they have it accounted as liability so at the end of the period on the employers balance sheet it will show liability in the cash equivalent of this compensatory time many pu blic employers didnt realize that and even in three cases had their bond ratings jeopardized by the large level of liability52httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97532crs17 house

eroded altogether53 an overview of the 1995 house hearings both witne sses and subcommittee members seemed to concur that oversight of the flsa was needed whether th statute was crying out to be fixed

added that the legisla tion does not require employers to offer their employees the option of taking overtime pay in the form of compensatory time but it allow s employers to do so but where employers choose to offer compensatory time the bill provides that the decision is then left to the employee whether or not t request to participate in that option73 an employee with accrued comp time may generally use the time whenever he or she so desir he must request to use compensatory time reasonable time in advance of using it and its use should not unduly disrupt the operations of th employer through public sector experience the unduly disrupt standard has become narrowly defined and does not allow the empl oyer to control the employees use of compensatory time the report stated the committ ee believes that the law must be written to allow the employer some ability to maintain the operations of the business if that is not recognized in the law then employer will ever offer compensatory time furthermore providing right to an employee to use compensatory time without any regard to workload or business demands is simply unfair to coworkers who in many cases woul d have to handle the workload of the absent employee74 accrual of comp time by private sector employees would be limited to 24 0 hours employees and employers may agree to limit accru of compensatory time to less than 240 hours per year accrued comp time would be treated as unpai d employee wages in the event of th employers bankruptcy and would be priority claim on the employers assets75 comm ents from the minority the bill as reported grants rights t employe rs not to employees the minority report stated this legislatio n encourage s employers to hire fewer employees and to work them longer hours b freeing employers from having to pay cash for overtim potentially reducing both workers incomes and employer labor costs the minority observed that this was76 contrary to the spirit and purpose of the flsa adopted to prevent employers from competing on basis of undermining living standards destru ctive race to the bottom that impoverishes workers and harms the overall economy77 the minority noted an essential premise underlying t he flsa that is worker cannot agree to give up his or her right to the minimum wage or overtime pay it explainedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97532crs22 house report 104670 pp 252678 house report 104670 pp 252779this fundamental principle of the act is grounded in the reality that individual s will virtually always feel compelled to accede to th eir employers demands because of the inherently greater and more pressing need for the worker for an income than the employers need for the services of an individual worker this economic pressure the immediate interests of individual workers aside th report argued was inherent in the private sector work environment the waiver of statutory rights by even few workers places all workers at risk it will usually be in the economic selfinteres t of some employees to compromise their statutor rights whether in the hope of greater rewards tomorrow or merely to hold nto as much as possible today but even if only few workers in workpla ce voluntary waive their rights the rest of the employees will com under severe pressure to follow suit in order to keep their jobs moreover allowing individuals to waive their right to living wage or overtime pay erodes the broad social purpose of spreading available work among all workers the minority affirmed the original principles which underlie the flsa are s relevant today as they were in 193878 dols wagehour investigative staff has declined by 15 since 1990 and one realistically forecasts change in that trend this shortage of staff the report suggested makes labor standards enforcement precarious against th presentday realities the republicanled congress is pushing legislation that fundamentally changes the overtim law the republican majority proposes to do so in manner that significantly weakens workers understanding of their rights encourages further violations of the overtime law and weakens the ability of workers to enforce their rights when the law is violated even with verifiable agreements and penalties for violators it said workhour s flexibility coul d exacerbate compliance problems given the remaining deficiencies in the bill the report states this protection is meaningless79 the minority pointed to re and substantial differences between employment in the public and privat sectors employers in the private sector have direct self interest in reducing labor costs at the expense of workers that does not typically exist in the public sector worker protect ions generally are more extensive in the public than in the private sector more than 40 of the public sector work force i s organized while less than 15 of the private sector workforce belongs to union further even where public sector workers are not organized they are typicall protecte d by civil service laws in the public sector employees are normall disciplined or termina ted on just cause basis in the private sector in the absence of union employees may be terminated by the employer on an at will basis eg at the will of the employer with or without cause finally the report notes public employers rarely go out of business and if they do are unlikely to be judgmentproofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97532crs23 house report 104670 pp 272880 house report 104670 p 2881 house report 104670 p 2982 house report 104670 p 2983 house report 104670 p 29 under the

293085private employers regularly go out of business and are often judgmentproof whe n they so do80 under hr 2391 those who willfully violate the law by engaging i n intimidation threats or coercion of workers are subject to penalties but the report explains to be entitled to any remedy an employee must produce smoking gun that proves that the employer engaged in coercive activity for the express purpose of interfering with th employees rights it is burden most employees are unlikely to be able to meet81 employee rights the report cont ends may be few whether to offer comp time is an employer decision thus the flexi bility option is not entrusted to workers nor is the design of the option itself entrusted to workers employee has legal right to work overtime that option which som workers may value because it adds to their income is left to the employer the bill does not prohibit employers from assigning overtime on the basis of whether th employee has chosen compensatory time in lieu of overtime pay thus an employer might reward cooperative employees those accepting comp time through assignment of extra work without being guilty of threats intimidation or coercion n employer m ay offer comp time option on selective basis there is requirement that all employees be permitted to enjoy flexibility the employer may arbitrarily deny compensatory time to an employee on some occasions while offering it to the employee on others the minority concluded rather than increasing n82 employees control over his or her own life hr 2391 actually increases th employers control over the workers life83 the minority argued that even worker with banked hours of comp time has secure right to use that time under hr 2391 the employer can simply deny the leave on the basis that it will unduly disrupt the employers business or th employer can unilaterally buy back the compensatory time from the employee thereby wiping out the employees compensatory time bank an employee 84 requesting the use of comp tim may use it within reasonable period after making the request but the employer decides what constitutes reasonable period85 the flsa has requirement for employerprovided sick leave or vacatio n time if workers can routinely accrue up to six weeks of comp time the question then becomes why should an employer giv away paid leave when that employer

representative bonior opined this87 comp time bill is not about compensation and it is not about flexibility and i t certainly is not about helping working families it is about ending the 40hou r workwe ek mr bonior added it is about changing the laws so employers n longer have to pay overtime wages for overtime work88 in opposition to the bill representative schroeder stated that america s working families are under tremendous stress and so she argued the sponsors of the comp time legislation have come up with this new warm fuzzy it sound s wonderful but she added this is not what we need an advocate of flexible and compressed work sched uling for federal employees during the 1970s and 1980s ms schroeder argued that the issue was different and that the legislation wa s misnamed it is wrong to try and trick americas families who are under suc h stress that you are trying to be so sympathetic toward them when all you are really doing is giving their employers even more money and even more authority over the time and the hours that they work ms schroeder concluded this is wrong it should be defeated89 consideration of the rule debate commenced with representative greene of utah as p art of the houses new crop of working mothers i am proud to be cosponsor of this legislation she said it is commonsense legislation to giv working families muchneeded option in balancing

would expand worker cho ice and flexibility and meet the needs of working women ms greene affirmed things have changed since 1938 we have more working parents more single parents more divorces we also have more seniors living longer needing th care and love of their children and grandchildren hr 2391 will permi t working parents to bank comp time so that they can have time available to tend to sick child to go to special event for that child like baseball game or dance recital or to care for fragile parent if some of those workers prefer extra cash wages for overtime they can still choose that focusing upon choice ms greene concluded this is chance to help workin g families get little more control over their lives by giving them greater choices and more flexibility lets let them choose and she noted the point is that under this legislation the choice will be theirs not washingtons91 representative moakley dissented saying that the legislation basically means that employees can be forced to take paid time off rather than overtime pay i t allows the employer to stop paying overtime and to say to employees sorry i cant pay you overtime but in return for your long hours you can take vacatio n when its convenient for if im still in business he stated the legislation not only enables the employers to decide whether or not to offer comp time but als provides protections for when and how worker can use their comp time his office he noted had not been deluged with letters and calls or telegrams fro m employees clamoring for comp time92 the heated debate exposed deeply held and diame trically opposed views of this legislation critics chairman goodling charged totally distort the facts93 representative ballenger referred to balderdash sprinkled with horse feathers and to

all employers are bad people who ar looking for ways to cheat their employees affirming that most employers have deep and genuine concern about the people who work for them and they want to do everything they can to sati sfy their employees needs conversely representative97 wynn observed the reality of the workplace is that most employees want to keep their jobs and therefore go along with the employer that means he added tha t when the employer suggests comp time they are going to take it98 mr ballenger contended that the w orkers protections of the bill were adequate they the workers can go to court on their own or they could go to the secretary of labor mr reich who is not friend of business and he will do it for them t enforce that law representative hefner on the other hand

representative meek seemed similarly dubious many employer s101 will find way to force employees to accept compensatory time instead of cas h because they know the employ ees dont have the resources to fight this coercion102 ms greene of utah pursued the issue of worker choice the bill she argued gives workers the flexibility that they need to be able to balance those competin g considerations of work and family it gives workers more control over their lives to be able to choose for themselv in the circumstances for each of their families ms greene urged let us giv workers that choice let us

going to say you want to work here this is voluntary decision if u voluntarily decide you want to work here then you better bloody well volunteer to sign this thing saying if there is an overtime you will take time off rather than get money ms schroeder added let us be real clear about this when people are working at those kinds of levels of jobs they cannot negotiate with their employer either they will never get overtime or they will not get hired at all115 what was really needed ms schroeder ar gued was predictability we need to be able to predict when we have to work and predict when we are going to have time off so that we can tell the school we can be there to help with the kids if my child is going on field trip he explained that is when i need to have the time off not 3 weeks later when it is convenience for the employer that is why this bill is joke116 as debate drew to c lose representatives goodling and ballenger proposed series of amendments dealing primarily with employee protections discusse d below representative clay opposing the measure argued that the bill should not have been repo rted out of committee without basic employee protections in the first place though he applauded his colleagues for belatedly rec ognizing that their bill has many flaws the supplemental amendments he maintained though numerous were insuffici ent to rescue bill that is fatally flawed similarly representativ e117 becerra asked how good bill and that is what we were told it was when it left the committee should suddenly need mo re than 20 changes being made now at the

comp time below 80 hour s would continue to b drawable by employees until used or until the end of the program year where co mp time program has become part of the collectively bargained agreement or of another agreement with an official representative of the workers it may not be clear th extent to which an employer could terminate the program at will because the language of the legislation as approved by the house grants right f120 termination of the c omp time agreement only to workers covered under paragraph 2aii it may not be clear whether worker covered by collective agreement may

employers the issue of the use of accrued hours remained ie definition of within reasonable period and does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer both concepts would need to be defined in regulation or would be left to th discretion of the employer the scheduling of hours of work in excess of 40 per week from which the comp time flows is an employer prerogative as approved by the house the bill would allow private sector employees t accrue up to 240 hours of comp time but under the floor amendments all time in excess of 80 hours may be cashedout by the employe r with at least 30 days notice to the worker further an employer could unilaterally disc ontinue the program upon giving employ ees 30 days notice private sector employee in the absence of a119 collective bargaining agreement etc would be able to terminate his individua l agreement to accept comp time at any time120 employee remedies for violation of workers rights were broadened by th floor amendments as reported an employee had to prove that his employer d willfully violated the admonition not to directly or indirectly intimidate threaten or coerce etc with respect to participation in or utiliza tion of the comp time option the word willfully was dropped from the legislation as passed the secretary of labor was directed within 30 days after enactment to develop language tha t employers could post

s 1129 would have added new subsection to section 13 of the flsa exemptions first it would have allowed employers to set aside the standard 40hour workweek and replace it with 160hour basic work

is any arrangement f hours so long as the total for the 4week period did not exceed 160 within the 4 week160hour period overtime pay would have b een required third if it were deemed appropriate to schedule more than 160 workhours in 4week period then those employees participating in flexible credit hour program under the legislation could have worked up to 48 hours beyond their regular 160 hours carrying over the excess 48 hours to succeeding 4week period as credit hours fourth hours worked in excess of 160 credit hours would have been credited to th employee at straighttime rate thus

to decline to participate in the compressed or flexible workhours program he or she could still have been required to work in excess of 40 hours week but in that case the overtime pay provisions of

john alden life insurance company131 pay docking initially discussion focused upon pay docking one of the issues dealt with in the ashcroft bill the ashcroft bill s 1129 would modify section132 13a1 of the flsa so that an executive administrative or professional employee would be both overtime pay exempt and subject to having his or her pa docked should the employer choose to do so in an exchange between senator ashcroft and attorney leibig the senato r suggested that under the present system one had flexibility to allow employees t take short term leave if one were willing to pay people for not showing up leibig countered they have the flexibility now to pay people salary or hourly if133 workers are paid on an hourly basis and they absent themselves for few hours the employe r can dock their pay under current law however if they are salarie d employees the mployer cannot dock their salary for short absences without risking their conversion of nonexempt status the choice rests with the employer senator ashcroft so your view is that it should be rigid 40 hour week and if person wants to take 2 hours off on friday afternoon to attend to sick child he or she should not be allowed the flexibility of volunteering to make that up the next week without some sort of penalty is that your view mr leibig it is my feeling that there should be nationa l standard for 40hour work week but that it should be flexible in area s where it is necessary for instance today under the family leave act if people need t take time off to take care of sick child and so forth there is flexibilit alreadyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97532crs35 senate hearings 1996 p 16134 as the legislation was introduced the first op tion would have been the employers whether135 or not to institute comp time program then if the employer offered such program the employee wou ld have had the option of participation assuming that he or she was part of the covered group of workers the use of comp time the timing of the drawing down f banked hours would then be left to the discretion of the employer senate hearings 1996 pp 1718136the chairman senator kassebaum but mr leibig isnt tha t only for employers of 50 employees or more mr leibig sure small employers are not covered by the othe r rules either and if it is question of whether the family leave act should be expanded to employers of less than 50 if that is the debate i guess i would favor expanding it leibig added it is one thing for workers to have comp time available for certai n needs especially at their own choice but it is another thing to say we shoul d abandon basic 40hour work standard and allow the work week to get longer and longer134 the workers choice throughout centra l issue related to whether flexibility could be secured at the workers choice or at the employers convenience senator ashcroft affirmed the proposed change to the statute is to give the employee the option not to give the employer the option and i think those ar different questions mr leibig concurred that choice was the issue but disagreed on the substance of s 1129 at it stood mr leibig if ther is provision that the employee has absolute access to get comp time and for instance after the comp time is in th bank the employee has the right of when to take it off and when to use it senator ashcroft i think that is the nature of the proposal mr leibig the bills that have been introduced in the house and your own bill do not have that s 1129 you may intend to put it i n employee choice and i think that should be encouraged but it is not in there now senator ashcroft well it certainly is at the employees option not at the employers choice mr leibig it is the employees option to take th comp time but135 once he has it it is not at his r her option whether to use it or have access to it it is controlled by the employer or at least it is allowed to b controlled by the employer under the way the bills are136 discussion then moved on to other

emphasized the notion of choice for workers stating the premise giving individuals greater number of attractive choices makes them better off further she affirmed the legislation gives emplo yees not employers the power to choose what is in their best interests either more or more money she stated that the flsa was a169 wellintentione d law fashioned in 1938 by clever people who might never have imagine d comp time as we know it today she asserted choice simply is t available to these emplo yees millions of average american hourly workers under current federal labor law she pointed to the

the most from hr 1 from the additional flexibility in the workplace an d additional opportunities to have more flexible hours ms furchtgottroth expressed her belief that many women not already in the workforc might be encouraged to seek employment if comp time option wer available she conceded that government might legitimately concern itself wit h workplace safety and child labor but where she queried is the public interest in denying employees the choice of comp time then returning to the flsa sh affirmed overtime is simply hours taken away from the life of employees and yet current law denies those employees the opportunity to regain that lost time sh conceded that there was concern in some quarters that hr 1 would lead t exploitation of workers since employers would pressure employees into acceptin g comp time instead of overtime pay however she concluded history has shown that when workers are given choices these choices are used fruitfully170 ms norton of the womens

risks and problems suggesting different view of the world from that of ms furchtgottroth ms norton ar gued that hr 1 does not give employees true choice she observed in the real world employers will have the last word the bill give s unscrupulous employers substantial new opportunity to coerce employees into taking time off even when they need or prefer to have money in their paycheck s instead most hourly workers have little bargaining power in the workplace as it is and they re also the most likely to rely on overtime pay just to make ends meet if they insi st on getting money instead of time they run very real risk if n employer would ra ther keep the money in the bank employees who do not accept comp time could find that they just re not getting the hours they have counted on or are getting assigned to bad shifts or have otherwise put their jobs an d livelihoods at risk for those who need overtime pay the most comp time is not real option but it ma be one they are directly or indirectly forced to accept under this bill if an employee is coerced into taking comp time against her wishes she has just two choic accept it or sue her employer in court bringing suit would put her job at risk and require resources both time and money that few hourl workers really have in practice she suggested hr 1 is not oriented toward the more highly paid salaried workers but rather toward lowerincome workers paid on an hourly basis ms norton went on to outline what she perceived to be additional hazards someone who is pressured into taking comp time when she really wants or need s overtime pay is taking an involuntary pay cut pure and simple since the employer controls when the comp time may actually be used the worker is essentially being asked to gamble on the chance that they will be able to take time when it is as valuable to them as overtime pay under the flsa she explained when employees work overtime they are compensated for it in the week that they worke d but under hr 1 worker who accepts comp could wait weeks or months before she can use the hours shes earned she added meanwhile the overtim pay that she would have received can be invested by her employer if the employee decides that she is better off with the cash than waiting any longer the employer can t ake up to 30 more days before putting the money in her paycheck the employee has lost money while her employer has had th opportunity to make money on the extra hours she worked further she pointed to the risk that firms paying their workers on an hourly basi s such as the garment construction and janitorial service industries may simpl close up shop without pa ying employees for their work for firms that have low capitalization the b anking of comp time with its cashout value she suggests may provide an added stimulus for such employer behavior the more comp tim workers accumulate and the longer employers can wait in fulfilling requests fo r compensation in time or money she noted the greater the risk to employees i f employers disappear without ever paying for all the hours workedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97532crs46 statement of helen l norton womens legal defense fund

his state of the union address was broad endorsement of flextime the president stated with new pressures on people in the way they work and live i believe we mus t expand family leave so that workers

families see clinton william j address bef ore joint session of the congress on the state of the continuedin ms nortons view hr 1 gives the employer not the employee the flexibility to decide when and even whether an employee can use her earned comp time should an employee turn to an employer with request to draw down few hours of comp time the employer can essentially say i ll get back to you and keep her waiting for an as yet undefined reasonable period of time before respondin g regardless of her needs and when the employer d oes eventually respond the answer could as easily be as yes further she as serted hr 1 provides resource for employees whose requests to use their comp time are arbi trarily or unfairly denied there is nothing s he can do this she stated is not flexibility from any working womans perspective ms norton observed that mandatory overtime is legal under curre nt law and that hr 1 will not change that employers can still require emp loyees to work up to 50 60 or more hours in week without advance notice or regard to employees other obligations employees in this situation can hardly be sa id to have flexibility or choice about the time they spend at work or at home under hr 1 however thos overtime hours could be paid for in subsequent time off rather than in cash finally ms norton suggested that enforcement of federal wagehour law could potentially be rendered more complex were hr 1 enacted however she stated the bil l contains money for the increased education or enforcement efforts that its changes will require172 karen nussbaum of the aflcio

offer in exchange that gives workers benefit say youre building contractor because of the seasonal nature of buildin g contractors you want to have your employees work 30 hours one week and 5 0 hours the next you dont want to have to pay in that second week 10 hours f additional overtime to your emp loyees the reason why small contractor cant on that second week have employees work for 50 hours is because they can t afford to pay the additional overtime for that 10 additional hours senator wellstone respond ed we want to make sure that large or small business now does not say to an employee li sten we have other choice we need the 50 hours of work done and thats the option were presenting to you then th senator observed people worry theyre going to lose their job if they dont tak it182httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97532crs49 continued182 congress daily february 21 1997 cngdailynjdccom statement donna r lenhoff subcommittee on employment and training february 13183 1997as in prior hearings the womens legal defe nse fund opposed s 4 and similar amendment of the flsa donna lenhoff general counsel for the fund declared that s 4 was not about the real flexibility that working women need instead it gives employees less control over their time and their paychecks creating new risks an d problems it does not give employees true choice between extra time off an d overtime pay183 david m silberman labor lawyer but speaking only on his own behalf similarl raised objections to s 4 but presented them in somewhat differen t manner quickly summarizing the requirements of the act overtime after 40 hours of work per week he noted within this limitation the act leav employers and employees complete leeway to work out mutually satisfactory work schedules and there is absolutely nothing in the flsa which in any way constrains the abi lity of employers to accommodate employees who need time off by granting such employees paid or unpaid leave s 4 he suggested would be sharp br eak with this longsettled system of overtime compensation and the 40hour week would longer necessarily be the benchmark for determining an employees entitlement to overtime pay the preovertim workweek under s 4 he argued could be 50 60 or even 70 hours so long as over two weeks the employee did not work more than 80 hours and if hours i n excess of 80 were worked they could be compensated for with comp time or wit h flexible credit hours silberman acknowledging the stated purpose of these provisions of s 4 affirmed important questions have been raised as to whether in practice in the run of private sector workplaces it is possible to c reate new and voluntary scheduling options for employees as the bills statement of purposes declares the argument came down to perspective ie how one might view the relative power position of workers and their employers regardless of wha t the law says will employees and especially the large number of lowwage and contingent workers who are in most need of the law s protections in fact feel free to insist on overtime pay after working 40 hours if their employer makes plain his preference to use biweekly work schedule or to provide comp time for flexible credit hours instead further silberman asked will an employee who has earned comp time or flexible credit hour fee l constrained to use the time off when it is convenient for the employer for her t miss work or will the employee actually feel free to use that time when it suits her familys needs and will an em ployee whose rights are violated feel able to stand up to her employerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97532crs50 statement of david m silberman subco mmittee on employment and training february184 13 1997silberman noted that under s 4 and hr 1 an employee ght be allowed to receive comp time in place of overtime were that to happen as provided for in th legislation the employee will end up in essentially the same position as if she d been paid for the overtime hours and then took unpaid leave to meet her family s needs that of course he pointed out is lawful today like ms lenhoff of the womens legal defense fund silberman argued that the legislation would not ctually provide workers with free choice he said that the entire program was structured to provide choice to the employer nothing in th legislation he affirmed would assure that employees who prefer premium pay are not disfavored by the employer when it comes to awarding overtime assignments and in the ab sence of such assurance comp time could be the only option h suggested because regular overtime could quickly beco unavailable he observed an employer could without violating the law hire only those applicants willing to work overtime without premium pay andor award vertime only to those employees willing to accept an iou for time off in return184 concluding comment allowing for variations among individuals and between historical periods workers have tended to favor legislated labor standards requirements minimu m wages overtime pay restraints upon child labor wor kplace safety etc conversely employers h ave tended to favor system less restrained by public enactments that division in some measure was reflected in the debate about hr 1 and s 4 labor standards regulation w hether by the federal government or by the states speaking generally has not been welcomed by employers some have viewed such regulation as violation of the spirit of the free market others as restraint upon the ability of employers to manage their own businesses however justified in terms of worker protection some have argued that the establishment of high labor standards within the united states may impair industrys ability to compete in globa l marketplace still others especially from the small business community contend that many employers cannot afford to pay minimum wages and overtime rates and stil l make profit employee perspectives toward labor st andards have varied through the years depending upon the experience of individual workers general economic conditions and distance from the adve rse conditions that caused such standards to be legislated some workers are anxio us to work overtime hours with overtime pay others for their own reasons would prefer to have more free time away from work even with slight loss of income over the years memories may have dimmed with

the workforce itself has changed through the years women ar more represented throu ghout the workforce and professions than may have been the case early in the century while some women always worked outside the home even after marriage and the birth of children that practice is now more the norm to that extent the tensions between domestic life and employment may have escalated as result some have projected need for increased flexibility in hours of work both for women and men for others it may be predictability that is needed meanw hile us businesses especially smaller businesses may feel

possibility if not the promise of higher productivity at lower costs thus an easing of workhours regulation in their view presents winwi n situation rationalization of production in manner so that overtime would not b necessary reducing costs and at the same time providing an ption for workers more effectively to manage the dual responsibilities of work and family188 while s 4 and hr 1 and related legislation have been presented as worker and family friendly the hearings on this legislation revealed strong worker concerns about proposals to change the 40hour workweek and modify overtime pa requirements large part of this dichotomy relat to choice initiation of the comp timeflexible scheduling options would rest with employers as would th determination as to when banked hours could be used without unreasonabl disrupting work processes these essential flexible workhours choices rest wit h employer s as some would argue they must if business is to be run with efficiency and be
