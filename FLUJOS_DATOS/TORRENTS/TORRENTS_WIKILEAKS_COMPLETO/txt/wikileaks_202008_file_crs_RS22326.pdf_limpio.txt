whether to develop any energy resources in anwr has focused on familiar image of coastal northern part of the refuge the area that is thought to contain oil reconciliation bills under consideration in the 109th congress have referred to two new maps one with diï¬€erent boundaries than previous maps and one apparently similar to those in previous bills this report does not cover the general anwr

law division summary major element of the us energy debate is whether to approve energy development in the arctic national wildlif refuge anwr in northeastern alaska and if so under what conditions or whethe r to continue to prohibit development to protect the areas biological recreational nd subsistence values for over 20 years the debate on whether to develop any energy resources in anwr has focused on familiar image of coastal northern part of the refu ge the area that is thought to contain oil reconciliation bills under c onsideration in the 109th congress have re ferred to two new maps one with different boundaries than pr evious maps and one apparently similar to those in previous bills this report does not cover the general anwr controversy but shows the maps in the two reconciliation bills and discusses historical maps and the implications of changes it will be updated if new maps are refere nced in legislation under the fy2006 budget resolution hc onres 95 the house resources and senate energy and natural resources committees were directed to reduce mandatory spending within their jurisdictions and as most observers expected the two committees recommended legislation to ope n the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr to use its expected offsetting receipts to meet th at target while th senate committees bill title iv of s 1932 report f iled confined itself to the opening of the refuge alone the house committee recommended variety of other changes within its jurisdiction title vi of hr 4241 hrept 109276 only the maps of the proposed coastal plain oil and gas development area in anwr in the two bills will be discussed here1 the chief difference in the two maps is in the outer bounda ry of the coastal plain part of the refugehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22326crs2 and the inclusion or exclusion of certain native lands since anwr development bills provide for such matters as revenue di sposition surface occupancy restrictions environmental protections and other provisions on the coastal plain as the bills define that term then change in the map specified in the definition can have substantial effects on many sections of such bills this repor t provides brief history of the area proposed for development and then discusses how the two bills and their maps differ in this respect over the last 25 years there have been numerous definitions of the coastal plain of anwr including definition relying on the august 1980 map first mentioned in the alaska national interest lands c onservation act of 1980 anilca pl 96487 94 stat 2371 the 1983 legal description of the coas tal plain published in the federal register and then placed in the code of federal regulations appendix i 50 cfr part 37 definition relying on the same 1980 map plus the legal description in the cfr definition relying solely on map dated september 2005 and definition relying on new map da ted october 21 2005 along with the same cfr citation these definitions and maps will be discussed below brief legislative history of native lands in anwr in november 1957 an application for the withdrawal of lands bordering the arctic ocean in northeastern alaska to create an arctic national wildlife range was filed on december 6 1960 after statehood the secretary of the interior issued public nd order 2214 reserving the area including its coast as refuge the potential for oil and gas leasing was expressly preserved in 1971 congress enacted the alaska nativ claims settlement act ancsa pl 92203 to resolve all native aboriginal land claims against the united states ancsa provided for monetary payments and created village corporations that received the surface estate to roughly 22 million acres of lands in alaska village corporations obtained the right to select the surface estate of certain amount of lands within the national wildlife refuge system under 22 g of ancsa these lands were to remain subject to the laws and regulations govern ing use and development in the particular refuge kaktovik inupiat corporation kic the local corporation initially received rights to three townships about 69000 acres along and near the coast of anwr ancsa also created regional corporations which could select subsurface rights to some lands and full title to others subsurface ri ghts in refuges were not available but selections to substitute for such lands were provided definition in anilca anilca expanded the refuge mostly south and west to include another 92 million acres section 7023 designated much of the original refuge as wilderness area but not the co astal plain nor the newer portions of the refuge instead congress postponed decisions on the development or further protection of the coastal plain the area believed to contain oil and gas deposits section 1002httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22326crs3 2 felicity barringer arctic map vanishes and oil area expands new york times oct 21 2005 it is not entirely clear that the missing ma p reported in this story and once viewed by the authors is actually the missi ng 1980 map see crs report rl31115 legal issues related to proposed drilling for oil and gas in the arctic national wildlife refuge by pamela baldwin for description of the missing map and its legal significance 3 the administrative legal description was not ch anged to reflect the fourth township and treat the native lands consistentlydirected study of anwrs coastal plain therefore often referred to as the 1002 area and its resources to be completed within five years and nine months of enactment the resulting 1987 study was called the 1002 report or the final legislative environmental impact statement fleis to geographer the coastal plain of anwr is the relatively flat or rolling land w hose southern boundary is rather indefinite line at the foothills of the brooks range and whose northern boundary is somewhat indefinite line in the tidal zone at the coast of the beaufort sea it stretches from the canadian border on the east side of the refuge to anwrs western boundary this geographic term may not be identical to defi ned terms section 1002b1 contained the definition that refers to map that is now missing2 the term coastal plain means that area identified as such in the map entitled arctic national wildlife refuge dated august 1980 administrative description of the coastal plain section 103b of anilca authorized administrative creation of narra tive legal descriptions of areas for which anilca changed the land management status and these descriptions have the force of law the secretary of the interior was au thorized to make minor changes to boundaries established by anilca minor being change s which could not increase or decrease the amount of land by more than 23000 acres description of the coastal plain was published that excluded the approximately three townships of kic lands then in existence even though these lands are geographically part of the coastal plain and totaled approximately 69000 acres 48 fedreg 1685 april 19 1983 appendix i 50 cfr part 37 without the 1980 map it cannot be determined whether this description comported with that map or was change from it these lands and laterselected fourth kic township that is within the defined coastal plain3 these four total appr oximately 92000 acres are all within the refuge and subject to its regulations the arctic slope regional corpora tion asrc obtained subsurface rights beneath the kic lands pursu ant to 1983 land exchange agreement in addition there are currently more than 10000 acres of conveyed or claimed individual native allotments in the 1002 area that are not expressly subject to its regulations were oil and gas development authorized for the federal lands in the refuge development would then be legally allowed or become feasible on the approximately 100000 acres of native lands possibly free of any acreage limitation applying to development on the federal lands depending on how the legislation is framed the extent to which the native lands would be regulated is uncertain given the confusion over boundaries of the coastal plain the status of allotments and some of the language in the 1983 agreement with asrc that seems to require specific congressi onal language to overri its terms see also crs report rl31115 legal issues related to proposed drilling for oil and gas in the arctic national wildlife refuge by pamela baldwinhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22326crs4 4 coast alliance v babb itt 6 f supp 2d 29 1998 us dist lexis 6927 d dc 1998 dismissed as moot 199 us app lexis 2414 dc cir 1999 although the case may not be precedent its reasoning appears sound 5 for example in 2002 in the 107th congress senate amendment sa3132 defined the coastal plain using both the 1980 map and the cfr referencevarious definitions of coastal plain definitions or depictions of the coastal plain that depend on the missing 1980 map may not be sound at least one case has held that administratively developed substitutes for missing map that congress relied on for substantive content are not effective4 the 1980 map defined the coastal plain for purposes of preserving that area from development pending completion of an environmental study and possible future c ongressional action arguably subsequent congressional action could define the coas tal plain differently to accomplish other purposes over the years anwr development bills have taken various approaches to defining or depicting the coasta l plain area that would be subject to leasing for example comprehensive bills in the 102d congress define d the coastal plain by reference to 1989 map that included all of the native lands and contained specific provisions regarding those lands more recently bills have been introduced that refer both to the anilca map and to the cfr description5 and are silent regarding native lands definition with september 2005 map under 4001a of s 1932 the deficit reduction act of 2005 the sena energy committee provided new map prepared by the us geological survey and dated september 2005 to accompany its submission to the budget committee for reconciliation and defined the coastal plain by reference to it see figure 1 this map included in the coa stal plain all native lands both corporation lands and allotments though the bill text does not expressl address native lands the major provisions in the bill remained unchanged including provision 4001b authorizing development in the co astal plain directing the secretary to establish leasing program limiting certain surface acreage development in the coastal plain to 2000 acres and notwithstanding any other provision of law directing receipts from leasing and operations authorized under th is section to be divided equally between the state of alaska and the federal governme nt this last provision might give rise to native claims for compensation for revenues from their lands if the revenue provision is not intended to apply to native lands it is not clear whether othe r provisions also might not apply the extent of federal cont rol of native lands that was intended or accomplished is not clear given that the potential for increased federal control in the section derives primarily from change in map rather than legislative language also some of the terms of the 1983 agreement call for an express congressional override to negate their effects definition with october 2005 map and legal description as reported title vi of hr 4241 the house reconcilia tion bill includes provision to open anwr to development the provision is essentia lly identical to previous anwr development provisions reported in the past by the resources committee the map figure 2 accompanying the bill was prepared by the u s geological survey and dated october 21 2005 the definition of coastal plain cont ained in hr 4241 refers to the october 2005 map and also to the cfr appendix therefore presumably the map in question is intended to be identical to the published legal description of the coastal plain and therefore to exclude basically three of the four native townshipshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22326crs5 representations of the two recent maps followhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22326crs6 figure 1 senate map of 1002 area figure 2 house map of
