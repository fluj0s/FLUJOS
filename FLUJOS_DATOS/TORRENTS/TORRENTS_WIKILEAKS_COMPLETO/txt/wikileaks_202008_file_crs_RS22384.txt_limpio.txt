rs22348 usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act of 2005 hr 3199 brief look 1 this report examines the provisions of s 2271 as introduced 2 section 2 of s 2271 indicates that the bill amends the specified sections of fisa and the nsl statutes after they are to be amended by hr 3199 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 judicial review of the section 215 nondisclosure requirement section 215 of the usa patriot act3 amended the business record sections of fisa to authorize the director of the federal bureau of investigation fbi or designee of the director to apply to the fisa court to issue orders granting the government access to any tangible item including books records papers and other documents matter who holds it in foreign intelligence international terrorism and clandestine intelligence cases4 section 215 order is accompanied by nondisclosure requirement that prohibits the recipient from disclosing to any other person that the fbi has sought the tangible things described in the order except to those persons necessary for compliance5 under current law the recipient of section 215 production order lacks an explicit statutory right to petition the fisa court to modify or set aside either the production order or the nondisclosure requirement the conference bill accompanying the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act of 2005 hr 3199 hereinafter conference bill provides judicial review process for recipients of section 215 orders to challenge their legality with httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22384 specified pool of fisa court judges6 however the conference bill does not expressly grant to recipients of such orders the right to petition the fisa court to modify or quash the nondisclosure requirement imposed in connection with the production order the conference bill has been criticized for its lack of an express right to challenge the nondisclosure order7 section 3 of s 2271 addresses this omission by establishing judicial review procedure for section 215 nondisclosure orders that largely resembles the procedure set forth in the conference bill for challenging the nondisclosure order accompanying an nsl8 for one year after the date of the issuance of section 215 production order the nondisclosure requirement remains in full effect and may not be challenged9 3 pl 10756 4 50 usc 1861a1 5 50 usc 1861d however the conference bill clarifies that recipient of section 215 order may disclose its existence to an attorney to obtain legal advice as well as to other persons approved by the fbi proposed 50 usc 1861d1b c 6 section 106f of the conference bill adding proposed 50 usc 1861f1 proposed 50 usc 1803e1 and proposed 50 usc 1803e2 7 152 cong rec s1326 daily ed feb 15 2006 statement of sen sununu i think it is important that we stand for the principle that restriction on free speech such as gag order can be objected to in court of law before judge you can at least have your case heard that does not mean you will win necessarily but you can at least have your case heard 8 proposed 18 usc 3511b23 9 by contrast the conference bill does not impose oneyear moratorium on challenging the nondisclosure order accompanying nsl proposed 18 usc 3511b1 crs3 after this oneyear period has expired the recipient of the production order may petition the fisa court to modify or set aside the nondisclosure requirement10 within 72 hours if the judge assigned to consider the petition determines after an initial review that the petition is frivolous the judge shall immediately deny the petition and affirm the nondisclosure order11 if after the initial review the judge determines that the petition is not frivolous the judge shall promptly consider the petition under procedural measures that the fisa court has established to protect national security including conducting the review in camera12 the judge has discretion to modify or set aside nondisclosure order upon finding that there is reason to believe that disclosure may endanger the national security of the united states interfere with criminal counterterrorism or counterintelligence investigation interfere with diplomatic relations or endanger the life or physical safety of any person13 if at the time the individual files the petition for judicial review of nondisclosure order the attorney general deputy attorney general an httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22384 assistant attorney general or the director of the fbi certifies that disclosure may endanger the national security of the united states or interfere with diplomatic relations then the fisa judge must treat such government certification as conclusive unless the judge finds that the certification was made in bad faith14 if the judge grants petition to quash the nondisclosure requirement upon the request of the government such order is stayed pending review of the decision to the fisa court of review15 if the judge denies the petition to modify or set aside the nondisclosure requirement the recipient of the section 215 order is precluded from filing another such petition for one year16 the fisa court of review has jurisdiction to consider petition by the government or by the recipient of section 215 order and to review fisa judges decision to affirm modify or set aside such production order or the nondisclosure order imposed in connection with it17 the us supreme court has jurisdiction to review decision of the fisa court of review concerning this matter18 10 proposed 50 usc 1861f2ai 11 proposed 50 usc 1861f2aii 12 proposed 50 usc 1861f2aii

to disclose identity of attorney sought to obtain legal advice regarding section 215 order or an nsl the conference bill expressly clarifies that recipient of section 215 order or an 19 nsl may disclose its existence to an attorney to obtain legal advice as well as to other persons approved by the fbi20 the recipient is not required to inform the fbi or the authorized government agency of the intent to consult with an attorney to obtain legal assistance however upon the request of the fbi director or his designee or upon the request of the government agency authorized to issue the nsl the recipient must disclose to the fbi or the government agency the identity of the person to whom the disclosure will be or was made21 according to one of the sponsors of s 2271 this provision of the conference bill might have an unintended chilling effect on the individuals right to seek legal counsel regarding the section 215 order or the nsl22 section 4 of s 2271 amends fisa and the five statutes providing nsl authority to federal intelligence investigators to exempt httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22384 explicitly from the identification disclosure requirement the name of the attorney sought to obtain legal advice with respect to the section 215 production order or nsl s 2271 achieves this exemption by omission in the case of section 215 order and by explicit language in the nsl statutes as described below under the conference bills proposed 50 usc 1861d1 the recipient of section 215 order is prohibited from disclosing to any other person that the fbi has sought the tangible things described in the order except to the following individuals those persons necessary for compliance with the order b an attorney to obtain legal advice with respect to the order or c other persons as permitted by the fbi director or his designee s 2271 amends the conference bills proposed 50 usc 1861d2c to provide that the fbi director or his designee may require any person to disclose the identity of persons 19 five federal statutes in roughly the same terms authorize federal intelligence investigators generally the fbi to request that communications providers financial institutions and credit bureaus provide certain customer information relating to national security investigation these statutes are 12 usc 3414 15 usc1681u 15 usc 1681v 18 usc 2709 50 usc 436 20

sen sununu we feel the provision in the conference report that required the recipient of national security letter to disclose the name of their attorney to the fbi was punitive and might have the result of discouraging an individual from seeking legal advice crs5 falling within categories and c above notably it omits b which effectively removes from the identity disclosure requirement attorneys sought for legal assistance section 4 of s 2271 also amends the five nsl statutes by adding language expressly exempting the identity of attorneys from the disclosure requirement established by the conference bill at the request of the director of the federal bureau of investigation or the designee of the director any person making or intending to make disclosure under this section shall identify to the director or such designee the person to whom such disclosure will be made or to whom such disclosure was made prior to the request except that nothing in this section shall require person to inform the director or such designee of the identity of an attorney to whom disclosure was made or will be made to obtain legal advice or legal assistance with respect to the request under subsection a23 nsls not applicable to libraries httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22384 section 5 of s 2271 entitled privacy protections for library patrons addresses the concern that library could potentially be subject to an nsl issued under 18 usc 2709 to obtain certain transactional and subscriber records pertaining to its patrons24 18 usc 2709 provides nsl authority to the department of justice to obtain certain transaction records from electronic communication service providers for counterintelligence purposes because libraries often offer patrons the ability to access the internet current law is unclear as to whether libraries might be considered electronic communication service providers for purposes of 18 usc 2709 s 2271 amends 18 usc 2709 by adding the following section library the services of which include access to the internet is not wire or electronic communication service provider for purposes of this section unless the library is providing the services defined in section 251015 of this title25 according to one of the sponsors of the bill this provision makes very clear that libraries operating in their traditional role including the lending of books including making books available in digital form including providing basic internet access are not subject to national security letters26 however if the library provides the services described in 18 usc 251015 which are electronic communication services then such library would still be subject 23 proposed 18 usc 2709c4 the language used to describe this exception in proposed 18 usc 2709c4 is substantially similar to that used in the proposed amendments to the other nsl statutes 24 however library could still be subject to section 215 order under fisa for the production of tangible items such as loan records s 2271 does not carve out any exception for libraries under section 215 for more information on this issue see crs report rs21441 libraries and the usa patriot act by charles doyle and brian t yeh 25 proposed 18 usc 2709f emphasis added 26 152 cong rec s1326 daily ed feb 15 2006 statement of sen sununu crs6 to nsls 18 usc 251015 defines electronic communication service to mean any service that provides to users the ability to send or receive wire or electronic communications yet this definition potentially could include libraries that offer electronic mail access to their patrons depending on the meaning of the words italicized above there are few instances in federal law that explicitly provide definition of service provider for possible insight into the intent of the language used in 18 usc 251015 it may be useful to consult the digital millennium copyright act which defines service provider as follows27 the term service provider means an entity offering the transmission routing or providing of connections for digital online communications between or among points specified by user of material of the users choosing without modification to the content of the material as sent or received b the term service provider means provider of online services or network access or the operator of facilities therefor and includes an entity described in subparagraph httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22384 although the second of these two definitions is broadly worded and arguably could be used to encompass library that offers internet access to patrons another reasonable interpretation of the foregoing suggests that to be considered an electronic communication service provider under 18 usc 251015 library must independently operate the means by which transmission routing and connection of digital communication occurs28 in contrast local county library likely has service contract with an internet service provider isp to furnish the library with the electronic communication service as many businesses and individuals do the fact that the library has set up computer with internet access for the use of its patrons probably does not by itself turn the library into communications service provider under this characterization the actual provider of internet access is the isp not the library29 therefore public library offering basic internet access would likely not be considered an electronic communication service provider at least for purposes of being an entity subject to the nsl provisions in 18 usc 270930 27 17 usc 512 k1 28 large library affiliated with university for example may function in capacity similar to an isp and thus could be considered communications provider subject to nsl authority these libraries may offer their students the ability to post materials on website servers operated by the library 29 see 152 cong rec s1390 daily ed feb 16 2006 statement of sen sununu some have noted or may note that basic internet access gives library patrons the ability to send and receive email by for example accessing an internetbased email service but in that case it is the web site operator who is providing the communication service the internet communication service provider itself and not the library which is simply making available computer with access to the internet 30 see 152 cong rec s1390 daily ed feb 16 2006 statement of sen durbin by way of comparison gas station that has pay phone isnt telephone company so library that has internet access where person can find an internet email service is not communications service provider therefore it would not fall under the purview of the nsl provision in 18 usc 2709 it is critically important distinction
