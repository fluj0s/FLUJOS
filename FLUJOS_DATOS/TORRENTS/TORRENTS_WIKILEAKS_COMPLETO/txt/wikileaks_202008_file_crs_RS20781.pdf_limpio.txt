not the majority with 122 out of 257 seats the peronists maintained the majority in the senate with 35 of the total 67 seats histo rical background the december 1999 presidential elections were the fourth since argentina returned to civilian democracy in 1983 after seven years of military rule argentinas successful return to stable civilian democratic rule is regarded as remarkable by many observers considering the countrys extensive period of political instability from 1930 to 1983 the government had numerous military coups 25 presidents 22 years of military rule and 13 years of rule by the authoritarian populist leader juan domingo perón1 perón who initially ruled as elected president from 1946 until his ouster by the military in 1955 established formidable political base through support from trade unions peronism survived as political movement despite attempts by the military and antiperonist sectors to defeat it perón was exiled until 1973 when he returned to win the presidency once again in 1976 the military again intervened and ruled until it fell into disrepute in the aftermath of argentinas defeat in the 1982 falkland islands war with great britain in 1983 raúl alfonsín of the ucr was elected president for sixyear term while alfonsín was credited with restoring democratic institutions during his tenure he left office in 1989 before his term was up because of chaotic economy characterized by hyperinflation in 1989 peronist carlos menem was elected president for sixyear term and was reelected in the may 1995 elections for fouryear term2 president menem was successful in launching major overhaul of argentine domestic policy turning the countrys economic situation around although argentinas successful return to democratic rule and stable economic conditions were widely hailed the menem presidency faced problems some observers characterized his government as authoritarian claiming it weakened the powers of the congress and the judiciary other political problems included charges of corruption in highlevel governmental circles some high profile unsolved crimes such as the 1992 bombing of the israeli embassy and the 1994 bombing of jewish community center both in buenos aires contributed to charges of corruption president rúas administration since taking office in december 1999 president rúa has continued the previous administ rations economic policy of structural reform and open markets in his inaugural address president rúa emphasized that the three priority areas for his administration would be to reduce levels of public spending address unemployment and eliminate corruption the president has followed program of spending cuts tax revenue increases and provincial revenue sharing reform to lower the fiscal deficit he has pursued labor law reform measures to ease existing hiring and firing restricti ons to allow for more flexible labor market which would stimulate employment and allow the economy to react more readily to external shocks in addition president rúa has taken anticorruption actions such as cracking down on tax evasion creating an anticorruption bureau investigating

disclosure rules on official discretionary expenditures3 when president rúa took office in december 1999 unemployment levels were high 145 the fiscal deficit was higher than the target level and the country was in recession in the first few months of his administration president rúa moved fast to initiate key portions of his political program some of the his early successes included winning congressional approval for major fiscal deficit reductions initiating labor reform measures and developing political support from sectors of the peronist party for key parts of his political program another significant accomplishment for president rúas administration in 2000 was concluding two sets of talks with the imf and other international lending institutions on financial package agreements to strengthen the argentine economic reform program in march 2000 the administration successfully concluded negotiations on threeyear standby arrangement from the imf supporting the governments 20002002 economic program in december 2000 the government announced another agreement with the imf and other international lenders on financial package of nearly 40 billion see below key elements of the agreement include continuing commitments to structural reforms and reducing the fiscal deficit president rúas government had high public approval ratings in the first few months of his administration but increasing doubts over economic recovery recent corruption scandal and second set of unpopular spending cuts affecting government salaries and pension payments have diminished public confidence in his abilities in november 2000 president rúas approval ratings dropped to 23 down from the 70 approval rating only ten months earlier the president is also having political difficulties within his cabinet and the governing coalition recent bribery scandal in the senate prompted him to make cabinet changes but not to the satisfaction of some government officials within the coalition he replaced some cabinet members but held on to two officials who had been associated with the corruption scandal in protest vice president carlos alvarez who argued the two officials should be removed resigned immediately other influential officials also resigned amid the cabinet reshuffling4 the future success of president rúas administration may depend on how well the economy does some analysts believe that the imf loan agreements combined with additional structural and labor law reform will help the struggling economy others believe that financial packages and economic reform measures are not enough and that argentina must change the currency board policy to achieve economic growth and international competitiveness however changing the fixed exchange rate would likely prove politically difficult for the administration since the us dollar is so widely used within the country and most argentines support the currency board policy

menem administration dramatically reversed argentinas economic decline by implementing aggressive free market policies and macroeconomic reforms these included the establishment of currency board which establishes fixed exchange rate of the argentine peso on onetoone basis with the us dollar trade liberalization privatization of state industries and public administration reform as part of the free market reforms the menem administration opened up the argentine economy more fully to international competition by liberalizing foreign investment and trade regulations and joining regional common market mercosur along with brazil paraguay and uruguay as result of these policies argentin experienced strong period of economic growth in the early 1990s in the second half of the decade however argentina experienced two recessions partially as result of external shocks caused by the 1995 mexican financial crisis the stronger value of the us dollar and the 1998 devaluation of brazils currency the establishment of currency board is widely credited as the main instrument responsible for argentinas reduction of inflation in the early 1990s the currency board effectively prohibits the government from stimulating the economy by printing new currency not backed by gold or dollars former president menem had considered proposal to replace the argentine peso with the us dollar but there is clear indication whether president rúa has intentions of implementing such policy while adoptinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20781crs5 5 for more information see crs report rs20105 if argentina decides

1980s which averaged 355 annually by 1993 argentinas inflation rate had dropped to 106 from more than 3000 in 19896 with the currency board however the argentine government cannot devalue the currency to stay competitive in the international market and is limited in fiscal policy adjustments to stimulate the economy to improve the fiscal balance after the economic shocks in 1995 and 1998 the government cut spending and increased taxes putting more deflationary pressures on the economy although some analysts maintain that argentinas economy is fundamentally sound because inflation is under control and the fiscal deficit appears to be manageable there are widespread concerns about sluggish economic growth and high unemployment president rúas unpopular budget cuts and tax increases are adding to deflationary pressures on the economy and stifling wage and employment growth in november 2000 millions of workers formed the largest strike in years to protest the governments economic policies continuing recent concerns about argentinas economic prospects have raised the possibility among investors that argentina may not be able to meet its debt obligations in 2001 an outcome that could easily lead to financial crisis in december 2000 in crucial move to avoid financial crisis argentina unveiled an economic program to enhance domestic and external confidence in the economy the program financial package of 397 billion was agreed to by the argentine government the imf the world bank the interamerican development bank idb the spanish government and other lending institutions it includes 137 billion line of credit from the imf 5 billion in loan commitments from the world bank and idb and 1 billion from the government of spain7 the goal is to provide argentina with sufficient liquidity to avoid defaulting on its debt and to restore investor confidence some analysts maintain however that economic problems will continue unless argentina eliminates the currency board to allow for increased competitiveness of argentinas exports in the world market and to provide more flexible fiscal policy to respond to economic problems others note that the present administration appears committed to the currency board on grounds that with argentinas facto dollarization through fixed exchange rate sudden change could cause significant economic disruption at
