the house committee on the judiciary reported favorably hr 2372 the bill titled private property rights implementation act of 2000 is aimed principally at lowering the threshold barriers of ripeness and abstention encountered when land owners file in federal court challenging local government actions as takings1 under the fifth amendments takings clause which applies to state and local not only federal actions private property may not be taken for public use without just compensation it is wellsettled that takings may be effected not only by government appropriation or physical invasion of private property but by use restrictions as well when use restriction as typically by local zoning has sufficiently severe impact on propertys economic use courts find that taking has occurred and that the regulating government must pay compensation takings challenges to local government action may be brought in state or federal court in federal court the plaintiff must surmount wider array of threshold issues than in state court before the taking issue can be reached some of these issues concern ripeness ripeness doctrine requires that before taking claim is heard by federal court the plaintiff must obtain final decision from the landuse regulating body including resubmission of scaleddown proposals in some cases and pursuit of any possible variances and that any avenues for obtaining compensation from the state courts be exhausted another threshold issue often encountered in takings cases against local government is abstention doctrine that may lead federal court to decline exercising jurisdiction in deference to state forums for resolving the matter studies show that goodly portion of takings cases brought in federal court against local government landuse regulatio n are dismissed on ripeness or abstention grounds hr 2372 aims to lower or eliminate these barriers so that landowners have federal forum for resolving takings claims on the merits as well as state one hr 2372 is thus process bill it disavows any intent to change substantive takings law httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20493crs2 2 robert meltz property rights bills take process approach hr 992 and hr 1534 crs report 97877 updated june 24 1998 at 1129more specifically hr 2372 targets federal district courts handling realproperty related claims under 42 usc section 1983 common vehicle for bringing takings actions the bill instructs such courts not to abstain in an action lacking any claim of state law violation if parallel state proceeding is not pending as for ripeness the bill sets out when state proceedings shall be deemed to result in final decision at which point the federal judge must find the claim ripe final decision exists the bill says once one meaningful application as defined in case law has been disapproved and if available one appeal and one waiver also however if the initial disapproval explains in writing the development on the property that would be approved the landowner to achieve ripeness must submit another meaningful application taking into account that explanation and have that resubmission be disapproved followed by one appeal and one waiver if available and their disapproval appeals and waivers need not be applied for if doing so would be futile the local governments failure to act on any of these applications within reasonable time would constitute disapproval also hr 2372 would eliminate entirely the ripeness rule that before coming to federal court the landowner must exhaust opportunities for statecourt compensation while formally only process bill hr 2372 raises important issues these are discussed at length in an earlier crs report on very similar bill in the 105th congres s hr 15342 here we briefly note some of the major ones 1 federalism in some instances the bill may result in federal courts involving themselves in local land use matters earlier than they would otherwise bill opponents say this contradicts congressional statements about respecting state and local rights and slights the state courts bill supporters contend that the bill merely places the takings clause on an equal footing with other guarantees in the bill of rights 2 effect on developerlocal government negotiations would hr 2372 give added weight to developers threat to bring taking claim if the local government did not approve its desired development scenario would local governments particularly small ones find it more burdensome to litigate in federal court than state court 3 federal judges federal judges often express an aversion to getting involved in local land use matters or note the already heavy workload of the federal courts 4 adequacy of the record what would be the effect of requiring federal courts to decide takings claims on the merits in the absence of detailed record 5 stateexhaus tion prong of ripeness is the stateexhaustion requirement constitutionally based if so congress may not eliminate it by statute the amendments to hr 2372 adopted in subcommittee and committee all offered by rep canady are of minor or technical nature all democratic amendments were rejected senate bill s 1028 contains provisions similar to hr 2372 plus another processtype approach restricted to takings claims against the united states action has been taken on s 1028
