which used the hearing to conduct its monthly review of the capitol visitor center project once again gao officials as they had at committee oversight hearing month earlier expressed concerns over continuing delays in the project they did concede however that some of those delays were prompted by redesign resulting from the cvc teams misunderstanding of congressional requirements for certain spaces as well as securityrelated design changes gao assistant director of physical infrastructure terrell dorn reiterated earlier concerns that the aocs projected completion dates for the project were too optimistic and did not allow enough time for several critical activities to take place or for risk and uncertainties that continue to affect the project hantman however remained convinced that the center except for the house and senate expansion spaces would be completed in march 2007 with formal opening month later at the hearing gao estimated that the final cost of the project would

several agencies have not effectively dealt with major management problems and lack reliable data to verify and validate performance while legislative branch agencies are not required to comply with
