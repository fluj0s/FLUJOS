the fy1977 crs instead generally funded specific unauthorized activities that had been stricken from the applicable regular appropriations bills 18 since 1988 there have been only two fully ear crs an fy1992 continuing resolution provided fullyear funding for one regular appropriations bill and the fy2007 fullyear measure continued funding for nine of the 11 regular bills 19 the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 pl 93344 88 stat 297 shifted the date of the start of the fiscal year 20 for more information see funding gaps section belowhistory and recent trends crs date from at least the late 1870s and have been regular part of the annual appropriations process for over 50 years in fact with the exception of three fiscal years fy1989 fy1995 and fy199716 at least one continuing resolution has been enacted for each fis cal year since fy1955 it is important to note that while congress enacted two fy1977 crs these acts did not temporarily fund any fy1977 regular appropriations bills si nce all the bills became law on or by the start of the new fiscal year17 during the past 35 years the nature scope and durati on of crs expanded from the early 1970s through 1987 crs gr adually expanded fro m interim funding measures of comparatively brief duration and length to measures providing funding in lieu of one or more regular appropriations bills through the end of the fiscal year these measures included in some cases the full text of one or more regular appropriations bills and sometimes contained substantive legislation as well ie provisions under the jurisdiction of committ ees other than the house and senate appropriations committees since 1988 tinuing resolutions have tended to be interim funding measures with less substantive legislation18 until the early 1970s continuing resolu tions principally were limited in scope and duration and rarely exceeded page or two in length they were used almost exclusively to provide interim funding at minimum formulaic level and contained few provisions unrelated to the interim funding beginning in the early 1970s conflicts between the president and congress over major budget priorities trig gered in part by rapidly increasing deficits greatly increased the difficulty of reaching final agreements on regular appropriations acts even after the start of the fiscal year was shifted from july 1 to october 119 these conflicts often led to protracted delay in their enac tment the view of continuing resolutions as mustpass measures b ecause of the constitutional and statutory imperatives was given increased urgency due to the 1980 depar tment of justice opinion prohibiting agencies from continui ng all but minimal activities when funds were not available20 the result was that continuing resolutions became major battleground for the resolution of budgetar conflicts and so metimes other policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30343crs8 21 pl 99591 100 stat 3341 and pl 100202 101 stat 1329 22 increased focus on enforcement began with the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 pl 99177 99 stat 10371038 and balanced budget and emergency deficit control reaffirmation act of 1987 pl 100119 101 stat 754 which were in part designed to balance the budget by fy1991 and fy1993 respectively both provided an automatic acrosstheboard reduction in select ed spending if the deficit targets provided for each fiscal year covered by the acts were exceeded under the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 pl 101508 104 stat 1388573 1388574 the deficit reduction procedures above were effectively replaced by two other procedures affecting legislation considered by congress that would increase spending andor decrease revenues the bea 1 set separate discretionary spending lim its for fy1991 through fy1995 enforced through acrosstheboard reductions in discretionary spending and 2 required increases in mandatory spending andor decreases in revenues to be offset so that the net deficit was not increased enforceable by acrosstheboard reduction in selected mandatory spending the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 107 stat 312 683 extended these procedures through fy1998 and the ba lanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 111 stat 251 extended them through fy2002 23 pl 102266 106 stat 92conflicts as well conse quently the nature scope nd duration of crs began to change continuing resolutions began to be used to provide funds for longer periods and occasionally for an entire fiscal year when agreement on one or more regular acts could not be reached further crs became vehicles for substantive legislative provisions unrelated to interim funding as it became clear that in some years crs would be the most effective means to enact such provisions into law these trends culminated in fy1987 and fy1988 following period of persisten tly high deficits and sustained conflict over how to deal with them for those two years crs effectively became omnibus appropriations measures for the federal government incorporating all of the regular appropriations acts for the entire fiscal year as well as host of substantive legislation c overing broad range of policy areas21 from fy1989 through fy1995 congress and the president generally operated under multiyear deficit reduction agreem ents achieved through budget summits and beginning with fy1991 separate enforcemen t of appropriations measures through discretionary spending ceilings22 with relative agreement on overall budget priorities conflicts over appropriations measures were generally narrower crs were typically more limited in scope contained less substantive legislation and were used mainly to provide interim funding for relatively brief periods the only exception was fy1992 when congress provided fully ear funding in cr for one fy1992 regular appropriations act foreign operations23 significant budgetary conflict resumed in 1995 the conflicts over spending priorities occurred between congress and the administration within congress and within the political parties as well due in part to these differences there were two partial government shutdowns in the wint er of 19951996 the first lasted for 5 dayshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30343crs9 24 during partial government shutdown departments and agenci funded in outstanding regular appropriations bills must begin to shut down while those funded in regular bills that have already become law continue their normal operations during the second partial government shutdown departments and agencies covered under six fy1996 regular bills shut down and furloughed employees while those agencies under the seven regular bill continued their activities it is important to note that there are exceptions to the shutdown requirement for certain activities such as pr otecting life or property as described in crs report rs20348 federal funding gaps brief overview by robert keith 25 pl 104134 110 stat 1321 26 in certain years selected regular bills were never considered on the floor or consideration was not completed since both house and sena standing rules prohibit amendments to conference reports some controversial amendments that might have been offered during initial floor consideration of an appropriations bill were never considered 27 to ensure all the fy1997 regular appropriations bills became law by the start of the fiscal year on october 1 for example five fy1997 re gular bills were attached to sixth fy1997 regular bill in conference this action obv iated the need for continuing resolution 28 pl 1105 121 stat 8

resolutions c ongress created an omnibus measure for fy199625 the change in the type of legislative vehicle from fullyear continuing resolutions to omnibus appropriations measur created at the conference stage of the legislative process was based on political and procedural considerations combining uncompleted appropriations bills or even including those that had received floor consideration in one or both chambers into single conference report for example made it possible to avoid floor consid eration of certain controversial floor amendments to regular appropriations bills26 creating an omnibus appropriations bill at the conference stage could also be used to expedite completion of the outstanding regular bills by reducing the number of votes and the number of opportunities for presidential veto27 since fy1997 conflicts over outstanding regular bills have generally been resolved in omnibus appropriations meas ures rather than fullyear continuing resolutions the only exception was fy2007 for that year nine of 11 fy2007 regular bills were funded for the entire fi scal year in continuing resolution28 during the fy1997fy2008 period omnibus regular appropriations bills were generally developed by att aching the language of outst anding regular appropriations bills as well as substantive legislation to the conference report on another regular appropriations bill it is important to note that during the fy1996 conflict congress began using new type of provision in crs targeted appropriations it separated some specific activities from the six
