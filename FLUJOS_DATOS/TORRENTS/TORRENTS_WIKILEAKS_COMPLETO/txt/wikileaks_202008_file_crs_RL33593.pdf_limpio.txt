meanstested entitlement program that covers about 57 million people across the nation including children and families persons with disabilities pregnant women and the elderly the program has become the largest single source of financing for longterm care ltc1 eligibility for medicaids longterm care services is limited to persons who meet statedesigned assessment for functional need and certain financial standards the assessment for functional need examines physical andor cognitive functioning that evaluates whether applicants would require the level of care provided in an institution ie nursing facility intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded or hospital 2 to meet states financial standards applicants income and assets must be within specified limits people meet medicaids income and asset eligibility criteria in one of three ways 1 they have income and assets equal to or below statespecified thresholds 2 they deplete their income and assets on the cost of their care thus spending down or 3 they divest of their assets to meet these income and asset standards sooner than they otherwise might if they first had to spend their income and assets on the cost of their care recent public policy concerns have centered around the third group in particular the medicaid estate planning issue applies primarily to subset of medicaid applicants who are age 65 and over need longterm care services such as nursing home or home and communitybased services have income greater than 74 of the federal poverty level about 637 per month for an individual and have assets above 2000 medicaid estate planning is means by which elderly people divest of their income and assets to qualify for medicaids coverage sooner than they would if they first had to spend their income and assets on the cost of their care it is also means by which persons may protect their assets from estate recovery motivation for estate planning is in part result of the high costs of longterm care services and the fear that these costs could quickly deplete savings metlife survey of select group of nursing homes across the country for example found that for these facilities the average daily rate of semi private room was 189 daily or 68985 per year in 2007 metlifes survey of home health agencies also found that the average per hour private pay rate of home health aide was 19 3 1 longterm care refers to wide range of supportive and health services for persons who have lost the capacity for selfcare due to illness cognitive disorders or physically disabling condition it differs from other types of care in that the goal of longterm care is not to cure an illness but to allow an individual to attain or maintain an optimal level of functioning 2 state tests for measuring levelofcare requirements vary across the nation in general the need for longterm care services is measured by persons ability to perform basic types of daily activities referred to as activities of daily living adls and instrumental activities of daily living iad ls adls generally include bathing dressing toileting transferring from bed or chair eating and getting around inside the home iadls generally include shopping light housework telephoning money management and meal preparation 3 metlife market survey of nursing home and assisted living costs metlife mature market institute westport ct october

1993 medicaids rules concerning eligibility asset transfers and estate recovery have been designed to restrict access to medicaids longterm care services to those individuals who are poor or who have very high medical or longterm care expenses and apply their income and assets toward the cost of their care however the 1993 law did not eliminate all ways for applicants to shield assets and income in recent years some people with the help of attorneys have used variety of methods to protect assets so as to enable them to obtain medicaid coverage while using personal resources for other purposes 4 the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 dra was the most recent attempt by congress to limit this activity there are insufficient data available to accurately estimate the prevalence of asset transfers today and data that can reasonably predict whether or how much this practice might grow in the future significant amount of anecdotal evidence exists about people engaging in medicaid estate planning in addition an industry of lawyers specializing in medicaid estate planning has developed across the nation court cases at federal and state levels also point toward the prevalence of transfers furthermore states have expressed strong interest in curbing medicaid estate planning and have taken number of steps to do so critics of medicaid estate planning often explain that asset sheltering places financial strain on the medicaid program and directs scarce resources away from people who are most in need of assistance to pay for care for people who are less in need some critics also object to this practice by asserting that people should assume financial responsibility for their own longterm care services before relying on tax dollars to pay for care they could otherwise afford others believe that people who engage in medicaid estate planning do so because they feel they should be able to leave their estates to their loved ones in addition they explain that medicaids generally low allowable asset limit often 2000 excluding home and certain other assets listed below often leaves persons with longterm care needs without the resources they need to remain at home and requires them to become virtually destitute before they can receive assistance in paying for their care medicaid estate planning they argue can preserve extra income andor assets of an individual or couple to be used toward living costs while obtaining medicaid coverage for longterm care services concern about medicaid estate planning resurfaced in the 109 th congress as part of the larger policy debate about the financial strains medicaid places on federal and state budgets in general and the increasing costs of medicaids longterm care coverage in particular some are concerned that as the population ages medicaids payments for longterm care services will become unsustainable without changes to the law govern ing the program concern also grew from an interest by some policymakers in assuring that medicaid play the role of safety net program for persons who are poor and not as defacto longterm care insurance program for persons who could otherwise afford to pay for their care by tightening eligibility transfer of assets and estate recovery laws the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 dra attempted to further 4 for description of some of these methods see medicaid asset

services fall into the category of aged or persons with disabilities financial requirements place limits on the amount of income and assets 6 individuals may possess to become eligible for medicaid often referred to as standards or thresholds additional guidelines specify how states should calculate these amounts ie counting methodologies the specific income and asset limitations that apply to each eligibility group are set through combination of federal parameters and state definitions consequently these standards vary 5 in the first session of the 109th congress the senate committee on

does not exceed 100 of the federal poverty level fpl medicaid law also allows states to cover people with higher income if they require the level of care offered in an institution such as nursing home or if they have medical expenses that deplete their income to specified levels note that lowincome elderly persons without longterm care needs and younger persons with disabilities who do not need longterm care services also qualify for medicaid through many of these pathways

100 option if available and who need the level of care that would be provided in nursing facility or certain other institutions11 states may also use this higher income standard for those needing institutional care as well as those who qualify for home and communitybased longterm care services under section 1915c of the social security act under the special income rule also referred to as the 300 rule such persons may have income that does not exceed specified level established by the state but greater than 300 of the maximum ssi payment applicable to person living at home for 2008 this limit is 1911 per month three times the monthly ssi payment of 637 or about 221 fpl number of states also allow persons to place income in excess of the special income level in trust called miller trust and receive medicaid coverage for their care 12 following the individuals death the state becomes the beneficiary of amounts in this trust g21g153g142g151g141g556g6g152g160g151g561g9g155g152g158g153g156g561 federal law also gives states the option of allowing aged persons with high medical expenses to qualify for medicaid through socalled spenddown groups under these groups people qualify only if their medical expenses on such things as nursing home care prescription drugs etc deplete or spend down their income and assets to specified medicaid thresholds 13 for example if an individual has monthly income of 1000 and the states income standard is 480 then the applicant would be required to incur 520 in outofpocket medical expenses before he or she would be eligible for medicaid states use specific time period for calculating persons medical expenses generally ranging from one month to six months14 the most common spend down group is referred to as medically needy under this option states may set their medically needy monthly income limits for family of given size at any level up to 133 of the maximum payment for similar family under the states former aid to families with dependent children afdc cash assistance program in place on july 16 199615 the monthly income limits are often lower than the income standard for elderly ssi recipients ie less than 637 monthly in 2008 once eligible for medicaid beneficiaries who qualify 11 care must be needed for fewer than 30 consecutive days 12 since 1993 obra 1993 states that use only the special in come rule for institutional eligibility and do not use the medically needy option must allow for incomeonly trusts 13 states may use spend down groups to extend medicaid coverage to persons who are members of one of the broad categories of medicaid covered groups ie are aged have disability or are in families with children but do not meet the applicable income requirements and in some in stances resources requirements for other eligibility pathways 14 the calculation becomes the basis for determining the amount of persons spenddown requirement generally shorter time period is more beneficial to the applicant for example if the state has one month spenddown calculation period the individual would be required to incur 520 in medical expenses in month after which services would be covered by medicaid on the other hand if the state had six month calculation period the individual would have to incur projected amount of 3120 520 times six in medical expenses before medicaid would begin coverage the length of the spenddown period does not significantly affect total outofpocket expenditures for persons with predictable and recurring medical expenses such as persons with chronic illnesses or disabling conditions however individuals faced with acute nonrecurring problems generally benefit more from shorter calculation period 15 for families of one the statute gives certain states some flexibility to set these limits to amounts that are reasonably related to the afdc payment amounts for two or more persons afdc was replaced with the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program in 1996

medically needy thresholds toward the cost of their care as result elderly re cipients living in the community who must spend down to qualify for medicaid generally are allowed to retain less money for their living expenses than medicaid beneficiaries who qualify through ssi in 2003 33 states had medically needy programs for persons age 65 and older16 the second spend down group is available in

medicaid persons qualifying through certain eligibility groups are required to apply their income above specified amounts toward the cost of their care the amounts they may retain vary by setting for

may retain maintenance needs allowance these amounts vary by states and ranged from 500 to 2267 per month in 2003 all income amounts above these levels including what may be available in miller trust

also set asset standards within federal parameters that applicants must meet to qualify for coverage these standards specify the maximum amount of countable assets person may have to qualify assets above these amounts make an individual ineligible for coverage for the treatment of most types of assets states generally follow ssi program rules under ssi and thus often under the medicaid program countable assets such as funds in savings account stocks or other equities cannot exceed 2000 for an individual and 3000 for couple for purposes of eligibility determinations assets are either 1 counted for their entire value 2 excluded for their entire value eg one automobile household goods and personal effects 17 certain property essential to incomeproducing activity or 3 excluded for part of their value and counted for part of their value eg up to 1500 in burial funds life insurance policies whose total face value is not greater than 1500 however state practices for counting assets vary significantly under section 1902r2 of the social security act states are granted flexibility to modify these rules this provision grants states permission to use more liberal standards for computing resources and income than are specified under ssi most states use section 1902 r2 to ignore or disregard certain types or amounts of assets and income thereby extending medicaid to individuals with assets too high to otherwise qualify under the specified ru for that eligibility pathway 16 these include alaska arkansas california connecticut florida georgia hawaii illinois iowa

whose husband or wife seeks medicaid coverage for longterm care services these provisions were added to medicaid law by the medicare catastrophic coverage act mcca of 1988 pl 100360 to address the situation that would otherwise leave the spouse not receiving medicaid ie community spouse defined as the spouse of an institutionalized medicaid beneficiary who lives in the community and is not eligible for medicaid with little or income or assets when the other spouse is institutionalized or at state option is receiving medicaids home and communitybased servicesalso referred to as the institutionalized spouse before mcca states could consider all of the assets of the community spouse as well as the spouse needing medicaid coverage available to be used toward the cost of care for the medicaid covered spouse these rules created hardships for the community spouse who was forced to spend down virtually all of the couples assets to medicaid eligibility levels so that the institutionalized spouse could qualify for coverage mcca established new rules for the treatment of income and assets of married couples allowing the community spouse to retain higher amounts of income and assets on top of noncountable assets such as house car etc than allowed under general medicaid rules regarding assets federal law allows states to select the amount of assets community spouse may be allowed to retain it specifies that this limit may not exceed 104400 and may be less than 20880 in total countable assets in 2008 for purposes of determining how many assets the community spouse may retain all assets of the couple are combined counted and split in half regardless of which of the two spouses possesses ownership if the community spouses assets are less than the state standard then the medicaid beneficiary must transfer his or her share of the assets to the community spouse until the communityspouses share reaches the standard all other nonexempt assets must be depleted before the applicant can qualify for medicaid regarding income federal law exempts all of community spouses income eg pension or social security in his or her name from being considered available to the other spouse for purposes of medicaid eligibility for community spouses with limited income federal law allows institutionalized spouses to transfer income to the community spouse up to statedetermined maximum level federal law specifies that this limit may be greater than 2610 per month and less than 1712 per month in 2008 see the sections on policy discussion of selected issues

attempt to recover payments made for other ltc services as described above in fact total benefits paid for ltc services for which states may recover is far greater despite the relatively low recovery ratio overall ratios vary significantly across states arizona had the highest recovery ratio in the nation at 104 followed by oregon with the second highest recovery ratio in the nation of 58 idaho had the third highest recovery ratio 45 all other states had recovery ratios of under 3 table 1 differences in estate recovery across states reflect variation in their political and economic environments for example states with more ri gorous programs have tended to view estate recovery as costcontainment strategy states with lower recovery ratios often face barriers to estate recovery as result of political debate about the appropriateness of recovering an individuals home after beneficiarys death in still others particularly those with relatively low per capita income belief that recovery is not costeffective in that state ie administrative costs exceed recovery amounts may contribute to weaker efforts to recover assets than might otherwise exist httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33593

budgets combined with projected increases in the programs longterm care spending sparked interest among some members in the 109th congress in containing program expenditures so as to free up federal dollars for other purposes supporters of dra passed by both houses at the beginning of the first session of the 109th congress argued that when faced with range of undesirable options for containing medicaid spending such as cutting benefit packages eligibility or reimbursement amounts to providers the better choice would be to restrict eligibility for persons who are better off so as to maintain spending for persons who are worse off provisions in the dra concerning asset transfers are intended to do just this the law made changes to medicaids eligibility asset transfers and estate recovery requirements in an attempt to further discourage people from sheltering or depleting their assets so as to qualify for medicaid sooner than they otherwise might many members opposed to dra argued that cuts to the medicaid program were misguided in part because medicaid estate planning was not large contributor toward medicaids financial strain on state and federal budgets they also asserted that medicaids covprotected and even expanded to cover additional groups of lowincome persons for whom the often catastrophic costs of longterm care could quickly lead family into impoverishment during the 109 th congress debate arose among policymakers about whether dra would actually discourage andor make it more difficult for persons to protect or deplete their assets to qualify for medicaid or whether such persons would simply find other methods to do so that are not prohibited by law it is likely that both outcomes will come true it is clear that new restrictions on the use of annuities promissory notes and life estates for example will reduce the types of financial vehicles available for protecting assets in addition tighter penalties ie change in penalty start date for transferring assets for less than fair market value will likely deter some people from making transfers together these tougher requirements will likely discourage some people from engaging in medicaid estate planning although it is not yet known how many the congressional budget office estimated that the savings generated by these asset transfer provisions would total 24 billion over 20062010 55 on the other hand the legislative language in dra does not penalize all methods of transferring assets certain methods for protecting or depleting assets for the purpose of qualifying for medicaid will still be available to some consequently it is also likely that some people will engage in medicaid estate planning despite the changes made by dra policymakers also raised concerns about the potential impacts of dra that are less clear for example concern has been raised about the extent to which stronger penalties for people who make asset transfers to qualify for medicaid would negatively impact other groups of eligibles as well particularly those who may have transferred assets without any intention of ever needing medicaids assistance in particular concern has been raised that persons who make charitable donations transfers to adult children in need or other transfers of small amounts would be 55 congressional budget office cost estimate s 1932 deficit reduction act of 2005 conference

individuals had intention of needing medicaid coverage for longterm care services other concerns have been raised about the possibility that the change in the penalty start date would result in some

signific antly impact the health and safety of some of the frailest among us finally dras requirement that states apply the incomefirst rule when allocating income and assets among certain couples in which one spouse qualifies for medicaid longterm care coverage and the other does not has raised concerns about potentially undoing the spousal impoverishment protections established by congress in the medicare catastrophic coverage act mcca of 1988 specifically these concerns are about how this new requirement might impact the longterm financial security of community spouses although the actual impacts of dra will not be known for some time the following discussion provides additional insight into these questions note that this analysis is limited to information available as of point in time and thus does not reflect the future choices of states about how they will implement the acts new requirements the 110 th congress may choose to monitor the implementation of dra as well as evaluate

application of penalties on persons who made transfers without having ever intended to increase the speed with which they qualified for medicaid however these provisions are not easily applied and implemented and states have thus far been inconsistent in their implementation of this provision as result whether penalties will be applied to such persons will depend on whether the secretary publishes additional guidance whether those states that are not actively examin ing intent begin to apply it and whether the secretary increases its oversight of this law intent of the transfer medicaid provisions established by the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 contain safety net requirement designed to protect individuals who make transfers for purposes other than to speed up the process of becoming eligible for medicaid the first section 1917c2c of the social security act limits states to applying penalties only on persons who made transfers for less than fair market value with the intention of protecting or depleting their assets and prohibits states from imposing penalties on individuals who transferred assets exclusively for purpose other than to qualify for medicaid provided that satisfactory showing is made to the state in accordance with regulations promulgated by the secretary 56 in spirit this 56 section 1917c2c of the social security act prov ides that penalties are not applied to persons when satisfactory showing is made to the state in accordance with regulations promulgated by the secretary that i the individual intended to dispose of the assets either at fair market value or for other valuable consideration ii the assets were transferred exclusively for purpose other than to qualify for medicaid or iii all assets transferred for less than fair market value have been returned to the individual httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33593g15g142g141g146g140g138g146g141g561g5g152g159g142g155g138g144g142g561g143 g152g155g561g14g152g151 g144g556

relatively small in size give regularly to charitable organizations provide financial assistance to adult children or grandchildren during crises among othersand in some circumstances the provision does in other circumstances however this provision may be less effective in part because the provision can be hard for states to implement the intent of the transfer is difficult to measure and guidance has been provided at the national level either under the law or by the secretary to assist states in developing standards for measuring intent consequently states implementation of this requirement varies across the country an informal crs survey of selected states in the fall of 2005 found that some states do not evaluate the intent of transfer and other states do among states that do not evaluate intent some simply automatically apply penalties to all transfers made for less than fair market value within the lookback period among those that do the survey also found that states considered the health status and living circumstances of an applicant at the time the transfer was made for example person who was healthy and living independently may be determined by state to have been less likely to have transferred assets for the purpose of qualifying for medicaid because he or she may not have suspected ever needing medicaid alternatively some states determine that gifts made while persons are already frail and dependent are likely to have been made with the intention of protecting or depleting assets to qualify for medicaid sooner than they otherwise would the following are two examples of the way in which this process might work in state to show that charitable gifts made during the fiveyear lookback period were not made to speed up qualification for medicaid an individual could provide financial records to the state demonstrating the applicants long history of annual charitable giving such as 1000 year for the past 10 years another method might be to provide medical records around the time of the transfer to demonstrate that at that time the applicant was healthy persons health record might suggest to the state that the individual had not expected to need medicaid longterm care coverage at the time the gift was made another important factor that may complicate the application of the intent provision is that applicants for the most part

the change in the penalty start date will likely result in more severe penalties for people who make transfers for less than fair market value however obra 1993 established provision in medicaid law intended to protect persons from experiencing significant harm as result of asset transfer penalties regardless of the intent for the transfer specifically section 1917c2d of the social security act prior to dra specifies that if state determines under procedures established by the state that the denial of eligibility would create an undue hardship the state must not apply asset transfer penalties as result all states are required to waive penalties when penalties would result in undue hardship however an informal survey conducted by crs in fall 2005 found that not all states had process for determining undue hardship and not all made sure to accurately notify people of

standardize the process states use to evaluate undue hardship as well as the procedures states use for notifying applicants of their rights see sections medicaids asset transfer rules and exceptions to the application of penalties as result of dra medicaid law now also requires states to provide 1 notice to recipients about the hardship waivers 2 timely processing of the waivers and 3 an appeals process for rebutting penalties it is still unclear at the present time whether and how states will change their practices to comply with these new requirements furthermore some observers speculate that applicants will take advantage of their rights to such exceptions by making transfers with the intent of speeding up their qualification for medicaid and then seeking waivers to the penalty periods so as to obtain care sooner than they otherwise would right to challenge penalties through undue hardship exception and appeals in the case that an applicant does not receive favorable determination from the state for an undue hardship exception other safety net provisions in medicaid law grant applicants the opportunity to rebut the appropriateness of penalty all applicants regardless of the intent of the transfers leading to penalties have the right to appeal penalty through each states appeal process states have the option to provide the opportunity for rebuttal during the application or redetermination process ie before penalty is imposed or the states fair hearing process 57 ie after penalty is imposed58

the answer to this question depends on the financial situation of the couple and the amount of income and assets available to the community spouse for some couples the incomefirst requirement will have impact on the couples financial security for others it will decrease couples financial security in the long run the section above see the section entitled financial eligibility criteria for medicaid coverage of longterm care services for the aged and appendix of this report for more information on spousal impoverishment rules describes medicaids provisions to prevent spousal impoverishment situation that leaves the spouse who lives at home on in another community setting with little or income or resources when the other spouse requires institutional or home and communitybased longterm care these provisions were intended to allow the community spouses to retain more of the couples income and assets so as to prevent him or her from becoming destitute while the institutionalized spouse receives medicaidcovered longterm care spousal impoverishment law provides guidance to states about how to count the income and resources of couple and how to allocate this income and resources between spouses this guidance includes instructions about minimum and maximum income and resources levels that community spouses may retain and guidance about how to calculate how much of the couples income and resources should be depleted to reach medicaid eligibility thresholds 57 described in 42 cfr part 431 subpart 58 state medicaid guidance section 32503

incomefirst rule medicaid law granted states flexibility in how they allocated income and resources when addressing the circumstance in which the income of the community spouse falls short of the mmna this flexibility resulted in states employing two divergent methods with the potential to affect the longterm financial security of community spouses differently as well as resulting in different medicaid savings effects under the method used by most states known as the incomefirst method states attempt to make up the community spouses income shortfall by first allocating the income of the institutionalized spouse to the community spouse under this method states consider whether all of the institutionalized spouses income that could be made available to the community spouse in accordance with the calculation of the posteligibility allocation of income or additional income allowance allocated at fair hearing has been made available after this calculation is completed resources may only be allocated to the community spouse if shortfall still exists between the community spouses expected monthly income and the mmna 59 if so states will allocate the institutionalized spouses assets to the community spouses income even if this expected transfer results in the commun ity spouses total resources exceeding the state specified resource limit all other resources of th institutionalized spouse must be depleted to medicaid eligibility thresholds before the individual can qualify for medicaid this method generally requires couple to deplete larger share of their assets than the resourcesfirst method and could reduce the amount of funds available to community spouses to cover their living expenses over their lifetimes at the same time this provision could increase the amount of couples funds that would be available to pay for spouses care incurring savings to medicaid under the other method known as the resourcesfir st method longer permitted as of dras enactment which is employed by fewer states the couples resources can be protected first even though the transfer of resources would bring the community spouses total resource level above the statespecified maximum for the benefit of the community spouse to the extent necessary to ensure that the community spouses total inco meets but does not exceed the community spouses monthly maintenance needs allowance under this method states do not consider whether income from the institutionalized spouse could be transferred to the community spouse rather they calculate the size of the allowable income based on the amount of income that would be generated by moving of resources of the institutional spouse to the community spouse first only if shortfall remains after the transfer of all available resources will the state consider transferring income to the community spouse this method generally enables the community spouse to retain at least theoretically 60 larger amount of the couples assets than the income first method and can reduce the amount of funds available to pay for the institutionalized spouses care thus costing the medicaid program more for example say states maximum income allowance for the community spouse mmna in 2006 is 2000 and the maximum resource allowance for the community spouse is 60000 in this example the community spouse eg wife retains exactly 60000 in resources but has only 1500 in monthly income 500 less than the mmna to raise the community spouses 59 the assets of an institutionalized spouse cannot be transferred to the community spouse if it would raise the community spouses total resources level above the maximum resources limit to generate additional income for the community spouse unless the income that could be transferred would still leave the community spouse with monthly shortfall 60 whether transfers of resources are ever actually made from the institutionalized spouse to the community spouse is not monitored by states

allow the institutionalized spouse eg husband to transfer additional assets that would be expected to generate income capable of covering the income shortfall as result in this example the husband could transfer enough assets to generate 500 of monthly income for the community spouse61 under the incomefirst rule transfer of asse ts from the husband to the spouse that would increase the communityspouses resource allowance above the maximum allowable level could but would not likely occur instead the law requires that states assume that the husband will transfer his income and not his assets to his wife as result the state would assume that the husband would transfer 500 of his income each month to his wife and require him to meet the states resources test eg assets may not exceed 2000 as result any additional assets above the protected 2000 for the institutionalized spouse and 60000 for the community spouse would need to be depleted before the husband could be eligible for medicaid the use of these funds on the cost of the husbands care would delay medicaid coverage and generate some savings to the program however medicaid law does not specify how these excess funds must be used rather the law allows for excess funds to be used without asset transfer penalties for care or for other purposes such as home improvements debt repayments and purchases of household items among other things regarding the community spouse the husband may continue to transfer 500 of monthly income to his wife as long as he remains living concerns can be raised about the community spouses longterm financial security surrounding the risk that the 500 may not be available to the community spouse in the long term if the husband were to pass away for example what would happen to that income if for example the income were in the form of pension variety of outcomes could occur it is possible that the pension would be automatically transferred to the surviving spouse in other instances the funds could be transferred but at reduced amount and in still other instances the pension would longer be available under the latter two scenarios the surviving spouses income would drop and less would be available to pay for monthly living expenses the incomefirst rule requires couples to apply mo re of their assets to the cost of their care and makes fewer assets available to community spouses to use for living expenses than under previous law as result medicaid savings will accrue at the same time the incomefirst rule may decrease financial security for some spouses residing in the community after the death of medicaidcovered spouse 61 the determination of how many assets would be required to generate 500 would depend on the method state uses to calculate the amount of income that is generated from assets for example the state may assume that the husband might place assets into an annuity or it might assume that it places assets into savings acc ount the state would then make an assumption about how much income would be generated from this annuity or savings account

eligibility current law provides that the value of an item may be totally or partially excluded for eligibility purposes when calculating countable resources current medicaid and ssi asset counting practices exclude the entire value of an applicants home however if an individual and spouse if any moves out of his or her home without intending to return the home becomes countable resource because it is longer the individuals principal place of residence if an individual leaves his or her home to live in an institution the home is still considered to be the individuals principal place of residence irrespective of the individuals intent to return as long as spouse or dependent relative of the eligible individual continues to live there the dra excludes from medicaid eligibility for nursing facilities or other longterm care services those individuals with an equity interest in their home of greater than 500000 state may elect to substitute an amount that exceeds 500000 but does not exceed 750000 beginning in 2011 these dollar amounts are increased from year to year based on the percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers rounded to the nearest

the beneficiary upon his or her death for purposes of recovery estates are defined as all real and personal property and other assets as defined in state probate law at the option of the state recoverable assets also may include any other real and personal property and other assets in which the person has legal title or interest at the time of death in general assets such as living trusts

noncountable assets for purposes of medicaid asset transfer rules in cms guidance however the secretary specifies that the establishment of life estate constitutes transfer of assets and that transfer for less than fair market value occurs whenever the value of the transferred asset is greater than the value of the rights conferred by the life estate according to cms life estate is at issue when an individual who owns pr operty transfers ownership to another individual while retaining for the rest of his or her life or the life of another person certain rights to that property generally life estate entitles the grantor to possess use and obtain profits from the property as long as he or she lives even though actual ownership of the property has passed to another individual the dra redefines the term assets with respect to the medicaid asset transfer rules as including the purchase of life estate interest in another individuals home unless the purchaser resides in the home for

intended to prevent impoverishment of spouse whose husband or wife seeks medicaid coverage for longterm care services permitting the community spouse to retain higher amounts of income and assets on top of noncountable assets than allowed under general medicaid rules the law allows community spouses with more limited income to retain at least statespecified amount set within federal guidelines if the community spouses monthly income amount is less than this amount the institutionalized spouse may choose to transfer an amount of his or her income or assets to make up for the shortfall ie the difference between the community spouses monthly income and the statespecified minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance this transfer allows more income to be available to the community spouse while medicaid pays larger share of the institutionalized spouses care costs current law allows states some flexibility in the way they apply these rules in allocating income and resources between spouses states have employed two divergent methods under the method used by most states known as the incomefirst method the institutionalized spouses income is first allocated to the community spouse to enab the community spouse sufficient income to meet the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance the remainder if any is applied to the institutionalized spouses cost of care under this method the assets of an institutionalized spouse eg an annuity or other incomeproducing asset cannot be transferred to the community spouse to generate additional income for the community spouse unless the income transferred by the institutionalized spouse would not enable the community spouses total monthly income to reach the monthly maintenance needs allowance this method generally requires couple to deplete larger share of their assets than the resourcesfirst method in contrast under the other method known as the resourcesfirst method employed by fewer states the couples resources can be protected first for the benefit of the community spouse to the extent necessary to ensure that the community spouses total income meets but does not exceed the community spouses minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance additional income from the institutionalized spouse that may be but has not been made available for the community spouse is used toward the cost of medicaidcovered care for the institutionalized spouse this method generally enables the community spouse to retain larger amount of the couples assets than the incomefirst method the dra requires all states to apply the incomefirst rule thus it requires states to consider whether all of the institutionalized spouses income that could be made available to the community spouse in accordance with the calculation of the posteligibility allocation of income or additional income allowance allocated at fair hearing has been made available before allocating the institutionalized spouses assets to the community spouses income to provide the difference between the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance and all income available to the community spouse potential impact under certain circumstances this provision could increase the amount of couples funds that would be available to pay for spouses care incurring savings to medicaid consequently it could reduce the amount of funds available to cover the living expenses over the lifetime of the other nonmedicaid covered spouse in the community
