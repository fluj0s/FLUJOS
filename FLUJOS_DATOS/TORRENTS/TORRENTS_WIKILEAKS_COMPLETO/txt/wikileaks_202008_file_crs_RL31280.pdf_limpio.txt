mailing of bacillus anthracis spores through the us postal service usps has caused five deaths twentytwo cases of anthrax and massive disruptions to congress and the usps both the public and private sector are examining an array of methods to limit the risk of future attacks the array of potential solutions include improving mail handling procedures changing the usps anonymous mailing policy installing biochem agent detectors and sterilizing the mail for the usps these decisions are complicat ed by its precarious financial state some proposed solutions may require an in crease in postage rates andor decreased levels of service each of these may fu rther depress postal reve nues and threaten the continued existence of the usps as an independent selfsupporting entity policymakers may wish to consider if the usps must ensure the safety of mail recipients at this point it is not clear if this is practical or even possible with existing technology it may be that it is practical to protect only the mail addressed to the most likely targets of future attacks some of the measures that the usps has taken or is planning to take to protect postal workers and mail recipients are common sense alterations to the mail processing procedures these include m easures to reduce cross contamination such as using vacuuming instead of pressurized air to dislodge dust and adding filters to air handling systems the usps is studying the feasibility of including biological weapon detectors during the sorting pro cess additionally the usps has made gloves masks and educational materials available to all postal workers more controversial and potentially more costly are plans to sterilize the mail currently all mail destined for federal offices in the washington dc metropolitan area is shipped to sterilization facility for irradiation treatment before delivery the usps is studying whether this solution can be scaled up to sterilize all mail from anonymous senders to imple ment irradiation procedures nationwide could cost up to 225 billion with up to another billion dolla rs each year in operating costs this procedure will cause delays and may damage the contents of some mail also controversial and costly are plan s to increase product tracking systems that will include video images of all retail transactions the planned system will enable mail dropped off at post offices to be tracked through to delivery and linked to facial images of senders mail dr opped off at anonymous coll ection sites will be traceable to the drop off point stamps and envel opes could also be encoded with purchase location information policymakers face difficult balance to strike between concerns for safety cost and practicality while deciding how to alter the practices of the usps

response to the threat of bioterrorism through the mail introduction the use of the us postal service usps to deliver agents of bioterror has caused 22 confirmed cases of anthrax in cluding five deaths as well massive disruptions to congress and the usps1 the contamination caused by processing and opening of the letters shuttered the hart senate office building for more than three months and indefinitely closed mail processing centers in washington dc and trenton nj these attacks have radically changed the way the nation views mail delivery and mail safety both the public and private sectors are evaluating variety of methods to reduce the risk of similar future attacks these potential solutions include changing mail handling procedures changing the usps anonymous mailing policy

for postal workers meas ures to decrease the threat of future mailings protect postal workers recovery costs medical treatments mail irradiation and to begin evaluating systems to protect mail recipients in the face of these increased costs the usps predicts the decrease in mail volume caused by the attacks will cost 2 billion dollars in lost revenues this fiscal year usps feels that its survival depends on being able to ensure th health of postal workers and to restore the faith of the american people in the safety of the mail interest and role of congress the efforts of the usps to respond to the threat of bioterrorism has been the subject of hearings before the nate treasury and general government appropriations subcommittee senate committee on governmental affairs and the house committee on government reform at the request of committee on government reform chairman dan burt on and ranking member henry waxman the national academy of sciences and th general accounting office have convened meetings between usps officials and outside experts to discuss appropriate technology and methodological changes to limit the threat of future attacks postmaster general john potte r has stated that he view s the need to reduce the threat of terrorism through the mail as an integral part of hom eland defense and thus plans to request congress to appropriate billions of dollars3 in addition to the 175 million it received from the white house emergency response fund the usps initially timated that it would need an additional approximately 11 billion in fy2002 to respond effectively to the bioterror threat and to replace or repair facilities damaged in the september 11 2001 terrori st attacks the 2002 department of defense appropriations act pl 107117 appropriated 500 million to the usps for these expenses because of ongoing concer ns over plans to screen and sanitize mail the conferees required the usps to submit an emergency preparedness plan to the committees on appropriations the house committee on government reform and the senate committee on governmental affairs before the money for these activities would be disbursed as part of its emergency prepare dness plan the conferees expect the postal service to include an assessment of threats to the health and safety of employees and customers of the postal service and the integrity of the mail testing and evaluating the options for detecting andor addressing those threats including both technol ogybased and pro cessbased options comparison of the costs and benefits of options under

the options selected4 in response to this request the usps published its comprehensive emergency plan in march 20025 this document discusses how the usps has responded to the attacks and the programs it plans to pursue over the next five years to further reduce the chances of successful bioterror attack in addition to the 675 million it has alr eady received from congress the usps indicated that it may ask for an additi onal 41 billion over the next five years to implement this plan because of its high cost this plan is likely to fall under careful scrutiny policymakers may want to explore questions that define the role the usps should play clearly the usps must protect postal workers but should the usps also take responsibility for the safety of ma il recipients is that possible if it is possible how much are ratepayers or taxpayers willing to pay does safe mean safe from all potential biological attacks or only anthrax what about chemical agents what kind of reductions in usps service are acceptable to ensure safety will changes to level of service add to th precarious financial position of the usps what portion of the costs should congress appropriate and how much of the costs should rate payers bear initial response previous terrorist attacks via the mail such as those of the unabomber generally targeted the recipient of the ma il however because anthrax spores are smaller than the natural pores in envelopes the spores can leak out during mail sorting putting postal workers at risk additionally spores can be transferred to other envelopes phenome non called cross contamina tion which puts at risk anyone whose mail was processed at the same facility as the anthrax tainted envelopes before these attacks these risks were generally considered negligible by experts in biological warfare and the centers for disease control and prevention cdc because it was thought that the few s pores that could be transferred this way would not be sufficient to cause disease because this assumption proved wrong the initial response of the usps has focused on ways to protect postal workers from exposure and how to protect subs et of high risk addressees shortly after the discovery of the c ontaminated letters both mail processing facilities which handled the letters were closed indefinitely the approximately 8500 postal workers deemed at even remo risk for exposure to anthrax werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31280crs4 6 centers for disease control and prevention morbidity and mortality weekly report vol50 47 november 30 2001 p 1052 7 washington post us

initial 60day course of antibiotics the cdc has recomme nded an additional 60 day course the cdc also has made the controversial anthrax vaccine available for the workers the delay between the discovery of the tainted letters facility closures and antibiotic treatments elicited criticism both from postal worker unions and congress7 the usps attributed the difference between the immediate closing and testing ofworkers in the hart senate office building and the delay before postal facilities and workers were tested to reliance on the evolving recommendations of the cdc after these attacks the usps examined its practices and found some changes could be made to reduce the risk to both postal workers and mail recipients one of the most obvious changes concerned dust ab atement procedures processing mail generates an enormous amount of dust compressed air had been the method of choice to clean the processing machines the usps recognized that this practice would widely distribute fine anthrax partic throughout the processing facility it is switching to vacuum systems both to clean the sorting machines and to replace the general maintenance practice of broom sw eeping these vacuums are fitted with high efficiency particulate air hepa filters which are designed to capture very small particles such as the bacterial spores which cause anthrax the usps has also provided antimicrobial wipes protective gloves and masks and their related educational materials to ensure proper use to all postal workers prior to the discovery of the tainted ma il procedure was in place to sterilize potentially harmful biological agents in the mail as an interim measure the usps has decided to sanitize mail destined for all federal government offices in the washington dc metropolitan area zip c odes 2020020599 initially this consisted of sealing the mail into secure containers and shipping it to subcontractors in lima ohio and bridgeport new jersey to be sterilized by irradiation the usps claims to have sterilized and deliver ed all of the mail that had been held undelivered since october although some agencies including the library of congress contend that all of this mail has not yet been delivered 8 once the undelivered mail backlog was cleared the usps began shipping all the mail only to the bridgeport facility this sterilization procedure adds approximately five to seven days to delivery times the usps forecasts that this procedure will be in place for only six months while permanent solution is implemented whic h could reduce the delay to two days the usps has purchased eight sterilization machines from the titan corporation for total of 40 milli on these will be used as part of an interim solution to sterilize the mail of what is considered high probability targets these targets were determined by the usps in cooperation with the department of justicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31280crs5 for national security reasons the usps will not disclose the exact make up of this list however they have publicly stated that some of these initial eight machines will be used to sterilize the mail destined for government offices in washington dc if the decision to sterilize all mail is made it may take several years before all of the required equipment can be installed in this case the target list will be used to prioritize which facilities to upgrade first the cost of some of this initial response was covered by the 175 million received from the white hous emergency response fund table 1 other aspects of the initial response such as the hepa f iltration systems are to be covered by the 500 million included in the 2002 department of defense appropriations act supplemental appropriation table 2 in addition the 87

2002httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31280crs8 long term plan the future viability of the usps may depend on its long term response to this new challenge the usps has decided while it is impossible to completely eliminate all risk of successful bioterror attack through the mail multifaceted response can greatly increase the safety of postal workers and mail recipients the usps constructed the emergency preparedness plan around four objectives deterrence of using the mail as tool for bioterrori sm and the detection containment and neutralization of biohazardous materials in the mail stream as soon as possible to accomplish these goals the usps proposes six initiatives prevention protection and healthrisk reduction detection and identification intervention and sanitization decontamination and investigation because several aspects of this plan are still under study the usps describes it as dynamic and subject to change only the decontamination initiativ has been completely funded by the appropriations to date the estimated costs of the remaining five as yet unfunded initia tives are detailed in table 3 prevention the usps plan defines prevention to include programs that stop contaminated mail from entering the mail stream as well as efforts to reduce the attractiveness of using the mail as delivery system for bioterror agents the emergency preparedness plan focuses on redesigning collection boxes increasing security at retail outlets developing security procedures for commercial mailers and increasing security at truck entrances collection box and drop slot redesign immediately following the anthrax outbreak some people called for th removal of all collection boxes the usps considered this but decided that such step would produce an enormous drop in residential and small business patronage the usps concluded that removal of all collection boxes was inconsistent w ith its continued operation therefore attention was focused on minimizing the risk associated with anonymous mail drops currently when mail enters one of the 350000 collection boxes or 40000 post office drop slots it falls into threesided bin the usps proposes to redesign these to have the mail enter plastic bag which would be mechanically sealed before the postal worker collected the mail the usps is studying the feasibility of including disposable biohazard det ector in each bag to immediat ely identify dangerous mail this combination would prevent exposing postal workers to bioterror agents and detect contaminated mail before it enters the mail stream although currently available biodetection strips are unlikely to be sensitive enough for this use the usps believes that either the next generation of strips will be useful or that another inexpensive detector system may become available soon collection boxes and mail bags may also be modified to contain tracking information thus if tainted letter gets past the initial detector screen but is detected later the entire route of the tter could be traced wh ich would help health care clean up and investigative operations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31280crs9 increasing retail outlet security this initiative calls for extensive deployment of security cameras to record all retail transactions images would be stored locally and could be linked with mail piece tracking to increase the investigative abilities as well critics of this initiative may suggest that 250 million is too much money for system that terrorist can easily thwart by avoiding post offices critics may also be concerned about the privacy issues rais ed by videotaping all postal patrons the usps acknowledges that this initiative may change public percep tions of its role which may further depress revenue developing security proce dures for commercial mailers because twothirds of mail comes from commercial bulk mailers the usps will work with industry to develop security standard s to reduce the probability of receiving contaminated mail from this source this mail will be considered safe and not subjected to further detecti on or possible decontamination processes currently there is request for supplemental funding asso ciated with this initiative because such program has not yet been developed however the usps predicts that any costs will be relatively low with industry paying for the bulk of it while the usps will hire compliance personnel increasing security at truck entrances this initiative will upgrade and install mechanical and elect ronic security devices and add more security personnel at each of the approximately 400 large mail processing centers protection and healthrisk reduction sorting machines it is likely that mail became cross contaminated inside the processing machines when the pinch be lts used to propel mail squeezed air out of the envelopes and caused puff of spores the usps is in the process of designing hepa filtration systems for these sorting machines the installation of these filters should be completed by the end of fy 2004 and is expected to require an additional 2658 million in s upplemental appropriations table 3 heating ventilating nd airconditioning systems the usps is also studying the use of hepa filters in th heating ventilating and airconditioning systems hvac all of the mail processing centers the usps projects that these systems could be operational by the nd of fy2003 for total cost of 126 million because the hvac for each processing cen ter is unique large portion of the implementation cost arises from the need for to design an individual system for each site the usps is also considering using an air sterilization system either instead of or in addition to hepa filter retrofits it may be possible to use ultraviolet light or ultrasound to kill any spores passing throug h the ventilation ducts however critics of hvac modifications argue that only small percentage of the air in facility actually passes through these systems and th erefore spores could stay airborne for days or weeks before entering duct for filtration or sterilizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31280crs10 detection and identification the usps envisions system which can continuously monitor facility air and the air ejected from mail during processing for potential threats current plans call for two step system detection of likel threat and confirmationidentification of the agent following confirmation appropria steps could be taken such as shutting down the center and treating atrisk personnel particle analysis the first step also called th triggering step would likely be carried out by particle analyzer these machines continuously sample the air and measure the size of all airborne par ticles more sophisticated versions also measure the aerodynamic shape of the particles and can potentially discriminate between biological and nonbiological partic these machines send an alert when it detects change in particle number size shape or makeup from background levels adapting this technology to usps needs is complicated due to the very high levels of paper dust that is gene rated during mail sorting however because paper dust particles tend to be larger than spores it is likel that this tec hnological hurdle can be overcome with appropriate filtering because this ty pe of detection system has relatively high false alarm rate s econd step is required for verification an alarm by the particle analyzer woul d trigger second step to verify the presence of threat and identify the agent it is not clear what technology would be used for this step experts from the department of defense advised the usps that the following technologies might be best suited for this application biological indicator strips polymer ase chain reaction pcr and mass spectroscopy biological indicator strips biological indicator strips work like home pregnancy tests sample is placed on the strip and within minutes result is known this can be automated to fit with usps plans however many experts think that biological test strips might require th presence of high levels of agent to work reliably therefore potentially lethal amounts of agent might not be detected another drawback is that each agent requires its own specially prepared test strip therefore samples can only be tested fo r only finite number of known agents polymerase ch ain reaction pcr is technology for detecting small quantities of dna with partic ular genetic sequence ty pically tests are designed to be specific for given species or strain of an organism if the target dna sequence is present in any of the dna in the sample the reaction produces multiple copies of the target sequence these multiple copies can then be detected to give positive test result if target sequence is present copies are made and negative test result is obtained multiple agents can be tested for simultaneously using pcr pcr can detect much lower levels than biological test strips and it is relatively easy to expand the list of agents for which to test however this test only works for agents which have genetic material for example pcr will detect bacteria such as the one that causes anthrax but it will not detect chemical agents nor biological toxins such as botulinum toxin mass spectroscopy mass spectroscopy is an advanced technology that is thought to be the gold standard for ch emical detection it breaks down samples into their constitutive parts then determin the mass of each piece the instrumenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31280crs11 9for more information about mail irradiation see crs report rs21184 irradiated mail by frank gottron httpwwwcongressgoverprspdfrs21184pdf 10ibidproduces complicated graph or spectra th at shows the masses of all of its parts this spectra is unique for each agent che mical agents have relatively simple spectra and are easily identified by this method in theory this method will work equally well on biological agents however because biological agents have many more constituent parts they produce much more complicated patterns this makes discriminating between dangerous bacteria and harmless related organism very difficult although this technology may curre ntly exist it is unlikely be in system that could be adapted quickly for the usps to use as this technology develops it may become the method of choice for these types of applications but some experts feel that this is at least few years away intervention and sanitization intervention procedures are used to ne utralize potential mail contaminants for mail destined for high risk targets as described above this group currently consists of all federal government offices in the washington dc metropolitan area zip codes 2020020599 after eval uating various forms of mail sanitization including gaseous and radiation methods the usps chose electron beam irradiation9 electron beam or ebeam is essentially very powerful verison of the electron gun found in the cathode ray tubes of tele visions and computer monito rs it is commonly used method to sterilize medical supplies incl uding baby bottle nipples and bandages the usps is leaving open the option of expanding mail irradiation to include all noncommercial ma il however in light of the problems generated by the current limited use10 this appears increasingly unlikely recipients have complained of various adverse health reactions to the irradiated mail as well as damage to mail contents the usps claims that lowering the radiation dose has solved many of these problems the emergency plan predicts that systemwide irradiation program would require 1225 billion in capital costs table 3 some experts suggest that annual operating costs for this system could run as much as 1 billion if implemented the usps would likely seek an appropriation for the capital costs while relying on rate payers for the operating costs this plan could be implemented as early as fy2005 decontamination these procedures differ from intervention pr ocedures in that they would be used following the identification of contamin ation event rather than prophylactically this covers treatment of contaminated mail and facilities tainted mail was treated using ebeam irradiation the usps evaluated several methods to treat tainted equipment and facilities before deciding on chlorine dioxide this is the samehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31280crs12 technology used on the hart senate ffice building the 80 million required for decontamination came from both the 175 million white house emergency response funds table 1 and from the 500 llion supplemental appropriation table 2 investigation these procedures are designed to help the usps investigate successful mail based terrorist attacks the technolog ies under considerati on are based on letter image capture and analysis these improvements are predicted to cost 3555 million in fy2004 and 1110 in fy2005 chart 3 image capture the usps is currently in the process of upgrading their ability to digitally capture an image of every mailpiece as it is sorted current capabilities only allow portion of the address side to be captured deployment of the wide field of view image camera will allow the entire side to be imaged the usps considers this to be crucial for the ability to reliably analyze the images currently the images of each envelope are deleted immediately after being used for sorting purposes the emergency plan calls for 24 million in fy2004 to increase storage capabilities and complete deployment of the new cameras so that images can be stored for 30 days chart 3 image analysis the usps also plans to implement programs that could profile the images of mailpieces in realtime some of th is analysis could redirect mail that met specific suspicious criteria for special handling it may also be possible to analyze handwritten addresse s to search for and isolate mailpieces currently in the system that satisfy specific criteria for example letters that share distinctive handwriting such as that found on the anthra x related mailings mig ht be able to be matched automatically and redirected for special handling the usps predicts these projects will cost 112 million and be available in fy2004 mailpiece tracking the emergency plan calls for an expansion of the usps current mail tracking capabilities by linking unique identification barcodes to each envelope ima ge this would allow investigators to trace the exact path through the system of any contaminated mail this is expected to cost 210 million and be implemented in fy2004 chart 3 positive product tracking this initiative would result in an increased ability to track mail this system would code all products with specific identifier that would be traceable to specific retail transaction and video image of the patron this includes any mail dropped off at retail outlet and any products bought such as stamps or envelopes furthermore all usps products could be encoded to allow investigators to determine the location of its sale for example the kiosk at which specific stamp was purchased this info rmation could be useful even without linked video image of the pa tron that would be obtained if the transaction took place in post office the usps sees this as complementing and extending the abilities discussed under retail outlet modifications the usps predicts that these modifications would cost 95 million in fy2004 and 110 million in fy2005 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31280crs13 critics say this initiative raises privacy questions and could result in serious public relations difficulties for the usps they argue that this will cost much more that projected capital costs because of the revenue lost due to decreased patronage by concerned customers conclusions the emergency preparedness plan outlines series of steps that the usps has taken and is planning to take to decrease the threat of biological terrorism through the mail some of the steps such as the change to hepa filtered vacuums are noncontroversial and easily imple mented other steps such as threat detectors are expensive and fraught with technical cha llenges however the plan also includes some expensive and very cont roversial steps such as the videotaping and tracking of all retail transactions and the i rradiation of all noncommercial mail the usps stresses that this plan is dynamic and will most likely change as new technologies become availabl however one thing th at policymakers will have to decide is how much of these plans should be paid by taxpayers rather than ratepayers if fully implemented the usps would seek up to 41 billion in add itional appropriations for fy2003 through fy2006 critics who feel that the usps was financially doomed before th anthrax attacks argue that funding these plans amounts to large waste of taxpayers money other less severe critics suggest that the cost of these plans should be borne entirely by the postal consumer who will benefit from the changes however the postmaster ge neral counters that these are actually costs associated with homeland security and shoul d be funded by taxpayers furthermore passing on these high costs directly to ra tepayers may hasten the financial collapse of the postal service which is already on the comptroller generals high risk list
