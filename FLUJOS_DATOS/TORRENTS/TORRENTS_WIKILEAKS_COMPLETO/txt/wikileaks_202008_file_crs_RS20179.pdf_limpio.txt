review process omb staff review these initial budget requests and the omb director makes the final decisions federal agencies may appeal the omb directors decisions directly to the president even at this stage the involvement of the president to resolve these appeals has varied while some presidents have taken direct role in deciding appeals others have delegated appeal decisions to presidential
