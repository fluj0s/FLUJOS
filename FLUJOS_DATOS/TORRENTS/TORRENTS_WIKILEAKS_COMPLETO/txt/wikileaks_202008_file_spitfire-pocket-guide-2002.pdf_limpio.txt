has an outstanding queued request only one request at time may be queued from user this user already has request queued and thus the current request is being canceled three things may have occurred one you have already sent service set up that was queued only one service of any kind on 25 khz dama so you must teardown and then set up the new service two the control station believes you have service pending teardown and try again if this does not work teardown out ofservice send status b then set up the service again third you just received busy signal from the distant end try again later or page the terminal address so they know you are trying to contact them this one doesnt make sense but has happened on occasion 73 requesting party is not authorized to activate all call the current

anytime you teardown the service before it is provided after sending ser vice set up usually queued action required 76 queued call canceled service queue timeout timer expired the previously queued

just recei ved busy signal again try again later 79 queued call canceled connection is longer possible the controller has deleted request from queue either at the request of the controller opera tor

controller for this guard all the jmini database has the net guard address marked wrong need to contact the nctams to correct this or you asked for private guard and the ncs has not or is not setting

the service request you need to try and set up the service again later if making conference call page the other terminals if network call one else is up but your terminal 91 connection would cause

work contact the nctams the jmini mistakenly has you already in service information request codes 50 92 not all requested parties could be connected at least one but not all of the requested parties could be connected this request is honored connecting all available parties you set up conference call and not all received the service assigned message call all the stations and find out who isnt there that you called prior to making conference call it is highly suggested you page everyone to ensure they are up before you make the call this should ensure you do not receive this message howeve r if you do the terminal that did not receive the message needs to send status b message maybe use data transfer to assist only way to get any missed terminals into the service is to all teardown then one terminal set up the service again 93 other link test in progress only one link test at time can be conducted on channel and another user terminal is conducting one at this time wait couple minutes
