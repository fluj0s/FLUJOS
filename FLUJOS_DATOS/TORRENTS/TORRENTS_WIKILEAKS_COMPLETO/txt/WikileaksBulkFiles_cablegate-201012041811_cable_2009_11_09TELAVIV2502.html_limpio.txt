iran will use the engagement process as an opportunity to continue its pursuit of nuclear weapon assistant secretary for political military affairs andrew shapiro stressed that engagement with tehran was not open ended the united states is preparing sanctions in the event engagement does not prove successful goi interlocutors continued to express concerns regarding us support of the lebanese armed forces laf us participants reiterated us support of the laf as counterweight to hizballah as shapiro noted nea with pm participation and support plans to brief the goi on the us policy regarding

officials expressed frustration over the goldstone report us officials advocated sharing lessons learned regarding confronting terrorists in civilianpopulated areas goi officials noted improved

israel and palestinian affairs bureau of near eastern affairs col richard burgess defense attache us embassy tel aviv robert maggi pm coordinator for counter piracy kevin maloney licensing director pmdtcl plenary 3 s mod director general pinchas buchris began the plenary stating this was perhaps the most important jpmg to date he pointed to the threat of nuclear iran and expressed hope that us leadership will find way to stop iran otherwise nucleararmed iran will impact the stability of the world buchris said as shapiro described this 40th jpmg as key forum and the primary mechanism in the politicalmilitary dialogue between the united states and israel he said the united states wants to reenergize the jpmg with the goal to bring back strategic elements into the discussion as shapiro highlighted the importance of mutual understanding and transparent dialogue iran 4 s mod politicalmilitary director amos gilad presented strategic overview he began with iran reciting president obamas statement made during visit to israel prior to becoming president that the united states would not tolerate nuclear iran gilad said israel concurs and described current dialogue with iran as the most sensitive stage and irans last chance he said iran remains determined to tel aviv 00002502 002 of 004 reach the nuclear option which he described as intolerable he quoted former president and ahmadinejad opponent rafsanjani as saying iran only needs one bomb for israel implying that iran will continue to threaten israel regardless of its leadership 5 s as shapiro noted that the united states shares israels concerns that iran is pursuing nuclear weapons program he said that the united states is beginning with engagement but at the same time is preparing tougher measures should engagement fail as shapiro stressed that engagement was not open ended the united states needs to see concrete steps and tangible results from the p5 1 talks he noted concerns over the qom facility if iran does not respond to engagement then the united states will move toward stronger steps such as sanctions dasd kahl reiterated that it is not our intention to allow iran to run out the clock and noted that engagement also serves to build international consensus on sanctions mfa deputy director for strategic affairs alon bar argued that the united states must present clearer message to the europeans on what is expected of them regarding sanctions 6 s representative from mossad said tehran understands that by reacting positively to engagement iran can continue to play for time and avoid sanctions while pursuing its strategic objective to obtain military nuclear capability from mossads perspective there is reason to believe iran will do anything but use negotiations to stall for time so that by 20102011 iran will have the technological capability to build nuclear weapon essentially reducing the question of weaponizing to political decision mossad said irans main crisis is in the political sphere the current regime is weaker than prior to the elections but does not face significant risk as its security apparatus remains loyal while the opposition lacks charismatic leader the goal of the regime therefore is to calm down the domestic political environment khamenei realizes the frustration demonstrated following the elections has not disappeared bg smith asked if khameneis death might change the political landscape mossad noted information to suggest change in khameneis health while those surrounding him appear more loyal than ever 7 s mossad believes iran wants to become regional hegemon and is dictating its agenda by using hamas and hizballah as force multipliers in that respect iran is very creative in finding ways to transfer weapons systems to its proxies mossad said tehran also understands the effort to split syria from irans influence and is working hard to deepen its relationship with syria as result dasd kahl argued that iran is weaker regionally today than in recent years he noted progress in iraq the results of the recent lebanese elections and outreach to syria as signs of weaker iran dasd kahl also noted increased us credibility in the muslim world while the crackdown following the iranian elections exposed the current regime as brutal to the region and in europe hizballahlebanonsyria 8 s gilad addressed threats posed by hizballahstan and hamastan noting that hizballahhamassyriairan cooperation has strengthened he noted that rockets from lebanon can now cover the entire territory of israel while ballistic missiles although not new remain israels most serious threat with adversaries having the capability to target israeli citizens and major cities idf j5 col shimon arad noted four main trends in lebanon 1 internal political deadlock since the elections 2 hizballahs growing military capabilities 3 lebanon as volatile military arena and 4 lebanons susceptibility to outside influences including syria iran and saudi arabia he recommended improved usisrael coordination and called for an exchange of views arad also recommended creating lebanese armed forces laf deconfliction measures demanding improved laf performance and exerting greater pressure on syria and smuggling finally he called for sanctions on the iranian republican guard corps irgc trilateral meetings with the lebanese and unifil to deter hizballah and bolstering unifil by extending gen grazianos tour for an additional six months 9 s as shapiro acknowledged the gois desire for specifics regarding us policy on lebanon and hoped to invite goi representatives to washington in the near future for full brief led by nea with pm participation and support he cited the need to provide an alternative to hizballah which explains us goals to strengthen the laf as counterweight dasd kahl argued that any laf cooperation tel aviv 00002502 003 of 004 with hizballah is pragmatic given the lafs current weakness he noted that us assistance has been temporarily put on hold since there is still lebanese government kahl also argued that prospects for better relations with damascus depend on syrian desires for better relations with the united states and the return of the golan heights arad argued that more must be done to weaken radicals and cease smuggling gilad said the goi cannot envision government in lebanon without hizballah and said the laf will come to the defense of hizballah if attacked by israel thus strengthened laf hurts israel qme 10 s turning to us regional arms transfers gilad suggested qualitative military edge qme as codename for potential threats against israel israel currently enjoys peace with regimes in egypt jordan saudi arabia and the united arab emirates but the future is uncertain and each of these regimes faces the potential for change he argued us weapons the best in the world level the playing field by reducing the need for training and could ultimately aid future enemy of israel gilad said as shapiro stressed the importance of transparency while there may be differences between israel and the united states in terms of regional assessment the key is to ensure that there are surprises he said peace process 11 s gilad described the middle east peace process as pillar of israeli security he quoted pm netanyahu and president peres that israel remains sincerely committed to peace gilad noted however that the relaunching of negotiations is complicated by the split in palestinian leadership he said weak and corrupt pa had lost gaza despite israeli warnings gilad said 2010 will prove pivotal with palestinian elections looming and egyptian mediation efforts to broker reconciliation between hamas and the pa having failed that said he noted that israelipa security and economic cooperation in the west bank continues to improve as jenin and nablus flourish and described palestinian security forces as the good guys neaipa director tom goldberger said special envoy sen mitchell continues his mission and noted that egyptian reconciliation efforts were meant to strengthen the pa not weaken it goldstone report 12 s gilad addressed israels immediate neighbors within the context of the goldstone report he said israel has checked all the details of the report and have concluded that the reports accusations are baseless buchris said the report sets bad precedent for countries trying to protect its citizens from terrorists he noted 300000 phone calls from the idf to houses in gaza ahead of strikes in the effort to prevent civilian casualties other country has taken such steps buchris argued as shapiro highlighted strong us opposition to the reports referral to the security council noting the reports biased mandate 13 s gilad said israel only entered gaza after hamas violated the ceasefire or tahdiya which many israelis felt was humiliating and left defense minister barak open to criticism gilad characterized operation cast lead as success that accounted for humanitarian issues the idf showed restraint in the operation because israel did not want to reoccupy gaza dasd kahl advocated sharing perspectives and lessons learned on strategic communication to more effectively confront terrorists in civilianpopulated areas nsc director for israel and palestinian affairs prem kumar noted continued unsc interest in the goldstone report and asked israel to inform the united states on any additional efforts or investigations the goi was taking to help deflect any further damage from the report egyptcountersmuggling 14 s gilad said israel was frustrated by its arab neighbors including specifically egypt for supporting the goldstone report which complicates the peace process israel continues to benefit from good security cooperation with jordan he said gilad argued that egypt could stop smuggling into gaza completely and questioned whether egypt should be judged by its efforts or results gilad tel aviv 00002502 004 of 004 stressed the latter and argued egypt can do more on countersmuggling finally he noted israeli concerns that egypt continues to prepare for potential future military confrontation with israel while egyptian military officers visit israel 15 s as shapiro outlined us military assistance to strengthen egyptian border security counterterrorism peacekeeping and civil defense efforts he said the united states is working with egypt to improve regional security efforts such as countersmuggling regarding the gulf states and saudi arabia as shapiro stressed efforts to improve energy security and counterterrorism while bolstering the capabilities of the gulf cooperation council gcc in the face of the iranian threat finally he noted us withdrawal from the anatolian eagle exercise following the turkish decision to suspend the idfs participation as shapiro said the united states has been delivering the message that turkey must improve its relationship with israel 16 s pm counterpiracy coordinator maggi briefed on the counter smuggling technical discussion meeting septel he cited the importance of working with israels neighbors including especially egypt and turkey to prevent iranian weapons from entering gaza maggi said more pressure should be applied in the eu and to gain more latitude and possibly further action from the eu he said tracking cash flows and increasing prosecutions and incarcerations were important with the ultimate goal of increasing cooperation and momentum goldberger said egypt sees hamas as national security threat and added that egypt had closed 200 tunnels since the beginning of 2009 17 s goldberger noted egyptian domestic political sensitivities and questioned whether more commercial and humanitarian goods could be allowed through the gaza border crossings gilad strongly stated that there were limits on commercial goods through the border crossings goldberger asked about construction materiel like cement gilad said the goi would not allow hamas to build bunkers goods such as cement or iron would not be allowed because of their military applications he also argued that smuggling is lucrative business for all involved including the egyptian government and said the best way to stop the smuggling was to increase arrests and incarcerations goldberger mentioned us economic and development assistance efforts in sinai he noted that most requests to third countries to deny arms transfer overflights are based on israeli intelligence additional informationintelligence from the goi would ensure greater cooperation bar raised prosecuting shipping companies complicit in arms transfers to gaza as shapiro said he would take that back to washington for further consideration iraqyemen 18 s on iraq dasd kahl noted there are currently 125000 us soldiers in iraq which will be reduced to 50000 soldiers by september 1 2010 with complete us troop withdrawal by the end of 2011 he noted the us goal of establishing longterm strategic relationship with sovereign stable and selfreliant iraq as shapiro and dasd kahl briefed the goi on us efforts to assist the iraqi military to complete its counterinsurgency force transition the military to force that can defend its borders and align the iraqi military more closely to the united states 19 s dasd kahl pointed to the growing threat qaida houthi insurgency and southern secessionists in yemen he said the united states is attempting to prevent yemen from heading toward an afghanistantype scenario with general lawlessness and increased ungoverned spaces bg smith noted that qaida in the islamic maghreb aqim continues to fester in north and subsaharan africa he said egypt is actively involved in countering aqim with 3800 soldiers in sudan this should be encouraged and expanded 20 u as shapiro has cleared on this cable cunningham
