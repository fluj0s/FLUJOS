to apply for trade adjustment assistance taa under separate programs operated through the departments of labor dol and commerce doc respectively the taa programs provide extended unemployment benefits and tr aining support for workers and technical assistance to firms that are adversely affected by federal policies that reduce barriers to foreign trade many economists prefer taa over trade restri ctive remedies because it directs assistance to those most affected and does so without distorting prices lthough some critics have questioned the need for this assi stance andor its effectiveness1 legislative authority for taa for worker s and firms expired at the end of fy2001 as the 107th congress considered legislation to extend it2 taa bill approved by the senate finance committee in late 2001 incl uded new taa program specifically for producers of agricultural commodities this program was incorporated into more wide ranging senate trade bill and was retained by housesenate conferees in july 2002 the final conference version of the trade bill with the agriculture taa was cleared by congress and is expected to be signed by the president see congressional

data and dol analysis from report on trade adjustment assistance for agricultural commodity producers october 26 2000 to the house ways and means committee the report was required by section 408 of the trade and development act of 2000 pl 106200 5 source storey report on trade adjustment assistance for agricultural commodity producers current taa programs 3 taa programs were first authorized in 1962 however title ii of the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 as amended provides the mo st recent legislative foundation for three separate programs they are taa for workers the north american free trade agreement transitional adjustment assistance program naftataap also for workers and taa for firms taa for workers group of unemployed workers can seek assistance under either taa or naftataap by petitioning the us department of labor dol and proving that competition from foreign imports contributed importantly to their employers loss of business under naftataap eligibility also can be established by showing that the employer relocated the jobs to mexico or canada under both programs each worker must establish individual elig ibility by qualifying for state unemployment compensation uc benefits working for the affected firm in at least 26 of the 52 weeks before layoff and receiving at least 30 per w eek from the firm total federal cost of the two programs is an estimated 416 million in fy2002 once eligible worker is entitled to weekly cash benefits ie trade readjustment allowances equivalent to the states uc benefits payable after the state uc payments have been exhausted for up to an additi onal 52 weeks up to 104 weeks of required training for new job dol can waive t aa training under certain conditions and allowances of 800 for outoftown job search and 800 for relocation to take new job agricultural worker assistance relatively few petitions for agricultural worker assistance have been filed or approve d since the start of the current taa program in 1974 and naftataap in 1994 according to dol for example from fy1994 to fy2000 only 35 certifications were in agricu lture covering an estimated 5135 workers of these 2181 were employees of florid vegetable firms 1334 from single fresh tomato packing company alone florida ve getable producers filed numerous claims after 1994 in reaction to increased mexican impor ts an outgrowth dol asserts of the mexican peso devaluation ie not nafta itself4 other certified workers came from various flower and nursery beef table gr ape mushroom apple poultry and fresh vegetable companies in num ber of different states as noted these workers primarily are paid employees in established firms farmers and ranchers typically cannot qualify for either of the worker programs for number of reasons5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21182crs3 6 report on trade adjustment assistance for agricultural commodity producers 7 section 408 of the trade and development ac t of 2000 pl 106200 which resulted in the above cited reportfarmers and ranchers mainly are selfemployed and therefore rarely eligible for unemployment benefits the taa law emphasizes training fo r new demand occ upation and tries to condition income payments on such training agricultural producers are less likely than other workers to want to be retrained for new occupation especially if they are still earning income from other crops or from nonfarm income the 1974 trade act ties eligibility to inc reases of imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by such workers firm agricultural firms are explicitly covered but only if they produce articles farmworkers as opposed to farm ow ners and operators may qualify for unemployment benefits but lowpaid seasonal work may keep them below the earnings and work history thresholds under state uc programs taa for firms compared with worker taa the program for firms is small with direct appropriations ranging between 8 million and 13 million per year the program provides technical assistance via 12 regi onal trade adjustment assistance centers primarily to individual ma nufacturing and producing busin esses that can document decreases in jobs and sales or production due to increased imports of like or s imilar goods direct financial assistance eg grants loans was discontinued in 1986 technical assistance generally is provided th rough private contractors and emphasizes the development of new or impr oved products production effici ency improvements better marketing and other strategies to regain competitiveness agricultural firm

action in the 106th congress the senate had included in trade bill hr 434 expanding us trade benefits to africa latin america and the caribbean new taa program for farmers the program sponsored by senato rs grassley and conra d was deleted from the final bill in conference conferees instead inserted requirement that dol in consultation with doc and the us department of agriculture usda submit report to congress examining applicability of the current taa programs to agricultural commodity producers and maki ng recommendations to impr ove their operation for such producers or to establish new program for them7 in the 107th congress senator conrad in troduced on june 26 2001 the trade adjustment assistance for farmers act s 1100 to add new chapter to title ii of the trade act of 1974

27 nd the senate did so on august 1 2002 program description under the new program group of agricu ltural producers can petition the secretary of agriculture to be certified as eligible for taa the secretary then has 40 days to determine whether the national average price fo r the affected commodity or class of goods from that commodity for the most recent marketing year was less than 80 of the average price for the prior 5 years and impor ts of articles like or directly competitive with the commodity in question contributed importantly to the price decline the bill defines this as cause which is important but not necessarily more important than any other cause8 if determination were so made each member of the eligible group would have 90 days to apply to the secretary for cash payment equal to onehalf of the difference between the most recent years national average price and 80 of the preceding 5 marketing years times his or her production for the year an individual commodity producers benefits under the program ar limited to 10000 in any 12month period and all claims are to be decreased proportionately if nece ssary to ensure that the total national cost of the program does not exceed the annua l funding level whic h the legislation sets at 90 million for each fiscal year 2003 through 2007 an applicants net farm income as determined by usda for the most recent year must be less than his or her net farm income for the latest year in which adjustment assistance was received those with aver age adjusted gross income above 25 million per year are ineligible if less than 75 of that income is from farming ranching or forestry the applicant also must certify that he or she has met with an extension service agent to obtain information and technical assistance on how to adjust to import competition including improving competitiv eness in producing and marketing the importaffected commodity and possibly shiftin g to an alternative commodity payment recipients cannot receive cash benefits under any other taa pr ogram however they arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21182crs5 permitted but not required as are other workers to use other job training and related employment services offered through the taa programs policy considerations the labor department report on taa for agriculture observed that the existing programs for workers emphasize retraining thos who have lost their jobs so that they can find other occupations any modifications to these dol pr ograms such as to provide financial assistance to workers to remain in their current ccupations runs counter to the emphasis of these important readjustment programs the commerce taa program for firms provides opportunities for agriculture commodity pr oducers who have been injured by lost sales and reduced th number of their employees due to increased imports to receive limited technical assistance on cost shared basis that will help them regain their economic competitiveness however th program has funding limitations and authority to provide any direct financial assistance in the form of loans loan guarantees or income supplements to trade injured firms if lawmakers consider legislation to assist agricultural producers and workers affected adversely by imports it should be acted separately and apart from the current programs the report conclude s the newlyapproved pr ogram is separate one in the report on its taa bill s 1209 s rept 107134 the senate finance committee said it recognizes that the dislocations that can be suffered by farmers and ranchers when imports surge as result of the liberalization of agricultural trade are as economically devastating as those experienced by manufacturing workers who lose their jobs when their plant relocates abroad yet when rising imports result in collapse of commodity prices individual farmers and ra nchers do not become unemployed in the same way as other workers and therefore ca nnot take advantage of the existing taa program the committee report cited testimony by the north dakota farmers union at july 21 2001 hearing when agricultural trade agreements fail to provide for fair competition or allow adjustments to offset the impact of import surges farmers ranchers and fishermen are the ones who suffer due to their inability to influence or rapidly adjust to changed market conditions taa prog ram for farmers would be fair and logical means for us agriculture to better cope nd adjust to the effects of import competition it also could be argued that the commodities most likely to be affected by import surges and to qualify for the new program are those that receive few subsidies relative to other crops for example since the united states entered into nafta some fruit and vegetable growers particularly in florida contend that they have been economically harmed by stiff mexican competition livesto ck producers also have raised concerns bout the price impacts of mexican and canadian imports these types of producers are not generally eligible for the type s and level of direct paymen ts and price support offered to those who grow row crops like wh eat corn cotton soybeans and rice fundamental difference in the new farmer taa is that it ties payments to the price effects of an imported commodity current taa eligibility for workers on the other hand is based on loss of job tying subsid ies to price and produc tion either current or past has long been key feature of the traditional usda farm s upport programs andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21182crs6 9 for background see crs report rs20848 farm commodity programs short primer and crs report rl31195 the 2002 farm bill overview and status 10 for details on these and others see crs report rl31296 trade remedies and agriculture 11 see crs report 97817 agriculture and fast track or trade promotion authority congress has passed and the president signed on may 13 2002 omnibus farm legislation hr 2646 pl 107171 that is estimated to provide 99 billion in commodity price and income support over 6 years fy2002fy2007 this total includes 38 billion in new budget authority above ba seline estimates ie what the programs would have cost if they had been reauthorized without changes9 some are critical of establishing yet another agricultural subsidy program even one with relatively lower costs moreover agricultural producers already ca n and do seek relief through variety of established trade remedy laws when they believe they have been injured by imports the major avenues are safeguard investig ations under the trade act of 1974 which can lead to the imposition of temporary duties quotas or other restrictions on imports and antidumping and countervailin g duty investigations under the tariff act of 1930 which also can lead to importconstraining duties on agricultural goods10 in the labor department report usda noted that low commodity prices are caused by variety of factors including large u s and world commodity supplies and reduced demand in key consuming count ries particularly following recent financial problems around the world which reduced us agricu ltural exports increased us imports while significant for some produc ts have generally not been major factor in explaining the decline in us farm prices for major agricultural commodities usda said it had examined imports as share of us consumption for various products and also data compar ing the ratio of changes in imports to changes in domestic production this research does not support th argument that imports are the primary cause of low prices usda concluded the doldrafted report used these observations to conclude that taatype programs with their linkage to increased imports would not help address low prices faced by agricultural commodity producers number of lawmakers believe that the expanded taa package including the new program for farmers was essen tial to passage of tpa they argue that tpa would have lacked enough support for final passage wit hout the taa provisions aimed at cushioning any potentially negative impacts from imports that future trade agreements negotiated under tpa procedures might bring although other lawmakers have disagreed with this assessment11
