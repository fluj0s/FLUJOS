of government information technology res ources as such egovernment can be considered process or means to an end rather than an end in and of itself government is still in the earliest stages of development and promises to evolve with advances in technology and increased acceptance and trust in electronic communications1 the dynamic nature of eg overnment and its broad sectoral applications

services while perceptions of egovernment va ry widely some common themes can be identified that capture its evolutionary nature egovernment involves using informat ion technology and especially the

state and local governments 24 hours day seven days week some observers of egovernment initiatives suggest service delivery could become more convenient dependable and less costly the gartner group describes egovernment as the continuous optimiz ation of service delivery constituency participation and governance by transforming internal and external relationships through technology the internet and new media2 mark forman associate director for info rmation technology and egovernment at the office of management and budget omb has defined egovernment as the use of internet technology and protocols to transform agency effectiveness efficiency and service quality3 egovernment is itself process still in the early stages of development initial forays into egovernment initiatives have focused mostly on providing enhanced access to information and basic services although the full transformative effects of egovernment remain largely unrealized at this time the rapid growth in interest and resources dedicated to egovernment initiatives may contribute to swifter changes implications for federalism one area where the implications for implementing egovernment initiatives may have significant effect relates to the concerns of federalism the constitution established federal system of governan ce granting certain powers to the national government while reserving others to th states and the people throughout the history of the country the nature of amer ican federalism has volved reflecting the political economic and social changes that have occurred4 however one of the hallmarks of federal system of governance is the emphasis on vertical divisions of power in contrast egovernment initia tives utilize information technologies that emphasize horizontal or networked m odel of communicati on and interaction while egovernment is designed in pa rt to break down the barriers separating different agencies it could also have similar effect on the boundaries of federal governance in light of the divergent properties of federalism and eg overnment the advent of egovernment has the potential to effect significantly the power relationship between the national and state governments an example includes initiatives to create onestopshopping web sites to obtain government services and information such as the firstgov site in addition to its original role of providing access to all federal government web site s firstgov has added links to most state web sites ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31057crs3 5 william matthews firstgov to add state links federal computer week 21 may 2001 p 13well5 one of the goals of these types of sites is to create an experience that attenuates the agencycentric approach to providing services although this usually refers to agencies at the same level of government it could also include services that are provided through some form of nationa l state andor local cooperation such as welfare transportation or w enforcement activities ho wever these same efforts to improve the delivery of government services could also diffuse political responsibility and credit making it less cl ear from where the funding and direction are originating the multidimensional nature of egovernment issues discussed in greater detail below the dvent of egovernment raises number of issues it is important to stress at this point the multidimensional nature of those issues on the one hand egovernment provides new opport unities to enhance governance which can include improved efficiency new services increased citizen participation and an enhanced national information in frastructure on the other hand egovernment also presents ne w challenges to governance including information security privacy disparities in computer access and management and funding requirements toge ther all of these issues are complicated by their combined intra and intergovernmental na ture they can crosscut both the various sectors and stages of egove rnment development howeve r they also share number of recurring themes often associated w ith previous less tec hnologicallydependent approaches to improving government such as jurisdictional authority procedures for the appropriate handling of information building and ma intaining infrastructures providing services and citizens rights the multidimensional nature of government suggests that there are quick fixes for the concerns raised but rather that issues will need to be addressed with careful atte ntion to context and precedent sectors of egovernment although egovernment encompasses wide range of activities and actors three distinct sectors can be identified thes include governmenttogovernment g2g governmenttobusiness g2b and governmenttocitizen g2c some observers also identify fourth sector government toemployee g2e however since g2e operations are intraagency activities they can be considered subset of the g2g sector and are not addressed separately in this

g2g in many respects the g2g sector repr esents the backbone of egovernment some observers suggest that governments federal state local must enhance and update their own internal systems and proce dures before electroni c transactions with citizens and businesse s can be successful6 g2g egovernment involves sharing data and conducting electronic exchanges between governmental actors this involves both intra and interagency exchanges at the federal level as well as exchanges between the federal st ate and local levels motivating forces behind the g2g sector there are number of forces motivating g2g egovernment initiatives on of these involves legislation there are variety of laws and regulations that are contributing to the implementation of egovernment initiatives7 for example the paperwork reduction act pra reduces the information collection and reporting requirement s of the federal government while also promoting the coor dination of governmentwide information management activities8 the computer security act requires federal agencies to develop information security plans and tasks the national institute for standards and technology nist with the responsibility to

force spurring g2g initiatives is the interest in improved efficiency one of the expected benefits of informa tion technology investment solutions often cited by proponents is cost sa vings achieved by increasing the speed of transactions reducing the number of personnel necessary to complete task and improving the consistency of outcomes12 as attention to efforts to c ontain the growth of the federal budget has heightened so s interest in using information technology solutions to streamline procedures and trim costs related to this interest in efficiency third driving force is the growing attention being paid to improving the mana gement of federal government information technology and public resources efforts to identify and apply best practices from other areas of the public and private sect ors have helped fuel the development of federal egovernment initiatives state and local governments are often perceived as models for egovernment initiatives due to their role in delivering services to citizens13 state and local governments are also the targets of many g2g efforts due to their relative proximity geographically and politically to citizens growing reliance on information technology generally and the need to update and invest in long term information technology projects such as the overhaul of the federal aviation administration faa and the internal revenue service irs systems have emphasized the importance of g ood information technology management practices to help ensure the success of these projects as part of reexamining information technology management strate gies policymakers have considered many approaches to restructuring government in this context egovernment is often proposed as solution examples of g2g initiatives one example of g2g egovernment initiative is the northeast gang informati on system negis negis is sponsored by the department of justice and serves as shared resource for street gang information for states in the

contractor past performance system maintained by the national institutes of health nih started in december 1996 this online database contains past performance scorecards of government contractors as rated by contractproject officers it is designed to help agencies determine the suitability of potential contractors on the basis of criteria such as the quality of product or service cost control timeline ss of performance and business practices thirteen agencies contribute to the databa including the environmental protection agency epa the department of commerce and the general services administration gsa governmenttob usiness g2b governmenttobusiness g2b initiatives receive significant amount of attention in part because of the high thusiasm of the business sector and the potential for reducing costs through impr oved procurement practices and increased competition14 the g2b sector includes both the sale of surplus government goods to the public as well as the procurement of goods and services although not all are directly dependent on the use of info rmation technology several different procurement methods are used in relation to the g2b sector performancebased contracting is method in which the payment made to the contractor is based on the actual goals and outcomes of the job shareinsavings contracts are those in which the contractor pays for the upfront costs of project such as the installation of new computer system and receives payment pa ssed on the savings generated by switching from the previous system 15 reverse auctions on the other hand are reliant on the use of information technology and coul d become frequently used method for purchasing products that are standardized and easily evaluated for quality such as offtheshelf technology components or offi ce supplies conducted over the internet reverse auction entails companies openly bidding against each other in real time to win government contract the purpose of reverse auctions is to drive prices down to market levels due to the emphasis on price reverse auctions are bestsuited in cases where quality and expected performance are clear and easily assessed motivating forces behind the g2b sector there are two primary forces driving the g2b sector the first is the business community in many industries the use of electronic means to carry out various activities such as procurement sales and hiring is commonplace for example the auto i ndustry created an electronic business exchange called covisint in fall 2000 covisint provides an online environment for automakers and parts suppliers to buy and sell goods sharehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31057crs7 16 the covisint web site may be found at http wwwcovi sintcom 17 senator fred thompson committee on governmental

new products16 in addition the software industry is producing an evergrowing number of products focused on moving routine business activities online many companies would like to extend the cost savings realized in their businesstobusiness b2b transactions to their business with federal state and local governments b2g the second primary force motivating intere st in the g2b sector is the growing demand by policymakers for cost cutting and more efficient procurement similar to the interest in efficiency that is helping propel g2g initiatives many g2b initiatives are promoted on their potential to streamline and improve the consistency of personnelintensive tasks such as processing license renewals or employee benefit changes however there is some disa greement over whether these efforts should help centralize or decentralize procuremen t by agencies until the passage of the clingercohen act in 1996 procurement d ecisions for information technology products and services were generally centralized with th general services administration gsa performing signif icant role among its provisions the clingercohen act decentralized some of th decisions back to the agencies some observers suggest that decentralized proc urement allows agencies greater control over their own projects and reduces the amount of time between when product is ordered and when it is delivered17 in contrast other obs ervers promote centralized procurement on the basis that it will lower costs by aggregating the purchases of similar products by multiple agencies and enhance accountability by limiting the number of people authorized to enter into purchase agreements18 examples of g2b initiatives one example of g2b initiative is gsa auctions19 gsa auctions is an online auction web site in which gsa sells federal surplus property to the highest bidders items sold include everything from hand tools and furniture to industrial machiner and vehicles perhaps one of the more wellknown items was the auction of fi ftyyearold coast guard cutter the tamaroa which appeared in the movie perfect storm second example of g2b initiative is buyersgov business and auction exchange administered by the gsa fede ral technology service fts the buyersgov site facilitates the purch ase of information technology pr oducts by federal government agencies through the use of re verse auctions and

gsa is fedbizopps21 fedbizopps is web site designed to serv as central location for agencies to post procurement notices such as requestforpur chase rfp notices the goal of the site is to create standardized easytoaccess point of contact for businesses which may want to bid on government contract instead of having to search through the variety of agencyspecifi c methods of advertisin g contracting opportunities22 similar site called dodbusopps was also established specifically for the department of defense23 governmenttoc itizen g2c the third egovernment sector is gove rnmenttocitizen g2c g2c initiatives are designed to facilitate citizen interaction with government which is what some observers perceive to be the primary goal of egovernment these initiatives attempt to make transactions such as renewing li censes and certifications paying taxes and applying for benefits less time consuming and easier to carry out g2c initiatives also often strive to enhance access to public information through the use of dissemination tools such as web sites and or kiosks another feature of many g2c initiatives is the effort to attenuate the agencycentric and at times processladen nature of some government functions some egovern ment advocates suggest that one of the goals of implementing these in itiatives should be to create onestop shopping site where citizens can carry out variety of ta sks especially those that involve multiple agencies without requiring the citizen to initiate contacts with each agency individually24 potential outgrowth of g2c initiatives is that they may facilitate citizentocitizen interacti on and increase citizen participation in government by creating more opportuni ties that overcome possible time and geographic barriers thereby connecting citizens who may not ordinarily come into contact with one another motivating forces behind the g2c sector interest in g2c initiatives is driven by combination of several fact ors one is citizen demand especially by younger citizens and those accustomed to us ing electronic transac tions in other areas of their lives eg banking25 some observers expect the citizen demand for government to increase significantly over the next ten years as the youth who are now growing up with personal computers and the internet as routine presence inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31057crs9 26 survey of government and the internet digital democracy the economist 24 june 2000 p 31 27 john m strate charles j parrish charles d elder and coit ford life

the relatively low political activity of young adults suggest this uptic k in citizen particip ation may be delayed several years27 citizen demand may also be driven by increased time pressures as citizens feel they have increased dema nds placed on their time they may look for ways to reduce time spent standing in lines and taking care of administrative tasks one way to do this is to be able to complete routine governmental transactions such as renewing license or applying for permit online similar to g2g and g2b projects g2c initiatives are also driven by an interest in better government through improved efficiency and more reliable outcomes examples of g2c initiatives although many examples of g2c initiatives can be found at the local and state level th ere are also examples at the federal level one of these examples is the blishment of the firstgov web site28 firstgov publicprivate partnership is administered by gsa tablished in september 2000 firstgov is designed to serve as the online portal29 for 51 million pages of government information services and onlin transactions according to the web site firstgov has the most comprehensiv search of government anywhere on the internet its creators also hope that firstgov will serve as the catalyst for growing electronic government second example is the irs30 in addition to providing all irs tax forms online for downloading the irs web site also cont ains wealth of information to answer variety of taxrelated questions that citizens might normally ask during call to an irs telephone help line or vi sit to one of its centers the irs also allows citizens and businesses to file and pay their taxes online using an option called efile depending on ones tax situation efile can enable filer to submit information make payments and receive refunds electronically stages of egovernment in addition to identifying egovernment initiatives according to their sector such projects can also be classified according to their level or stage of development although different egovernment initiatives strive to accomplish different goals some observers argue that one of the overarc hing themes of egovernment is to fully realize the capabilities of availa ble information technology in an effort to transform government from an agencycentric limited service operation into an automated citizencentric operation capable of delivering government services to citizenshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31057crs10 31 christopher baum nd andrea di maio gartners four phases of egovernment model 21 november 2000 businesses and other government agenci 24 hours day seven days week however for variety of technical economic and political reasons it will take time for these initiatives to evolve into their full potential for that reason some observers use common schema for classi fying the stages of evolution of government projects31 the schema is based on the degree to which the properties of information technology have been utiliz ed to enable the delivery of services electronically using this schema there are four stages of evolution presence interaction transaction and transformation it is important to note that an government initiative does not n ecessarily have to start at the first stage and work its way through all of the stages instead project can skip levels either from its inception or as it develops presence presence is the first stage of development and is the establishment of placeholder for delivering information in the future it represents the simplest and least expensive entrance into egovernment but it also offers the fewest options for citizens typical example is basic web site that lis ts cursory information about an agency such as hours of operation mailing address and or phone numbers but has interactive capabilities it is passive presentation of general information some observers refer to these types of s ites as brochureware suggesting they are the electronic equivalent of paper brochure interaction the second stage is interaction lthough interactive webbased initiatives offer enhanced capabilities efforts in this group are still limited in their ab ility to streamline and automate government functions interactions are relatively simple and generally revolve around information provi sion these types of initiatives are designed to help the customer avoid trip to an office or make phone call by making commonly requested informati on and forms available around the clock these resources may include instructions for obtaining services downloadable forms to be printed and mailed back to an agen cy or perhaps email contact to respond to simple questions transaction the third stage in the evolution of egove rnment initiatives is transaction these initiatives are more complex than simple information provision and embody the types of activities popularly associated with government they enable clients to complete entire tasks electronically at any time of the day or night these initiatives effectively create selfservice operations fo r tasks such as license renewals paying taxes and fees and submitting bids for proc urement contracts although the level of interactivity is of higher magnitude than second stag initiatives the activities still involve flow of information that is prima rily oneway either to government or to the client depending on the activity th electronic responses are generally highlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31057crs11 32 ibid 33 jeff breen at the dawn of egovernment the citizen as customer government finance

license renewal creating receipt acknowledging bid transformation the highest order of evolution for egovernment initiatives is transformation initiatives at this level utilize the full cap abilities of the technology to transform how government functions are conceived organized and executed such initiatives would have the robust customer relationship management capabil ities required to handle full range of questions problems nd needs currently there are very few examples of this type of initiative in part due to administrative technical and fiscal constraints one of the distinctions of these initiatives is that they facilitate the seamless flow of informa tion and collaborative decisi on making between federal state local public and private partners in other words transformative government initiatives often seek to remove the organizational barriers that promote agencycentric solutions and instead prom ote customercentric solutions some advocates suggest that at its most advanced level egovernment could potentially re organize combine andor eliminate existin g agencies and replace them with virtual organizations32 issues for congress potential opportunities of egovernment on the one hand proponents of egovern ment suggest these initiatives will provide variety of opportun ities to improve governance as discussed above there are number of forces driving the diffe rent egovernment sectors however proponents of egovernment suggest there ar some overarching benefits that will result either directly or indirectly from these initiatives egovernment is one means congress may use to try to achieve objectives related to these issues efficiency as with many information t echnologyrelated projects one of the anticipated benefits is improved effi ciency in egovernment projects this efficiency can take many forms some projects seek to reduce errors and improve consistency of outcomes by automating standardized tasks related efficiency goal of many egovernment initiatives is to reduce costs and layers of organizational processes by reengineering and streamlining operating procedures similarly some egovernment advocates suggest that re ducing the amount of time spent on repetitive tasks will give those federal employees an opportunity to develop new skills and advance their careers33 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31057crs12 34 see crs report rl30153 critical infrastructures background policy and implementation by john d moteffnew and improved services another opportunity promoted by government supporters is the potential to improve the quality range and accessibility of services some observers suggest that in addition to enhanced efficiency the quality of services may be improved through quicker transactions improved accountability and better processe s the evolution of eg overnment also creates the potential for new services along with the possibility of combining existing services egovernment initiatives could contribute to qualitative change in how government conducts business and how c itizens interact with g overnment and each other increased citizen participation third benefit anticipated by some government advocates is increased citizen participation in government one way this could occur is by connecting people who live in remote areas of the country so that they can send and receive information more easily second way suggested by some observers is through increased participation in government by younger adults some advocates believe that the generation of c itizens about to come of political age who have grown up with the internet and dig ital communications technologies in their everyday lives will be more likely to become participant citizens if the means to do so are similar to the ones they use for personal and professional activities by extension egovernment initiatives could also enhance citizentoc itizen c2c interaction by providing opportunities for pe ople with similar interests opinions and concerns who may be geogra phically separated to inter act and share information improved national information infrastructure fourth possible benefit of the drive to implement egovernment in itiatives is the improvement of the national information infrastructure nii during the years leading up to the y2k rollover there was growing concern over the protecti on of nii as part of the efforts to address the y2k problem former president clinton released presidential decision directive 63 the directive sets up groups within the federal government to develop and implement plans that would pr otect governmentoperated infrastructures and calls for dialogue between governme nt and the private sector to develop national infrastructure assurance plan that would protect the nations critical infrastructures by the year 200334 following the successful handling of the year 2000 y2k problem attention began to wa ne again however the events of september 11 2001 have reinvigo rated the sense of urgency to focus interest in nii issues on october 16 2001 president bush signed executive order 13231 which outlines the administrations policies and objectives for critical infrastructure protection and reiterates many of the provisions in pdd63 this heightened awareness along with the effort to make many government services available online could renew interest in the

c relyea for more comprehensive analysis of computer matching issuespotential challenges to egovernment on the other hand despite the potentia l opportunities for the implementation of egovernment initiatives there are number of challenges that could prevent the realization of these anticipated benefits some of the challenges such as disparities in computer access digital divide the lack of equal access to computers whether due to lack of financial resources or necessary skills are preexisting conditions that are connected to larger issues othe rs such as funding rules and concerns about federalism are problems that have emerged out of efforts to integrate information technology into government generally computer security perhaps one of the most significant challenges for implementing egovernment initiatives is computer security in series of evaluations published since july 1999 th general accounting office gao has repeatedly reported that the largest federal agencies were not adequately protecting critical federal operations and assets from computerbased attacks35 specifically gao has identified six areas of weakness security program management access controls software development and change controls segregation of duties operating systems controls and service continuity36 for egovernment activities service continuity is critical not only for the availability and delivery of services but also to build citizen confidence and trust however the risks of fraud and misuse of sensitive data are concerns as well privacy related to computer security privacy also presents challenge to the implementation and acceptance of egovernment initiatives concerns about the use of cookies37 sharing information between agencies computer matching38 and the disclosure or mishandling of private inform ation are frequent subj ects of debate as gao reported in september 2000 report re garding online privacy protections at federal web sites nearly one third 23 of 70 of

services addressing the issue of privacy in the context of egovernment may require both technical and policy responses disparities in computer access another challenge for egovernment is disparities in computer access this challe nge includes two policy issues the often described digital divide nd accessibility for people with disabilities in the case of the digital divide not all citizens currently have equal access to computers whether due to lack of financial resour ces or necessary skills while the placement of internetenabled computers in schools nd public libraries is helping address this issue these efforts are still progressing41 some observers point out that much of what governments do involves interactions with people least likely to have access the poor the elderly languagelimited persons and the lesswelleducated42 similarly advocates for the disabled obs erve that computers can present new obstacles for citizens such as the blind or physically impaired who may require costly hardware or software for their co mputers such as screen readers or oral controls to be able to access online information and services this also requires that these resources be designed in manner that makes them accessible using these tools on june 21 2001 section 508 of the reha bilitation act amendments of 1998 went into effect section 508 requires all elect ronic and

federal acquisition regulations far for implementing section 508 went into effect on june 25 200143 government information tec hnology manageme nt and funding multilayered challenge for the development of egovernment is government information technology management and f unding this includes issues such as government information technology worker recru itment retenti on and compensation the establishment of fe deral cio and coope ration between local state and federal governments while egovernment provides the opportunity forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31057crs15 44 to help address this

february 2001 p 1 48 in contrast the comparable section in s 803 the egovernment act of 2002 also requires senate confirmation of the egovernment administratorfederal employees to develop new skills it also presents the dilemma of hiring and retaining skilled information technology wo rkers in relatively highdemand field belowmarket salaries44 and the inability to offer some types of benefits hinders the governments ability to attract and retain skilled workers forcing it to either outsource certain projects or delay implementation45 likewise the growing debate over the establishment of federal cio raises questions about how to manage and develop information technology and government projects more than just an organizational issue the outcome of the federal cio issue has implications for the level of support fundi ng and interagency cooperation that will take place46 another issue related to t echnology management is fede ral funding of state and local egovernment projects some observers claim that the terms attached to federal grants sometimes require predetermined soluti ons or restrict the use of funds across two or more programs hindering efforts to create integrated statewide systems however efforts to lift restrictions on commingling federal and state funds could raise concerns regarding federalism especi ally or projects that span across several agencies and budgets this issue may become more critical if there is an increase in the use of information technology gr ants by the federal government47 pl 107347 egovernment act of 2002 title i establishes new
