moulay ismail mohammed vis siblings and cousins are performing official duties of varying importance domestic politics king mohammed vi is continuing the process of managed democratization that his father had begun in the 1990s and capped with the appointm ent of opposition leader youssoufi as prime minister in 1997 king hassans overbearing leadership style however had diminished youssoufis scope of authority the prime minister also was stymied by his unwieldy sevenparty coalition which is opposed by seven other parties and by lack of funds in july 30 1999 speech mohammed vi said that he was committed to the system of constitutional monarchy political pluralism economic liberalism regional and decentralized government the establishment of the state of rights and law and preserving human rights and individual and collective liberties1 the king and prime minister agree on these matters and royal support may enable youssoufi to overcome some of the difficulties he has experienced in governing mohammed vi is populist who reaches out to his subjects personally he appointed the first ever palace spokesman to communicate his policies the king also traveled to the neglected povertystrick north including the rif mountains site of past berber uprisings where monarch had traveled in more than 40 years mohammed vi took his most significant political step on november 9 1999 when he summarily fired driss basri the feared interior minister who commanded the police and intelligence services hassan ii had survived two coup attempts in the 1970s and relied on basri to protect his regime sometimes by draconian measures the new king however had illconcealed contempt for basri2 mohammed vi initially circumscribed basris power by removing two issues counterespionage and the western sahara from his portfolio the latter action reportedly resulted from royal displeasure with heavyhanded police suppression of riots in the region in septemberoctober the king used foreign minister mohammed benaissa as his personal envoy to algeria task that basri had often performed for hassan ii then on november 9 the king replaced basri with former ministry technocrat whom basri had sacked in 1997 and named friend and classmate to be the new ministers secondin command and the royal eyes and ears in the ministry many of basris appointees as governors and ministry officials were relieved of their duties later basris removal affirmed mohammed vis credibility as force for positive change in the countryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20391crs3 3 rtm tv rabat in arabic translated by bbc

within the framework of liberties guaranteed to the individuals and institutions by the constitution he formed an independent arbitration committee to determine ways of compensating those who have been the subject of disappearances and unjust arrest3 this royal acknowledgment that such practices had existed may be interpreted as slap at the interior ministry which had been accused of the worst abuses4 mohammed vi has made other highly symbolic moves on september 30 1999 he allowed dissident exile ibrahim serfaty to return home from france the marxist serfaty had been expelled in 1991 after serving 17 years in prison for statements favoring self determination for the western sahara and his fate had become an international cause celebre serfaty is old and wheelchair bound but remains
