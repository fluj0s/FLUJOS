was not federally recognized in 1934 may avail itself of the landintotrust provision u nder section 465 the soi is authorized to take land into trust for the purpose of providing land for indians indians is defined to include all pers ons of indian descent who are members of any recognized indian tribe now under federal jurisdiction and all persons who are descendants of such member s who were on june 1 1934 residing within the present boundaries of any indian reservation and sh all further include all other persons of onehalf or more indian blood15 the same provision states that tribe is to be construed to refer to any indian tribe organized band pueblo or the indians residing on one reservation16 riicsa does not explicitly clarify the matter it did not set up reservation for the tribe it did however designate certain lands as settlement lands17 which ultimately became the tribes reservation and specified that the state would have virtually full jurisdiction over them18 riicsa

narragansetts assertions of aboriginal right the provisions do not reveal an intent to otherwise restrict the tribes legal rights and privileges including those benefits which became available to the tribe upon attaining federal acknowledgment id at 183district court decision in carcieri v norton 24 the district court upheld the sois decision to take the 31acre tract into trust the court ruled that soi had authority under the ira to take the land into trust for the tribe it read the reference in the ira to members of any recognized indian tribe now under federal jurisdiction25 as covering the narragansett indian tribe by finding the tr ibe to have been unde r federal jurisdiction in 1934 even though it was not formally recognized until 1983 the court reasoned that because the tribes existence from 1614 was not in doubt whether or not it was recognized it was tribe and thus under federal supervision26 at the district court level the state raised three arguments based on the riicsa 1 the trust acquisition is contrary to the purposes of riicsa b ecause it results in expansion of tribal jurisdiction and c ontraction of state authority 2 riicsa specifically precludes any additi onal trust acquisition and 3 since the parcel at issue was within the area claimed in the litigation settled by riicsa trust acquisition of the particular parcel is precluded by the extinguishment of aboriginal title in riicsa and in the tribes renunciation of aborig inal claims in the underlying jmou in finding against the state the district c ourt ruled that riicsa provided explicit guidance on treatment of trust land applications by the tribe after federal recognition were to be treated it found that riicsa s jurisdictional provisions are confined to the settlement land and that riicsas extinguishment of the tribes aboriginal claims covered only claims with respect to previous transfers of lands the court took narrow view of riicsas purpose clearing titles encumbered by the lawsuit that it settled and in way addressing the prospect of future land acquisitions by the tribe according to the court the fact that trust acquisition may result in diminished state sovereignty over the parcel does not form basis for construing riicsa to prevent the trust acquisition but the basis for an argument for congress to amend riicsa27 appellate court rulings there are three decisions of the

of the fact that the tribe had not b een federally recognized in 1934 it rejected rhode islands arguments that for section 465 to apply tribe must have been both recognized and subject to federal juri sdiction in 1934 the opinion focused on the interaction between section 465 which authorizes the soi to take land into trust for indians and section 479 which defines indi ans as all persons of indian descent who are members of any recognized indian tribe now under federal jurisdiction29 the court chose to defer to dois longsta nding interpretation of the term now as meaning today rather than 193430 it viewed this interpretation as in accord with the supreme courts interpretation of the statute in united states v john31 and buttressed by the federally recognized indian tribe list act32 and 1994 amendment to the ira33 on rehearing34 the panel reiterated its earlier rationale on the ira issue and squarely addressed the jurisdictional issue majority of the panel relying on principle of statutory construction sometimes used to interpret indian affairs legislation35 rejected rhode islands argume nts that taken together certain provisions of the settlement act precluded any tribe from exercising sovereignty over land in rhode island except to the extent specified in riicsa the majority of the panel read the settlement act as crystal clear in settling claims related to prior land transactions but ambiguous in failing to mention future land transfers thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34521crs7 36 423 f 3d 45 at 62 37 according to the dissent it is not surprising that the settleme nt act does not refer explicitly to the preservation of state jurisdiction outside of the settlement lands as sovereign rhode island already had jurisdiction out side of the settlement lands and the settlement act extinguished any potential co mpeting indian claims to that land the only land about which there might have been doubt was the settlement lands and as to that land state ju risdiction was expressly preserved in the circumstances of this case holding that rhode island is divested of our jurisdiction by the secretary taking into trust the adjacent parcel that was part of the original disputed land upsets the fairly expressed expectations of the parties it also produces an unwarranted anomalous relationship between the settlement lands and the after acquired parcel 423 f 3d 45 7273 howard j dissenting 38 the test was articulated by the supreme court in chevron usa v natural resources defense council 467 us 837 1984 39 id at 843 40 497 f 3d 15 26 there is ambiguity as to whether to view the term now as operating at the moment congress enacted it or at the mo ment the secretary invokes it the court also raised the question of whether the word now was meant to restrict the applicability of ira temporally to individual indians who were under federal supervision in 1934 rather than tribes 41 in this context the court rejected rhode islands arguments that the soi had changed continuedmajority relying on the canon of construction resolved this ambiguity in favor of the narragansetts once the tribe received fe deral recognition in 1983 it gained the same benefits as other indian tribes including the right to apply to ve land taken into trust pursuant to 46536 in dissent however circuit judge howar d took the view that the intent of the parties to the settle ment act was that rhode isla nd laws should apply throughout rhode island and that the language in the jmou and in riicsa could fairly be interpreted to that end37 on rehearing banc divided fi rst circuit ruled on both the ira and jurisdictional issues it found that the definition of indian in 25 usc 479 with its use of the phrase now under federal ju risdiction is sufficiently ambiguous to implicate what is known as the chevron test38 this involves twopart examination of statutory language 1 if congress s directly spoken on the precise question at issue and its intent is clear and unambiguous courts must defer to that interpretation of the law 2 if the meaning or intent of statute is silent or ambiguous courts must give deference to the agencys interpretation of the law if it is based on permissible and reasonable construction39 the court found by examining text context and legislative history that the ira is am biguous on the question of whether trust acquisitions are available for tribes not recognized in 193440 it therefore moved to the second prong of the chevron test and found the secret arys interpretation to be reasonable and consiste nt with the statute41httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34521crs8 41 continued position on the issue over the years noting th at application for trust acquisition had been rejected because the applicant tribe had not been

indians in maine 25 usc 1724e 45 497 f 3d 15 4950 howard circuit j dissentingon the jurisdictional issue the banc majority ruled against the states basic arguments principally by characterizing them as requiring finding that riicsa implicitly repealed the secretarys authority to take land into trust for the tribe it cited supreme court authority requiring high standard for repeals by implication42 it found nothing in the text of the settlement act that cl early indicates an intent to repeal the secretarys trust acquisition pow ers under ira or th at is fundamentally inconsistent with those powers43 the opinion also identified support for its position in the existence of other statutes settling indian land claims which did have provisions clearly limiting soi trust acquisition authority44 from this it reasoned the congress knew how to preclude future trust acquisitions and clearly did not choose to use this approach in riicsa the court turned down as not within its power the states request that if the court were to uphold the tr ust acquisition it should require the soi to limit the tribes jurisdiction to that specified for the settlement lands i with rhode island retaining civil and criminal jurisdiction the court acknowledged that such directive would preserve what the state in good faith believed to have been the essential component of its bargain in ag reeing to the jmou and to riicsa ie maintaining state sovereignty it suggested however that the power to limit jurisdiction over the newly acquired land wa s the prerogative of congress not the courts or the soi the two dissenting opinions raised argume nts that are likely to be advanced by the state in its supreme court merits brie f circuit judge howard would have found that 1 the parties to the jmou and congress in enacting riicsa intended to resolve all indian claims in rhode isla nd past present and future 2 riicsa contains broad language which maybe fairly interpreted as impliedly and partially repealing soi authority under the ira to take land into trust for the tribe 3 the fact that other settlement acts included provi sions limiting jurisdiction should there be subsequent approvals of tr ust acquisitions is irrelevant because riicsa clearly contemplated that there would be trust acquisition other than that of the settlement lands and 4 to read riicsa as if it did not preclude subse quent jurisdictional adjustments outside of the settlement lands would be antithetical to congress intent and absurd45 senior circuit judge selyas dissent characterizes the majoritys construction of the riicsa as wooden and too narrow and the resulthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34521crs9 46 497 f 3d 15 515 selya j dissenting 47 the settlement act when taken together with the extinguishment of all indian claims referable to lands in rhode island the tribes surrender of its right to an autonomous enclave and the waiver of much of its so vereign immunity suggests with unmistakable clarity that the parties intended to fashion broad arrangement that preserved the states civil criminal and regulatory jurisdiction over any and all lands within its borders id 51 48 under quiet title act suits contesting title to indian trust lands may not be entertained by the courts 28 usc 2409a 49 this would seemingly conflict with other statutes that assume that one of the consequences of tribal acknowledgment is the ability to acquire trust land see eg 25 usc 2719b1biii doi regulations in existence since 1980 which set forth the land acquisitions procedures and policies do not preclude trust acquisitions for newly acknowledged tribes see eg 25 cfr part 151 under 25 cfr 1512b the soi may take land into trust for any indian tribe band nation pueblo community rancheria colony or other group of indians which is reco gnized by the secretary as eligible for the special programs and services from the bureau of indian affairs 50 25 usc 1708babsurd46 judge selya argued that riicsa mu st not be divorced from its historical context47 potential impact the court may choose to resolve this cas as matter of statutory construction it may elect to apply canons favoring lib eral interpretation of statutes providing indian benefits and rigorous standards for repeals by implication on the other hand it may examine riicsa from the point of view of the bargain that the parties contemplated and as if reforming contr act interpret the statute to preserve the essentials of that agreement ie limit tribal jurisdiction and preserve state sovereignty however the court rules there are likely to be unexpected and unpredictable consequences for other tr ibes other lands and other issues decision favoring soi authority to take land into trust for newly recognized tribes would maintain the status quo if the court upholds the first circuit on the ira issue the soi would be able to continue to acquire land in trust for newly acknowledged or recognized tribes absent an express statutory restriction specific to particular to the tribe or land the contrary decision while not likely to jeopardize lands already held in trust48 would mean that newly acknowledged tribes would be unable to acquire any trus t land without further legislation49 if the court rules that riicsa is not bar to the trust acquisition the narragansett indian tribe would acquire nd primarily subject to federal and tribal jurisdiction and presumably eligible for gaming under igra since riicsas prohibition on gaming specifies settlement lands50 there would also be

jurisdictional limitations in other settlement legislation would test their ability to extend their sovereignty51 whether the impact of ruling against the tribe on the riicsa issue would have consequences beyond rhode island depends on the rationale of the decision if the court finds textual basis for holdi ng that riicsa indicates that congress intended to oust tribal jurisdiction in rhode island for all times by the breadth of the language extinguishing claims ramifications outside of the facts of the case are not likely if the decision rests on the extinguishment of aboriginal title in riicsa its effect might reach beyond the borders of rhode island and the narragansett tribe were the court to find that by extinguishing tribal aboriginal title congress foreclosed any subsequent trust acquisition or reassertion of ju risdiction there might be rash of challenges to the authority of other indian tribes which have reacquired and placed into trust land to which thei r aboriginal title had been extinguished
