discrimination in employment on the basis of race color relig ion sex or national origin2 in 90 decision with one justice concurring the court held that the statutes retaliation provision encompasses any employer action that would have been ma terially adverse to reasonable employee or job applicant3 this standard which is much broader than standard that would have conf ined the retaliation provision to actions that affect only the terms and conditions of employ ment generally makes it easier to sue employers if they retaliate against workers who complain about discr imination under the

losing wages background in 1997 sheila white the only woman wo rking in her department at one of burlington northerns train yards complained to company officials that her supervisor had repeatedly made sexist comments on th job although her supervisor was ordered to attend sexual harassment training ssion white was simultane ously reassigned to less desirable job and later was suspe nded without pay the company eventually reinstated white to her original position and awarded her backpay but white sued claiming that both the reassignment and suspension without pay constituted unlawful retaliation in violation of title vii4 at trial jury agreed with whites claims and awarded her compensatory damages initially panel of the court of appeals for the sixth circuit reversed the judgment5 but the full court sitting banc vacated the panels decision6 although the sixth circuit ultimately upheld whites retaliation claims th court like other fe deral appella courts to consider title vii retaliation claims differed over the standard to apply to such claims and the supreme court granted review to settle this question title vii and retaliation claims under title vii it is unlawful for an employer to among other things fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation terms conditions or privileges of employment because of such individuals race color religion sex or national origin7 in other words title viis antidiscrimination provision protects an employee only from discrimination that is employmentrelated in contrast title viis retaliation provision prohibits an employer from discriminating against any employee or job applicant because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment prac tice or because he has made charge testified assisted or participated in any manner in an investigation proceeding or hearing under title vii8 since the enforcement of t itle vii relies in part on the willingness of employees to report discrimination this pr ovision appears designed to prevent employers from undermining the antidi scrimination purpose at the heart of title

courts about whether retalia tion claim like discriminati on claim must be based on an employmentrelated action as well as about how harmful an employment action must be to constitute retaliation for example some appellate courts ve required close relationship between the retaliatory action and employment by applying the same standard to retaliation claims that they apply to discrimination claims namely that the employers action must have an adverse effect on the terms and conditions of employment10 other courts have applied an even stricter standard that recognizes retaliation only when an employers conduct relates to significant employmentrelate d actions such as hiring firing or compensation11 in contrast other circuit c ourts have taken more expa nsive view that applies different standard to retaliation claims than is applied to regular discrimination charges for example several courts have required simply that employees demonstrate that the challenged action would have dissuaded reasonable employee from making complaint of discrimination12 the supreme court granted review to resolve this dispute among the lower courts the supreme courts decision in burlington northern ultimately the supreme court agreed with lower courts that had taken more expansive view of the application of the retaliation provision holding that the provision encompasses employer actions that would have been materially adverse to reasonable employee or job applicant13 the court relied on both the language and the purpose of the statute to reach this result in analyzing the statutory language the court noted that the language of title viis antidiscrimination provision differs from the language of the retaliation provision in important ways14 under the antidiscrimination pr ovision the statutory language limits the scope of the provision to actions that ffect the terms and conditions of employment but such limiting words appear in the antiretaliation provision15 as the courthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22492crs4 16 id at 2412 quoting russello v united states 464 us 16 23 us 1983 17 id 18 id 19 id 20 id 21 id at 2415 22 idnoted we normally presume that where word s differ as they differ here congress acts intentionally and purposely in the di sparate inclusion or exclusion16 additionally the court examined the purposes behind the antidiscrimination and retaliation provisions according to the cour t the antidiscrimination provision reflects the primary purpose of title vii which is to prevent discrimin ation against certain individuals the retaliation provision on the othe r hand is designed to ensure that the statutes primary purpose is carried out by pr eventing an employer from retaliating against employees who report discrimination17 relying on this difference in purpose the court reasoned that congress did not need to prohibit anything more that employme ntrelated conduct in or der to achieve the statutes primary purpose of preventing disc rimination however the court noted that an employer can effectively retaliate against an employee by taking actions not directly related to his employment or by causing him harm outside the workplace18 as examples the court cited case in which the fbi retaliated against an employee by refusing to investigate death threats made against the agent and his family as well as case in which an employer retaliated by filing false criminal charges against former employee who had complained of discrimination19 therefore the court reasoned that the purpose behind the retaliation provision would not be served unless the provision compassed broader range of conduct than the an tidiscrimination provision notin g that provision limited to employmentrelated actions would not deter the many forms that effective retaliation can take20 given these differences in both the langua ge and purpose of the statute the court ultimately held that the retaliation provision is not limited to employer actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment inst ead the court established standard that requires an employee to dem onstrate that reasonable em ployee would have found the challenged action to be materially adverse noting that title viis retaliation provision does not protect an employee from the pe tty slights or minor annoyances of the workplace21 the court stated that challenged action must be significant enough to dissuade the average worker from making or supporting charge of discrimination the court also emphasized that the context matters when determining whether an employers action rises to the level of re taliation for example sche dule change in an employees work schedule may make little difference to many workers but may matter enormously to young mother with school age children22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22492crs5 23 id at 2416 24 id at 2421applying the broader retaliation standard to whites claim the court upheld the original jury verdict in her favor23 although burlington northern eventually reversed its decision to reassign white and suspend he r without pay the companys actions were deemed sufficiently harmful to dissuade an employee from reporting discrimination in concurring opinion justice alito disagreed w ith the majoritys st andard for retaliation claims instead justice alito favored narrower interpretation that would have limited retaliation claims to conduct that affects the terms and conditions of employment although he would have uphe ld whites retaliation cl aim under this standard24 conclusion although the burlington northern case involved retaliation against an employee who made charges of sex discrimination the decision applies more widely to employees who claim retaliation for reporting any kind of di scrimination prohibite d by title vii in addition because the courts decision in burlington northern means that broader range of employer actions may constitute unlaw ful retaliation it should become easier for employees to file retaliation claims therefore the number of title vii retaliation claims filed with the equal employ ment opportun ity commission or in federal court may be expected to increase in the future
