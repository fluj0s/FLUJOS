minimumcover has been set to reflect the level currently reachedby such claims generally most contractors that thedepartment deals with have such cover howeversome contractors may not or may consider that therisk involved with particular project justifies lowerfigure defra will accept lower insurance figurewhere it agrees it is commensurate with the riskcontractors should state whether they believe lowerinsurance figure is reasonable and provide justification it is the departments policy to hold contractors responsible for any costs incurred through the lattersnegligence or breach of contract the standard clauseplaces financial limit to this responsibility andtherefore the contractor remains liable even thoughthe claim may exceed the limit of the contractorsinsurancenote 16 for this purpose small business has fewer than 250 employees and has an annual turnover of greater than 40 million about 26m or alternatively balance sheet total of higher than 27 million about 17m and independent that is less than 25 of the business is owned by enterprises that do notconform to the other criteria this rule need notapply to investments that are held by publicinvestment corporations venture capitalcompanies or other institutional investors providedthey do exercise control over the business charities university spinoffs individuals and groups aredeemed to be small businesses if

details necessary for the project costs pay costs you should include the costs of personnelworking directly on the project defra is willing toaccept pay calculations on the basis of averagepay costs in this event you should indicate theaverage pay used for the grades in question b inflation i if the project is submitted under competition percentage to cover inflationcan be built into the price but please bear inmind that overall cost is factor in theselection process ii if the project is not submitted under competition costings must be submitted atcurrent prices and defra will add anallowance for inflation in line with thetreasurys forecast gdp deflator c consumables these will be essentially scientific laboratorysupplies eg glassware chemicals costingindividually up to 2000 in value which arepurchased from third parties please give briefdetails d equipment capital equipment is fixed asset costing over2000 in value which is expected to yieldcontinuous service beyond the year in which it ispurchased it includes items such as scientific andinformation technology equipment theequipment must be essential to carrying out theproject three quotations must be obtained foreach item of equipment see note ii below for new equipment defra will usually only fund that proportion of its working life normally 5years to which it is used solely on the project ieif project is of 3 years duration defra will fund35th of the cost at the rate of 15 each yearwhere equipment has useful life of more than 5years andor is used for other purposes youshould make an appropriate reduction in theannual rental charged to defra where newequipment is required please give details of themake model price and the year when each itemis to be purchased and its purpose likewiseplease indicate when equipment is to be leasedand give details of the costs of rental for eachyear piece of equipment may need to be allocated fulltime to project in such case the fact thatan organisation owns similar piece ofequipment for use on other projects does notremove the need here for that equipment to beeither purchased or hired although the usualrules on the amount to be paid will apply it ishowever for the contractor to justify such apurchase you may be asked by defra to provide the following as appropriate i the original purchasing invoice or top copy of the rental agreement this will be returned immediately after copy has been taken and ii the original written quotations obtained from three different suppliers nb in appropriate cases eg where it can beshown that the technical specification ofequipment precludes all but single supplier asingle written quotation will be acceptable on rare occasions defra will meet the full purchase price of piece of equipment this is where defra wishes to own the equipment forpossible future transference to another contractorin due course eg air monitoring equipment travel expenses visits to conferences and similar functions in theuk or
