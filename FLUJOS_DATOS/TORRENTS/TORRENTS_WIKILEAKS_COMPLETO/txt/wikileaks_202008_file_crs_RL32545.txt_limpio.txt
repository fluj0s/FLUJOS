domestic social policy division health care spending context and policy summary the united states spends large and growing share of national income on health care in 2007 health spending is expected to approach 23 trillion and account for more than 16 of gross domestic product gdp we spend substantially more than other developed countries both per capita and as share of gdp however given our wealth such spending is not necessarily problem on the one hand depending on our preference for health care compared with other things we may wish to spend even more on the other hand regardless of the preferred level for national spending our nation might use available resources more efficiently and equitably health care costs put significant pressure on the federal budget both directly through spending on medicare medicaid and other federal benefits and indirectly through tax expenditures for health insurance and expenses the congressional budget office projects that spending for medicare medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program will total 634 billion and account for about 23 of federal outlays in 2007 federal tax expenditures for health benefits health coverage for military personnel veterans and federal employees and spending by public health service agencies are expected to add 272 billion in costs given competing constituent interests and the complex interdependence of public and private benefits and actors policymakers face difficult challenges in helping to ensure access to health care and health insurance without exacerbating federal budget pressures or contributing to marketwide inflation three broad policy directions have both promise and limitations for addressing health spending 1 changing health care 2 changing federal programs and 3 changing tax policy the first changing health care considers the potential for influencing spending by improving the quality and delivery of health care services key limitation of this direction is uncertainty about whether any particular change will reduce or increase health spending the second direction changing federal programs focuses more narrowly on federal spending for federal benefits to influence spending policymakers can set budgets for programs services or beneficiaries they can change eligibility rules or program benefits and they can change other program features including payment methods and amounts and how beneficiaries obtain coverage in this category the primary challenge is balancing explicit tradeoffs between competing goals regarding access and spending the final direction changing tax policy focuses both on making health care more affordable for individuals and families and on influencing consumers choices as they purchase health insurance and health care key benefit of tax subsidies including exclusions credits deductions and taxadvantaged accounts relates to flexibility in general these tools help consumers buy the health insurance and health care they prefer drawback is that tax subsidies may drive up consumer demand and spending on the one hand while failing to help ensure access to health coverage on the other this report will be updated contents

spending on health care and other items 4 health care spending context and policy health care costs and spending are persistent concerns for the congress on one hand policymakers worry about access to care and the burden of health costs on household and employer budgets on the other hand rising costs put growing pressure on the federal budget from medicare medicaid and tax expenditures for private health insurance this report seeks to put health spending in context how much does this nation spend and is it too much why is policy action so difficult and what types of policies can the congress pursue in seeking to balance concerns regarding spending and access given the breadth of the topic this report is not intended to be comprehensive instead it introduces selected issues and policy strategies using examples from variety of federal programs and policies to make ideas more concrete health spending the big picture health spending in the united states is projected to be nearly 23

income in 2005 spending on health care services including hospital inpatient and outpatient services physician services and prescription drugs rose by 74 per capita this rate is similar to the 2004 growth rate of 75 and down from high of 104 in 20011 by contrast personal income grew 42 during 2005 and at an average annual rate of 26 over the 20012004 period2 is the us spending level problem what about the rate of growth international perspective compared with other developed countries the united states spends both more per capita and greater share of its national income on health care according to data from the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in 2005 per capita health spending in the united states was more than double the oecd median3 also based on oecd data us health spending consumed 153 of gdp in 2005 compared with median spending of 91 of gdp for oecd countries4 after america countries spending the highest shares of gdp were switzerland 116 france 111 germany 107 belgium 103 austria 102 portugal 102 greece 101 and canada 98 the us spending level is not necessarily too high most of the variation in health spending across oecd countries can be explained by differences in gdp per capita suggesting that countries with higher national income are able and willing to spend this income on more health care5 1 center for studying health

estimating both health spending and gdp this difference is not meaningful 5 uwe reinhardt peter hussey and gerard anderson us health care spending in an continued crs3 valuing spending on health care criticism of us spending levels generally boils down to the argument that americans benefit little from the additional money they spend on health care despite paying more than twice as much per capita as other oecd countries basic health statistics for the united states are worse than oecd averages6 in 2004 the us infant mortality rate of 68 deaths1000 live births was higher than the median rate of 43 deaths1000 live births for all oecd countries in the same year us life expectancy at birth also was below oecd averages us females were expected to live 804 years compared with median life expectancy of 815 years for females in all oecd countries for males the us and oecd numbers were 752 and 765 years respectively another argument regarding the uncertain value of health spending points to variation within the united states itself that cannot be explained fully by differences in health status or prices and that is not correlated with better outcomes or satisfaction with care7 for example according to the medicare payment advisory commission medpac in 2000 medicare spending per beneficiary varied from about 3500 in santa fe new mexico to almost 9200 in miami florida8 many factors contribute to such differences in spending including variation in the supply of medical resources in how physicians practice medicine and in the economic social and cultural characteristics of communities9 unfortunately variation in measures of health on the one hand and spending on the other are difficult to interpret in the former case many things besides health care affect infant mortality and life expectancy including nutrition sanitation and hygiene housing and the prevention and control of infectious disease in the latter case although more spending on health care is not necessarily better10 it also is not 5 continued international context health affairs vol 23 3 mayjune 2004 p 12 using 2001 oecd data reinhardt and colleagues estimate that about 90 of crossnational variation in health spending can be explained by differences in gdp said another way as gdp increases spending on health care increases both absolutely and as proportion of gdp 6 organization for

collection 2004 supplement to health affairs 2004 p var104 10 more spending on health care is not better if it fails to improve health or otherwise offer benefits that exceed costs fuchs asserts see cite above that considerable amount of continued crs4 necessarily worse some differences in spending may be the appropriate result of differences across markets in the cost of inputs for producing health services in addition although overuse of health care may be wasteful underuse of services also can be problem it may not be clear whether any given spending level is too high too low or about right economics and valuing spending economics offers additional concepts for thinking about whether us spending levels are desirable or affordable despite high spending we may conclude as society that it is worthwhile to devote the same or even more resources to health care this conclusion depends on preferences for health care relative to other things if we value health care more than what we would otherwise produce with the same resources diverting resources to health care from other uses will increase social welfare we also may conclude that spending levels are affordable based on the observation that it is possible in growing economy to spend more both on health care and on other goods and services as table 2 shows over the 19601999 period increasing national income was sufficient to support both rapid growth in per capita spending for health care and growth in spending for items other than health care whether our economy will be able to support similar trend in the future depends on the extent to which increases in health spending continue to outpace change in gdp11 table 2 us spending on health care and other items in 1996 dollars 1960 1970 1980 1990 1999 per capita

growth in gdp by 1 if the gap is instead 2 spending would be affordable only through 2039 crs5 distribution matters even if health spending is generally affordable for society the cost of health insurance and health care may be too much for certain individuals and families for example in 2006 178 of americans under age 65 went without health insurance for the entire year low income individuals were more likely to be uninsured about onethird of those earning less than 150 of the poverty level and more than one quarter of those with income between 150 and 199 were uninsured compared with just over one in ten people earning at least 200 of poverty12 given the cost of health insurance these rates are not surprising in 2006 the average annual premium for individual coverage under an employersponsored plan was 4242 with the workers share of this amount averaging 627 for family of four the average premium and workers share were 11480 and 2973 respectively13 for comparison in 2006 the average poverty threshold was 10294 for an individual and 20614 for family of four14 having coverage does not guarantee ready access to health care for example according to medpac although medicare beneficiaries enjoy good access overall population subgroups report delaying care because of cost even after controlling for income health status and other demographic variables beneficiaries with only medicare are more likely to delay care than those with medicare and supplemental coverage of some sort this finding is statistically significant for all reported sources of supplemental coverage including medicaid medigap employersponsored and health maintenance organization hmo15 12 crs report 96891 health insurance coverage characteristics of the insured and uninsured populations

coverage also does not guarantee low outofpocket costs in 2003 9 of people with private health insurance almost one in ten reported spending more than 5 of family income on health care not including health insurance premiums the burden was predictably higher for people without health benefits 21 of the uninsured spent more than 5 of family income on health care16 key issue for the congress regardless of whether america can afford to spend more of its national income on health care health spending is key issue for the congress both because it constitutes substantial share of federal spending and because it affects all constituents in one way or another federal spending medicare and medicaid generally top the list of concerns about federal health spending according to the congressional budget office medicare spending is projected to be 436 billion in 2007 and the federal shares of spending for medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program are expected to be 192 billion and 6 billion respectively the sum of these amounts 634 billion represents about 23 of estimated federal outlays 27 trillion for 200717 costs for medicare and medicaid are expected to grow significantly as the population ages federal tax expenditures for health benefits are also substantial although difficult to measure estimates by the joint committee on taxation suggest personal income tax expenditures for health benefits could approach 120 billion in 200718 most of this amount represents forgone revenue because employerprovided health benefits are excluded from federal income and employment taxes other tax expenditures include the itemized deduction for unreimbursed medical and dental expenses above 75 of adjusted gross income the deduction for health insurance for the selfemployed and the deduction and exclusion for health savings accounts federal spending on health benefits for military personnel veterans and federal employees is expected to total 103 billion

research and quality20 constituents and complexity influencing health spending is complicated broadly the congress faces the challenge of balancing fiscal constraints against the desire to help constituents beyond this general challenge the details can be mindnumbing constituent groups often have competing objectives or at least different priorities public and private actions are highly interdependent and policy actions inevitably have both intended and unintended consequences for example health spending and cost trends affect taxpayers who pay for public benefits and tax subsidies individuals and families who may receive coverage through public programs benefit from tax subsidies for health insurance or find themselves uninsured or underinsured because of the high cost of health care employers who must balance providing an attractive compensation package including health insurance for employees against the need to keep labor costs under control states who share responsibility with the federal government to provide coverage for certain vulnerable populations insurers and health plans who must balance offering attractive products at reasonable prices against profit goals and the risk of financial loss and health care providers whose income depends on insurance coverage and functioning market for health care 19 executive office of the president office of management and budget historical tables budget of the united states government fiscal year 2008 washington us government printing office 2007 p 322 20 executive office of the president office of management and budget budget of the united states government fiscal year 2008 washington us government printing office 2007 p 72 for this accounting program budgets include both agency appropriations and funding from other sources including user fees transfers between public health service agencies and transfers both from the departmentlevel budget for health and human services and from other federal departments crs8 together these actors make up complex market in which it is hard to discern the beginning or end of public and private influences public programs depend on private providers to deliver health care services and they depend on private entities to administer benefits whether by processing claims or by providing private health plan options for beneficiaries the private insurance market in turn depends on substantial tax subsidies to increase demand for coverage and make the price of insurance more affordable for purchasers public subsidies such as medicare and medicaid payment addons for hospitals that train physicians or treat lowincome people help ensure access to care not only for beneficiaries of public programs but also for uninsured and privately insured individuals ultimately all policies affecting public benefits influence the private market and vice versa given the complicated interdependence of actors unintended consequences are inevitable for example although medicare and medicaid have provided both financial protection and access to care for millions of beneficiaries the programs also contribute to health care inflation because insured consumers are less price sensitive similarly expanding public benefits as the congress has done in enacting drug coverage under medicare and creating the state childrens health insurance program inevitably crowds out private spending regardless of efforts by policymakers to prevent this substitution maximizing the benefits while minimizing the costs of any policy action is difficult challenge three policy directions the following sections introduce three broad approaches for using policy to influence health costs and spending changing health care changing federal programs and changing tax policy these approaches are neither mutually exclusive nor exhaustive in addition controlling spending whether national spending or federal spending is not assumed to be their only objective as discussed above devoting high share of national income to health care is not necessarily problem nevertheless policymakers generally are concerned about whether health services are worth their cost as well as about how benefits and subsidies are distributed changing health care this broad direction changing health care to increase its value and potentially reduce its underlying cost focuses on the health system the basic idea is that policy might help improve quality and efficiency in the production and delivery of health care and in so doing lower the cost of health services if realized lower costs would affect both public and private health spending research highquality health care depends on information about health and illness about medical treatments and about patients federal policy has long influenced health care delivery by supporting the development and dissemination of information for example the national institutes of health supports basic science and clinical research the agency for healthcare research and quality analyzes the effectiveness of different treatments and clinical practices and the centers for disease control and prevention monitors the incidence and prevalence of health risk crs9 factors and illness in communities government support of these research functions benefits both private actors who use the information and society more broadly because absent government support the private market would produce and share less information information technology beyond supporting research and surveillance the government can facilitate the use of information in health care by developing data and communication standards and by creating incentives for adopting information tools for example policymakers have moved to support the use of health information technology it by establishing standards for data exchange among the departments of health and human services defense and veterans affairs in addition to promoting information sharing across these federal departments that deliver health care the initiative is meant to serve as model for the private sector21 policymakers also have supported financial incentives for implementing health it for example the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma pl 108173 authorized grants to physicians to help defray the cost of purchasing installing and using computer systems for electronic prescriptions health it offers the potential to improve health care quality by providing both specific information about patients and general information about effective treatment strategies electronic health records and clinical decision support systems can help physicians and other clinicians provide integrated evidencebased care computerized physician order entry systems can help prevent medical errors and interconnected systems can facilitate the exchange of information about patients and populations over time these tools might help reduce health care spending by encouraging costeffective care and streamlining administrative processes but current evidence is inconclusive22 leadership more generally government influences the health care system by sometimes leading and sometimes reinforcing change policy support of research and health it are just two examples of this influence during the past decade both public and private efforts to rein in health care spending have shifted from focusing on managed care and integrated delivery systems to focusing on changing incentives for health care consumers through socalled consumerdirected strategies and providers through payforperformance this evolution reflects mix of public and private initiative for example federal policy has supported the market for managed care plans through medicare payment rates and medicaid policy changes that make it easier for states to provide benefits through health plans and primary care case management arrangements similarly tax subsidies for health savings accounts and policy interest in tying medicare payments to providers performance are examples 21 for more information about this initiative specifically and health it more generally see crs report rl32858 health information technology promoting electronic connectivity in health care by c stephen redhead 22 see the thematic issue of health affairs vol 24 5 septemberoctober 2005 which includes series of articles on the economics of health it crs10 of federal efforts that both reflect and shape ongoing change in the market for private health insurance efforts to change the health care system offer both promise and risk investment in research policies to support health information technology and other efforts may improve the quality of care but their potential impact on spending is uncertain on one hand although new discoveries and technology tend to lower the cost of most products innovation in health care tends to have the opposite effect on the other hand inefficiency and waste in the us health care system like that implied by relatively poor health statistics and regional variation in health spending suggest opportunities for improvement whether this means slowing growth in health care spending or at least getting better value for what we spend changing federal programs whereas strategies to change health care focus on the health system generally second broad direction changing federal programs focuses on federal spending for federal benefits given growing costs and limited resources many policymakers note the need to control spending on federal programs but other goals such as improving program benefits and ensuring adequate payments for health care providers are also important medicare illustrates the tension from competing objectives over the past decade repeated legislative efforts alternately have emphasized limiting spending or increasing spending with most bills including provisions for doing both whether the congress seeks to reduce spending or not policymakers have different types of options for changing federal programs including specifying budgets changing eligibility andor benefits and changing features that define how programs work program budgets in way the simplest tool for influencing federal spending on health care is to set budget for example the congress limits outlays on health benefits for veterans by specifying budget through the appropriations process by changing the appropriation congress can reduce or increase spending for this population the appropriation for veterans health care is an example of programlevel budget but other possibilities include budgets for certain services or beneficiaries for example the congress attempted to control spending for physician services under medicare through the sustainable growth rate system which more or less sets budget for medicare spending on physician services policymakers also could limit federal spending for individuals in entitlement programs through capitation payments two examples of this type of approach include converting medicare to premium support system under which beneficiaries would purchase coverage much like federal employees do today and changing medicaid from program with federal matching payments for services to program in which states receive fixed payments for enrollees crs11 the details matter setting budget can restrict spending but if set too high it also can lead to higher spending than would occur otherwise in addition mismatch between funding demand and supply can lead to access problems in the veterans case some argue that queuing for services is the result of appropriations that have failed to grow in tandem with rising enrollment and health care costs in the medicare case some physicians have threatened to stop seeing beneficiaries in response to recent and expected future payment cuts eligibility and benefits another tool for influencing federal spending is changing eligibility and benefits under entitlement programs the congress could use this tool to reduce spending but usually it has done the opposite for example over the years policymakers have expanded eligibility for medicare and medicaid notably in the former case to certain disabled persons and individuals with endstage renal disease and in the latter case to successive subgroups of pregnant women and children the congress also has expanded benefits examples in medicare include coverage for hospice services and more recently for various clinical preventive services and outpatient prescription drugs in medicaid most new benefits have been optional for states mandatory additions have included limited coverage for professional services by nonphysician providers dentists nurse midwives and nurse practitioners coverage for care provided in rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers and coverage for family planning and pregnancyrelated services changing cost sharing is another way policymakers can modify benefits for example under the balanced budget act of 1997 bba pl 10533 policymakers in effect increased coverage for hospital outpatient services under medicare by reducing beneficiaries liability for coinsurance in contrast the congress slightly reduced medicare benefits when it required future increases in the part b deductible under the mma changes to eligibility and benefits have fairly straightforward tradeoffs in general expansions increase access but also spending restrictions reduce spending but may limit access distribution and incentives matter while policy change to reduce covered services or increase cost sharing requirements might seriously limit access for some beneficiaries the same cutback likely would encourage others to be appropriately prudent in seeking health services other program features the congress can influence spending under entitlement programs by changing program features other than eligibility or benefits key tools include changing payment methods and amounts and changing how beneficiaries obtain coverage for example over the years policymakers have changed payment methods for most medicare services beginning in 1983 and accelerating with the bba cost based payment has been abandoned in favor of prospectively determined rates for hospital physician skilled nursing facility home health and other services under prospective payment providers have greater incentive to be efficient because they crs12 are at risk for costs above payments amounts and can profit if costs are below payment amounts in addition to encouraging efficiency through payment methods policymakers can influence spending by changing payment updates for example under the bba congress restricted payment updates for most medicare services to control rapid growth in spending over several years following passage of the bba congress essentially reversed course increasing medicare payments on multiple occasions under the balanced budget refinement act of 1999 bbra pl 106113 the medicare medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa pl 106554 and the mma to ensure adequate reimbursement for health care providers more recently the congress cut payments for various medicare services under the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 increasingly policymakers have looked to private health plans to provide benefits under public programs including medicare medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program some people emphasize the inherent value of offering different coverage options for beneficiaries others argue that greater reliance on private plans will reduce program spending because the plans can provide benefits more efficiently that outcome depends among other things on how much private plans are paid like changes in eligibility and benefits changes in other program features must balance competing goals regarding spending and access to care payment amounts whether for particular services or for all services under health plan must cover the cost of efficiently caring for beneficiaries and payment methods should encourage the provision of adequate but not wasteful care changing tax policy third broad direction changing tax policy focuses more on consumers compared with strategies to change health care or federal programs the tax code currently includes variety of subsidies to help individuals and families pay for health insurance and health care limiting tax expenditures generally has not been policy priority although some taxrelated policy proposals seek to influence consumers use of health care by making them more pricesensitive insurance subsidies the subsidy for employerprovided health benefits is by far the largest tax expenditure for private insurance payments for health insurance are excluded from the income and employment tax base in effect lowering the price of insurance for those obtaining coverage under employersponsored plans23 with the annual cost of such plans averaging 4479 for individuals and 23 for more information on this tax subsidy and others see crs report rl33505 tax benefits for health insurance and expenses overview of current law and legislation by bob lyke and julie m whittaker crs13 12106 for family of four in 200724 and with most households facing marginal income tax rates of 15 or 25 savings can be substantial although tax savings make insurance more affordable the subsidy encourages people to purchase more insurance than they would otherwise having more insurance drives up demand for health care which in turn drives up health care prices and spending in addition the tax exclusion for employer health benefits provides the largest savings to those who least need assistance highincome workers who face high marginal tax rates to address issues regarding demand and equity policymakers and analysts have proposed various changes to tax subsidies for insurance including limiting the exclusion for employerprovided benefits increasing tax benefits for highdeductible health plans and offering tax credits for the purchase of nongroup health coverage two of these approaches might influence health care spending by changing demand for health insurance and health care limiting the exclusion for employer provided benefits could affect the type of coverage employers provide and it could reduce employees demand for policies that are generous compared with the tax threshold similarly increasing tax benefits for highdeductible plans and associated savings accounts may change consumer preferences regarding health coverage in both cases the assumption is that people with less generous coverage will use less health care the third approach offering tax credits for the purchase of nongroup coverage is more about making insurance affordable than it is about influencing health spending depending on the details such credits offer potential advantages compared with the exclusion for employerprovided benefits first credits are less regressive because subsidies are not function of marginal income tax rates second because tax credits need not be tied to employment they provide tool for subsidizing insurance coverage that can reach larger population potential disadvantages of tax credits relate to affordability and access even healthy people may find that credits of 1000 or more are not enough to make insurance affordable in addition because of their health or risk profile some people may not be able to purchase nongroup coverage at any price other subsidies in addition to helping consumers purchase insurance tax subsidies including the itemized deduction for unreimbursed medical and dental expenses and several taxadvantaged accounts help consumers pay for health expenses not covered by insurance like insurance subsidies these subsidies reduce the apparent cost of health care and have the same unintended impact increasing demand prices and spending they also provide larger benefits to taxpayers in the highest brackets 24 the kaiser family foundation and health research and educational trust employer health benefits 2007 annual survey annual premium costs include both employer and worker contributions crs14 the deduction for unreimbursed medical and dental expenses is less regressive than the subsidy for employerprovided insurance because eligibility is related to income taxpayers who itemize deductions can deduct expenses exceeding 75 of adjusted gross income in addition because the deduction covers catastrophic costs some might regard it higherpriority use of limited public dollars variety of taxadvantaged accounts help consumers pay for unreimbursed expenses these accounts health care flexible spending accounts fsas health reimbursement accounts hras archer medical savings accounts archer msas and health savings accounts hsas differ on various dimensions25 but they are more similar than different offering account holders significant flexibility in using balances to cover health care expenses two of the accounts hsas and archer msas were crafted with an eye to limiting the impact of insurance coverage on demand because the accounts must be used in conjunction with highdeductible health insurance plans some believe the combination will encourage consumers to be more prudent in seeking health services the underlying assumption that consumers with savings accounts and high deductible plans will think twice before seeking discretionary health services is worth evaluation although incentives under this arrangement are not completely obvious if consumers accrue large account balances over time will they continue to be price sensitive or will they instead act as if they have firstdollar coverage and will highdeductible plans affect spending at all among consumers with health care expenses that easily exceed even high deductibles conclusion the good news is that policymakers have full toolbox for pursuing goals regarding health care costs and spending they can use government resources and leadership to help improve health care they can change federal programs to influence both access to care and federal spending and they can use tax policy to support and shape the market for health insurance and health care the bad news is that both problems and solutions are complicated does the united states spend too much on health care or not how should society allocate its resources among members and how should policymakers set priorities among competing goals and interests even assuming agreement on these questions the congress faces difficult challenges in choosing the best combination of policy tools for achieving whatever objective is adopted 25 for more
