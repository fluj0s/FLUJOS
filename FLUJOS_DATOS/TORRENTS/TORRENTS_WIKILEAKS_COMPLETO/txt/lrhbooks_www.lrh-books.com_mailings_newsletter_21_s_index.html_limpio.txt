bridge publications inc newsletter date decision the power of decision is actually the power of sanity if you just mercilessly search out of your life in the actions and the common actions of your life all of the maybes on decision level and if you suddenly assert your decisions where you have withheld decisions i can guarantee you that your life will smooth out pretty well if you do that in big office for instance where theres big staff it may very well be that by asserting your decisions they fire you straight out the door thats where you belong then youre lot better off outside that door if this environment has smothered your power of decision you dont belong in it most of the indecision which you will meet in life is strictly based around choice of environment and the ability to exert decision in that environment l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture decision contained in the route to infinity series to be or not to be an article by l ron hubbard from the route to infinity lectures i would like to talk to you about decision decision is you will discover one of the fundamental points of indecision and one of the fundamental reasons why people are sane or insane decision you see decision is short way of saying choice and choice of course is the keynote of selfdeterminism to determine anything you must have the choice to determine choice to determine means that you must have the power of decision automatically you will discoverautomatically in any casethat the one thing that is holding up beingness is indecision maybe in any engram that presents itself to be runin any engram that presents itself to be run there is maybe two choices which are relatively evenly balanced and their even balancing make an irresolution now theres great deal to do with time in decision decision and time have lot in common when we have clean clear decision we have clean clear time and when we have an indecision there is an unclarity about time if you are trying to decide anything and having difficulty in trying to decide that thing the root of its trouble is time not even necessarily data its time theres time hangup there somewhere and if you look for that back of the data usually the data becomes needless decision the basic decision that life makes that theta makes is to be or not to be shakespeares famous line to be or not to be that is the question hamlet was in very very bad condition that day he was hung up on the squarest maybe that anyone can be hung up on if you see someone facing new joba choice of whether or not hes going to continue with his old job or take new jobyou may think that he is resisting change or lot of other things and so on hes not anything i mean he is hung up until he decides one way or the other on beingness situation so that any beingness situation where you had to be or not to be on case becomes itself the most aberrative situation running an engram is really basically only necessary until the preclear has reached of his own volition and evaluation the decision he didnt make hes found the maybe in his life hes found that maybe and having found the maybe it is clearly enough in view so that he can resolve it or evaluate its importance and the rest of the engram will blow itll disappearbecome completely unaberrative postulates are important only because postulates are the root material of decision that is to say you have the decision and you make the postulate to resolve the decision to be or not to be is action or inaction existence or existence l ron hubbard from the lecture decision excerpted from the route to

to these lectures without the data from those lectures the route to infinity i never would have dreamed such wild dream and been able to hold it there until it came true my wife and i have been scientologists for over 25 years for variety of reasons we got stalled on the bridge i was at clear my wife at ot iii although we had the purpose and intention to move up the bridge it just wasnt happening as any scientologist would agree this creates serious failed purpose i started listening to the the route to infinity lectures while in my car driving to and from sales and service calls and key datum that ron repeats frequently began to sink in from my own duplication of lrh it was as follows the mest universe is reality only because we all agree to it but that it is really an illusion and shabby one at that ones own universe is the actuality as thetan slides down the scale he reverses this concept so that his own universe becomes seemingly insignificant illusion the mest universe becomes the reality and that the actuality is lost to that thetan somewhere around the fourth lecture the datum finally sunk in and i cognited on what he was saying that the reason i was so pressed back having my intention blunted etc was because i believed that i could survive only if i agreed with mest until it would permit to survive when i got home i put aside all of the problems i was facing located myself in the room i was in and then created the illusion that i was in fact quite successful in anything i wanted to be that had all of the space i needed and could enjoy the game of life and get up the bridge less than two weeks later i pulled in the money to get going on the bridge again and to do it full time this year i have moved from stalled clear to ot iv my wife has completed ot iv and v and in less than two months we will be going to flag for vi and vii now from this viewpoint i see that i was imprisoned in structure of my own making unable to get out even though i was holding the key in my hand which i had forgotten about and i wasnt even aware that i held anything in my hand without the data from those lectures i never would have dreamed such wild dream and been able to hold it there until it came true i share this data with you with the hope and postulate that you can use the data in these lectures and if you are stuck trapped or blunted on your progress up the bridge i cannot recommend this data highly enough mt ot iv order your set now by clicking here or by phone 800 7221733 send your friends this newsletter sendandsubscribelink
