determin rates the senate bill s 1248 108th cong kept the same general framework as in previous law with several changes the final 2004 idea reauthorization was closer to the senate vers ion and kept many of the previous provisions on attorneys fees but also made several additions these include allowing attorneys fees for the state educational agency sea or the local educational agency lea against the parent or the pare nts attorney in certain situations pl 108446 language relating to attorneys fees3 under the new law the general provisions regarding filing complaint and appeals have not

to harass to cause unnecessary delay or to needlessly increase the cost of litigation8 in the senate debate on the attorneys fees amendment senator grassley stated that the amendment regarding attorneys fees would in way limit or discourage parents from pursuing legitimate complaints against school district if th ey feel their childs school has not provided free appropriate public ducation it would simply give school districts little relief from abuses of the due process rights found in idea and ensure that our taxpayer dollars go toward educating children not lining the pockets of unscrupulous trial lawyers9 senator gregg also emphasized the need for the attorneys fee amendment he noted that the concept th at defendant should be able to obtain attorneys fees when plaintiffs acti ons were frivolous unreasonable or without foundation has been applied to title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 the supreme court in christiansburg garment co v equal employment opportunity commission10 held that prevailing defendant s should recover attorneys f ees when plaintiffs actions were frivolous unreasonable or without founda tion in order to protect defendants from burdensome litigation having legal or factual basis11 senator gregg observed that the standard is very highand prevailing defe ndants are rarely able to meet it and obtain reimbursement of their attorneys fees and that case law directs courts to consider the financial resources of the plaintiff in awarding attorneys fees to prevailing defendant12 the attorneys fee provision also would allo w defendants to recove r fees if lawsuits were brought for an improper purpose in the senate debate nator gregg noted that this concept was drawn from rule11of th federal rules of civil procedure13 and that in interpreting this language from rule 11 courts must apply an objective standard of reasonableness to the facts of the case14 attorneys fees are based on the rates prevailing in the community and bonus or multiplier may be used15 there are specific prohibitions on attorneys fees and reductionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22055crs4 16 20 usc 1415i3d pl 108446 615i3d 17 20 usc 1415f1b pl 108446 615f1b 18

200623 generally the department of education ed declined to elaborate on the statutory language observing that further guidance on the interp retation of this stat utory language is not appropriate since judicial in terpretations of statutory pr ovisions will necessarily vary based upon casebycase factual terminations consis tent with the requirement that the award of reasonable attorneys fees is left to courts discretion24 one of the issues ed declined to address in the regulations involved whether court could award fees to nonattorney advocates who accompanied and advised the parents at due process hearing ed stated that l ay advocates are by definition not attorneys and are not entitled to compensation as if they were attorneys25 ed also noted that the supreme courts recent decision in arlington central school district board of education v murphy26 held that if congress wishes to allow recovery of experts fees by prevailing parents it must include explicit language authorizing such recovery such explicit language was not added in the 2004 reauthor ization of idea the supreme courts rationale was found by ed to be controlling concerning the fees of nonattorney experts and the department of educa tion declined to add regulatory provision on the subject27
