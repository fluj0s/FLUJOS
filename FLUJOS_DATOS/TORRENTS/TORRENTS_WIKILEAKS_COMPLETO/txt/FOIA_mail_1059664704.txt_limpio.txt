from michael mann mannvirginiaedu to tim osborn tosbornueaacuk subject re reconstruction errors date thu 31 jul 2003 111824 0400 tim attached are the calibration residual series for experiments based on available networks back to ad 1000 ad 1400 ad 1600 i cant find the one for the network back to 1820 but basically youll see that the residuals are pretty red for the first 2 cases and then not significantly red for the 3rd caseits even bit better for the ad 1700 and 1820 cases but i cant seem to dig them up in any case the incremental changes are modest after 1600its pretty clear that key predictors drop out before ad 1600 hence the redness of the residuals and the notably larger uncertainties farther back you only want to look at the first column year and second column residual of the files i cant even remember what the other columns are let know if that helps thanks mike ps i know i probably dont need to mention this but just to insure absolutely clarify on this im providing these for your own personal use since youre trusted colleague so please dont pass this along to others without checking w first this is the sort of dirty laundry one doesnt want to fall into the hands of those who might potentially try to distort things at 0258 pm 7312003 0100 you wrote thanks for the explanation mike now i see it it looks familiar so perhaps youve explained it to previously if you have then sorry for asking twice i now understand how you compute them in theory i have two further questions though sorry 1 how do you compute them in practise do you actually integrate the spectrum of the residuals 2 how would i estimate an uncertainty for particular band of time scales eg decadal to secular f00 to 01 if integrating the spectrum of the residuals i wonder whether integrating from f0 to f002 and then f002 to eg f01 note this last limit has changed would give the right error for time scales of 10 years and longer ie for 10yr low pass filter the way i had planned to do this was to assume the residuals could be modelled as first order autoregressive process with lag1 autocorrelation r100 after 1600 essentially white and r1 before 1600 do you know what the lag1 autocorrelation of the residuals is for the network that goes back to 1000 ad the stuff back 2000 years will be interesting though the gcm runs were starting to look at go back only 500 hadley centre or 1000 german groups so mbh99 seems fine for now cheers tim at 1428 31072003 you wrote tim the onesigma total uncertainty is determined from adding the low f and high f components of uncertainty in quadrature the low f and high f uncertainties arent uncertainties for particular eg 30 year or 40year running meanthey are band integrated estimates of uncertainties highfrequency band from f0 to f002 lowfrequency band from f002 to f05 cycleyear taking into account the spectrum of the residual variance the broadband or white noise mean of which is the nominal variance of the calibration residuals alternatively one could calculate uncertainties for particular timescale average using the standard deviation of the calibration residuals and applying squarerootn argument where n is the effective degrees of freedom in the calibration residuals i believed i did this at one point and got similar results let know if this needs further clarification thanks mike ps you might want to try to using mann and jones n hem if youre going back further than ad 1000 crowley has some ebm results now back to 0 ad and is in the process of comparing w that should be interesting at 0204 pm 7312003 0100 you wrote hi mike weve recently been making plans with simon tett at the hadley centre for comparing model simulations with various climate reconstructions including the mbh98 and mbh99 northern hemisphere temperatures i was stressing the importance of including uncertainty estimates in the comparison and that the error estimates should depend on the timescale eg smoothing filter or running mean that had been applied i then looked at the file that i have been using for the uncertainties associated with mbh99 see attachment which i must have got from you some time ago column 1 is year 2 is the raw standard error 3 is 2se but what are columns 4 and 5 ive been plotting column 4 labelled 1 sig lowf when plotted your smoothed reconstruction assuming that this is the error appropriate to lowpass filtered data id also assumed that the last column 1 sig highf was appropriate to highpass filtered data i also noticed that the sum of the squared high and low errors equalled the square of the raw error which is nice but ive realised that i dont understand how you estimate these errors nor what time scale the lowf and highf cutoff uses maybe 40year smoothed as in the ipcc plots from mbh99 it sounds like post1600 you assume uncorrelated gaussian calibration residuals in which case you would expect the errors for 40year mean to be reduced by sqrt40 this doesnt seem to match the values in the attached file pre1600 you take into account that the residuals are autocorrelated red noise rather than white so presumably the reduction is less than sqrt40 but some factor how do you compute this the reason for my questions is that i would like to 1 check whether ive been doing the right thing in using column 4 of the attached file with your smoothed reconstruction and 2 id like to estimate the errors for range of time scales so i can compare decadal means 30year means 50year means etc thanks in advance for any help you can give here tim dr timothy j osborn climatic research
