bayhdole act has been seen as particularly successful in meeting its objectives however while the legislati on provides general framework to promote expanded utilization of the results of fe derally

small business university or other nonprofit institution the legislation is intended to use patent ownership as an in centive for private sector development and commercialization of federa lly funded

of legislative debates over ways to promote private sector development and utilization of federally funded research and development this was soon followed by expanded congressional interest in

bayhdole act was one of the first of these initiatives prior to 1980 only 5 of government owned patents were ever used in the private sector although portion of the intellectual prope rty portfolio had potential for further development application nd marketing the bayhd ole act was constructed in part to address the low utilization rate of these federal patents the house report to accompany hr 6933 the house counterpart to the senate bill that eventually became the bayhdole act noted that at the time the bill was considered 26 different agency policies existed regarding the use of the results of federally funded rd generally the government retained title to inventions made with government support whether the research was performed in federal laborator ies in universities or by individual companies license s to use government patents were then negotiated with firms either on nonexcl usive basis meaning additional companies could use the technology or more rarely for the exclusive use by one manufacturer however it was widely argued that without title or at least an exclusive license to an invention and the protection it conv eys company would not invest the additional and often substantial time and money necessary to commercialize product or process for the marketplace in 1980 the federal expenditure for re search and development totaled 555 billion in constant 2000 dollars2 the money typically was used to support research and development to meet the mission requi rements of the fede ral departments and agencies eg defense public health environmental quality or to finance work in areas where there was an identified need for research primarily basic research not being performed in the private sector while the governments investment led to many new inventions that ve profoundly influenced our society many in congress were of the opinion that add itional applications could be pursued by the private sector if provided the proper incentives the intent of the new law was to replace this situation with single uniform national policy designed to cut down on bur eaucracy and encourage private industry to utilize government financed inventions through the commitment of the risk capitalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32076crs3 3 house committee on the judiciary report to accompany hr 6933 96th cong 2d sess hrept 961307 part 1 3

ibidnecessary to develop such inventions to the point of commercial application3 expanded technology commercia lization was to be accomplished by employing the patent system to augment collaboration between universities as well as other nonprofit institutions and the business commun ity to ensure that inventions are brought to market the bayhdole act also provides for the increased participation of small firms in the national rd ente rprise under the assumption that these companies tend to be more i nnovative than larger companies the patent system brief overview the patent system was created to prom ote invention and i nnovation article i section 8 clause 8 of the us constitution states the congress shall have power to promote the progress of science and us eful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries patents are widely believed to encourage innovation by simultaneously protecting the inventor and fostering comp etition they provide the inventor with right to exclude others temporarily from use of the invention without compensation patents give the ow ner an exclusive right for 20 years from date of filing to further develop the idea commercializ product or process and potentially realize return on the initial investment concurrently the process of obtaining patent places the c oncept in the public arena as disclosure system the patent can and often does stimulate othe r firms or individuals to invent around existing patents to provide for parallel technical developments or meet similar market needs4 not everyone agrees that the patent system facilitates i nnovation critics argue that patents provide monopoly which induces additional social costs others assert that the patent system is unnecessary due to market forces that already suffice to create an optimal level of innovation the desire to obtain lead time advantage over competitors as well as the recognition that technologically backward firms lose out to their rivals may well provide suffici ent inducement to invent without the need for further incentives5 some commentators believe that the patent system encourages industry concentration and presents barrier to entry in some markets and that cross licensing between companies can result in exploitation of other markets6 still other observers believe that the patent system too frequently attracts speculatorswho prefer to acquire and enforce patents rather than engage in socially productive activity 7 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32076crs4 8 federic m

december 14 2002 13 national science board science and engineering indicators 2002 washington continuedthe importance of patents varies among industrial sectors patents are perceived as critical in the drug and chemi cal industries in part because of the ease of replicating the finished product while it is expe nsive complicated and time consuming to duplicate an airplane it is relatively simple to chemically analyze pill and reproduce it8 studies have found that in ma ny other industrie s the protection offered by patents is diminished by the ability to invent around the patent and limited by the disclosure of vital information in the patent itself9 in the aircraft and semiconductor industries patents have not been the most successful mechanism for capturing the benefits of investments instead lead time and the strength of the learning curve were determined to be more important10 later studies bear this out secrecy and lead time were deemed to have greater effect than patents in the semiconductor and relate d equipment industry as well as the aerospace and machine tool industries among others11 patents can provide an economic incentive for companies to pursue further development and commercializa tion studies indicate that research funding accounts for approximately onequarter of the costs associated with bringing new product to market according to the economist dollars worth of academic invention or discover requires upwards of 10000 of private capital to bring it to market12 patent ownership is seen as way to enc ourage the additional and often substantial investment necessary for new goods and serv ices particularly in the case of small business in an academic setting the posse ssion of title to inventions is expected to provide motivation for the university to li cense the technology to the private sector for commercialization in anticipation of royalty payments universityindustry cooperation changes to the patent laws embodied in the bayhdole act had as an

necessary to take the results of research and gene rate marketable produc ts such activities are carried out by industry thus the empha sis in the bayhdole act on the promotion of cooperative efforts between academia nd the business community by providing universities with intellectual property ownership with which to pursue and structure collaborative ventures the legislation is intended to encourage the two sectors to work together to generate new goods pr ocesses and services for the marketplace such joint work allows for shared costs shared risks shared facilities and shared expertise prior to world war ii industry was the primary source of funding for basic research in universities this financia l support helped shape priorities and build relationships however after the war th federal government supplanted the private sector as the major financial contributor and became the principal determinant of the type and direction of the research performed in academic institutions this situation oftentimes resulted in disconnect between the uni versity and industrial communities because the private sector and not the government typically is involved in commercialization the difficultie s in moving an idea from the research stage to marketable product or process appeared to have been compounded thus efforts to encourage increased collaboration between and among the sectors through the bayhdole act were expected to au gment the contribution of both parties to technological advancement small business special consideration concerning patent title was given to small businesses in part because of the role these companies were seen as playing in the generation of new jobs and in technological advancemen t early research supported by several federal agencies concluded that small high technolog companies are the source of significant innovation an often cited 1982 study financed by the small business administration determined that sma ll firms were 24 times as innovative per employees as large companies14 similar work performed at the time the legislation was being considered found that firms of less than 1000 employees were responsible for more major innovations than large fi rms in the years 19531966 and for an equal number from 1967197315 study of national and re gional data by the federal reserve bank of chicago concluded that small firms

37employees create larger proportion of ne w jobs than their share of employment in the economy and continue to create jobs even during recession16 however certain caveats need to be stated particularly within the context of small business innovation and technology velopment over the years experts have argued that the contribution of sma ll firms to the economy is overstated marc levinson writing in duns business month during the 1980s maintained that small companies tended to produce fewer goods than larger ones because they are less capital intensive and on the whole add less to the gross national product because they offer lower salaries and often do not provide health insurance or pension plans17 professors zoltan acs and david audretsch argued that the relationship between company size and innovation capacity varied by industry18 others maintained that there is conclusive evidence that firm size affects the success of rd19 an important factor affecting the ability of small companies to effect technological advance appears to be the relationship between these firms and large corporations concept that is reflected in the provisions of the bayhdole act the corporate contribution and that of the innovative entrepreneur are characteristically very different from one another and characteristically play complementary roles moreover the contribution of the two together is superadditive that is the combined result is greater than the sum of their individual contributions20 study by the national academy of engi neering concluded that small hightech companies play critical and diverse role in creating new produc ts and services in developing new industries nd in driving technological change and growth in the us economy21 the reasons for this include the ability of these firms to rapidly develop markets generate ne w goods and services and ffer product diversity small businesses tend to be willing to take those technological ri sks that

pretty emphatic positive answer that the bayhdole act s created public benefits with minimal costs38 as stated in an article in the economist the bayhdole act is probably the most inspired piece of legislation to be enacted in america over the past half century39 one of the major factors in the reported success of the bayhdole act is the certainty it conveys concerning ownership of intellectual property the director of stanford universitys office of technol ogy licensing katherine ku noted that exclusivity is what motivates firms to invest financial nd human resources in technology development40 it provides an incentive for universities to take the time and effort to pursue patent and to license those patents in its tfolio this has led to significant increase in academic pate

several analysts argue that bayhdole was only one of number of important factors behind the rise of uni versity patenting and licensing activity48 in study of the technology transfer and patenting activities of the university of california stanford university and columbia university professor david mowery and his colleagues concluded that increas ed federal funding for basic biomedical research expanded research in biotechnology specific court rulings and government policies augmenting what can be patented all contributed to the rise in academic intellectual property activities according to their assessment the bayhdole act had little impact on the conten t of academic research the pursuit of patenting and licensing at universities has expanded b ecause of changes in biomedical and biotechnology rd not because of the act49 later work by professor mowery follows this approach arguing that the emphasis on the bayhdole act as catalyst to these interactions increased uni

middletier schools not just the top research universities53 researchers who take this position suggest that the mowery et study focused solely on universities that were previously involved in paten

development of university technologies is an importa nt element in getting those technologies to market mechanisms to ensure ch efforts are an important element of commercialization regardless of whether those mechanisms included licensing by universities59 in addition professor scott shane observes because universities exploit their inventions primarily through the licensing of technology and licensing is not equally effective across all technologiesthe incentive to become more commercially focused led universities to concentrate their patenting in fields in which know ledge is transferred effectively through licensing60 while the effects of the bayhdole ac t on the small business sector have not been as extensively studied the results appear similar all eight small business owners

supported research nd development after profits are generated this is particularly true in the area of pharmaceuticals68 such arguments are similar to those that were identified and considered as part of the original legislative debate over patent policy and coope rative rd the concept of recoupment is based upon the argument that the government should be reimbursed for research and development expenses provided to contractor if the resulting product is brought to the market and gene rates profits proponent s of this approach also maintained that providing the c ontractor with limited time monopoly on the results of federally funded rd through assignment of patent rights should be balanced by compensation for the governments initial investment in the debate over related legislation thens enator robert dole stated on the floor of the senate on april 23 1980 the provision for recoupmen t was intended to insure that the governments investment paid for by the taxpayers of this country is returned to the federal coffer69 during the same debate senator birch bayh argued that payback provision means that in the final analysis the taxpayer will not be out the cost of the research and they also will have the benef it of the product70 such suggestions are based on several fact ors in addition to funding research performed by individual companies unde r certain

modified by th is public subsidization they contend that the public has right to return on its investment however it is argued that this right is not preserved under the patent system which ascribes solely to the patent holder all proprie tary rights and interests in th patented product or process71 to date congress has weig hed these issues and decided that in the case of patent and technology policies the benefits to the nation brought about by increased innovation are paramount the passage of the bayhdole act represented determination that with respect to cer tain types of organizations the economic incentive to realize return on investment provided by patent is necessary to stimulate companies to provide the often substantial financial commitment to turn federallyfunded rd into marketable technologies and techniques this is suggestive of the idea that the promise of large return on investment is precisely the tool sanctioned by the constitution to promote the progress of science72 the decision was based on several determinations deriving fro m the rationale for federal support of basic research the importance of technological progress to the nation and the critical role of private sector comme rcialization in technol ogical advancement federal support for basic research is founded in large part on the understanding that the rate of return to society as whole generated by investments in research is significantly larger than the benefits that can be captured by any one firm performing it73 it has been estimated that the returns to society generated by investments in basic research are approximately twice those to the company performing the work government support reflects consensus th at basic research is the foundation for many innovations but that incentives for private sector fina ncial commitments are dampened by the fact that spending for rd runs high risk of failure even results of fruitful rd often are exploited by ot her domestic and foreign companies thus resulting in underinvestment in research by the private sector the returns from basic research are generally long term sometimes not marketable and not always evident it is now widely accepted that from onethird to onehalf of all us growth has come from technical progress and that it is the principal driving force for long term economic growth and the increased st andards of living of modern industrial societies74 technological advancement can cl early contribute to the resolution of those national problems which are amenab to technological solutions such progress is

provide the academic community an alterna tive way to support further research and the business sector means to obtain retu rn on their financial contribution to the endeavor while the idea of recoupment wa s considered by the congress in hearings on the legislation it was rejected as an unnecessary obstacle one which would be perceived as an additional burden to work ing with the government it was thought to be particularly difficult to administer75 instead congress accepted as satisfactory the anticipated payback to the country through increased revenues from taxes on profits new jobs created improved pr oductivity and economic growth for example from 1980 when the bayhdole act was passed through 2006 5724 new spinoff companies were created nd in 2006 alone 697 new products were introduced into the market by these firms76 the emergence of the biotechnology industry and the development of new therap eutics to improve health care are other prominent indications of such benefits to date these benefits have been considered more important than the initial cost of the technology to the government or any potential unfair advantage government rights royalt free

the sh elf and royalty free ie at discounted price products that happen to incorporat federally funded invention when they are not produced under the governments license77 the study goes on to say that rights in one patent do not automatically permit rights in subsequent related patents78 because the government apparently holds few licenses on the biomedical products it purchases generally throug h the veterans admin istration and the department of defense79 federal officials indicated that procurement costs were best reduced by use of the federal s upply schedule and na tional contracts80 government licenses are used primarily in the performance of research in the biomedical area81 related issue is that of tracking the governments interest in patents resulting from federally funded research and deve lopment in an august 1999 study gao noted that federal contractors and grantees were not meeting the reporting requirements associated with the bayhdole act making it difficult to identify and assess what licenses the government retained among other things82 two years later in followup report gao stated that four of the five agencies had taken steps to insure improved compliance with the law including several new monitoring systems although more needed to be done83 of particular interest is iedison created by the nih which electronically tracks federal

resear ch and facilitate tec hnology transfer and cooperative rd among government industr and academia as well as changes in the way companies obtain the basic research necessary for product development shape the environment within which academic research is pursued thus as argued by katherine ku it is necessary to evaluate criticisms of the bayhdole act and to understand that the success of the law has made many in gove rnment uncomfortable despite the clear guidelines for technology transfer it established85 senior research scholar m ildred cho and her coauthors assert that the bayh dole act has created opportunities for conflict of in terest for university faculty members because academicindustry partnerships can offer direct financial rewards to individual faculty members in the form of consulting fees royalties and equity in companies while simultaneously funding these faculty members research86 this it is argued has resulted in situations where the researchers ties to private sector interests may not be evident and may adversely affect the quality outcome and dissemination of research87 other studies indicate th at obligations to industry pose threat to scientific integrity88 some commentators maintain that private sector funded research tends to generate conclusions favor able to industry however the factor that is primarily associated w ith the withholding or delay of information is the involvement of the scie ntist in bringing his research to market in product not the industrial financing itself89 data collected by professor david blum enthal and his

concerns over the increasing number of academic institutions taking equity positions in andor incubating spinoff companies these actions simply tend to distract the university from its core missions

property has led critics to charge that the bayhdole ac t encourages the patenting of fundamental research which in turn prevents furt her biomedical innovation law professors rebecca eisenberg and

licensing on commercialization and research 262designed to spur innovation rai and eisenberg ma intain that certa in patents hinder the process from their perspective by permitting universities to patent discoveries made under federal funding the bayhd ole act draws distinction between inventions that lead directly to commerc ial products and fundame ntal advances that enable further scientific studies122 these basic innovations are generally known as research tools eisenberg and professor rich ard nelson argue that owne rship of research tools may impose significant transaction cost s that result in delayed innovation and possible future litigation123 it also can stand in the way of research by others broad claims on early discoveries that are fundamental to emerging fields of knowledge are particularly worrisome in light of the great value demonstrated time and again in history of science and technology of having many independent minds at work trying to advance field public science has flourished by permitting scientists to challenge and build upon the work of rivals124 similar concerns were expressed by harold varmus president of memorial sloan kettering and former director of nih in july 2000 prepared testimony he spoke to being troubled by widespread tendencies to seek protec tion of intellectual property increasingly early in the process that ultimately leads to products of obvious commercial value because such practices can have detrimental effects on science and its delivery of health benefits125 while the bayhdole act and scientific advances have helped generate dyna mic biotechnology industry there have been changes that are not always cons istent with the best interests of science126 however as varmus and ot hers acknowledge the remedi to this situation are not necessarily associated with the bayhdole act yales richard levin noted that while some research should be kept in the public domain including research tools the fact that it is privatized is not the result of the bayhdole act but rather the result of patent law made by the courts and the congress therefore he believes that changes to the act are not the appropriate means to address the issues127 other experts agree that many of the issues that are identified today as negative consequences of bayhdole can be traced to the institutional polices of universitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32076crs26 128 sara boettiger and alan b bennet bayhdole if we knew then what we know now nature biotechnology 24 2006 available at httpwwwnaturecomnbtj

decisions permits the patenting of research tools however there have been efforts to encourage the widespread availability of these tools marie freire testified that th value to society is greatest if the research tools are easily available for use in researc h she asserted that there is need to balance commercial interests with public interests129 to achieve this balance nih has developed guidelines for universities and companie s receiving federal funding that make clear research t ools are to be made availabl to other scientists under reasonable terms130 in addition the us patent and trademark office recently made changes in the guidelines used to termine the patentability of biotechnology discoveries studies by professors john walsh ashi sh arora wesley cohen and charlene cho found that although there are now more patents associated with biomedical research and on more fundame ntal work there is little evidence that work has been curtailed due to intellectual property issues associated with research tools131 scientists are able to tinue their research by li censing inventing around patents going offshore the development and use of public databases and re search tools court challenges and simply using the technolog without license ie infringement according to the authors private sector owners of patents permitted such infringement in academia with the excepti on of those associated with diagnostic tests in clinical trials partly because it can increase the value of the patented technology concluding observations the discussion surr ounding change s to the

generated by american companies there remain areas of concern as di scussed above that congress may decide to pursue some argue particularly with respect to pharmaceuticals and biotechnology that under the bayhdole act companies are receiving too many benefits at the expense of the public others particularly in the defense arena assert that the existing rights retained by the government under the act are too restrictive and are an impediment to meeting federal needs but the impact of the legislation is still seen as significant as summed up by howard bremer who was patent counsel to the wisconsin alumni research foundation from 1960 through 1988 one important factor which is often over looked is that the success was achieved without cost to the taxpayer in other words separate appropriation of government funds was needed to establish or manage the effort in fact it has been estimated that the economic benefits flowing from the universities licensing activities adds about 41 billion to the united states economy significant as that dollar amount is it should not be overlooked that university inventions arising as most of them do from basic research have led to many products which have or exhibit the capability of saving lives or of improving the lives safety and health of the citizens of the united states and around the world in that context their contributi on to society is immeasurable132
