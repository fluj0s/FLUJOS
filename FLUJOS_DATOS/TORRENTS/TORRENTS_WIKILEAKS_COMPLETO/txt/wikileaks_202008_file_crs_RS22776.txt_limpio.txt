l3 communications was awarded the jca contract in 2007 this is an update of report by william knight and will be updated as conditions warrant background the joint cargo aircraft jca is small intratheater airlifter being procured by the army and air force small airlifters have filled niche roles for the department of defense dod over the past several decades flying missions to deliver timesensitive cargo transport important personnel evacuate casualties and resupply austere operating locations during the vietnam war the air force flew c123 providers while the army used c7 caribous for intratheater airlift1 source of interservice tension c7 ownership transferred to the air force in 1966 but the air force continued to fly them attached to army units2 with funding scarce after vietnam the air force retired both the c7 and c123 without replacement in the 1980s the air force bought 18 c23 sherpas to move supplies between european bases after the cold war six sherpas were transferred to the army before 40 more were acquired and assigned mostly to army national guard units3 in 1991 the air force purchased 10 c27a spartans for operations around howard afb panama but 1 lt

to consider options to meet army requirements for intra theater airlift5 the armys future cargo aircraft fca program gained dod approval in march 2005 with plans for an initial purchase of 33 fcas fca was intended to replace aging c23s c26 metroliners and some c12 hurons6 reduce reliance on ground convoys in iraq and afghanistan and decrease the heavy workload of the armys ch47 chinook helicopters7

the jca competition in june 2007 raytheon contested dods evaluation of competing aircraft the government accountability office denied both protests12 and subsequently l3 communications was awarded 204 billion firm fixed price contract to build up to 78 c27js 54 army 24 air force13 the rift between the army and air force mentioned above reflects differences in their overall approaches to the intratheater airlift mission as well as continued debate from many others including congress over the roles and missions of each service the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22776 following sections address these differences army intratheater airlift mission joint doctrine does allow each service component to maintain small fleet of aircraft to meet servicespecific needs14 the army states that it plans

army cargo as its role the air force says it will use jca to provide general support airlift for all users joint publications define this as the airlift service provided on common basis for all dod agencies and as authorized for other agencies of the us government and assigns mission responsibility to us transportation command17 under this construct the air force allocates available aircraft to all users in accordance with joint force commanders jfcs priorities the stated goal is efficient use of every aircraft for multiple tasks requirements in 2007 rand conducted an intratheater airlift force mix httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22776 analysis iafma for the air force to determine the optimum composition of the air forces intratheater airlift fleet18 while most details were classified the study determined that c27s were an efficient complement to other intratheater platforms but were not as costeffective as operating the same number of c130js the air force has requested further study on possible mission activity where the c27 may be more cost effective as well as comparisons to precision airdrop systems see next section and recapitalizing ch47s andor c23s19 in addition tactical airlift requirements are part of the mobility capabilityrequirements study mcrs currently in progress and due for release in 200920 other options for intratheater airlift jca critics state that dod already has sufficient options for tactical airlift some suggest the air force could have more versatile system by diverting funds planned for jca into procuring larger tactical airlift models such as c130s and c17s view backed up by the iafma results21 others assert that the armys helicopter modernization program may require 50 larger budget between 20072030 compared with 19862005 16 robert c owen

dollars by modernizing its helicopter fleet22 accordingly the services are also pursuing joint heavy lift program that would replace current largehelicopter fleets and could perform this last tactical mile mission separate but related possibility for accomplishing this mission is precision airdrop system several systems currently in use or under development combine cargo platforms steerable parachutes and gps receivers that allow cargo airdrops from high and relatively safe altitudes to deliver supplies and vehicles with pinpoint accuracy and with runway needed roles and missions some members have questioned the merit of splitting tactical airlift between the army and air force while others have expressed strong support for this approach historically the army has argued for ownership of small fleet of tactical airlifters field commanders often state they need the responsiveness that direct support airlift provides to counter unforeseen contingencies critics characterize this approach as inefficiently creating two air forces others state that the jca simply maintains the status quo in roles and missions for example it is argued that direct support army httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22776 transport helicopters performing timesensitive or missioncritical movement of passengers and cargo create battlefield synergy between efficiency and effectiveness in conducting the joint fight further some point out that the army is responsible for sustaining soldiers within its joint operating areas and believe the army should be able to procure and use the most efficient vehicles truck helicopter fixedwing aircraft to perform this task the crux of the roles and missions debate however is command and control of these aircraft advocates of placing all jcas into the air force point out that presently jfc can apportion tactical airlift into direct support role whenever it is needed the air force has an extensive command and control architecture already established for the air mobility mission in any theater centralized control of all air assets is the primary tenet of this construct army commanders however normally function in an environment of decentralized control that would allow them to instantly task their own assets but may leave the aircraft idle when not needed the army proposes that its aircraft would be made available to the commonuser airlift pool when not needed in direct support role but it is not clear that it is committed to obtaining the necessary command and control systems architecture mentioned above to ensure the aircraft are both visible and usable by joint commander lastly critics may question the air forces longterm commitment to the direct support role pointing out the air force has retired its last four small tactical airlift aircraft without replacement when asked about his preference in the jca debate general norton schwartz then commander of us transportation command questioned whether the air force was willing to support the army in the manner the army wants to 22 congressional budget office paper modernizing the armys rotarywing aviation fleet november 2007 p vii crs6 be supported for example he asked is the air force willing to attach tactical airlifters to an army brigade commander when required23 legislative actions fy2009 the president requested 2642 million to procure seven c27js for the army 54 million for advanced procurement for the air force 3 million for army research development testing and evaluation rdte and 268 million for air force rdte the 2009 defense authorization act supported the army portions of the request but cut all of the advance procurement funds and 10 million of rdte funds from the air force request house authorizers hrept 110652 pointed to the results of the aforementioned iafma as one cause for removing funds and questioned the lack of analysis done to justify air force procurement of jca appropriators pl 110329 also supported the army funding while removing the air force advance procurement funds and 10 million in rdte money that was unexecutable fy2008 the president requested 157 million for army procurement and 423 million for air force rdte house authorizers hrept 110146 supported the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22776 request but stipulated that dod could not obligate funds until requirements analysis was complete senate authorizers srept 11077 also supported the funding request but transferred funds from the army into the air forces procurement account and questioned the armys need for an organic fixedwing airlift fleet stating if there were pattern of the joint forces air component commander jfacc providing support that did not match the priorities of the joint forces land component commander jflcc that would certainly argue for intervention of the joint forces commander to correct the situation it would not be persuasive argument that the jflcc should have his own air force24 the 2008 defense authorization act restored army procurement funds but directed dod to conduct roles and missions review pl 110181 appropriators supported the presidents request for procurement but cut 213 million
