federal budget process that includes budget resolutions appropriations regular supplemental and continuing bills rescissions and budget reconciliation bills the process begins with the presidents budget request and is bounded by the rules of the house and senate the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 as amended the budget enforcement act of 1990 and current program authorizations customarily each of the 13 individual appropriations bills is considered and processed as discrete measure on occasion however congress may choose to bundle these bills into an omnibus appropriation containing two or more initially discrete appropriations bills each of these bills is then represented as separate title within the omnibus measure fy1999 funding for broad range of government programs is contained in the omnibus appropriations bill hr 4328 originally introduced to fund the department of transportation dot and related agencies based on the conference report hrept

related agencies summary for fy1999 the us department of transportation dot requested total funding of approximately 43 billion 1 increase over the fy1998 enacted level of 39 billion the fy1999 budget request for the dot was similar in many respects to the fy1998 appropriation there are many macro issues or factors that are influencing the debate over the administrations fy1999 budget request some of them have been carried over from the previous fiscal year complicating the budget process had been the delay associated with reauthorizing many of the departments programs the recently concluded reauthorization of surface transportation programs will dramatically effect the fy1999 appropriations process the transportation equity act for the 21st century pl 105178 tea21 provides for an increase in spending at level above that contemplated in the administration budget request in addition the new legislation provides new budget environment for highway and transit programs that limits the ability of the appropriations process to alter spending for these activities in its fy1999 request the administration reiterated that safety is its highest priority followed by technology development environmental enhancement infrastructure needs and innovative financing the budget proposal included requests of 31 billion for direct safety funding 300 billion for infrastructure investments 11 billion for transportation research and development rd and 06 billion for amtrak see crs issue brief 97030 on july 15 1998 the senate committee on appropriations reported s 2307 srept

bar the use of federal funds to impose project labor agreements on highway and transit fund projects compromise substitute was offered the house appropriations committee reported its own bill hr 4328 hrept 105648 which would have provided total of 469 billion an amount 48 billion greater than fy1998 and 39 billion greater than the amount requested by the administration the committee voiced its objections to the impact of tea21 legislation whose firewalls significantly limited its latitude in funding according to the report these firewalls make it virtually impossible for the appropriations committee to make downward adjustments to those funding levels in the annual appropriations process over the next 5 years by july 31 both the house and senate had passed their respective bills the

of 428 billion hearings on the budget request were held in transportation subcommittees of the house and senate appropriations committees in related development many of dots surface transportation programs were recently reauthorized by the transportation equity act for the 21st century generally referred to as tea21 pl 105178 june 9 1998 both the house hconres 284 and the senate sconres 86

departments surface transportation agencies ranging from the national highway traffic safety administration to the coast guard the impact of its provisions have been addressed in other sections of this report on july 15 1998 the senate committee on appropriations reported out s 2307 department of transportation and related agencies appropriations bill for 1999 srept 105249 the report recommends 13694249000 of new budget obligational authority for the department of transportation this amount represents approximately 340000000 more than the administrations request and almost 1 billion more than the enacted amount for fy1998 in conjunction with 32234800000 estimated obligation limitations generated from trust funds the total obligational authority is approximately 459 billion on july 24 with few substantive floor amendments the senate passed its version of the dot appropriations for fy1999 one provision relatively controversial between the administration and congress however was dropped from the legislation that provision which drew veto warning from administration officials would have barred the use of federal funds to impose project labor agreements on highway and transit fund projects substitute amendment appears to have served as compromise permitting passage crs2 on july 22 1998 the house appropriations committee reported hr 4328 hrept 105648 the bill provides for total of469 billion new budget authoruty guaranteed obligations contained in the tea21 limitation on obligations and exempt obligations for fy1999 this amount is 48 billion greater than fy1998 enacted levels and 39 billion greater than the administrations fy1999 request on july 30 1998 the house passed hr 4328 also with few substantive amendments hr 4328 was referred to the senate which amended the bill by inserting s 2307 after the enacting clause on september 17 1998 the house and senate passed hjres 128 continuing resolution to fund until october 9 1998 any government activity that would have otherwise been funded by an annual appropriation following the enactment of five subsequent continuing resolutions the house passed the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act for fiscal year 1999 on october 19 1998 on october 21 the senate passed the same measure the conference agreement provided approximately 47 billion in fy1999 for federal transportation programs an amount 12 greater than the fy1998 funding 9 more than requested by the administration and about150 million more than that included in the house bill the amount for some dot programs including federal highways and mass transit was virtually insured by funding firewalls that had been placed in the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 for the complete legislative text of the omnibus act as it appears in the october 19 1998 congressional record members and staff should see the following internet web site httpwwwclerkwebhousegov introduction transportation budgeting uses confusing lexicon for those unfamiliar with the process of budget authority and contract authority the latter form of budget authority1 contract authority provides obligational authority for the funding of trust fund financed programs such as the federalaid highway program prior to tea21 changes in spending in the annual transportation budget component had been achieved in the appropriations process by combining changes in budgetcontract authority and placing limitations on obligations the principal function of the limitation on obligations is to control outlays in manner that corresponds to congressional budget agreements 1 much of this section was taken from crs report 98749 entitled the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 and the federal budget by john w fischer september 4 1998 crs3 contract authority is tantamount to but does not actually involve entering into contract to pay for project at some future date under this arrangement specified in title 23 usc which tea21 amends authorized funds are automatically made available to the states at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligated without appropriations legislation appropriations are required to make outlays at some future date to cover these obligations as will be discussed tea21 greatly limits the role of the appropriations process in core highway and transit programs because the act sets the limitation on obligations level for the period fy1999 through fy2003 highway and transit grant programs work on reimbursable basis states pay for projects up front and federal payments are made to them only when work is completed and vouchers are presented perhaps months or even years after the project has begun work in progress is represented in the trust fund as obligated funds and although they are considered used and remain as commitments against the trust fund balances they are not subtracted from balances trust fund balances therefore appear high in part because funds sufficient to cover actual and expected future commitments must remain available both the highway and transit accounts have substantial short and longterm commitments these include payments that will be made in the current fiscal year as projects are completed and to much greater extent outstanding obligations to be made at some unspecified future date additionally there are unobligated amounts that are still dedicated to highway and transit projects but have not been committed to specific projects two terms are associated with the distribution of contract authority funds to the states and to particular programs the first of these apportionments refers to funds distributed to the states for formula driven programs for example all national highway system nhs funds are apportioned to the states allocated funds are funds distributed on an administrative basis typically to programs under direct federal control for example federal lands highway program monies are allocated the allocation can be to another federal agency to state to an indian tribe or to some other governmental entity these terms do not refer to the federal budget process but often provide frame of reference for highway program recipients who may assume albeit incorrectly that state apportionment is part of the federal budget per for fy1999 the dot requested total funding of 43259 billion about 10 increase from the fy1998 enactment of level 42828 billion the departments fy1999 budget request was similar in many respects to the fy1998 appropriation the agencies targeted for gains include in descending order the maritime administration 353 the national highway traffic safety administration 2192 research and special programs administration 16 federal aviation administration 70 federal railroad administration 26 office of the secretary 24 and the us coast guard 2 those whose budget request were reduced for fy1999 included in descending order st lawrence seaway development corporation 100 federal transit administration 138 the budgets for the office of the inspector general and the surface transportation board are set at the fy1998 level crs4 figure 1

be the allocation of funds for the us department of transportation among numerous competing national interests competition for these funds stems from various transportation interests and from the modal administrations themselves seeking portions of the transportation pie monies have been allocated for diverse array of purposes for example to pay for the expenses of the us coast guard to improve safety across the transportation system and to help finance various infrastructure needs in the dot and related agencies appropriations act monies are also provided to support the national transportation safety board and the surface transportation board stb and several other transportationrelated agencies2 the perennial question of priorities surrounds the appropriations process throughout its budget request the dot continues to emphasize several priorities including safety infrastructure innovative financing environmental enhancement technology and national security much of the appropriations process must take place within the newly enacted framework of the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 signed into law on june 9 1998 pl 105178 hr 2400 the act which authorizes appropriations for key transportation programs through the fiscal year 2003 emphasizes certain programs and deemphasizes others the general sense of congress appears to be that although transportation trust funds are not sacrosanct proceeds from the gasoline tax must be targeted towards the maintenance of the vast us highway and transit network and not viewed as source of revenue for the general treasury although attempts to move highway and transit programs off budget were unsuccessful congress did insert language within tea21to protect specific funding by creating fire walls around programs in addition to spending ceilings the fire walls effectively create floors the creation of these devices emerged as point of contention between authorizers and appropriators surface transportation infrastructure policy the administration requested total of approximately 300 billion for fy1999 this requested increase occurred in spite of the limitations placed on domestic discretionary spending by the balanced budget act of 1997 since many discretionary budget allocations were reduced the increase in transportation infrastructure spending is regarded as strong policy statement on the part of congress and the clinton administration that infrastructure is policy priority in each of its budget submissions the clinton administration has sought to emphasize its commitment to improving the nations infrastructure increased 2 dot proposed that the surface transportation board stb be fully funded by user fees in fy1998 the stb and its predecessor the interstate commerce commission have never been fully funded by user fees for further information see crs report 9667 entitled the surface transportation board stb an overview and selected public policy issues by stephen j thompson crs6 infrastructure spending to enhance national productivity and competitiveness was policy feature of both of the presidents election campaigns the administrations fy1999 budget request is predicated on continuation of this policy at least in spirit the administration makes the case in its budget document that the fy1999 budget request would compliment the spending increases that have occurred earlier in this decade3 the administration view is that transportation infrastructure spending at the 300 billion level envisioned in its request would provide the highest level of infrastructure spending in dot history in addition the administration takes considerable credit for some improvements in transit capacity airport capacity and highway condition that have occurred in recent years finally the administration contends that it has accomplished all of these advances and provided for future improvements in fiscally responsible manner in reality the administrations fy1999 request is very similar to the levels of funding provided in the fy1998 act this is very much the result of the balanced budget act of 1997 the administration request has now been somewhat superceded by passage of tea21 by signing this legislation the administration has agreed to somewhat higher level of spending for surface transportation in fy1998 then it had proposed earlier in the year in addition the administration has agreed to much higher levels of spending in the period fy1999fy2003 one of the principal provisions of tea21 is change in the budget treatment of the highway and transit programs this new legislation sets limitation on obligations for program spending in each of the next 6 fiscal years and does so by creating fire walls that prevent reductions in spending below agreed upon levels this action deprives the house and senate appropriations committees of their traditional authority to determine the absolute level of spending for these programs instead the committees now control spending of only small portion of the highway and transit programs over the last several years the administration has attempted to find more funding for infrastructure by changing the way infrastructure was financed to accomplish this objective in fy1999 the dot proposed to continue supporting state infrastructure banks sibs at the 150 million level and to finance new transportation infrastructure credit program at the 100 million level for fy1998 the sib program combines federalstateprivate funding to help finance variety of transportation improvements such as toll roads and intermodal terminals although the sib program had been adopted by 10 states with an additional 15 expressing interest the program was reduced to four states by language in tea21 examples of innovative financing include proposed new transportation infrastructure credit program intended to leverage federal dollars and encourage private sector investment in projects of national significance that may be too large to attract local capital4 the administration also is trying to improve the efficiency of 3 us dot budget in brief fy1999 p 8 4 us dot budget in brief fy1997 p 5 crs7 federal funds distribution in dollar terms however the administrations efforts to promote innovative financing represent small portion of the total dot budget technology the administration proposed to spend about 11 billion on transportation research development and technology activities during fy1999 this amount represents about 10 increase over the fy1998 level for those activities the support of research and technology activities is not goal in and of itself but it underpins the other functions of the department for example dot seeks to apply the results of its research and development activities to improve safety enhance mobility further an intermodal transportation system promote economic growth and trade and support national security the three largest components of the fy1999 research development and technology budget request are for fhwas program 582 million faas program 334 million and nhtsas program 53 million increased investment in research and development continues to be key theme of the clinton administration and this emphasis has been reflected in the departments budget during the last few years it remains difficult to decide on the amount of funds for the numerous rt activities at the department especially when these decisions are considered within the context of the other funding needs dot is involved in variety of technology programs including the partnership for new generation of vehicles the national advanced driving simulator and the advanced technology transit bus one of the largest rt activities is the intelligent transportation systems its program the fy1999 request for this multifaceted activity that involves each of the surface transportation modes within the department is 250 million these funds would support comprehensive research and demonstration program and deployment initiative that initiative is designed to stimulate investments in variety of its technologies such as traffic surveillance crash avoidance systems and safety monitoring for commercial motor vehicles the actual amount of fy1999 contract funds authorized for its is set in the tea21 law for fy1999 that act provides 95 million for research development operational tests and other activities considered to be part of the core departmental its program tea21 also authorizes 105 million of contract funds for its integrated deployment projects the overall highway obligation limitation will reduce the amount of funds actually made available for those activities pl 105277 provides total of 200000000 to be available for implementation of the various its program specified in tea21 with an obligation limitation of 883 percent for fy 1999 that amount is effectively reduced to 1766 million the federal railroad administration requested that funding for the next generation of high speed rail program be reduced from about 20 million in fy1998 to about 126 million in fy1999 the senate appropriations committee recommended 28494000 for this program for fy1999 the coast guard requested 18 million for research development testing and evaluation funds were requested for technologies materials and human factors research to improve the coast guards mission performance and delivery of services to the public crs8 safety safety continues to be claimed as the departments highest priority dots request for various transportation safety programs for fy1999 is 31 billion an 11 percent increase over the fy1998 level substantial increases are requested for the safety activities of several modal administrations including the federal aviation administration the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa and the federal highway administration each year debate continues over the perennial question regarding funds for safety relative to other functions of the dot dot sought to promote public health and safety by working toward the elimination of transportationrelated injuries deaths and property damage funding was requested to increase safety using variety of approaches including rulemaking compliance efforts public education and outreach and direct operations such as vessel traffic services in fy1999 some of the activities intended to achieve the departments safety goals include requesting additional personnel for the fras office of safety promoting publicprivate partnerships to demonstrate costeffective safety technologies such as intelligent vehicles and advancing research exploring causes of and countermeasures for transportation incidents in all modes of transportation spending for nhtsas highway safety programs was intended to increase by 22 from 333 million in fy1998 to 406 million in fy1999 increased funding for grants and research to improve the protection of automobile occupants was requested 31 million was proposed for the presidents initiative to increase seat belt use and 102 million was proposed for safety systems research which supports improvements in vehicle structures and occupant protection the 1998 department of transportation appropriations act provided 186500000 for obligations for highway traffic safety grants and 146962000 for operations and research for total of 333462000 for nhtsas activities the conference bill ultimately provided 1594 million for nhtsa operations and research and 3614 million total for all of nhtsas activities tea21 sets specify contract funding levels for the various traffic safety grants administered by nhtsa tea21 also sets an authorization level for nhtsa section 403 research program and for nhtsas various motor vehiclerelated activities which together form much of the operations and research account of nhtsa consequently tea21 will likely have substantial impact on setting the overall nhtsa budget and appropriation during fy1999 through fy2003 pl 105277 provides 159400000 for nhtsas operations and research account and 2000000 for the national driver register and limits obligations for highway traffic safety grants to 200000000 other factors the debate on the fy1999 budget request has focused partly on the administrations funding priorities some members however chose to focus their interests on other priorities such as local needs for roads transit and airports the debate leading to passage of tea21 is indicative of these concerns passage of this legislation has created new issues for the appropriations process primary among these is the new budgetary treatment of highway and transit spending the tea21 crs9 limitation on obligations for these activities restricts the ability of the transportation appropriations committees ability to meet their 302b goals by requiring all that all adjustments in spending be made in other program categories finally enactment of the government performance and results act gpra has compelled dot along with other agencies to reconcile their spending requests and programsprojects with their more fundamental strategic and performance goals major funding trends table 2 shows historical funding levels for fy1988 through fy1998 actual and enacted and fy1999 request for the department of transportation almost all of these funds are provided by new budget authority or limitations on obligations in the dot appropriations act5 total dot funding increased approximately 66 from fy1988 through fy1998 enacted the following information from dot shows actual estimated and requested appropriations obligations limitations dod transfers and exempt obligations subject to the appropriations process in millions of dollars according to dot spokesperson this information does not include user fee collections consequently program totals may vary from other figures cited in the text 5 starting in the early 1990s about 300 million of the funds shown in table 1 were transferred from the dod appropriations budget to dot these monies are used to support coast guard activities the amounts requested for fy1998 are provided in table 3 crs10 table 2 department

43259 coast guard httpwwwuscgmil the administration requested 41 billion for the coast guard in fy1999 this was up 22 over fy1998 and maintains the same trend since fy1996 the budget request would have allowed the coast guard to continue its activities against drug smuggling and to recapitalize aircraft and vessel fleets to meet the presidents national security goals of this amount 28 billion would have been for operation and maintenance of wide range of ships boats aircraft shore units and aids to navigation including 309 million in defenserelated funding the administration requested 67 million to train support and sustain ready military selected reserve force of 7600 members for direct support to the department of defense and to provide surge capacity for responses to emergencies such as cleanup operations following oil spills other coast guard requested funding included 61 million for spill cleanup and initial damage assessment available without further appropriation from the oil spill liability trust fund funds were requested for boat safety grants because these would be funded from appropriations from the aquatic resources trust fund the senate appropriations committee recommended 37 billion for the coast guard 11 less than the budget request but 09 more than enacted for fy1998 crs11 of this amount operating expenses would be funded at 28 billion including 300 million in national security activities scored against defense funding environmental compliance and restoration 21 million retired pay 684 million and reserve training 67 million would be funded at the level of the request acquisition construction and improvements would be decreased from the request from 4426 million to 3887 million and research development test and evaluation would be decreased from 183 million to 175 million the house passed an appropriation of 3887 billion for the coast guard which is 294 million less than fy1998 operating expenses were funded at 27 billion including 300 million in national security scored against defense spending this would also include 406 million for drug interdiction activities which is an increase of 338 million over the presidents request increases in this area would be offset by reductions in fisheries law enforcement and polar ice breaking acquisition construction and improvements were funded at 389 million and environmental compliance and restoration at 21 million 684 million was appropriated for retired pay and 69 million for reserve training research development test and evaluation would receive 12 million the conference agreed to an appropriation of 39 billion for the coast guard which is 210 million less than fy 1998 operating expenses were funded at the house level of 27 billion of which 300 million shall be available for defenserelated activities this is 154 million less for operating expenses than fy 1998 however the secretary may transfer funds from the federal aviation administration operations account not to exceed 717 million for drug interdiction activities acquisition construction and improvements is funded at 3955 million of which 20 million shall be derived from the oil spill liability trust fund there was disagreement between the houses over either environmental compliance and restoration or retired pay the houseapproved levels of 69 million were appropriated for reserve training and 12 million for research development test and evaluation alteration of bridges received 14 million and funds were appropriated for boat safety federal railroad administration fra the administration requested 751 million for the federal railroad administration for fy1999 compared to fy1997 actual obligation of 11 billion and an fy1998 enactment of 937 million the most notable reduction 172 million from the fy1998 amount was the lower request for funding amtrak crs issue brief 97030 and the northeast corridor the northeast corridor is the rail route from boston to washington dc the house appropriations committee recommended 7293 million for fra for fy1999 including 6092 million for amtrak the senate recommended 707 million including 555 million for amtrak congress appropriated 7498 million to fra for fy1999 including 6092 million for amtrak and allowed amtrak to decide how much of its appropriation will be used to upgrade the northeast corridor crs12 amtrak httpwwwamtrakcom amtrak see crs issue brief 97030 receives its funding as part of the fra account the administration requested that fy1999 funding for amtrak come from the federal highway trust fund rather than from the general fund as in past years the administration requested 621 million for capital grants to amtrak of which not less than 200 million would have been for the northeast corridor and 12 million for penn station in new york city the administration requested funding for operating grants for amtrak for fy1999 proposing that sufficient operating funds could come from capital grants the house recommended 6092 million for amtrak for fy1999 plus 2 million for third freight track in rhode island to give amtrak separate line from freight and 153 million for next generation high speed rail that would remove grade crossings on rail passenger routes and provide other funding that benefits rail passengers the senate recommended 555 million for amtrak for fy1999 this was total of 16 billion when coupled with the 11 billion amtrak will receive in fy1999 without further legislative action as result of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 the committee bill s 2307 included language to allow the capital funds provided in the bill to be spent under the same definition of capital expenses that currently pertains to federal capital funds provided for other transportation modes this use of capital funds for capital expenses could come to 400 million during fy1999 according to the committee report srept 105249 pp 120121 the committee recommended that 200 million of the 555 million be used for upgrading the northeast corridor the new york pennsylvania station is to get 40 million as result of the tea21 highway reauthorization legislation pl 105178 congress appropriated 6092 million to amtrak for fy1999 and allowed amtrak to decide how much of that will be used to upgrade the northeast corridor the committee report rejected the proposal to allow amtrak to use capital grants for equipment maintenance in the same way federal transit funds can be used but the report set specific limit on the amount of federal capital grants that amtrak can use for equipment maintenance during fy1999 the funds are to come from the general fund as in past years rather than from the highway trust fund as proposed by the administration congress appropriated funds for the penn station redevelopment in new york city congress appropriated 205 million for next generation high speed rail and 5 million for the rhode island freight rail project amtrak reform council the amtrak reform council established by the amtrak reform and accountability act of 1997 pl 105134 is given additional responsibility by the report language of the senate appropriations committee for fy1999 the council is directed to help amtrak reach its financial goals and decrease reliance on federal aid by identifying which amtrak routes are candidates for closure or realignment and the council is directed to report this information to congress annually p 25 the council is prohibited by the committee report language from using any of the councils appropriation to pay for outside consultant services since the report states the members of the council were selected because crs13 of their technical qualifications professional standing and demonstrated expertise in areas related to the needs of the council p 24 congress appropriated 450000 to the amtrak reform council for fy1999 the conference report is silent on the above issues that are addressed in the senate committee report federal highway administration fhwa httpwwwfhwadotgov the highway section of the fy1999 appropriations act provides an obligation limitation of 255 billion for highway program activities this is an increase of over 40 billion over the fy1998 act and is consistent with the levels authorized by the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 an additional 12 billion in exempt obligations is provided by the act6 the fy1999 act provides for few modest changes in the highway program but generally follows the program guidance provided in tea21 one important provision in the act is clarification of tea21s distribution of high priority project funds the act gives the states considerable leeway in their treatment of these funds and allows the states to set overall priorities without having to treat each high priority project as separate pot of money finally the act provides funding in the transportation section for the appalachian highway program the act also provides some highway funding in the emergency supplemental portion of the omnibus act these provisions provide an additional 100 million for alabama and massachusetts that had been promised to these states during the tea21 conference further highway funding from this section is provided for west virginia and arkansas some of these funds are for the appalachian highway program the total level enacted for fy1999 is well above what had been proposed by the clinton administration 235 billion with limitation on obligations of 215 billion is identical to the fy1998 level as mentioned above tea21 and its accompanying technical corrections establish an fy1999 limitation on obligations for all highway activities including safety of approximately 255 billion the limitation on obligations could not be changed by the appropriations process and the act provided specific unamenable funding levels for all major highway programs appropriatorss had the ability to make specific decisions about number of smaller highway and highway safety programs the senate committee on appropriations bill set core spending at the tea21 limitation on obligation level total fhwa spending was just over 270 billion the committee did make number of recommendations about spending for particular activities for example fhwa operating expenses were increased over the fy1998 level but not to same degree as proposed by the administration the committee also made number of recommendations about the its program aimed primarily at 6 exempt program spending is used for the emergency relief and minimum allocation programs crs14 increasing spending for actual its projects as opposed to its promotion finally spending for the appalachian highway system was set at 2000 million this is 1000 million less than the fy1998 level and below the spending level that could be supported by tea21 the house committee on appropriations also respected the tea21 fire walls for core highway spending total funding for fhwa was set at 267 billion which is somewhat below the senate level much of this difference can be accounted for by the committees decision to zero out funding for the appalachian highway system and new transportation infrastructure credit program that had received 800 million in the senate bill federal transit administration fta httpwwwftadotgov the fy1999 act provided total of 539 billion for the fta this exceeded fy1998 funding by 5490 million an increase of more than 11 almost all fta programs with the significant exception of the operating assistance program received funding increases operating assistance funding was eliminated under formula grants by tea21 however preventive maintenance previously eligible for funding from operating assistance is now an eligible use under an expanded capital grants program several transit programs have been controversial almost since their inception especially the operating assistance program recent administrations beginning with the reagan administration have proposed reductions andor outright elimination of these programs transit tends to be supported on local basis with the majority of support coming from urban areas support for sometimes competing highway programs is seen as having much broader base especially because of the absence of transit systems in rural areas transit programs have continued largely due to strong congressional support from members representing urban areas for fy1999 the clinton administration proposed slight decrease in total fta funding over fy1998 levels 478 billion essentially the administrations proposal would have consolidated most of the existing programs into 36 billion formula program the administrations proposal would have consolidated the discretionary bus and bus related program and fixed guideway modernization program into the formula grants program all funding for this program would have come from the transit account of the federal highway trust fund only the fixed guideway modernization formulas would have been retained as separate component of the consolidated program the new starts programs renamed the major capital investment program would have continued to allocate discretionary funds for fixed guideway systems new start funds would have been increased to 8760 million over the fy1998 level of 8000 million the clinton administration proposed one new initiative for access to jobs and training which was included in the recentlypassed tea21 the full senate and house appropriations committees passed their versions of the fy1999 transportation appropriations act respectively on july 14 and july 22 1998 the house and senate transit proposals recommended the same funding levels crs15 for fy1999 539 billion an increase of 549 million over fy1998 these funding levels were enacted into law on october 21 1998 under the omnibus appropriations act of 1999 hr4328 pl105277 the major capital investment program was increased to 23 billion from the fy1998 level of 20 billion an increase of 128 this included 9028 million each for new starts and fixed guideway modernization and 4514 million busbus facility for fy1999 the formula grant program was set at 285 billion or 350 million over the fy1998 level of 25 billion an increase of 14 this included 25 billion for urbanize area grants 50 million for clean fuel vehicle grants 67 million for elderly and disabled grants 188 million for nonurbanized area grants 2 million for rural transportation grants and 48 million for the alaska railroad for fy1999 other funding included 75 million to

activities research engineering development this account is funded at 150 million which is 140 million less than the budget request most of the reduction is the result of congress denying 90 million in direct funding and approximately 45 million in indirect funding for the flight 2000 program9 the decision to not fund this program was based on determination that the faa was not yet ready to begin such an ambitious and expensive undertaking had not decided on the sites for the project and had not achieved industry consensus10 full funding is provided for aircraft safety technology including 15 million for aging aircraft research also in this account is 417 million for explosives and weapons detection research which is 22 million more than the request grantsinaid for airports airport grants are limited to 195 billion which is 250 million above the presidents request only 975 million of the limit is available however until an faa reauthorization bill is enacted in the next congress the

administration nhtsa httpwwwnhtsadotgov the national highway traffic safety administration was established as separate organizational entity in the department of transportation in march 1970 the agencys responsibilities include establishing minimum safety standards for automotive equipment serving as clearing house and information source for drivers identifying and studying emerging safety problems and encouraging state governments to enact laws and implement programs to reduce drunk driving and encourage the use of safety devices for fy1999 the agency requested an appropriation of 406 million up from 333 million enacted for fy1998 of the total about 233 million 25 increase and this year expressed as an obligation limitation will be devoted to highway traffic safety grants although the appropriation for the nhtsa represents small portion of the total dot budget successful implementation of its programs could be instrumental in saving significant percentage of the 150 billion lost to highway deaths injuries and property damage annually one of the agencys programs to encourage the use of seat belts has been bolstered by the recent presidential seat belt initiative also nhtsa has encouraged the establishment of uniform 008 blood alcohol concentration bac level senate and house reauthorization proposals took significantly different approaches for convincing the states to enact 008 bac levels the senate s 1173 recommended more stringent approach by reducing the basic allocations and apportionments for construction projects to the states the house however recommended safety grant program to induce states to adopt 008 the house prevailed in conference the senate committee on appropriations in its report on s 2307 acknowledged number of nhtsa initiatives including the state alcohol incentive program mentioned above other programs included increased seat belt use side impact standards and other occupant protection programs although air bags are not specifically mentioned in the committees report it does encourage continuing work to develop an appropriate child crash dummy to better assess the effectiveness of crash protection devices which would include air bags in conference congress provided total funding for nhtsa of 3614 million an amount 28 million greater than the fy1998 enactment but 445 million less than that requested by the administration for fy1999 the conference bill gives the agency 1594 million for operations and research this represents an amount 124 million above its fy1998 amount but less than half of its requested 25 million increase for this program it also permits additional obligations from the highway trust fund of 135 million 200 million total for highway safety grants versus the 33 million requested and provides 2
