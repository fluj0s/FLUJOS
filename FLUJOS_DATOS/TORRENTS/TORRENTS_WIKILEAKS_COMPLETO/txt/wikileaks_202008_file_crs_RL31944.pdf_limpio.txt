international political economy foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31944iraqs economy past present future summary for most of its history the government of iraq has played an active role stimulating and directing the iraqi econom this pattern was most pronounced during the recent regime of saddam hussein which was at root centrallydirected command economy with some trappings of market economics and crony capitalism iraqs industrial sector was created in larg part as result of government efforts to diversify the economy through economic velopment projects using the proceeds from iraqs oil wealth and borrowed funds many of these initiatives were not viable without government subsidies much of th industrial base has now been destroyed either by direct attack in the iraniraq or the two gulf wars or through atrophy caused by neglect iraq has suffered absolute declines in gross domestic product gdp chronic inflation wholesal depreciation of its currency virtually nonexistent foreign investment and the accumulation of crushing debt burden this report which will be updated periodically identifies issues to be addressed before iraq can participate normally in th world economy it will need civil peace and new legitimate govern ment hague and geneva conventions place limits on the capacity of an occupying power to restructure or develop the economy of an occupied state by its own d ecisions alone it will need sound monetary system and marketoriented banking and finance sy stem it will need to recast its i ndustrial sector on sounder principles with attention to productivity and rela tive prices it will also need to ensure that the government cannot use the massive oil revenues passing through its hands to establish once again new authoritarian regime should iraqs oil fields be restored to their prewar conditions iraq could re enter the world oil market as one of the largest suppliers generating up to 24 billion in annual revenues it has large undeveloped potential long term it may be the worlds largest oil producer generating even larger export revenues perhaps doubling or more its income within decade how iraq uses this prospective oil wealth and its effect on the rest of th economy will be concern at present its oil revenue will go into the internationa llyaudited development fund for iraq iraqs agricultural sector is small output during the 1980s was stimulated by incentives and subsidies but production gged and imports supplied most of the countrys agricultural needs during the 1990s through poor practices iraqs farmland was heavily damage d by salinization years will be required to rebuild iraqs agricultural productivity in the m eantime iraq will rely on imports to meet its agricultural needs as result among other things urbanization will increase iraq has large foreign debts with estimates ranging from 42 billion plus unpaid interest since 1991 to 64 b illion and 78 billion this does not include 1980s warloans from gulf or other arab stat or war damage claims most of the debt stems from the iraniraq war or from loans incurred before 1990 to fund consumer needs and industria l or infrastructure projects the earlier sanctions regime and the security c ouncil resolution of may 22 2003 sh ield iraq against action by its creditors and claimant s to settle claims the issu will need to be resolved before normalization of iraqs international trade and financial relations can occurhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31944contents introduction 1 government and the economy 2

introduction1 this report provides information on the ec onomy of iraq in the recent past and on current postwar conditions it also discusses issues and factors which will likely influence iraqs future economic prospects in the 1980s iraq had one of the arab worlds most advanced economies though buffeted by the strains of the iraniraq war it had besides petrol eum considerable industr ial sector relatively well developed transport system and comparatively good infrastructure iraq had relatively large middle class per capita income levels comparable to venezuela trinidad or korea one of the best educational systems in the arab world well educated population and generally good sta ndards of medical care nevertheless iraq was centrally directed command ec onomy that was heavily dependant on oil revenue to fund its key institu tions and its development pr ogram iraq experimented in the late 1980s with priv atization functional autonomy for some elements of the economy and limited use of market forces this initiative ended however with the advent of the first gulf war in the dozen years since 1991 iraqs i ndustrial and agricultural capacity has decayed its transportation and infrastruct ure systems have deteriorated and the education levels and standard of living for its popula tion have declined oil exports resumed under the oil for food prog ram offp after 1995 albeit at lower rate however its production capacity teriorated from lack of inputs some economic facilities were damaged in the recent war and its chaotic aftermath in effect iraq must start over as it rebuilds its economy its massive oil resources can serve as an engine of future growth and development it does not start though with blank slate the experience expectations and aspirations of the past will have important if unknown effects on iraqs fu ture economy what iraq learns from its past and how it adapts itself for the future will be important considerations an important feature of centrally pl anned economies such as iraq under saddam hussein is the absence of the legal political economic and regulatory institutions that are the necessary underp inning of successful market economies according to dani rodrik prominent velopment economist in the long run the main thing that ensures convergence with the living standards of advanced countries is the acquisition of highquality institutions2 institutions are the rules of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31944crs2 2 continued httpwwwksgharvardedurodrick 3 prepared by alfred prados specialist in middl east affairs foreign affairs defense and trade divisiongame the sets of rules nd norms that organize societ and allow market economy to function thus the focus of the iraqi reconstruction efforts must be the creation of institutions that not only stabilize the economy but can serve as an engine for sustained longterm growth iraq will need to learn how to build and maintain good institutions and how to use them effectively to rebuild its economy this report provides background on the diffe rent sectors and institutions of the iraqi economy it also identifies some questions and issues which may have significant bearing on iraqs future prospects and may need to be addressed as iraq the united states and the international co mmunity seek to put the economy of iraq on sounder longterm foundation government and the economy3 the history of iraq during the 20th century falls into three fairly distinct periods 19211958 constitutional monarchy under direct british control at first and later under significant british influence 19581968 series of nominally republican regimes headed bymilitary officers who assumed power in most cases through military coup detat 1968 2003 government controlled by the socialist panarab baath party which quickly deve loped into vehicle for oneman rule by leading party official saddam hussein the constitutional monarchy government during the first period britain established monarchy in iraq under king faysal i leading member of the prestigious hashemite family of which collateral branch continues to govern jo rdan in 1932 iraq became an independent country but the bilateral treaties replacing the br itish mandate provided for continued british role in iraq particularly in defense and foreign affairs rising opposition to iraqs western ties and moun ting nationalist sentiment among younger iraqis including the armed forces created growing disaffection from the regime in july 1958 group of army officers led coup in which the king and leading officials were killed many other officials imp risoned and repub lic was proclaimed economic policies economic institutions developed slowly during the early years of the iraqi monarchy as the nascent government sought to establish itself and deal with internal tensions and ripple eff ects of world war ii with the advent of mounting oil revenues in the 1950s iraqi were able to concentrate to greater degree on the nations economy at this time ir aqs economy was largely marketorientedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31944crs3 4 see for example phebe marr the modern history of iraq boulder

nd traditional rather than on modern principles development board estab lished in 1950 promulgated multiyear plans that emphasized three prio rities agriculture including irrigation and flood control transportation and communications and c onstruction commentat ors have praised the board for using most of the countrys oil income for capital investment and infrastructure development some fault it however for overemphasizing agriculture and underemphasizing industry and human resources which would have appealed to two increasingly important constituents the educated elite and the workers4 by neglecting these groups the government may have contributed to ward the climate of disaffection that helped bring on the revolution in 1958 although political opposition appears to have been more important factor in the demise of the old regime the military regimes governments three military leaders governed iraq in succession during the decade that followed the overthrow of the iraqi monarchy by leftwing nationalist army officers the somewhat eccentric general abd alkarim qasim who led the coup of 1958 terminated iraqs ties with th west withdrew iraq from the baghdad pact and aligned iraqi polic ies to considerable degree with those of the soviet union steady erosion of his power base sapped by growing domestic unrest including the beginning of kurdish in surgency and regional quarrels led to second coup in which qasim was overthrown and killed in february 1963 qasims successors generals abd alsalam arif and abd alrahman arif5 took somewhat more moderate positions on regional and international affairs established better relations with other middle eastern states particularly egypt under then president gamal abd alnasser and adopted more friendly stance toward the west while retaining ties to the soviet union howeve r the arif regimes faced further domestic instability the kurdish insurgency continued to simmer and the government lost much of its credibility as did other arab regimes after israel quickly defeated arab armed forces during the sixday war in june 1967 year later on july 17 1968 the arif regime was overt hrown by the baath party economic policies the revolutionary reg imes of 19581968 reversed many of the economic policies of the old re gime although like the monarchy they continued to devote major resources to transportation and communications as well as military modernization gene ral qasim the first of th military rulers and his key advisors were influenced by socialist m odels and emphasized veral themes which bore this stamp planned

only those areas currently in production iraq subsequently nationalized the company itself in june 1972 land reform perhaps the most significant of qasims economic measures was an ambitious undertaking designed to break up the old feudal system of land ownership and redistribute land to peasants howev er implementation was slow as the government sought to put in place the necessary machinery to administer the program one commentator has said the early reform measures did more to destroy the edifice of the old regime than to construct the founda tions of the new6 basic economic policies inaugurated by qasim continued under his two successors although at somewhat slower pace the arif governments adopted additional measures to increase the role of the public sector in the economy in july 1964 it nationalized all banks and insurance companies and in the same month it nationalized the 27 largest privately owned industrial firms the government also reorganized other companies required profit sharing with workers and participation by workers in management these and similar measures contributed toward capital flight and departure of tr ained management with an accompanying decline in industrial development during the 1960s the baathist regime government baathist leaders quickly estab lished one party rule by the early 1970s saddam hussein dynamic but ruthless party offici had consolidated his control over the party leadership and government apparatu s in 1979 saddam hussein replaced the aging president ahmad hasan albakr as president of the republic and in several ancillary positions saddams position as president was endorsed in 1995 and 2 002 by ritual majorities of 996 and 100 respectively parliamentary life suspe nded after the overthrow of the monarchy in 1958 was nominally restored in 1980 when new law established an elected 250member national assembly however most observers have characterized iraqs post1980 assemblies largely as rubber stamps after period of interna tional strain in the ear ly 1970s saddam mended fences with most middle east countries in th later 1970s nd 1980s and reestablished relations with the united states in 1984 trade relations flourished with the united states which like the conservative ar abian peninsula monarchies regarded saddams secular regime as bulwark against the militant clerical regime that came to power in iran in 1979 us concerns over iran in the 1980s tended to obscure saddams poor human rights record illustra ted by brutal campaign of repression and forced resettlement of his kurdish population and his fforts to develop weapons of mass destruction meanwhile the inconclusi ve iraqiran war which lasted eight years and resulted in tota l of perhaps million

years of his rule and in line with the socialist principles of the baath party saddam followed economic policies similar to those of the preceding military regimes the government employed central economic planning to manage its resources expenditures were divided into three categories government operations budget an investment budget and an annual import budget flush with mounting oil reve nues iraq was able for some years to pursue its socialist model without having to make hard choices between solvency and other priorities such as welfare benefits infrastructure development and even armed forces modernization one commentator obs erves that in the early years of the baathist regime the responsibility of th state was not so mu ch to allocate scarce resources as to distribute the wealth and economic planning was concerned more with social welfare and subsidization than with economic efficiency7 growing economic burdens resulting from the protracted iraqiran war led saddam to change course in the midtola tter 1980s abandoning to some degree the socialist ideology that had dominated baathi st thinking in the past he embarked on more pragmatic course of economic re form in june 1987 speech by saddam exhorted provincial governors that f rom now on the state should not embark on uneconomic activity that year the gove rnment abolished labor law that had guaranteed full employment laid off t housands of government workers many of whom were foreign nationals transferred other civil service workers to factory jobs and took steps to privatize governmentown ed enterprises including bus companies gas stations agricultural ente rprises department stores and factories in an even more profound departure from the three pr evious decades iraq i officials announced in late 1987 that the government would ffer inducements for foreign companies to operate in iraq by easing former rest rictions on foreign direct investment iraqs invasion of kuwait and its afte rmath dramatically altered the economic scene in iraq henceforth iraqi efforts were concentrated on circumventing the international sanctions imposed as consequent of the invasion taking advantage of the oil for food program and obtaining additional assistance through humanitarian donations illicit trade and private barter arrangements this twilight economy might well have lasted for

while most arabs in the south are shiite there are also small christian communities particularly near mosul as well as other small groups such as the sabian and yazidis12 while the majority of iraqi muslims are shiite sunnis are disproportiona tely represented among iraqs wealthy muslims the predominance of sunnis in iraqi political economic and defense institutions goes back to the ottoman period and continues to be major grievance of the shiite community the government of saddam hussein sought to mold from these disparate groups common sense of ir aq nationality it was successful in part during the iraniraq war as few shiites we nt over to support the iranian side despite commonalities in religion whether that id entity is strong enough to weather the current difficulties remains to be seen the answer to that question will have considerable bearing on iraqs future economic and political prospects role of women in the gove rnment and economy of iraq13 iraq has mixed record in its treatment of women under the relatively secular baathist regime women enjoyed signifi cantly more privilege s and opportunities at least in theory than they did under some traditional regimes that

shape the future of iraq iraqs economy in recent years macroeconomic policy and conditions15 the structure of the iraqi economy has been characterized by heavy state control and involvement since the time of the ottoman empire according to one source different governments from the british mandate and the monarchy to baathist rule and saddam hussein have all had the common goal to fix prices and to stabilize consumption16 government control of the economy tightened from one regime to the next nevertheless an underlying goal was to satisfy the large sector of the population that was employed by and depe ndent on the state during the 1970s hard choices were avoided as il revenues financed devel opment projects and obscured economic mismanagement resulting from state control of the economy the eight year war with iran drained the economy of its surplus oil revenue and forced the regime into debt the first gulf war and economic sanctions impos ed new constraints on an already crippled economy economic st atistics were considered state secrets during the baathist regime and were suppre ssed or not kept at all such fragmentary data that do exist indicate that the iraqi economy since

predominance of the state in the economic affairs of the nati on was confirmed by seri of expropriations and nationalizations in the 1950s and 1960s in agriculture expropriation of land occurred faster than redistribution to th detriment of that sector the petroleum industry was nationalized in stages from 1961 to 1973 largescale industry banking insurance and services were na tionalized in 1964 these nationalizations also enabled the government to weaken rival power centers whether landlords the shia business community or foreign oil companies from 1968 the baathist regime placed gr eater emphasis on the industrialization of the economy the government embark ed on two fiveyear development plans between 19701980 the first plan was primarily concer ned with economic independence the final nationalizations in the oil sector and investment in that sector the modesty of the goals reflected consolidation period for the regime and in part the lack of money to achieve more far

nearly 142 billion on economic developmen t often indiscriminately heavy industrial complexes such as the petroche mical complex at basra the iron and steel mill at khor alzubair the development of sulphur and phosphate extraction and processing and the fertiliz er industries were deve loped during this period much of this industrial structure was not effectively utilized after the outbreak of the war with iran in 1980 due largely to the shortcoming of iraqs administrative apparatus direct attacks on iraqi indus try around basra were less significant than the iraqis inability to obtain inputs spare pa rts or to export oil or other products due to damaged ports iraqi ec onomic management during th war was predicated on belief that iraq could fight quick nd limited border war without

embarked on series of economic reforms designed to make the economy more flexible and more marketdriven in 1987 it removed price controls on commodities it priva tized several sectors of the economy either by selling assets directly to domestic investors through public offerings on the newly constituted baghdad stock exchange or through longterm leases of state assets the most prominent of these divestments was ir aqi airways in which majority of the enterprise was sold off to the public it also lowered or removed state subsidies to enterprises remaining in g overnment hands and for agri culture the countrys labor law which largely guaranteed lifetime em ployment was abolis hed and thousands of white collar officials of state enterprises we re laid off the government also eased direct investment restrictions allowi ng limited foreign ownership of investment projects this last reform reflected the increasing unwillingness of western creditors to loan money directly to the iraq i government for development projects20 these economic reforms did not long surv ive the end of the iraniraq war by 1989 the economic crisis deepened and exacer bated the decline in living standards for most iraqis creating threat to the viability of the regime21 in addition the success of the privatization program was disappointing w ith many enterprises sold for under either book or replacement value w ith the economy facing dire straits the government reimposed price controls ren ationalized some state enterprises and raised industrial and agricultural subsidies the first gulf war and the subsequent sanctions wreaked havoc on an already distressed economy the bombing campa ign of 19901991 severely damaged or destroyed much of the petroleum trans portation power and indus trial infrastructure the government initially channeled its efforts to repairing the oil infrastructure communications and the state security apparatus it instituted rationing program to spread available food and consump tion items however government policy essentially has been reactive because the sanctions regime and the regimes priorities left little for reconstr uction and development of the ec

currency aided by oil revenues and rising foreign exchange reserves some of this reput ation may be attri butable to the decision by the national bank of iraq in the 1950s to maintain 100 reserves behind outstanding domestic currency30 the official rate was variously set between 3 per dinar to 338 per dinar in the 1970s the last official rate of 311 per dinar was set in 1982 during the 1970s the official and markets rate s generally corresponded and by 1980 the country had 35 billion in foreign exchange reserves by 1987 that figure had fallen to 2 billion31 the currency depreciated steadily during the iraniraq war and the pace of descent quickened after the first gulf war one estimate had the currency depreciate from 4 to 8 dinars per dollar in 19909132 the advent of sanctions paradoxically stabilized the currency for brief time as foreign exchange transactions virtually ceased however the onset of limited food and dicine trade under sanctions renewed the downward slide th dinar reached an alltime low of 2660 per dollar in december 1995 it has slowly appreciated from that low yet has fluctuated widely from 1000 to 2300 dina rs per dollar in the period 19972001 on the black market although the regime did not alter the official exchange rate it acknowledged the rate differe ntial in 1999 by allowing state banks to exchange hard currency at the rate of 2000 per dollar the depreciation of the exchange rate in the 1990s was enhanced by capital flight and migration the restrictions of the sanctions regime on exchange transactions and th progressive dollarization of the economy up to the 1980s the country ran consiste nt balance of payments surpluses with oil sales producing increasing foreign exchan ge reserves while the earnings of the oil fields allowed the government to implement development plans without becoming indebted the dependence on oil revenue also had ss salutary effects on other sectors of the economy with increased income

the period 19962001 however another source estimated that consumer price inflation gradually dec lined from about 200 to about 60 due to the reappearance of goods as result of the oil for food

state sect or employees whose sa laries did not keep up with inflation two decades of high in flation at times hyper inflation also led to the loss of confidence in the dinar as store of value this led to the widespread dollarization of the economy ma ny iraqis also sought to convert their liquid assets into other asse ts real estate and gold goods were purchased and hoarded when available and

always participated in its deliberations even after 1991 there are t oo many unresolved issues to attempt reliable analysis of future iraqopec relationship although many factors point toward iraqs continuing opec participa tion in addition to opec membership being an accustomed situation there is the fact that iraqs geographic neighbors are all participants and its stake in the world il market will grow as exports expand and that opec offers an oil price security blanket as well as voice most recently effectual in price deter mination looking further forward in time opec could be useful to any efforts by iraq to reach th preiran wars production levels of 35 mbd an amount that opec would most likely act to accommodate however the length of time it might take to ge t production up to that level is matter of speculation given current difficulties in iraqs oilfields from us perspective iraqs return to opec as fullfledged cartel member would not dovetail with stated policy of encouraging nonopec supply sources if the united states establishes broad c ontrol over iraqs oil industry during its rebuilding phase it seems unlikely that iraq will be able to participate in opec strategy and

could iraqi oil ex ports generate that depends on such variables as how much total production can be achieved domestic consumption world market prices and to what extent iraq can participate in international oil markets without driving down market prices th last variable depends at least in part on how and if opec makes room for iraqi exports the volatile history of oil prices is an important part of iraqs revenue equation this parameter has fluctuated almost as much as the volume of iraqi exports since the iraniraq war for iraqs economy th combination of price and quantity and its unpredictability provide some real uncertainty about monies that might be available for reconstructi on and development these imponderables weigh on the monetary contribution of oil to iraqs economy oil can be potent revenue generator and iraq has the potential to pr oduce and export more oil than it ever has in the recent past what might the future hold for iraqi crude production while there are many imponderables were these unknowns to be resolved over time in manner favorable to developments supporting greater explo itation of already known proven reserves future crude output

was major agricultural export market for the united states during the prior regime due to drought lack of inputs poor met hods and weak administration iraq had been unable to achieve agricultural production levels near its potential after 1991 the irrigation system fell into disrepair and much of the irrigated cropland in central and southern iraq was severely damaged by salinization several years will be needed to remedy the situation in the meantime iraq will rely on imports once again for most of its agricultural needs absent strong agricultural sector population movements from rural

sanctions period 1990 to 2003 under the sanctions regime adopted in 1990 the importation of agricu ltural products was not banned however foreign companies were prohibited from investing directly in

attained in 1992 nd again in 1993 however agricultural productivity suffered for lack of fertilizers agricultural machinery and the means of spraying planted areas with pesticides anecdotal evidence suggests that the 1991 gulf war resulted in significant damage to the irrigation and transportation infrastructure vital to iraqs agricultural sector but it is difficult to evaluate the ex tent or severity of the damage iraqs irrigation infrastructure fell into disrepair and salinity has spread across much of the irrigated fields of central and southern iraq once seve re salinization has occurred in soil the rehabilitation pr ocess may take several year s according to fao officials71 in addition rural areas were left with severe labor shor tage further hurting agricultural productivity according to the us census bureau in 1991 iraq experienced 37 decline in population as an estimated 663000 persons died or left the country following the first gulf war72 much of this exodus included foreign guest workers from the agricultural sector iraqs poultry and livestock populations were devastated by the loss of rangeland to grain crops and the drop off of feed gr ain imports and veterinary medicines needed for routine control of sites and diseases 1997 screw worm epidemic and 1998 outbreak of footandmouth disease re sulted in further losses of animals by the mid1990s severe macroeconomic problems related to the international sanctions led the government to end most support to the sector and instead to implement austerity measures that further curtailed agricultural investment declining food availability re sulted in significant rise in malnutrition in iraq particularly in the center and south of the country73 by 1996 iraq agreed to terms for

cereal production in iraq with the acti on of the security council on may 22 2003 lifting trade and financia l sanctions on all nonmilitary goods iraq will be able to import food and needed agricultural i nputs however political stability and increased internal security will also be necessary before iraqs agricultural sector witnesses significant investment and gr owth restoration of the irrigation infrastructure including l ongterm desalinization program as well as the grain marketing infrastructure for handling storin g and distributing agricultural inputs and outputs will be vital in addition the deve lopment of viable agricultural research and extension service to develop and di sseminate improved vari eties and successful production practices are needed to restore agricultural productivity clearly iraq will be dependent on im ports for meeting domestic food demand for several years to come in the long term after the economy has regained its viability and vibrancy market forces and international competition will likely be the driving forces behind iraqs agricultural trade patterns historical trade and food consumption patterns suggest that food grai ns such as wheat and rice feedstuffs including corn barley and protein meals vegetable oil sugar meat and dairy products are all likely to be important imports into iraq banking and financial institutions74 iraq has never had what most western analysts would call marketoriented banking system neverthele ss before 1991 it had one of the most modern financial systems in the arab world the government created most of the countrys financial institutions with the exception of some pr ivate banks established after 1988 iraqi banks seem to have gotten most of their funds not through borrowing in the market or from deposits but from allocations from the national treasury access to capital and financial services seems to have been determined more by political factors than by independent considerati ons of creditworthiness pr ofit and risk between 1991 and 2003 government control over the iraq i financial system tightened further75 iraqs banking system was limited until the 1930s by the size of its economy and the small level of savings in 1936 the government created an agricultural and industrial bank which split in 1940 into two separate institutions other specialized banks for real estate mortgages and c ooperatives were created in the 1940s and early 1950s commercial bank the rafi dain bank was created in 1941 it also served for few years as the central bank stateowned institution the national bank of iraq was founded in 1947 it b ecame the central bank of iraq in 1956 one of the earliest arab monetary authorities the rafidain bank was for many yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31944crs28 76 the rafidain bank was the only commercial bank in the country til 1988 and it remained the predominant institution thereaft er some analysts have questioned whether it was truly independent of the central bank fo r most of their history both were owned and controlled by the government with assets of more that us17 billion in 1983 the rafidain bank was reportedly the largest arab commercial bank in 1982 according to one report the american banker newspaper named rafidain the worlds fastest growing bank in early 1989 rafidain ranked number 83 in the world with 545 billion in assets in 1996 it had 152 local branches and nine branches abroa d given the strength of the iraqi economy during this period it seems likely that much of the capital to fund the banks operations came from government or from regime sourcesthe only commercial bank in the country76 its original ownership is unclear in 1964 all iraqi banks and insurance firms were nationalized the governments specialized banks were consolidated at that time into separate institutions for agriculture industry and real estate the industrial bank made loans to both public and private sector firms and held equity positions in several publicprivate jointstock companies government policy evidently played major role in its decisions and those of the other specialty banks in the early 1980s for example the industrial bank was instructed to expand its lending to private and stateowned firms in order to promote development the real estate bank meanwhile was instructed to increase its lending in order to promote the cons truction of housing and to encourage more people to build their own houses until the late 1980s iraq had one of the most modern financial systems in the arab world it reportedly helped jordan and perhaps others establish their own central banks the rafidain bank was shareholder in several europeanarab consortia banks and one of the seven founding shareholde rs of the gulf international bank regional commercial ba nk founded in 1977 in 1981 rafidain created joint venture bank with banco do brasil w ith capitalization of us175 million in 1987 its own capital base was doubled to id 100 million as the first stage in plan to expand the national banking system in 1988 the iraqi government announced that another commercial institution the ra shid bank would be created also at capitalization of id 100 million to compete with the rafidain bank some sources report that rafidain emphasized foreign c onnections while rashid focused more on the domestic economy the government seem s to have been the source of the new capitalization for both banks the government also encouraged more competition among the three stateowned insurance firms the

1964 decree nationalizing all financial institutions according to recen t reports there were 17 privately owned banks in iraq in 2002 the role of the pr ivate banks is unclear given the legal

nd autonomy implicit in the legalization of private banking in 1988 seems to have b een overtaken by events most of the countrys overseas assets were impounded frozen in october 1992 or shifted to escrow accounts this made it very difficu lt for iraqi financial institutions to operate internationally the post 1991 sanctions regime and th oil for food program also centralized financial control within iraq in the hands of the government and the international bodies administering the syst em iraqi banks had little access to capital other than through official channels much of the lending by these institutions in the past decade seems to have been based mo re on personal or political connections than on normal banking principles in many cases it is not clear that these were in fact loans which the borrowers were expected to repay since the end of the recent war most of iraqs banks have been severely battered by looting the central bank and other banks have been thoroughly looted by officials of the former regime as well as by postwar thieves77 the financial capacity of iraqs banks and their ability to continue operations may be in serious doubt for its part the rafidain bank served durin g the 1970s and 1980s as the governments principal agent for borrowing funds abro ad after 1990 it became the principal venue through which saddams govern ment defaulted on its foreig n debts the bank was sued by most of the countrys creditors for collection of those debts it is in effect bankrupt in april 1993 british liquidation experts informed creditors meeting in london that the liquidation of the rafidain banks internationa l operations would yield only minimal recovery transportation and infrastructure78 iraqs transportation and infrastructure systems have deteri orated

sanctions aside from the internal weaknesses in the sector war and sanctions also crippled iraqi manufact uring during the iraniraq war most industry escaped direct damage from iranian attacks however much of the industrial infrastructure was sidelined by the inability to obtain intermediate inputs and spare parts due to interference with shipping nd damage to ports as the conflict dragged the government concentrated its resour ces on military industrialization projects and this emphasis contributed to the decision to privatize some state industries in 1988 in the manufacturing sector approximately 50 state operations were sold to the private sector or listed on the baghdad stock exchange many of these entities were sold at well below what was considered market cost84 much of the industrial infrastructure that survived the iraniraq war was destroyed or severely damage d by bombing during the first gulf war the khor zubair heavy industry complex was heavily hit and although some reconstruction work has occurred it has not operated si nce for industries not destroyed the sanctions regime in effect between 1990 and 2003 closed off the possibilities of obtaining inputs or spare parts or expo rting manufactured pr oducts legitimately reconstruction efforts did not concentrate on the revitalization of the manufacturing sector but rather focused on the more lucr ative oil industry and on instruments of the regimes power85 prospects the future outlook for the manuf acturing sector is clouded most facilities have been destroyed by war or degraded by sa nctions few new inputs have been put into the sector sine 1990 iraqi manufacturing is saddled with aging if not damaged equipment and infrastructure the capacity and skills of the labor force have deteriorated over time in addition much of the economic rationale for iraqi industry has evaporated since much of the capacity built in the 1970s and 1980s was based on national prestige import substitution or other nonmarket considerations new policies to fac ilitate and encourage the growth of industry on better and more sound foundations will be needed given th large size of the urban population and the

source united nations international trade data the sixmonth ceilings on oil sales we re raised from 2 billion to 53 billion in 1998 and abolished altogether in 1999 this allowed iraq to export and import without limit so long as it complied with the screening process despite this iraqs oil exports ran significantly be low capacity in 2001 and much of 2002 due in part to disputes between iraq and the over the formula for pricing iraqs oil iraq imposed surcharges of about 3050 cents per barrel on its oil buyers resulting in illicit kickbacks that the government llegedly used to buy unapproved goods in september 2001 the sanctions co mmittee changed the pricing formula to retroactive pricing in an attempt to block the surcharges this policy reduced iraqs oil sales by about 25 although the noted rebound to previous sales levels by september 2002 in addition ir aq has sometimes unila terally interrupted the sale of oil to protest s ecurity council policy or to ch allenge the united states and its allies for example iraq suspended its oil sales for the month of april 2002 in protest of israels military incursion in the west bank imports prior to the implementation of the

at 66 billion from 19972001 countries receiving illicit exports allegedly in cluded syria turkey and jordan94 prospects since so much of its gdp depends on oil exports iraqs economic prospects are linked to its ability to pump oil given the deterioration and current disarray in the manufacturing and agriculture sectors it does not appear that iraq will be able to produce sizable quantities in either sector for export any time soon indeed it appears that imports in the near term will need supply much of the countrys demand for food other agricu ltural products and many manufactured goods reconstruction and improvements in iraqi comp etitiveness may diminish this situation in the next few years if the country pursues appropriate policies and establishes adequate incentives for nono il economic activity in the meantime as discussed in the section on petroleum bove iraq seems poised to became major exporter of oil to the world market some experts believe that it can double its capacity to 6 million barrels per day within decade95 fiscal levies on foreign trade96 quantitative data are available on iraqs past revenues from dutie s taxes or fees on imports or exports likewise there is little information available on government revenues in general the future iraqi governments fiscal system will have to be built from the ground up the size of the governments fiscal needs and their financing will depend on the prospective activities of the government as reflected in the budget the extent to which iraq will rely on duties or taxes on foreign trade as opposed to other domestic and foreign sources of revenue such as income and business taxes eg on petroleum andor its products various fees foreign assistance to finance such activities as well as their scope is matter yet to be decided by iraqis future governing authorities speculatively the obvious source of fore igntrade related fiscal levy would be an export tax or duty on crude petroleum andor its products traditionally the most important component of iraqs foreign tr ade similar levies on other exports would not be likely source of significant revenue because of the small share they hold in iraqs exports moreover at least in the short to medium run in certain areas the availability of output for export will be m odest because of past deterioration of production facilities nd the damage caused by recent wars httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31944crs38 97 prepared by jeremy m sharp analyst in foreign affairs rhoda margesson analyst in foreign affairs and curt tarnoff specialist in foreign affairs foreign affairs defense and trade divisiona likewise less likely source of significant if any traderelated fiscal levies would be iraqs imports which consist mainly of articles for basic personal consumption food medicine and inputs fo r agriculture and industry and for the rehabilitation of iraqs economy the obvious br oad need for imports of this type and the ultimate locus of the burden of such taxation the general public would make this approach somewhat counterproductive it would also lead to increases in the prices of such commodities with their concomitant inflationary effect this may have negative impact on the countrys non oil economy see discussion below in the matter of any levies on domestic ndor foreign transactions in petroleum and its products some consid eration would have to be given to certain aspects of world petroleum trade in view of the ove rall uniformity of the world prices of such products for instance an export levy could not be passed to the importer but would have to be absorbed by the exporter if iraqi petroleum is to remain competitive on the world market another aspect to be considered in this context is iraqs membership both of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and of the organization of arab petroleum exportin g countries oapec and their role in iraqs petroleum exporting policy and activities the postwar situation97 assessing the damage rebuilding the physical and social infrastructure of iraq is necessary prerequisite to the functioning of the ir aqi economy in addition to fixing utilities and transportation the governme nt must be able to assure the basic welfare of its citizenry through adequate food supplies medical care and security arrangements this cost of the reconstruction will likely be borne by the newly constituted government of iraq through oil revenues by national and multilateral aid organizations and by the iraqi people themselves critical infrastructure although the united states did not target much of iraqs electrical water and telecommunications infrastructure during the war collateral bombing damage and the chaos wh ich ensued following the downfall of the saddam hussein regime has prevented coalition forces and local iraqis from rapidly repairing and restoring vita l services such as electr icity water sanitation and telecommunications some of iraqs power plants were looted after us forces entered baghdad power lines also have b een damaged and in some instances were deliberately cut down by looters in ba ghdad several towers which hold up high voltage power lines were wrecked by bombing and central dispatch center that coordinates the alloca tion of electricity was ravaged by looters most of all many employees of iraqs electricity system have been to afraid to go back to work forcing coalition forces to have to find vital electric engineers and other employees of iraqs electricity system in order to restart servicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31944crs39 98 over the last several years some interna tional carriers in violation of sanctions had started offering flights to baghdad the water supply in iraqs main cities also was damaged bot h during and after the war even before the war iraqs wate r system was old and decrepit as nearly 40 of all water is lost due to leaky pipelines the war exacerbated this situati on in baghdad there were breaks in the main water line that required repairs before residents could receive water service some of iraqs water and sanitation infrastructure was damaged by looters in the days and weeks following the cessation of heavy fighting the lack of electricity has had an impact on water service as engineers have had to rely on generators to power water st ations many sewer treatment plants are not func tioning allowing sewage to drain into water systems there also has been garbage collection service other than local efforts in neighborhoods to collect and dispose of trash in an effort to disrupt iraqi communications during the war coalition forces bombed iraqs telephone exchanges cutting off telephone service for many iraqis some telephone lines also ar down due to combinati on of war damage and post war looting iraqis with satellite phones which were banned under saddam husseins regime can make long distance calls and ve begun charging other iraqis for calls abroad outside the kurdish area iraq has mobile phone network transportation infrastructure iraqs roads bridges and highways were not seriously damaged during the recent war however the war and the ensuing civil unrest have disrupted the distribution of fu throughout the country many drivers of gasoline tankers have st opped making shipments due to the insecurity on the roads this has caused shortages and long lines of cars waiting for gas at fuel stations the port of umm qasr iraqs main outlet to the persian gulf and only deep water port was only partially damaged during the war british and australian forces continue to sweep it for mines but massive dredging and rebuilding are required to prepare the port for large cargo ships team of port management specialists and engineers are reported assessi ng the damage and determin ing what needs to be done to make it operational for the di stribution of humanitarian aid damage to iraqs airports varied during the war during the first gulf war iraqs national airline iraqi airways had lost many of its planes some of which it had flown to safety in neighboring stat furthermore in ternational sanctions preclude incoming commercial flights from flying into iraq some legal experts believe that these sanctions must be lifted before iraqs airports can be reopened to commercial traffic98 business analysts believe that it will take 23 years before iraqi airways will be up and running as the airlin requires an entirely new fleet of planes security police services have also been seriously diminished many observers believe that one of the greatest ch allenges to iraqs recovery from war and future economic growth is the security situ ation in iraqs population centers and rural countryside in the aftermath of the war there has been complete breakdown in law and order with the dissolution of the b aath party and saddam husseins repressive security apparatus with cohesive local police forces judicial system or national army iraq is entirely dependent on coalition forces to provide security in baghdadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31944crs40 99 for more on humanitarian and reconstr uction efforts see crs report rs31833 iraq recent development in

of those trying to provide the most minimal vital assistance while they need protection aid agencies fear th at receiving it from coalitionled forces could mean an increase in security risks for their staff coalition troops are now patrolling citie s and have been successful in controlling the looting in some areas troops are also helping with the emergency restoration of critical services such as water and power but it is slow going many iraqis are growing impatient with the lack of order and public service medical services many iraqi hospitals were looted after the dissolution of the iraqi government causing widespread shortages in medical equipment and medicine in some cases hospitals have been stripped of furniture and plumbing some looters stole ambulances or stripped them of their tir and other parts despite these challenges many iraqi doctors nd medical staff have persisted and have managed to provide tr eatment in emergency situations at some hospitals staff took up arms to protect their facilities from looting during the immediate postwar chaoshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31944crs41 the international committee of the red cross has reported that hospitals have varying levels of capacity and security there are reports of dramatic increases in diarrheal cases especially among children as well as confirmed cases of cholera in southern iraq the situation at the hospitals has been complicated by an insufficient clean water supply along with lack of electricity food supplies at present food supplies seem adequate in part because extra rations were distributed prior to the

the treasury authority to require us financial institutions to take appropriate countermeasures against foreign jurisdictions or foreign financial institutions that the secretary finds to be of primary money laundering concern he noted that the administration was asking foreign governments nd institutions to turn over all iraqi assets that might belong to saddam hussein or hi s associates he stated that should it be necessary jurisdictions or foreign financ ial institutions refusal to search for and eliminate accounts holding illicit proceeds may fall within the purview of this legislation in other words the administration might cut ff their access to the us financial system if countries or institutions failed to comply with the us request aufhauser did not say how illicit assets owned by members of the prior regime could be distinguished from assets held abroad legally by other persons or by agencies or instrumentalities of the iraqi governmentwith binding permanent authority to ad judicate among conflicting property claims113 in iraq such courts could sort out the c onflicting claims of foreign firms that signed contracts with the former regime for the development of oil fields for example however it could not substitute parties having such claims for the exiting claimants the occupation authorities could also defer action on these claims until new iraqi government in place to evaluate and decide them114 on may 22 2003 the security council directed in resolution 1483 that countries should transfer to the development fund for iraq see below any financial assets or economic resources in their territory belonging to the iraqi government or to officials of the former regime115 claims by private individuals on those funds or assets will be held in abeyance until decided by an internationally recognized representative government of iraq ear lier the administration had asked other countries to transfer iraqi assets froze n in 1990 and 1991 to the occupation authority for use in iraq it also asked countries to turn over illicit iraqi funds the us treasury department announced serious penalties for foreign governments and financial institutions that fa il to turn over such funds116 unilateral action by occupying powers without confirmation by recognized local authorities may be questionable in an extreme case the japanese and

sovereign government could be created for ir aq it is unclear whether the occupying powers must use this procedure and whether they will avail themselves of it the next concern for iraq would be lifting of sanctions and other restrictions on its freedom to transfer assets receive or make foreign investment and buy and sell in world markets the security c ouncil moved far in this direction on

careful weavin g together of the authorities held respectively by the security council and by the occupying powers certain degree of ambiguity may have been left for reso lution in the future the council notes but did not itself create the dfi which was established by the occupying powers it underlines but did not direct that iraqi oil revenues shall be used for purposes that were previously announced by the occupyin g powers however it directs that portion of those revenues shall be transferred to the comp ensation fund it transfers 1 billion from the offp to the dfi and it directs that member states shall transfer frozen iraqi assets to the dfi in that case its underlining of the purposes of the dfi seem to be conditions under which that 1 billion and the frozen ssets may be used the security council calls on the occupy ing powers consistent with the charter and other relevant in ternational law to promote the welfare of the iraqi people through the effective administration of the territory it may be but it is not evident that the council conferred ne w powers on the occupation authorities it recognizes the specific authorities responsibilities and obligations under international law which they have as occupying powers it calls on them to act in manner consistent with the charter and international law it also calls upon all concerned to comply fully with their obligations under international law including in particular the geneva convention of 1949 and the hague regulations of 1907 the security council included in reso lution 1 483 provisi ons whereby long term changes could be made in iraq it said that the special representative appointed by the secretary general shall promote in coordination with the occupation authorities economic reconstructi on and the conditions for sustainable development including through coor dination with nati onal and regional organizations as appropriate civil society donors and the international financial institutions the syntax of this phrase makes interpretation difficult however it would appear that the special representative may promote the implementation of conditions which are c onducive to longterm development in iraq the word sustainable would suggest that changes in current procedures and institutions would be possible so long as broad cons ultation occurs presumably those changes will have validity after the occupation period is concluded it is less certain that unilateral actions by the occupation authorities which exceed their legal mandate under the hague and geneva standard s would be equally sustainable actions by the occupation authorities to allow the sale or transfer of iraqi assets or to changes the laws gove rning commerce in iraq done without the participation or confirma tion of an independent ir aqi government may have uncertain longterm prospects the authorities might believe they have acted for purposes benefitting the people of iraq however their decisions and the

questionable decisions by the occupation authorities in iraq might find themselves subject later to lawsuits for damages or they may find that they have paid money for activities whose legal basis was null and void120 the former sanctions regime and reso lution 1483 are the principal shields protecting iraq against lawsuits that would attach its assets or oil revenue to satisfy the demands of foreign creditors and claimants121 this immunity was retained in the new resolution in the words of the us state department to ensure that the iraqi people are not penalized because of sa ddam and can receive the benefits of their national patrimony absent other action by the secu rity council or general procedure for settling or in some cases readjudicating these claims iraqs ability to trade and the ability of the government and iraqi citizens to hold assets abroad might be endangered whether this immunity from legal action can or should be continued as iraq normalizes its international trade

created by government largess rather th an independently through the emergence of autonomous industrial manufacturing and rvice sectors the latter was crucial to the democratization process in central and eastern europe the problem for iraq is how to make an abundance of centralized oil wealth compatible w ith pluralistic and democratic form of government possible alternatives first the proceeds from oil sales or taxes on oil production could be depos ited in special trust funds where the proceeds may be spent only for certain activities education hea lth economic development for example and are beyond official control this is the case in chad in exchange for the world bank helping to develop chads oil industry the bank stipulated that 80 of the revenues be spent on health educati on and rural infrastructure 5 spent on people living near the oil fields and 10 be saved for future generations only 5 of the revenue can go directly to the g overnment for iraq such program could promote spending in certain areas and limit government patronage however it would allow the managers of the trust acc ounts to build their own patronage systems with limited accountability or control s econd the proceeds could be distributed periodically directly to the iraqi people on per capita or some other basis this would put the funds directly into the nds of the people and encourage private spending however it would starve the government for reve nue and require the imposition of some form of direct taxation on the public third as variation on the second option ownership of the iraqi petrol eum industry could be broadly distributed among the iraqi people so that they receive the proceeds not as government distribution but rather as capital gains or stock dividends similar to the alaska permanent fund126 fourth the government could continue receiving oil revenues directly either as profits from state firms or as taxes and royalties on private producers but all transacti ons would be transparent nd allocations of those funds would be determined by open competition among political figures rather than by quiet consensus within the leadership according to some experts iran is moving in this direction reviving the nonoil economy127 when iraqs petroleum sector comes fully on line as discussed above iraq will likely be one of the worlds largest oil exporting countries as long as it does not export so much oil as to drive down world pr ices to its own detriment iraq will likely obtain considerable income from this source however the impact this inflow of oil wealth may have on iraqs nonoil econom may be less favor able phenomenon called the dutch disease often occurs in countries where natural resource exports comprise large share of their total exports the term

brunei idpm discussion paper 56 consult httpidpmmanaxukwpdpdp_wp56htm the countrys nonoil exports less competitiv and foreign goods cheaper as potential imports this pushes up domestic prices rais ing the cost of other potential exports meanwhile capital and labor shift away from manufacturing and agriculture towards the booming sector natural gas in the case of the netherlands and petroleum in the case of iraq resources also shift to the domestic sectors producing nontraded goods to meet the increasing demand for goods and services from those participating in the booming sector as result production in the countrys traditional nonoil export sectors declines and domestic producers are less able to compete with imported agricultural and manufactured goods some economists believe that the dutch disease is not really problem at all but rather natural and fficient shift of resources from lesser to more productive uses within the economy many economis ts believe that steps should be taken to protect the domestic nonoil sector from this effect oil prices fluctuate they note and countries can be very vulnerable to ex ternal shocks if they are overly dependant on the export of only few products even ones as potentially lucrative as oil128 furthermore there is necessary reason why productivity and comparative efficiency in the nonoil sectors of the economy should be lowe r in countries that produce petroleum for export than in those that do not accumulating foreign reserves or in the case of iraq using oil revenue to pay off foreign debts and claims would be means to this end this would keep iraqs currency from appreciating excessively but it would also deny the iraqi people most of the benefit of their oil wealth mo re popular remedy for dutch disease would be efforts to improve pr oductivity in the nonoil sectors through investment privatization restructuring worker training and limits on taxation tariffs that fall heavier on the nonoil sector than on the il sector would appear counter productive in this regard another tactic involves dir ect effort to encourage di versification in the nonoil sector in order to develop products that can better meet the test of foreign competition most efforts of this type ve tended to emphasize larger enterprises in order to capture economies of scale some authors suggest however that more emphasis might be put on smallscale entrep reneurship in order to achieve possible gains from flexibility initiative and innovation129 another concern if iraq accrues high leve ls of oil wealth in the future will be the possible negative impact that oil wealth may have on incentives to work and produce this is an evident concern in so other countries in the gulf region if living standards are increased either through

security council declared that iraqs re pudiation of debts wa s null and void and it demanded that iraq accept responsibility and repay all its foreign debts131 as noted above iraqs foreign debt obliga tions are considerable iraq told the united nations in 1991 that it owed 421 billion an amount doubtlessly increased now through compounded interest to private banks suppliers international agencies and foreign governments the world bank imf and bis timated in 2001 that debt owed to creditors in oecd count ries totaled 261 billion exclusive of debt which may have already been written off

billion has been paid to date iran is seeking 97 billion for war damage during the 1980s thoug h the status and likely outcome of this claim is uncertain the issue is whether iraq has the capacity to

within decade further study will be necessary to determine the actual size of iraqs debts and debt payments and whethe r such oil revenues are likely broad agreement among creditors is nece ssary before countrys foreign debts can be forgiven or rescheduled the london club debt to private creditors and paris club debt to bilateral official creditors are the normal venues for such discussion in recent years only debt owed by the poorest countries has been forgiven outright iraq does not meet the economic criteria for debt forgiveness regular paris club rescheduling terms would likely apply132 the paris club met on april 24 2003 for preliminary discussion and is ready to engage on iraqs debt133 at the paris club debtors must be in state of imminent default before they can avail

and the recent destruction of records some have proposed that iraqs foreign bts should be forgiven either to allow more revenue to be available to improve iraqi living standards or to wipe out odious debt action on the former will depend on future calculations showing the amount that will be left over for iraqi use after payments for debts and claims are subtracted from its oil revenues it will depend also on the amount the creditor countries value the aspirations of the ir aqi public over the expectations of iraqs creditors and claimants odious debt is more complex concer n odious debt is normally considered to be debt which benefits the ruler through life style or through graft and corruption but has little benefit for the people ruled the question is whether successor regimes should

revisited october 30 2002 at httpwwwjubileesouthorg the debate was framed in terms whether the postapartheid government of south africa should have to pay the debt which funded the military and

definition almost any go vernment in nondemocratic country could declare that the bills and debts of its predecessor were odious and therefore not its responsibility 135 us treasury secretary john

endorsed by any in ternational legal or financial body it has been used successfu lly by few successor regimes to repudiate war debt owed by defeated opponents or bt incurred by former colonial regimes some people have suggested that the concept might be relevant to the issue of iraqi debt on april 10 2003 for example tr easury secretary john snow told fox news that certainly the people of iraq shoul dnt be saddled with those debts incurred through the regime of the dictator who is now gone135 most observers will agree that the regime of saddam hussein was odious it is less certain however that the debt incu rred by the regime was also odious portion of iraqs debt may have been incu rred to support an enhanced lifestyle and privileges for the regime and its close suppor ters much of these expenditures seem to have been funded with oil export reve nue however particul arly those after 1990 when new loans were prohibited by the sanc tions regime most of iraqs debt was incurred to pay the cost of the iraniraq wa r to finance construc tion of industrial and transportation facilities to pay for imports such as agricultural imports from the united states and to support economic policy schemes which proved given the centrallydirected nature of the regime to be wasteful and unsound whether these are the types of debts which ought to be categorized as odious will be matter requiring future consideration establishing currency and monetary system136 for the foreseeable future though other currencies will also circulate the us dollar may serve in effect as the basic currency for iraq other currencies likely will be defined in dollar terms dollarization implies currency credibility but also monetary dependence on the united st ates from political and economic perspective this will likely not be an acceptable longterm response to iraqi needs oil will play dominant role in the economy for the foreseeable future and this has important implications for iraqs choice of an exchange rate regime if iraq remains basically on dollar standard for its currency however its inflation level and business cycle will be determined by us monetary policy and not by its domestichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31944crs55 137 oxford analytica daily brief april 24 2003 138 at present the other main currency circula ting is the old or swiss dinar which was used before saddam

2003needs levels of economic activity in iraq may be overly stimulated or depressed and the nonoil sectors of the economy may suffer in the longrun iraq needs monetary institutions and exchange rate procedures which are capable of maintaining stability and credibility for its currency as well as sufficient flexibility in monetary policy to address adequately its internal needs the dinar lacks sufficient credibility new currency may be needed to enhance the new monetary systems credibility the dinars credibility and the stability of iraqs monetary system unde r the hussein regime were undermined by high inflation and black market exchange rate due to the economic and fiscal pressures caused by the first gulf war nd the sanctions regime iraq was unable to finance budget deficits through tax reve nues and bond issuances and was forced to print money instead resulting in high inflation thus an ear ly step that may be taken in reconstructing the economy will be the introduction of new currency that is not tainted by the dinars unreliability nor by symbolic association with the old regime the us treasury announced on april 21 th at new currency would be introduced in 90180 days137 interim dollarization by default three currencies are widely circulating at present in iraq two iraqi currencies from previous regimes and the us dollar138 with new currency in place facto dollarization of the economy seems to be taking place individuals avoid holding dinars if possible foreign currencies are now the favored medium of exchange with the dollar in ascendence dollarization will have stabilizing effect in the shor t term as us aid and economic ties increase more dollars will be available for circulation relative to other currencies and the process of dollarization will continue for example american officials recently made emergency payments in dollars to iraqi civil servants139 dollarization provides iraq with stable prices but also dependence upon us monetary policy new currency requires key decisions under the current dollarized system iraq has control over its money supply interest rates and the exchange rate to change that iraq will need to introduce new curre ncy and authorize monetary authority to manage it until faith in the new currency is established alternative currencies will circulate alongside it to make the transition to new currency occur as quickly as possible the current trends promoting dollarization willhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31944crs56 have to be reversed to this end the new government and the united states could make and accept payments in the new currenc and not in us dollars to introduce the new currency the government can tempor arily allow dinars to be exchanged for the new currency if authorities wish to soften the blow on individuals whose wealth is trapped in dinars they can make the tr ade on terms favorable to the dinars current market rate this will increase the cost of the currency reform however the authorities may also have to decide whether to allow the old dinar to be exchanged for the new currency even though it was not the official currency of the hussein regime importance of monetary control the first hurdle new iraqi monetary system must pass is the elimination of high inflation which depends on the successful reform of the fiscal system once sanctions are completely lifted at least some fiscal pressures will be relieved iraq may be less vulnerable to fiscal weakness than most developing countries because of easy access to re venue through state control of the oil industry at l east when oil prices are high five other steps may be needed to establish an effective monetary regime first is renegotiation of the large external debts incurred by the hussein regime see the discussion of debt below second iraq may need central bank which is able to operate somewhat i ndependently from the countrys fiscal authorities and cannot be compelled as was the case during the former regime to automatically finance government budget deficits third iraq ma need to clearly define the goals of its monetary policy some countries like ca set numerical inflation targets for their central bank to meet others like the united states have looser multiple goals fourth the iraqi monetary authorities may need adequate foreign reserves to stabilize their operations particularly if the exchange rate is fixed and to build confidence in the currency finally ir aq may need sound banking system both because the economy will need adequate ba nking services and because it will provide the monetary authorities with effective means for controlling the money supply and managing monetary policy choosing an excha nge rate regime the creation of new monetary system requires choice of an exchange rate regime exchange rate regimes and monetary policy are best thought of as go ing hand in hand since one determines the other there are number of monetary exchange rate regimes that have been successfully used around the world from whic h iraq can choose the choices fall under two broad categories fixed exchange d rates including dollarization currency boards and exchange rate pegs maintained by central bank and floating exchanges philosophically these systems can be thought to fall on continuum of less or more freedom for iraq to adjust m onetary policy at its discretion the iraqi authorities could let the current process of dollarization continue adopted in countries such as panama nd estonia dollarization does away with an independent monetary system entirely the money supply is instead determined by the foreign currency inflows that occur through international trade or capital flows since the political symbolism of dollari zation would probably be unacceptable in iraq currency board might be an altern ative currency board is also very restrictive since the local currency is 1 00 backed by foreign currency reserveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31944crs57 140 for more information see crs report rl31093 currency board as an alternative to central bank although it can be reversed more easily as was the case in argentina140 but unless iraq has large foreign reserves curre ncy board could prove to be unstable floating exchange rate the least re strictive option allows the market to determine the exchange rate so that iraqi authorities would be able to focus on setting monetary policy to the needs of the domes tic economy in between fixed exchange rate regime would greatly but not completely limit iraqi monetary policy to maintaining fixed relationship between the domestic currency and foreign currency or basket of foreign currencies unless capital controls are adopted iraq used this system with the dinar the huge difference between the black market rate and the official rate is the strongest sign that the system was abused by authorities shortrun credibility vs longrun flexibility the best monetary system depends on iraqs specific circumstances politically the freedom to alter monetary policy at will in response to ch anging economic conditions is only valuable if it is not abused the iraqis could adopt more restrictive exchange rate regime as way to tie their hands and regain credibility after the previous monetary abuse dollarization and currency boards are means to achieving instant monetary credibility at least in the short run but if iraq can establish strong independent central bank and an effective fiscal reg ime and tax administr ation restrictive monetary system would serve little purpose economically the value of floating exchange rate and the freedom it provides to adjust monetary policy to domestic needs depends upon how closely iraqs bus iness cycle will ultimately follow those of its trading partners if iraq is closel tied to large country through trade it may have little to gain from setting monetary policy that is different from its large partner by contrast if it does not depend

economic conditions are never static and the proper monetary polic can help country adjust to the changes static exchange ra arrangement will only be supportive under new economic conditions if the country to which iraqs exchange rate is tied has undergone similar changes many economic cr ises of the past two decades have been precipitated by country being forced to abandon its exchange rate peg oil and monetary policy because iraqs economy has been stifled for so long by geopolitical events it is difficult to envision how it will look in the future the one certainty is that oil will play dominant role in the ec onomy for the foreseeable future this has important ramifications for iraqs monetary system on the one hand pegging the iraqi currency to the dollar would be useful since the international oil market is conducted using the us dollar and many of iraqs neighbors in the gulf like saudi arabia ve pegged their exchange rate to the dollar on the other hand the business cycles of oilproduc ing countries widely differ from oilconsuming countries by their very nature rise in oil prices is likely to cause boom in oilproducing countri and slowdown in oilconsuming countries and vice versa if the iraqi ex change rate were tied to the dollar its monetary policy determined by us monetary policy through the exchange rate peghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31944crs58 141 prepared by

time there was large shift in oil prices rebuilding the financial system141 rebuilding or rather forming for the first time marketbased financial system in iraq may need to accompany the rebuilding of the ec onomy for two reasons first and fundament ally economic activity alwa ys has financial side second and empirically rebuilding experien ces in other countries suggest that it is important from the beginning of economic r econstruction to have in place financial system featuring marketbased incentives risk management and safety net to insure confidence lessons learned from those experiences are that the system could be simple initially but that supervisory and regulatory arrangements also matter whatever form the system takes its primary function is to allocate capital sufficiently well to allow the iraqi economy to operate fficiently past experience also shows that capital is needed quickly to get an economy up and running iraq is expected to face capital shortage and foreign cap ital may be desira ble initially the administration has held extensive planni ng discussions on rebuilding the iraq economy and financial system but details are not yet available change to marketbased system as noted earlier iraq has never had functioning marketoriented financial system although there have been limited attempts at reform the basic tasks are daunting how can iraq create functioning marketoriented financial system when it has never really experienced one how should iraq design its institutions and its system of incentives so that marketbased behavior rather than political influence andor cronyism are rewarded can iraq use the networks and expertise built up in the past to help establish its new financial institutions without creating opportunities fo r the corrupt practices of the former system to reemerge anew to tackle th challenges lessons from financial sector reforms in countries that had similar circumstances are re levant for iraq142 1 priority might be the immediate establishment of financial system based on basic market principles rebuilding the financial system in iraq must go hand in hand with rebuilding the iraqi economy from the start the efficient operation of financial system is the backbone of any market economy it links the suppliers and users of funds in order to support economic activity it is criticalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31944crs59 infrastructure but unlike water and electricity is largely invisible to the average citizen when it is working properly 2 there is one size f its all system design the types of private sector institutions to be chartered by the fi nancial authority vary with the economy in iraq case can be made for very s imple system consisting of single bank with extensive branching in the early phase of reconstruc tion problems that might otherwise arise in such m onopoly situation can be addressed with marketoriented pricing which matches supply and demand for funds other options for financial institutions range from universal banks which may provide the widest range of services to speci alty banks which ma have particular features important for the smooth functioning of key sectors 3 institutions matter in the efficient c onduct of financial system in similar situations elsewhere over the past 15 years the weakness of the reconstituted central banks and if sepa rately established othe r financial supervisory authorities have often resulted in financial market crises many analysts believe that in russia and other similar situations powerful interests were given too many resources and too much regulatory forbearance because their support was considered politically nece ssary to build consensus for the new system many also believe that financial sector liberalization was done too quickly to foster competition without ad equate legal and pr udential safeguards first being in place major crises ensued in several instances which were costly to resolve and undermined attempts to build depositor and investor confidence 4 strong institutions may require substa ntial budgetary resources iraq may need to spend money to get the best qualified staff available for its regulatory and oversight bodies most experts believe that the employees of supervisory agencies should be paid enough to di scourage them from private activities or side deals which conflict with their fficial duties training may also be necessary for example central banke rs and financial regulators from the former soviet republics we re trained in their countries the united states or europe on best practices of central ba nking and financial market supervision 5 establishment and enforcement of sound legal framework featuring viable contract bankruptcy and prope rty law plus judicial re view may be as important as if not more important than the design of new financial institutions in the transitional phase of reform sound gal framework is linked to fundamental financial considerations related to risk management for example enforcement of an agreed contract is bedrock of any economic or fi nancial transaction collateralbased lendi ng depends on functioning gal system bankruptcy law sets out the framework for redr ess under certain circumstances 6 private foreign capital may be required to increase the capital base of the economy to fund development and to foster competitive conditions in the longer run it is widely believed that iraq does not have sufficient resources to adequately fund its financ ial system because solid earnings stream from its oil exports will not resume for awhile its foreign debt situation needs to be worked out and the shift from an economy dominated by stateowned enterprises to functioning private sect or needs to be funded past experiencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31944crs60 143 world bank global development finance 2002 pp6169 144 neil king jr bush officials draft broa d plan for free

us treasury department mcpherson na med financial coordinator for office of reconstruction and humanitarian assistance orha in iraq press release april 25 continuedin rebuilding economies elsewhere suggests that encouraging private foreign capital inflows can be quick way to capitalize an economy and create competitive conditions initially particularly in the ab sence of taxpayerfunded resources from other countries opening up the financial system to wellrun and capitalized foreign banks and permitting foreign direct investors to have stake in the privatization of staterun enterprises are often seen as the most effective ways to meet basic needs143 these experiences do not suggest that domestic firms are eliminated by foreign firms despite concerns over basic competitive inequities between large deeppocket institutions and more thinly capitalized firms domestic firms have often had comparative advantage because of their ability to exercise judgment on nonecono mic risk factors in familiar setting administration plans over the past few months the administration has been developing blueprint for the rebu ilding of the iraq economy and financial system initial plans are reportedly contained in document moving the iraqi economy from recovery to sustainable growth that is being circulated among potential private sector us contractors144 on the financial side this document is said to include plans 1 to reform the central bank and the commercial banking system 2 to work out problem loans in the banking system 3 to set up tough securities commission to limit abuse 4 to form stock market with electronic trading capability 5 to privatize statecontrolled companies which would bring with it associated financial market activity and 6 to grant loans of as much as 8 billion to small and medium sized enterprises within the first year which may require separate financial facility the traditi onal islamic money transfer system would be incorporated into the banking system145 the administrations plans are taking concrete shape security council resolution 1483 passed may 22 2003 laid out some basic institutional arrangements for rebuilding the economy and financial system the development fund for iraq including oil revenues nd overseas assets previously frozen can be used to rebuild the iraqi economy see the section on preconditions for economic

international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade divisionexport and border control capabilities147 prior to operation iraqi freedom the export control problems most observers worried about were iraqs capability to smuggle in material technology and equipment related to weapons of mass destruction nuc lear chemical biological weapons and ba llistic missilesand smuggle out oil in additi on some observers worried about the export of sensitive materi als to other rogue states or terrorist organizations or individuals with change in regime most of those concerns are probably diminished from the perspective of statesanctioned exports however some provisions for controlling exports and patrolling borders may be desirable currently none of the nonproliferation treaties nuclear nonproliferation treaty biological weapons conventi on and chemical weapons convention requires member states to create export ws and implement them although they all contain prohibitions or restrictions on r eceipt and transfer of sensitive materials technology and equipment rather the cont rol of such goods is administered at the national level and c oordinated multila terally through the nuclear suppliers group the missile technology control regime and the australia group iraq is not member of any of these groups and doe s not belong to the chemical weapons convention although this may be an opport une time to press for iraqi membership despite the lack of legal requirements to implement export and border control it is likely that iraqi leaders may want to show goodwill by doing so the creation of legal framework processes and implementation will have costs the united states has helped other countri including former soviet st ates in variety of areas including providing legal advice detection equipment and training for border police among other things for several years the us state depa rtment has provided global export control and re lated border security assistance about 40 million which is designed to help other countries prevent an outflow of sensitive items from their borders iraq may be g ood candidate for such assistance access to foreign resources148 iraq

the imf stand ready to play their normal role in iraqs redevelopment at the appropriate time on april 29 the bank announced that its management had the authority to decide what the appropriate time woul d be the imf and world bank cannot lend to iraq until several major steps have been taken to normalize its relations with them however now that the former restrictions on their activities have been lifted the bank and fund will be able to send staff missions to iraq for technical and policy consultations as soon as their assistance is requested and the physical security of the persons involved can be assured iraq has been member of both the imf and the world bank since these institutions were founded in 1945 howeve r neither institution has had official contact with iraq for twenty years the last imf article iv consultation an official assessment of an economy for iraq was in 1980 in 1983 the next consultation was begun but never completed iraq owes the imf 5231 million special drawing rights sdrs or approximately 72 million for prior loans149 its current imf quota is sdr 504 million or 695 million the last world bank loan to iraq was grain storage project in 1973 between 1945 and 1973 the world bank made six loans to iraq totaling 1065 million mainly for educati on and infrastructure in 1990 iraqs loans were put on nonaccrual status when it failed to make loan payments including interest iraq owes the wo rld bank 82 million in payment arrears on may 22 2003 the security council rescinded the restrictions in the earlier sanctions regime barring internationa l agencies from operating in or providing assistance to iraq instead resoluti on 1483 calls on the inte rnational financial institutions to assist the people of iraq in the reconstruction and development of their economy and to fac ilitate assistance by the broader donor community the imf and world bank will not lend new money to iraq until it clears its existing arrears to borrow from the imf ir aq would also need to subscribe to the last two imf quota increases it would n eed to pay to the imf money sufficient to raise its imf quota from sdr 504 million 695 llion to sdr 1188 million 164 billion onequarter of the amount woul d need to be paid in hard currency iraq would then be able to borrow back the hard currency the imf has fund for immediate postconflict lending up to 50 of members quota but since iraq has not subscribed to the last two quota increas and is in arrears to the imf it is unlikely they would be able to receive imf emergency assistance iraq graduated from the world bank in 1973 due to the oil boom making it ineligible to borrow bank funds it might be able to borro w during the reconstruction period once government takes power whic h has authority to sign longterm contracts that are binding on iraq however this would depend on variety of conditions which cannot be assessed at this time and would likely be temporary situation pending restoration of iraqs oil export capacity the bank and fund can move more quickly to provide techni cal assistance and policy advice this is the normal role mentioned earlier the world bank

representative in iraq moreover the world bank has also approved the appointment of bank official to the international advisory and monitoring board of the development fund for iraq it is not clear however whether occupation authorities are authorized to make that request or whether an inter im government is required normally the bank and fund identify experts who might he lp address the problems identified by the mission and procedure for coordinating and evaluatin g their activity the bank and fund team may also identify broader projects or prog rams which may be needed the cost of the technical assistance program is normally borne by foreign aid donors rather than by the bank and fund themselves the imf expressed willingness at the fall meetings to help iraq reconstitute its monetary and financial sector it is unclear whether the occupation authorities will pursue this offer the bank and fund have been actively involved in postconflict situations in many countries including ko sovo afghanistan and east timor they have also helped postsoviet and east european governments make the transition from sovietstyle command economies to marketbased systems the bank and fund have also advised postconflict nd transition countries on ways they can rebuild their statistical and administrative capabilities and improve monetary fiscal and exchange rate policy the world bank has also served as the lead agency on foreign assistance donor coordinati on committees in many countries in summary like all other international institutions planning to operate in iraq once an internationally recognized government is in place the imf and world bank are currently trying to acquire as much information as possible from secondhand sources basically watching brief initially imfworld bank activity will most likely be limited to technical assistance and advisory role once iraqs arrears which are small compared to its possible future gdp are resolved and iraq is in good
