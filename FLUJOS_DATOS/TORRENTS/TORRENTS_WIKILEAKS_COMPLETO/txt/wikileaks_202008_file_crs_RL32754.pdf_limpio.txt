impetus for the real id act of 20051 during the 108th congress number of proposals were made to strengthen identificationdocument security and make more stringent requirements for alien admissibility and continuing presence within the united states2 immigration and identificationdocument security proposal s were considered in the context of implementing recommendations of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states also known as th 911 commission to improve homeland security and some of these were acted under the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 20043 however congress did not include all discussed proposals certain documentsecurity provisi ons being notable among them at the time that the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act was enacted some congressional leaders reporte dly agreed to revisit so of the dropped immigration and documentsecurity proposals in the 109th congress4 the real id act of 2005 was first intr oduced as hr

immigration reform and document security that were considered during congressional deliberations on the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act but which were ultimately not included in the

418 and the version of hr 1268 that originally passed the house however some notable changes were made including inter alia 1 removing provisions relatin g to the release of aliens in removal proceedings on bond 2 making asylum and withholding of removal eligibility and credibility standards less st ringent than those proposed in earlier versions of the real id act 3 providing for limited judicial review of secretary of homeland security decisions to waive certain legal requirements to facilitate the construction of barriers at the borders 4 providing broader waiver authority to the secretary of state and secretary of homeland security regarding terroristrelated grounds for inadmissibility and removal and 5 modifying and in some cases making more stringent real id ac t provisions concerning minimum security standards for stateissued drivers licen ses and personal identification cards accepted for federal purposes this report analyzes the major provisions of the real id act of 2005 as enacted it describes releva nt law prior to passage of the real id act relating to immigration and documentsecurity matters and discusses how the real id act altered preexisting law i preventing terrorists from obtaining asylum or relief from removal5 the 911 commission report6 documented instances where terrorists had exploited the availability of hum anitarian relief under immigration law7 although the antiterrorism and effective d eath penalty act of 1996 aedpa8 and the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 iirira9 amended asylum procedures to reduce fraudulent cla ims and limited judicial review of removal orders provisions in the real id act again amend the immigration and nationality act ina10 to further diminish the

explicit adverse credib ility finding kataria v ins 232 f3d 1107 111314 9th cir 2000 citations omitted even under the substantial evidence standard an adverse credibility finding must be based on

provides that the attorney general may grant asylum to an alien whom he termines is refugee as defined in 101a42a of the ina that secti on defines refugee as person who is persecuted or who has wellfounded fear of persecution because of race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion12 an alien who is physically present or arrives in the united states regardless of the aliens immigration status may apply for asylum although the burden of proof had not been explicitly described in the ina prior to the enactment of the real id act regulations at 8 cfr 20813a and b placed the burden of proof on the asylum applicant as did previous statutory provisions13 also case law had placed the burden of proof on the asylum applicant14 the grant of asylum is discretionary and even if an applicant meets the burden of proof for asylum eligibility asylum may be denied on discretionary grounds prior to the enactment of the real id act there had been explicit standards in the ina for determining the credibility of an asylum applicant and the necessity for corroborating evidence of pplicant testimony in the ab sence of explicit statutory guidelines standards for determining credibility and sufficiency of evidence evolved through the case law of the board of immigration appeals bia and federal courts however these standards were not necessa rily consistent across federal appellate courts arguably yielding different results in otherwise apparently similar cases15 generally an asylum adjudicator could base an adverse credibility finding on factorssuch as the demeanor of the applicant or witness inconsistencies both within given testimony and between given testimony and other testimony and evidence which may include country conditions news acc ounts etc and lack of detail or specificity in testimony the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit ninth circuit had held that an adjudicator must make explicit the reasons for an adverse credibility finding or the court will accept the applicants testimony as credible 16httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32754crs4 17 sidhu v ins 220 f3d 1085 1092 9th cir 2000 18 in re smj applicant 21 i n dec

instance in which such person was granted asyluman adverse credibility finding could be based in part but not solely on an applicants failure to provide corroboration the ninth ci rcuit had held that where there is reason for an adjudicator to stion the applicants credibility and the applicant fails to provide easily obtainable corroborating evidence with explanation for such failure an adverse credibility finding will withstand judicial review17 with regard to sufficiency of the evidence the bia and the federal courts had agreed that credible testimony alone may suffice to sustain the applicants burden of proof in some cases but disagreed on when credible testimony alone meets the burden and when corroboration is needed the bia standard had been that where it would be reasonable to expect corrobora tion it would have to be provided or an explanation for failure to provi it would have to be given18 however some circuits criticized the bia for failing to articulate what corroboration it expected in particular cases and why the ninth circuit had adopted standard that an applicants credible testimony alone alwa ys sufficed to sustain the burden of proof of eligibility where it was unrefuted direct and specific19 one authority argued that the bias approach was contrary to inte rnational standards under which an asylum applicant should be given th benefit of the doubt given the difficulties in obtaining corroborating evidence although the appli cant should try to provide any available corroborating evidence20 on the other hand the us court of appeals for the second circuit asserted that the bia standards were consistent with international standards because an applicant is supposed to try to provide corroboration for his or her claim or satisfactorily explain its absence21 prior to the enactment of the real id act an alien who was inadmissible on certain terrorist grounds or who was remova ble for engaging or having engaged in terrorist activities was not eligible for asylum not foreclosed from relief was person who was inadmissible as member of terrorist organization the spouse or child of person inadmissible on terrorist grounds or person who was representative of terrorist organization when the attorney general determined that there were not reasonable grounds for regardin g the representative as danger to the security of the united states22 as discussed below however changes made elsewhere in the real id act more broadly restrict the availability of asylum to those with terrorist tieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32754crs5 23 8 usc

service ins to the department of home land security most provisions of the ina still refer to the attorney general andor commissioner of the ins both the secretary of homeland security and the attorney general may now exercise authority over asylum depending on the contex t in which asylum issues arise and 101a1 and 2 of the real id act accordingly amends 208b1 of the ina to insert references to both the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security however this amendment only addresses references for that particular subsection and does not amend the rest of 208 which continues to refer only to the attorney general it is not clear whether this omission was intended to limit the authority of the secretary with respect to ch anges in asylum status or procedures for considering asylum applications burden of proof and central reason subsection 101a3 of the real id act codifies the existing regulatory nd case law standard that the burden of proof is on the asylum applicant to establish eligibility as refugee however the subsection appears to create new standard requiring that the applicant must establish that at least one central reason for persecution was or will be race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion neither 208 nor 101a42a of the ina previously or as amended nor the relevant regulations re fer to or define the concept of central reason which appears to be modification of establis hed refugeeasylum laws although possibly slight one since existing case preceden ts recognize similar standards the conference report for the real id act noted that past proposed change to asylum regulations would have required that protected statutory ground be central not incidental or tangential motive for persecution26 case law concerning asylum has addressed the concept of mixed motives for the persecution of an alien where there is more than one motive for persecution person may be granted asylum as

opinion does not mean persecution solely on account of the victims political opinion that is the conclusion that cause of persecution is economic does not necessarily im ply that there cannot exist other causes of the persecution as the united nations handbook on procedures and criteria for determining refugee status says what appears at first sight to be primarily an economic motive for departure may in reality also involve po litical element and it may be the political opinions of the individua l that expose him to serious consequences rather than his objections to the economic measures themse lves quoting handbook at 6264 to quote the boards decision in this case an applicant for asylum need not show conclusively why persecution occurred in the pa st or is likely to occur in the future however the applicant must produce evidence from which it is reasonable to believe that the harm was motivated at least in part by an actual or implied protected ground other cites omitted emphasis added singh v ilchert 63 f3d 1501 1509 9th cir 1995 persecutory conduct may have more than one motive and so long as one motive is one of the statutory grounds the requirements have been satisfied see also crs report rl32621 us immigration poli cy on asylum seekers by ruth ellen wasempersecution27 for example person may be ec onomically persecuted eg he may receive an extortion demand if the extorti on is motivated by both desire to obtain money and by desire to punish the pers on for political opinion or being member of race religion nationality or particular social gr oup then that person may be granted asylum however person may be denied asylum where economic persecution is motivated solely by the desire to obtain money rather than for the motives enumerated in the statute the standard for the importance of the statutory motive in asylum cases has ranged from being one of the motives to being meaningful motive to being principal motive thus the statutory establishment of central reason standard appears to be modification to the mixed motives standard in some case precedents but consistent with the operative standard in others corroboration and credibility subsection 101a3 of the real id act attempts to bring some clarity and consistency to evidentiary determinations by codifying standards for sustaining the burden of proof determining credibility of applicant testimony and termining when corroboratin g evidence may be required under the real id act the testimony of the applicant may suffice to sustain the applicants burden without corroboration but only if the adjudicator determines that it is credible persuasive and refers to specific facts demonstrating refugee status the adjudicator is entitled to consider credible testimony along with other evidence if the adjudicator determines in hisher discretion that the applicant should providehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32754crs7 28 the enacted version of the real id act dr opped earlier language that would have further required that the applicant could not reasona bly obtain the evidence without leaving the united states and that the inability to obtain corroborating evidence would not excuse the applicant from sustaining the burden of proof 29 see eg mendoza manimbao v ashcroft 329 f3d 655 660 9th cir 2003 minor inconsistencies in the record that do not relate to the basis of an applicants alleged fear of persecution go to the heart of the asylum cl aim or reveal anything about an asylum applicants fear for his safety are in sufficient to support an adverse credib ility finding this clause was not in the real id act as introducedcorroborating evidence for otherwise credible tes timony such corroborating evidence must be provided unless the applicant doe s not have it and cannot reasonably obtain it28 considering the totality of circumstances and all relevant factors the adjudicator may base an applicant or witness credibility determina tion on among other relevant factors demeanor candor responsiveness inherent plausibility of the account consistency between the written and oral statements regardless of when they were made whether they were unde r oath and considering th circumstances under which the statements were made internal consistency of statement consistency of statements with other evidence of record including the department of state reports on country conditions and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements without regard to whether an inconsistency inaccuracy or falsehood goes to the heart of an applicants claim there is presumption of credibility however if adverse credibility determination is explicitly made the applicant or witness has rebuttable presumption of credibility on appeal given the flexibility afforded the adjudicator it is not clear that the real id act represents either significant departure from case law standards for credibility and corroboration or clear resolution of inconsistencies among case precedents in different federal appe llate courts and also the bia the ina 208b1bii as amended by the real id act appears to permit an adjudicator to make an adverse credibility finding based on the applicants failure to provide corroborating evidence for otherwise credible testimony unless the applicant does not have it or cannot reasonably obtain it this provision appears to be intended primarily to resolve the difference between the bia and the ninth circuit with regard to credibility and sufficiency of evidence by adopting the bia position with some modification specifying what circumstances excuse an applicants failure to provide corroboration on the other hand the amended version of ina 208b1biii generally appears to be c odification of but not signif icant change from existing case law permitting an asylum adjudicator to consider the totality of circumstances including relevant factors such as demea nor inconsistencies and the like in making credibility determinations as long as they are not actually speculation or conjecture rather than factual observation however the clause providing that an adjudicator may consider an inconsistency inaccuracy or falsehood regardless of whether it goes to the crux of an asylum claim appears intended to supersede ninth circuit precedent that inconsistencies inaccur acies and falsehoods that do not go to the heart of claim will not support an adverse credibility finding29 but any such consideration would have to take into acc ount the totality of circumst ances and relevant factorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32754crs8 30 hrept 10972 at 167 2005 31 see canjuraflores v ins 784 f2d 885 88889 9th cir 1985 we will continue to remand to the board for credibility findings when we

ins v cardozafonseca 480 us 421 1987 with ins v stevic 467 us 407 1984even with the passing of the real id act30 the clause regarding presumption of credibility appears to adopt ninth circ uit precedent that presumes credibility on appeal where neither the immigration judge nor the bia has made an explicit adverse credibility finding31 with the modification or clarif ication that the presumption is rebuttable terrorist exceptions to asylum eligibility subsection 101b of the real id act amends 208b2av to provide that an alien described in the terrorism grounds for in admissibility and removal is not eligible for asylum with certain narrow exceptions noted above in preexisting law effective dates subsection 101h1 of the real id act provides that the references to the authority of the secret ary of homeland security took effect as if enacted on march 1 2003 which was the official date of transfer of immigration enforcement functions from the ins to th department of ho meland security under the reorganization plan subsection 101h 2 provides that the asylum standards established in 101a3 and b of the real id act took effect on the date of enactment may 11 2005 and apply to appli cations for asylum made on or after such date therefore the standards do not apply by statute to asylum applications filed before the enactment of the real id act rather standards in preexisting case law would apply to such claims standards for granting withholding of removal background subsection 241b3 of the i na places restrictions on removal to country where an aliens life or free dom would be threatened because of the aliens race religion nationa lity membership in particular social group or political opinion32 although there are s imilarities between asylum and wit hholding of

the extent consistent with the constitution the court found that serious suspension clause i ssue would arise if it were to accept the ins position that the 1996 acts eliminated habeas review without

second category includes other groups that carry out specified terrorrelated activ ities but have not been designated as terrorist groups86 for simplicity this report refe rs to groups falling within this second category as nondesi gnated terrorist organizations certain forms of assistance to terrorist organizationare grounds for inadmissibility and deportability because they amount to engaging in

the alien has been associated with terrorist organiza tion and intends while in the united states to engage solely principally or incidentally in activities that could endanger the welfare safety or security of the united states changes made by the real id act section 103a of the real id act reorganizes and generally expands the terrorrelated grounds for inadmissibility given that real id act 103bc broade ns the inas definitions of terrorist organization and engage in terrorist activ ity two phrases frequently used in the ina provisions establishing the terrorre lated grounds for inadmissibility the real id act expands the terrorrelated grounds for inadmissibility more broadly than might first appear the interplay be tween the amended definition of terrorist organization discussed above and the expansion of covered support and associational activities discussed below may be particularly significant in broadening the grounds for inadmissibility the following paragraphs discuss the alterations that the real id act makes to the terrorrelated grounds for inadmissibility effects of expanded defi nition of engage in terrorist activity on terrorrelated grounds for inadmissibility as in preexisting law the real id act provides that any alien who s engaged in terrorist activity is inadmissible94 as previously mentioned 103b of the real id act expands the

of terrorist organi zation found in ina 212a3bvi iii retention of attorney generals role in deeming an alien inadmissible for terro rrelated activity though recent law has transferred most immigration enforcement authority to the department of homeland security the real id act allows consular officer the secretary of homeland security or the attorney general to declare an alie n inadmissible if the alien is known to be engaged in terrorist activity or is likely to engage in such activity upon entry into the united states95 incitement of terrorist activity the real id act does not alter the preexisting ground for inadmissibility on acc ount of the incitement of terrorist activity representation of terrorist organization or political group espousing terrorist activity under prior law representative of foreign terrorist organization designated as such by the secretary of state was inadmissible the real id act expands this ground for inadmissibility to deny admission to representative of any group that constitutes terrori st organization as defined under ina 212a3bvi as previous ly discussed the real id act expands the breadth of the term terrorist organization for purposes of the ina the real id act also makes inadmissible any representative of political social or other similar group that ndorses or espouses terrorist activity96 previously such representatives were only inadmissible if 1 the organization publicly endorsed terrorist activity and 2 the secretary of state determined that such endorsement undermined us efforts to redu ce or eliminate terrorist activities97 pursuant to 104 of the real id act the secretary of stat or the secretary of homeland security in consultation with the other and the attorney general may waive this provision with resp ect to particular alien membership in terrorist organization the real id act substantially increases the grounds for inadmissibility on account of membership in terrorist organization previously membership in foreign terrorist organization designated by the secretary of state under ina 219 or membership in an organization that the alien knew or should have known was terrorist organi zation made an alien inadmissible98 the real id act facilitates the removal of member of nondesignated terrorist organization by shifting the burden from the government to show that the alien knew or should

expansion of definition of rrorist organization could significantly amplify the potential impact of these changes officers spokesmen and repr esentatives of the palestine liberation or ganization in both prior law and the real id act an alien who is an officer official re presentative or spokesman of the plo is inadmissible expanding inadmissibility grounds for espousal of terrorist activity prior to enactment of the real id act aliens were inadmissible for the espousal of terrorist activity only if they 1 used positions of prominence within any country to endorse or espouse terrorist ac tivity or to persuade others to support terrorist activity or terrorist organizati on and 2 did so in way that undermined us efforts to reduce or eliminate terrorist activities based on determination by the secretary of state the real id act makes inadmissible any alien who espouses or endorses terrorist activity or persuades others to s upport terrorist activity or terrorist organization regardless of whether the alien has position of prominence and his espousal undermines us efforts to reduce terrorism in the opinion of the secretary of state it is important to note that this gr ound for inadmi ssibility does not include mens rea requirement it appears that an lien who persuades ot hers to support terrorist organization is inadmissible ev if the alien had knowledge of the organizations terrorist activities the possibility of this occurring may not be improbable given the real id acts ex pansion of the definition of terrorist organization to include any group that engages or has subgroup that engages in terrorist activity including soliciting funds or otherwise providing material support for terrorist organization which itself may be one solely because it has for example subgroup that has solicited or provided funds to anot her terrorist organization pursuant to 104 of the real id act the secretary of stat or the secretary of homeland security in consultation with the other and the attorney general may waive this provision with resp ect to particular alien receiving militarytype training from or on behalf of terrorist organization the real id act makes inadmissible any alien who has received militarytype training99 from or on behalf of any organization that at the time the training was received was terrorist organization term defined under

specify that the organization must be desi gnated as terrorist organization by the united states accordingly it appears that an alien who receives militarytype training from or on behalf of terrorist organization is inadmissible regardless of whether the alien was aware or should have been aware that the organization was engaged in terrorist activity inadmissibility of spouse or ch ild of an alien inadmissible on terrorrelated grounds the real id act neither alters the inadmissibility of the spouse or child of an alien who was deemed inadmissible on terrorrelated grounds nor eliminates the exception to inadmissibility for an aliens spouse or child who 1 did not and should not have reas onably known about the terrorist activity or 2 in the reasonable belief of the consular officer or attorney general has renounced the terrorrelated activity causing th alien to be found inadmissible association with terrorist organization the real id act does not amend ina 212a3f which designates an alien as inadmissibl if the secretary of state after consultation with the attorney general or the attorney general after consultation with the secretary of state determines that the alien has been associated with terrorist organization and intends while in the united states to engage solely principally or incidentally in activities that could endanger the welfare safety or security of the

terrorrelated grounds for deportability of aliens aliens found to have engaged in rrorrelated activities following admission into the united states may be deportabl until recently the terrorrelated grounds for inadmissibility were significantly broader than those for deportability the real id act amended the terrorrelated grounds fo r deportability to make them identical to the terrorrelated grounds for inadmissibility background prior to the enactment of the real id act ina 237a4b provided that an alien was deportable if he committed any of the actions falling under the inas definition of engage in terrori st activity pursuant to 5402 of the intelligence reform and terrorism preven tion act of 2004 any alien who received militarytype training from or on behalf of any organization that at the time thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32754crs30 102 id 103 real id act 105atraining was received was designated as terrorist organization by the secretary of state was deportable102 changes made by the real id act section 105a of the real id act significantly expands the terrorrelated gr ounds for deportability so that any alien who is described in the inadmissibility provisions of ina 212a3b relating to terrorist activity or 212a3f re lating to association with terrorist organization is also deportable the fo llowing sections disc uss the new deportation grounds added by the real id act effects of expanded defi nition of engage in terrorist activity on terrorrelated grounds for deportability person who engages in terrorist activity is both inadmissible and deportabl under both current law and prior to the enactment of the real id act however as previously mentioned 103b of the real id act also expands the applicable definition of the term engage in terrorist activity thus

did not and should not have reasonably known that the organiza tion was terrorist organization designation as deportable for terror related activity by consular officer the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security the real id act enables consular officer the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security to declare an alie n inadmissible who is known to be engaged in terrorist activity or is likely to engage in such activity upon entry into the united states although the real id act provide s that any alien considered inadmissible on terrorrelated grounds is deportable103 it is unclear whether this means that consular officer the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security could declare an alien deportable if the alien was known to be engaged in terrorist activity or was likely to engage in such activity w ithin the united states or what procedures apply in such circumstance incitement of rrorist activity the real id act makes any alien who incited terrorist activity under circumstances indicating an intention to cause death or serious bodily harm deporta ble as well as inadmissible representation of terrorist organization or political group espousing terrorist activity the real id act makes deportable as well as inadmissible any representative of either 1 terrorist organization or 2 political social or other similar group that ndorses or espouses terrorist activity membership in terrorist organization the real id act makes it deportable offense for an alien to be either 1 member of terrorist organization designated by the secretary of state or 2 member of any group that constitutes terrorist organization unle ss the alien can demonstrate by clear and convincinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32754crs31 evidence that he did not know and s hould not reasonably have known that the organization was terrorist organization officers spokesmen and representatives of the palestine liberation or ganization pursuant to the real id act an alien who is an officer official re presentative or spokesman of the plo is deportable espousal of terrorist activity an alien who espouses or endorses terrorist activity or persuades others to support terrorist activity or terrorist organization is deportable as well as inadmissible pursuant to the real id act as discussed previously this ground for inadmissib ilitydeportability does not include mens rea requirement meaning that an alien who persuades others to support terrorist organization may be consider ed deportable even if the alien has knowledge of the organizations terrorist activities receiving militarytype training from or on behalf of terrorist organization section 105b of the real id act repeals the former grounds for deportability on account of r eceiving militarytype training from or on behalf of terrorist organization designated by the secretary of state instead the provision added by the real id act making aliens who receive militarytype training from or on behalf of any terrorist organization ie not s imply those designated as such by the secretary of state inad missible is also grounds for deporting an alien given the real id acts amendments to the inas finition of terrorist organization and the terrorrelated gr ounds for inad missibility it appears that an alien who r eceives militarytype training from or on behalf of terrorist organization is deportable regardless of whether the alien was awar that the organization was engaged in terrorist activity deportability of spouse or child of an alien inadmissible on terrorrelated grounds the real id act makes the spouse or child of an alien inadmissible on terrorrelated grounds deportable if the terrorrelated activity causing the alien to be inadmissible occurred within the last five years unless the aliens spouse or child 1 did not and should not have reasonably known about the terrorist activity or 2 in the reasonable belief of the consular officer or attorney general has renounced the terrorrelated activity causing the alien to be found inadmissible association with terrorist organization as grounds for deportability the real id act makes an alien deportable on the same grounds that the alien would be inadmissible pursu ant to ina 212a3f accordingly an alien is deportable if the secretary of state after consultation with the attorney general or the attorney

an alien found to have engaged in terrorrelated activ ities is not only inadmissible and potentially deportable but is also ineligible for various forms of relief from removal in modifying the terrorrelated grounds for inadmissibility and deportability the real id act also affects certain aliens eligibility for relief from removal specifically the real id ac t expands the scope of aliens who were ineligible for asylum withholding of removal and cance llation of removal asylum asylum is discretionary form of relief from removal available to aliens in the us who have wellf ounded fear of persecution on account of race religion nationality membership in par ticular social group or political opinion aliens who have been admitted into the us or who entered surreptitiously are generally in the posture of potentially d eportable aliens nd are removable under grounds for deportation aliens otherwise pres ent in the us paroled aliens and aliens presently arriving at an airport or other port of entry for example are in the posture of potentially inadmissible liens and removable under the grounds for inadmissibility aliens engaged in terrorist activity are ineligible for asylum as are aliens who fall under most other terrorism provisions mere membership in terrorist organization is perhaps the most notable exception to this automatic disqualification the real id act preserves this exception for inadmissible aliens but as explained below it appears to deny this exemption to deportable aliens other changes in law also appear to result due to changes in cr ossreferences and section numbering arising from the real id act restrictions on asylum eligib ility for aliens deportable on terrorrelated grounds prior to the enactment of the real id act deportable alien is ineligible for asylum relief on terrorrelate d grounds if he is removable under ina 237a4b relating to terrorist activity prior to the enactment of the real id act an lien was only removable under 237a4b if he committed certain actions defined as engaging in terrorist activity under ina 212a3biv as previously mentione d engaging in terrorist activity is only one of several terrorrelated grounds under which an alien may be deemed inadmissible the real id acts effects upon asyl um eligibility r estrictions for aliens deportable on terrorrelated grounds ina 208b2av makes ineligible for asylum any alien who is 1 inadmissible on specified terrorism grounds those terrorrelated grounds for in admissibility provided under subclause i ii iii iv and vi of ina 212 a3bi or 2 deportable under

committing terrorrelated activity thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32754crs33 would make the alien inadmissible under ina 212 including those activities that do not make an alien who is inadmissible on terrorrelated grounds ineligible for asylum accordingly the real id act appears to create disparity in asylum eligibility under which an alien designated as inadmissible on account of certain terrorrelated activities mig ht still be eligible for asylum relief while an alien who is deportable on the same grounds is ineligible pursuant to amendments made by the re id act which do not directly alter the inas asylum eligibility provisions but do make the terrorrelated grounds for deportability the same as those for inadmissibility deportable alien is ineligible for asylum on

know and should not reas onably have known that the organization was terrorist organization withholding of removal apart from asylum is the separate remedy of withholding of removal like asylum w ithholding of removal is premised upon showing of prospective persecution of an lien if removed to particular country109 in certain circumstances aliens are inelig ible for withholding of removal including in cases where the attorney general decides that having been convicted by final judgment of particularly serious crime an alien is danger to the community of the united states there are serious reasons to believe that the alien committed aserious nonpolitical crime outside the united states before the alien arrived in the united states or that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the alien is danger to the security of the united states110 by statute an alien who is described in ina 237a4b ie the terror related grounds for removal is reasonably regarded as danger to the security of the united states and is therefore ine ligible for withholding of removal111 restrictions on withholding of removal eligibility for aliens deportable on terrorrela ted grounds prior to the enactment of the real id act an alien lawfully admitted into the united states was ineligible for withholding of removal on terrorrelated grounds only if he was deportable under ina 237a4b which prior

engaged in terrorist activity is ineligible for withholding of removal on account of th danger he likely poses to the united states112 an alien who is inadmissible on account of engaging in terrorist activity is ineligible for withholding of removal for the same reason the real id acts effects upon wi thholding of removal eligibility for aliens inadmissible on terrorrelated grounds the real id act appears to make aliens w ho are inadmissible on terrorrela ted grounds ineligible for withholding of removal ina 241b 3 provides that an alien who is described by ina 237a3b is in eligible for

alien who is inadmissi ble on terrorrelate d grounds is also ineligible for withholding of removal cancellation of removal the ina provides the attorney general with the discretionary authority to cancel the rem oval of certain permanent and nonpermanent residents however alie ns who are inadmissible or deportable on account of terror related activity are ineligible for such relief restrictions on cancellation of removal eligibility for aliens deportable on terrorrelated grounds prior to the enactment of the real id act an alien is ineligible for cancellation of removal if he is deportable under ina 237a4114 prior to the enactment of the real id act the only terrorrelated grounds under whic h an alien was expressly ineligible for cancellation of removal was if the alien either engaged in terrorist activity as defined by ina 212a3biv or received militarytype training from or on behalf of designated terrorist organization115 the real id acts effects upon ca ncellation of removal eligibility for aliens deportable on terrorrelated grounds t h r l i d c t amends ina 237a4b so that any alie n who would be considered inadmissible on terrorrelated grounds as am ended by the real id

this topic wa s prepared by todd b tatelman legislative attorney 117 congressional action prior to 911 on national standards in this direction proved highly controversial for example 656 of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 pl 104208 division c provided federal standards for state drivers licenses and birth certificates when used as identificationrelated documents for federal purposes state had two choices under th is provision it could require that each of its licenses include the licensees social security number in machinereadable or visuallyreadable form or the state could more minimally require that each applicant submit the applicants social security number and ve rify the legitimacy of that number with the social security administration however this section became subject to widespread public criticism shortly after its enactment with opponents most frequently alleging that it could be construed as step toward national id entification card system congress blocked funds to implement regulations aimed at assisting th states to adopt the social security number requirements and the underlying requirement itself was subsequently repealed in 355 of the department of transportation and rela ted agencies appropriations act 2000 pl 10669 prior to 911 legislation aimed at discouraging national standards for identification documents had gained bipar tisan support and was thought likely to pass 118 pl 108458 72117214 119 as mentioned previously bill containing only the provisions of the real id act continuedrestrictions on cancellation of removal eligibility for aliens inadmissible on terrorrelated grounds prior to the enactment of the real id act an alien is ineligible for cancellation of

inadmissible aliens who are ineligible for cancellation of re moval on terrorrelated grounds is expanded v improved security for drivers licenses and personal identification cards116 prior to the passage of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 standards with respect to drivers licenses and persona l identification cards were determined on statebystate ba sis with national standards in place117 even with the passage of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 with the exception of what was specifi cally provided for by the legislation majority of the standards remained at the discretion of state and local governments118 the real id act contains number of provisions relating to improved security for drivers licenses and personal identifi cation cards as well as instructions for states that do not comply with its provisions the real id act also repeals certain overlapping and potentially conflicting provisions of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004119 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32754crs39 119 continued relating to drivers licenses and personal iden tification cards has also been introduced see drivers license security and modernizati on act hr 368 109th cong 1st sess 2005 120 see pl 108458 7212 whether limiting the standards to federal acceptance as opposed to direct federal prescriptions on th states obviates federalism concerns under supreme court jurisprudence remains to be see n the court has held that in exercising its power under the commerce clause congress may not commandeer the state regulatory processes by ordering states to enact or administer federal regulatory program see new york v united states 505 us 144 1992 the court has extended this principle by holding in printz v united states that congress may not ci rcumvent the prohibition on commandeering states regulatory processes b conscripting the states officers directly printz v united states 521 us 898 935 1997 it may be possible to argue that because the issuance of drivers licenses remains st ate regulatory function the minimum issuance and verification requirements established in th is bill even if limited to federal agency acceptance constitute an effective commandeer ing by congress of the state regulatory process or conscription of the state and local officials who issue the licenses 121 pl 108458 7212b2divii 122 id at 7212b2ef 123 id at 7212b2g 124 id at 7212b2acbackground the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 delegated authority to the secretary of transportation in consultation with the secretary of homeland security empowering them to issue regulations with respect to minimum standards for federal acceptan ce of drivers licenses and personal identification cards120 pursuant to the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act the secretary was required to issue regulations within 18 months of enactment that required each drivers license or identification card to be accepted for any official purpose by federal agency to include the individuals 1 full legal name 2 date of birth 3 gender 4 drivers license or identifica tion card number 5 digital photograph 6 address and 7 signature121 in addition the cards were required to contain physical security features designed to prevent tampering counterfeitin g or duplication for fraudulent purposes as well as common mach inereadable technology with defined minimum elements122 moreover states were required pursuant to implementing regulations to confiscate drivers license or personal identification card if any of the above security components were compromised123 the statute also required that the implementing regulations address how drivers licenses and identification cards were issued by the states specifically the regulations were required to include minimum standards for the documentation required by the applicant the procedures utilized for verifying the documents used and the standards for pro cessing the applications124 the regulations were however prohibited from not only infringing upon the s tates power to t criteria concerning what

infringe on that states decision or its ability to enforce that decision in addition the regulations were also not to require single unifo rm design and were required to include procedures designed to protect the pr ivacy rights of individual applicants127 finally the law required the use of ne gotiated rulemaking pursuant to the administrative procedure act128 this process was designed to bring

definition of the phrase official purpose for purposes of the act an official purpose is defined as including but not limited to accessing federal facilities boarding federally regulated commercial

identification cards minimum issuance standards section 202c of the real id act establishes minimum issuance standards for federal recognition requiring that before state can issue drivers license or

act provision appears to preempt any state verification standards and replace them with the new federal standards as established by this statutory language evidence of legal status section 202c2b of the real id act appears to require states to verify an applicants legal status in the united states before issuing drivers license or pe rsonal identification card previously the categories of persons eligible for drivers licenses were determined on statebystate basis as indicated above the intelligen ce reform and terrorist prevention act of 2004 specifically prevented the secretary of transportation from enacting regulations that would interfere with this authority this section of the real id act appears to preempt any state law requirements and appears to require the states to verify the legal status of the applicant130 temporary drivers licenses and identification cards section 202c2c of the real id act establishes system of temporary licenses and identification cards that can be issued by the states to applicants who can present evidence that they fall into one of six categories131 under the real id act state may only issue temporary drivers license or identification card with an expiration date equal to the period of time of the pplicants authorized stay in the united states if there is an indefinite end to the period of authorized stay the cards expiration date is one year the tempor ary card must clearly indicate that it is temporary and state its expira tion date renewals of the temporary cards are to be done only upon presentation of valid documenta ry evidence that the status had been extended by the secretary of homeland secur ity if such provisions existed prior to the enactment of the real id act they existed as function of state law and are preempted by the act other requirements pursuant to 202d of the real id act states are required to adopt procedures and practi ces to 1 employ technology to capture digital images of identity source

recognition training programs for appropria employees engaged in the issuance of drivers licenses and identification cards 10 would limit the length of time drivers license or pers onal identification

not conform to the requi rements of this act be re quired to use unique color identifier or design to alert officials that the document is not to be accepted for any official purpose moreover the states are required to clearly state on the face of the document that it is not to be accepted for federal identification or for any official purpose further the enacted version of the real id act includes provision requiring the states to maintain motor vehicle database that at minimum contains all data fields printed on the drivers li cense or identification card and all motor vehicle driver histories including violati ons suspensions or points finally the act requires the states to provide electronic access to their databases to all other states to the extent that any of these requirements previously existed they did so as function of state law thus it appears that the state laws are preempted in favor of the new federal standards trafficking in authentication features for use in false identification documents section 203 of the real id act amends 18 usc 1028a8 which makes it federal crime to either actually or with the intent to transport transfer or otherwise dispose of to another materials or features133 used on document of the type intended or comm only used for identification purposes by replacing the phrase false identification features with false or actual
