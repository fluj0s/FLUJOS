6307c24 shspec289 arc breaks and the comm cycle current model session is pretty short sincemidruds and pulling missed withholds is better than the previous beginning ruds an arc break assessment at end of session is much better than any endruds we had in the old model session if all lines are cleaned up as they read presession stuff is the same as always she rest of the model session goes like this 1 goals for the session 2 sincemidruds if ta up or needle dirty 3 check for and pull any missed withholds 4 body of the session use whatever is necessary to get him through b chat little before ending the body of the session 5 arc break assessment if the pc is not very happy at end of session the wording of this is still very fixed the only problem is on what to do if rud question is clean asking the pc if he agrees it is clean can cause an arc break if the pc feels that it is impossible for the question to be really clean 6 take up each goal from 1 above acknowledge the pc for each one made 7 ask for any gains made in session dont milk this question acknowledge these by saying thank you for making these gains 8 can squeeze 9 end of session the reason for rough needle on the pc is the auditors outtr2 and tr4 clean up tr2 and tr4 and youll clean up more needles than you can shake stick at it isnt the significance of it you see its the calm flow of the auditing cycle during arc break assessments you normally consider dirty needle to be withhold or something the pc has done but weak or overly heavy tr2 can do it as well there are two comm cycles in an auditing cycle 1 auditor pc 2 pc auditor these cycles can operate independently both have to be very acceptable before you get good auditing cycle the pc doesnt even have to say anything for communication to exist thus from the auditor you can get an rfactor as an independent comm cycle and from the pc you can get pc origination as an independent comm cycle from the pc as in tr4 in this case an acknowledgment is not even really necessary an artificial acknowledgment can knock an origination off its base you can handle these with head nod or facial expression the pc origination only needs ghost of an acknowledgment for the pc to know that the auditor got it if it is something that seems funny to the pc and to the auditor it is ok for the auditor just to laugh with the pc if you can project your think tank you dont need tr2 sometimes an acknowledgment can indicate understanding on the part of the auditor the pc only needs to be sure that you understand good auditor of children obeys kids auditing commands in r3r you dont have to ask the pc whether he has done the command on move to the beginning of the incident he doesnt have to tell you that he has done it you will get meterflick when he is there and you can send him through from that point if the pc gives you gobbledygook do not tell the pc that you didnt understand that is powerful phrase to use furthermore by saying that all you have done essentially is to ask him to repeat what he has just said this is peculiarity of homo sapiens you just get the same words again that doesnt help you are just asking for complete arc break you want the pc to vary the statement what you want is an explanation or broader statement so you have to be able to get him to do that without invalidating him here we get the basis of the arc break there is bungedup communication cycle whatever else there is what is bunged up about it is that the communication is not fully detected and understood lacking those points there is comm cycle the intention of the pc is cause distance effect and that cycle is interfered with so that the communication is not fully detected this is the woof and warp of all arc breaks communication that is partially but not fully detected or you could detect something but not receive it for instance say the pc says that he feels fine and doesnt need to continue you say well thats fine but we will continue to fill in the time here the pc sees that the communication is not received because action is taken you said that it should be something else before it arrived at you therefore there is busted communication line you can get roaring arc break on this this is primary cause of arc breaks in this case r and c are out because u is out actually the communication is detected expectations come into this you can yell at rock since you dont expect detection you dont arc break auditing is different because the expectations are different there are other kinds of arc breaks all of them are based on the communication cycle the whole definition of bypassed charge is partially detected it had to be partially detected because it must have been stirred up comm cycle once begun must go through if it doesnt there will be trouble eventually you would think that people at cocktail parties would always be bypassing charge on each other because they are always partially detecting that someone spoke the only reason wog meat bodies dont explode during cocktail parties is that they are armored they dont expect anybody to hear them so theres never any partially detected charge comm it is very dangerous to ask for communication and then fail to acknowledge what is received as result of your request you are inviting an explosion in doing that for instance an auditor asks for the earliest incident the pc cant give it and arc breaks because the question kicks in an earlier incident than the one he can see which he cannot reach thus the pcs bank gets only partially detected and you get an arc break if the time track is like bunch of mines laid out in line and activated magnetically lets say you want mine number 4 you throw magnet to mine number 8 then you wonder why you get an explosion mine number 8 speaks but it is only partially detected one way to locate the earlier incident is to find its order of magnitude of years ago comm cycle once begun must go through or there will be an upset eg the president promises to communicate to everyone but lacks the ability to carry through this gives the background for the revolution people who dont know anything about the communication cycle find this all so threatening and dangerous that they just decide to withdraw from communicating because they dont understand what is happening or how to remedy the upset desperation only enters in when communication goes out think of the sessions when you have gotten desperate your response to the pc ebbs and flows to the degree that you could put comm between yourself and the aberration thats bothering him and straighten it out and see the evidence of its discharge you dont worry about case for any other reason when you cant seem to reach the pc or the bank with your comm you get worried and upset when you are upset as an auditor see what communication you are not getting home to the pc and you as an auditor will feel better if the pc is miserable comm cycle is awry but this could happen in various ways from the pcs point of view some comm cycle has begun it hasnt been fully detected and it hasnt been understood that is the basis of low arc or arc breaks in your pcs even when the pc doesnt have an arc break realizing this point will help you understand something about your pc that you hadnt seen before keep on figuring out whether you are bypassing any charge the basis of low arc or arc breaks is 1 some comm cycle has begun 2 it hasnt been fully detected but has been slightly detected 3 it hasnt been understood actually in any pc you are going to see an out comm cycle because he isnt ot the telepathic cycle is usually out there can be the mundane result of the pc not having ever understood the command and at least faintly knowing it the reason that it is an arc break is that the nonunderstanding brings in and r it is the and r factors that tend to make the c not understood something didnt go through an incomplete comm cycle always results in bpc you should know that that simple little outness can bring the living lightning you should also know that the cause and effect always work in that direction the catastrophe that you are handling has simple little outness as its origin not complex bear the basic things that wont go through and get detected are r and c and the basic things that these three face are m s and t so you have the livingness of the person arc vs the material universe or mest or it is the individual vs time that is what keeps the k and c from completing the communication cycle there is lie in the individuals communication with time or with times communication with the individual bypassed charge originates as the beginning of comm cycle that is not wholly detected or understood charge is energy excited and channeled to go in certain direction but it never arrives because it is not wholly detected or understood so it always remains as bpc then explodes in dispersal of some sort it does not always explode sometimes it just results in downtone pc who is not feeling so well lately we know the magic of the explosive nature of interpersonal relationships knowing these things you should be able to handle session better dont be afraid that handling means always doing what the pc says just let the pc know that you got his origination and understood it and go ahead and do what you are doing youve got to be an expert in the detection of communication that has begun the better you are the fewer arc breaks youll have the arc break assessment covers the number of types of comm that can be started and not detected in the activity you are doing so that you can find the correct bpc and not have to shotgun it with something like an earlier incident was restimulated deciding which list to use could be problem look in the right place if the arc break is in the session and you do an r3r arc break form you wont find it therefore use the right list if you dont get the bpc you are using the wrong list get the right one just realize that deciding which is the right list could be problem and use another list if you didnt find she arc break the main mistake you could make is not to be sure everything is fine with the pc after you have handled the arc break make sure that you are right about the bpc lists locate the type of charge bypassed the type of comm cycle that began and was never completed now its up to you to locate and indicate to the pc the charge the charge is not on the list it is in the pc the assessment is not the location even though the magic is good enough so that you can often get result just by indicating what was assessed you only actually get type of charge not the charge with the assessment you must still locate and indicate the specific charge if you tell the pc what you got on the assessment and he feels better fine let sleeping dogs lie but if he doesnt feel better or if there is still charge there find the exact charge that was bypassed you may need another list to get it so there are five steps to handling bpc with an arc break assessment 1 find out if there is an arc break 2 assess the appropriate list 3 locate the exact bpc 4 indicate it to the pc 5 check whether the indication was all right with the pc if it is wrong date check the ones you have gotten or see if it is in the first or the last half of the session
