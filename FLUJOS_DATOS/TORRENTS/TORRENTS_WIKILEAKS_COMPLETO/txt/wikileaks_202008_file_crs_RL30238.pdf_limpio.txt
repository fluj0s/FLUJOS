lived tax proposed as means of helping to meet the costs of the rev olutionary war debt the tax was resurrected briefly during the war of 18 12 eliminated shortly after the close of that war it

prior to world war i to wines generally taxation of alcoholic beverages are periodically reevaluated b congress and the subject of congressional inquiries taxes generally have increased during war time periods and during their early years when demands on the national government were not as great revenues from these excises contributed substantial portion of the total budget tax rates on alcoholic beverages remained unchanged from the mid 1950s until 1984 when the tax on distilled spirits was increased b 2 per proof gallon to 1250 proof gallon is gallon which is 50 alcoho l in 1990 in response to demands for added revenues to reduce the budget deficit there was an across the board increase on beverage alcohol tax rates according to the house committe recommending that increase these taxes were selected for an increase because they had not bee n increased for many years so that the effective rate was substantially lower than when adopted and there was considerable evidence of added social costs from consumption of alcoholic beverages in the latter context the tax increase was viewed as user fee to aid in bearing the added costs to governme nt and potential deterrent to

excise tax on distilled spirits was enacted in 1791 it was part of a8 program urged by alexander hamilton as means of meeting budget deficits when import duties adopted in 1789 failed to produce enough revenue to pay the interest on the debt 2239000 and provide operating revenues 600000 for the ne w government as enacted the law imposed taxes ranging from 9 to 25 cents per gallon on spirits made from mat erials produced in the united states rye and corn whiskey and from 11 to 30 cents on spirits made in whole or part from foreign materials rum rates varied according to p roof for small domestic content stills located outside of cities towns or villages the owners had an option of paying tax of 60 cents pe r gallon of t he stills capacity or 9 cents per gallon on the amounts actually produced there was considerable opposition to the tax partic ularly in the southern and western areas of the new nation the law was revised in 1792 rates on domestic content9 spirits were lowere d to range from 7 to 18 cents according to proof and on foreign content spirits the rates were from 10 to 25 cents small distillers less than 40 0 gallons capacity were classed with country distillers and given an option of paying taxes at 54 cents per gallon of capacity or 7 cents per gallon actually produced nevertheless the tax remained unpopul ar with western farmers with poor means of transport they found it easier and also more profitab to transport their grain in liquid rather than bulk form in 1794 the so called whiskey rebe llion took place while thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30238crs4 act

disti llers were per gallon of capacity and varied with11 the content of materials domestic or foreign and periods of actual operation for example if still operated six months of the year and used domestic grains it wa s taxed at 70 cents per gallon of capacity but if foreign materials were used the rat was 105 cents per gallon retail license fees va ried with the type of merchandise sold and location thus retailer selling on ly domestic spirits and located in city town or village with 100 families in square mile area paid fifteen dollar fee but the same retailer in less heavily popula ted area was charged ten dollars if the merchant sold wines and spirits the rates were twentyfive and fifteen dollars respectively in 1814 in response to increased needs tax of 20 cents per gallon of actua l production was added to the existing license duties coverage was extended t rectifier s and distillers operating for as short time as one week and retailers licenses were increased by 50 perce

interim from 1817 to the civil war the distilling industry flourished with large quantities of distilled spirit s and alcohol used for variety of nonbeverage purposes including fuel for lighting and for kitchen stoves by an act of july 1 1862 tax of 20 cents per proof gallon was levied on distillers that act established14 the basic pattern of administering and collecting the excise taxes on

the next quarter of century as taxes rose from 50 per proof gallon to 110 in 1894 where the rate remained until just prior t prohibition when it rose first to 320 then 640 for beverage and 220 for non

continued26 tax in explaining the law increase on wines the ways and m eans committee said id at 40 your committee deemed it appropriate to make only moderate increase in th case of the taxes on wines because of the importance of wines to the grape growing industry between onethird and onehalf of the total grape crop i s customarily absorbed by wine the demand for wine therefore also has n important effect n the prices which can be obtained by producers for raisins and fresh grapes the two other important uses of grapes moreover in view of the fact that it has been necessary for the department of agriculture at times since the end of world war ii to pport the price of raisins it would appear inappropriate for your committee to make substantial increase in the tax on wine which might have the effect of req uiring further price supports in addition it should be pointed out that wine consumption in the uni ted states relative to consumption of other forms of alcoholic bev erages is relatively low when compared to relationships generally established abroad moreover the wine industry is one of the few industries which has been classified under the excessprofits tax as depressed industry the rate provisions as enacted in the 1954 code w ere temporary with rollback of most rates to prekorean war levels scheduled for 1955 68 stat 595 5001 609 5041 611 5051 scheduled
