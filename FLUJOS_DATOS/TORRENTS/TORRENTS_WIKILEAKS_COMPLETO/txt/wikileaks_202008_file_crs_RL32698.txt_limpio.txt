congress summary when the 108th congress convened in january 2003 few observers predicted that trade would be top legislative concern congress just six months earlier had passed by narrow margin the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 the first major piece of trade legislation in almost decade nevertheless trade remained top level domestic and foreign policy issue in 2003 and 2004 the 108th congress completed work on number of major trade bills most notably bills to implement free trade agreements ftas with chile singapore australia and morocco and to enhance trade benefits for the countries of sub saharan africa were passed and signed by the president legislation repealing an export tax benefit long ruled violation of us world trade organization wto obligations passed thereby moving the european union closer to ending sanctions on 4 billion of us exports in addition congress passed miscellaneous tariff bill that eliminated or suspended tariffs on hundreds of products and repealed the 1916 antidumping act which also had been ruled violation of wto provisions the implementing bills for the four ftas were passed by wide margins running contrary to predictions of some observers that congress was turning protectionist or antitrade all agreements received strong backing from the business community but encountered resistance from organized labor they eventually will eliminate tariffs on almost all traded goods cover trade in services and provide enhanced protection for intellectual property rights while the overall effects of any of the agreements on the us economy are expected to be minimal each agreement provides us exporters and investors with additional market openings and opportunities protection for the us steel industry was prominent concern of the 108th congress in 2003 many members supported the steel industrys efforts to persuade president bush to extend the import restraint regime he had imposed in 2002 while others supported steelconsuming industries efforts to roll back the import restraints the more globalized us economy contributed to rising concerns in congress about whether us companies were increasingly offshoring or relocating service sector jobs to lowwage developing countries as well as to generalized anxiety about job losses associated with chinas growing trade prowess and its policy of pegging its currency to the dollar congress also engaged in an intensive debate generated by growing consumer interest in purchasing more affordable prescription drugs from abroad the issue was addressed in elements of three bills introduced in the senate and one bill which passed the house in 2003 number of export policy issues were also the subject of legislative activity in the 108th congress while policies that promote exports through financing and efforts to open foreign markets attracted limited amount of legislative activity the restrictive component of export policy particularly economic sanctions targeting

policies and laws that affect trade negotiations the world trading system imports and exports negotiations to liberalize trade flows are intended to make the us economy more efficient and productive the rules of the world trading system are designed to facilitate trade flows by providing stable and predictable environment policies affecting imports through the lowering or raising of tariffs or other barriers determine the relative openness of the us market to goods and services produced abroad export policies both increase and restrict the sales and opportunities of specific companies and industries trade policies affect jobs profits and investment decisions in the united states and abroad in the process some workers and companies gain or lose more than others thereby increasing the political stakes embedded in the decisions the 108th congress completed work on number of major trade bills most notably bills to implement free trade agreements with chile singapore australia and morocco and to enhance trade benefits for the countries of subsaharan africa were passed and signed by the president legislation repealing an export tax benefit long ruled violation of us world trade organization obligations passed thereby moving the eu closer to ending sanctions on 4 billion of us exports in addition congress passed miscellaneous tariff bill that eliminated or suspended tariffs on hundreds of products and repealed the 1916 antidumping act which also was ruled in violation of wto rules this report provides information and analysis of the major trade bills considered by the 108th congress in three parts the first section provides an overview of major trade legislation acted on in the 108th congress including some issues that may be carried over or taken up in 2005 for purposes of analysis congressional trade policymaking is divided into the categories of trade agreements and wto rules importrelated legislation and exportrelated legislation this section draws heavily from crs reports on the myriad trade issues discussed readers who seek full discussion of any particular issue are encouraged to consult these crs reports and authors cited the second section appendix provides in tabular form more detailed breakdown of the majority of trade bills introduced and acted on in the 108th congress the bills are divided into twelve categories 1 trade agreements 2 world trade organization dispute settlement issues 3 trade and tariff preferences 4 permanent normal trade relations status 5 importation of prescription drugs crs2 6 offshoring of service jobs 7 trade remedy laws 8 china 9 other issues in import policy 10 export promotion 11 trade sanctions and 12 export controls list of congressional traderelated hearings is provided in appendix b this section illustrates another dimension of congressional interest in trade issues and the numerous committees that play role in oversight it can be noted that congress influences trade policy in number of ways beyond the bills that are discussed in this report the most common are through floor statements and letters sent to the administration that urge certain course of action as well as through warnings that specific legislation will be introduced to resolve problems that are not being adequately addressed in negotiations regulations or executive actions in addition to warning the administration congress often sends messages directly to us trading partners some prominent examples of this form of trade policymaking from the 108th congress follow1 group of house republicans led by house speaker hastert urged president bush in january 29 2003 letter to initiate wto dispute settlement case against the european unions biotechnology moratorium on march 5 2003 senate finance committee chairman charles grassley expressed his dissatisfaction with the administrations decision to delay initiating the wto case on august 7 2003 the bush administration initiated wto dispute settlement complaint over the moratorium group of 70 senators signed february 4 2003 letter to president bush that strongly supported the continued operation of the continued dumping and subsidy offset act better known as the byrd amendment despite an adverse wto ruling the letter subsequently has been cited widely as evidence that congressional sentiment is broadly antirepeal house republicans from textile states met with trade officials from the bush administration on february 7 2003 in an effort to persuade the administration to impose safeguard restrictions on chinese apparel imports as soon as possible in october and november 2004 the administration did impose restrictions on selected apparel items under special china safeguards provision nineteen senators in an april 4 2003 letter urged president bush to begin negotiations with new zealand on the establishment of free trade agreement as soon as possible to date new zealand is still under consideration as potential free trade partner house ways and means chairman bill thomas requested the international trade commission to prepare report on the section 201 steel safeguards impact on us steel users along with the 1 information is gleaned from various editions of inside us trade crs3 itcs midterm review of the impact of import restraints on the domestic steel industry senate finance committee chairman charles grassley said on april 4 2003 that he supports the thomas request the report was prepared and its determinations were cited widely in the 2003 debate over the efficacy of lifting the import restraints concurrent resolutions were introduced in the house and senate in march 2004 in an effort to convince the administration to keep auto tariffs out of the fta negotiations with thailand the negotiations currently are still in preliminary stage trade agreements and wto rules when the 108th congress convened in january 2003 few observers predicted that trade would be top legislative concern congress just six months earlier had narrowly passed in contentious vote the trade act of 2002 pl107210 the first major piece of trade legislation in almost decade this comprehensive trade bill ended eight years of stalemate over whether to reauthorize fasttrack authority now called trade promotion authority tpa trade promotion authority allows the president to submit to congress legislation implementing new trade agreements under special legislative procedures that limit debate prohibit amendments and require an up or down vote2 the trade act of 2002 also renewed trade preference programs for andean and african countries as well as the us generalized system of preferences3 in addition it mandated tighter congressional oversight of trade negotiations by requiring the president to report all potential trade agreements to congress 180 days before they were signed and provide an explanation of why any changes to existing trade laws would be necessary4 contrary to some expectations trade remained toplevel domestic and foreign policy issue in 2003 and 2004 part of the reason is that the bush administration used the tpa to promote an ambitious trade negotiating agenda by early 2003 the administration was actively promoting global negotiations in the wto the doha agenda working towards free trade area of the americas ftaa completing free trade agreements with chile and singapore and beginning five new sets of fta negotiations morocco and five central american countries in january 2003 australia in march five members of the south african customs union in june and bahrain in august and proposing regional trade strategy to deepen us trade and economic relationships in southeast asia and the middle east5 2 crs report rl31844 trade promotion authority fasttrack

by ian f fergusson and lenore sek crs4 the administrations strategy of pursuing multiple trade initiatives dubbed competitive liberalization holds that simultaneous multilateral regional and bilateral trade negotiations reinforce and catalyze one another however when the doha round of the world trade organization stalled at cancun in september 20036 and the regional free trade area of the americas incurred comparable fate at the november 2003 summit of the americas in miami 7 much of the administrations attention turned towards completing ongoing ftas and initiating new ones with three andean countries colombia ecuador and peru the dominican republic panama and thailand8 while congress supported the administrations overall competitive liberalization strategy few members did question the choice of fta partners on the grounds that commercial considerations were being given short shrift senator max baucus ranking senate finance committee member for example reportedly publically maintained that the administrations strategy of picking fta partners is mostly motivated by abstract foreign policy concerns rather than pursuing the greatest market opportunities9 fta implementing legislation possible criticism of the choice of fta partners notwithstanding the 108th congress approved implementing legislation for all four ftas the administration sent to capital hill for consideration for the chile and singapore ftas in july 200310 for the moroccan fta in july 2004 and for the australian fta in august 200411 the implementing bills were passed by wide margins running contrary to predictions of some observers that congress was turning protectionist or antitrade12 6 crs report rl32060 world trade organization negotiations the doha development agenda by lenore sek 7

of 314109 senate votes on these agreements were respectively 6631 6632 85 crs5 all four agreements received strong backing from the business community but not from organized labor the ftas eventually will eliminate tariffs on almost all traded goods liberalize trade in services and provide enhanced protection for intellectual property rights while the overall effects of any of the agreements on the us economy are expected to be minimal each agreement provides us exporters and investors with additional market openings and opportunities13 these ftas are also significant because they are the first agreements considered by congress under the fasttrack procedures authorized in the trade act of 2002 other precedents include the fact that the chile fta was the first such agreement with south american country singapore was the first such agreement with an asian country the australian agreement was the first fta between the united states and developed country since the uscanada free trade agreement in 1988 and the morocco fta forms part of the administrations longterm effort to establish middle east free trade area extant opposition and controversy to the ftas was concentrated mostly on labor and immigration issues in the case of chile and singapore and on agricultural and pharmaceutical trade issues in the case of australia the labor provisions contained in the chile and singapore agreements were criticized by some members mostly house democrats on the grounds that basic worker rights obligations such as freedom of association the right to form unions and bargain collectively and limitations on child labor were not subject to as rigorous dispute settlement process as was provided in the usjordan fta14 while the salience of the treatment of labor rights in the chile and singapore ftas may have been tempered by these countries relatively strong labor rights laws and records the issue is likely to be much more divisive in congressional consideration of the uscentral american fta cafta which the administration concluded in december 2003 cafta reportedly is opposed by many more members some of whom say it does not go far enough in promoting stronger labor laws and enforcement in the region faced also with opposition from sugar and textile interests the bush administration decided not to send implementing legislation to congress this year but battle over the implementation legislation can be expected in the 109th congress15 immigration provisions were also controversial in the chile and singapore ftas both agreements created separate categories of entry for citizens of each country to engage in wide range of business and investment activities on temporary basis that is as nonimmigrants these fta provisions on the temporary 13 and 8016 13 crs

crs report rl31870 the uscentral america free trade agreement cafta challenges for subregional integration by jf hornbeck crs6 entry of business personnel and professional workers raised concerns among many in congress who have jurisdiction over immigration that the ustr negotiated these provisions without any authority or direction from congress the bush administration countered that the temporary entry of professionals falls within tpa objectives regarding the opening of foreign country markets for us services and investment in particular reduction or elimination of barriers that restrict the operations of service suppliers or the establishment or operations of investments16 agricultural issues were among the most difficult issues in the consideration of the australian fta in the end each side acceded to very sensitive demands of the other in order to bring the negotiations to close this meant that australia acceded to the us objective not to liberalize trade in sugar and to only gradual opening of dairy and beef while the us acceded to australias position on maintaining monopolies for the export of wheat barley and rice17 number of members of congress however were highly critical of the sugar exclusion arguing that the exclusion of any product or industry should not be repeated in future ftas18 trade and the health care policies of foreign trading partners became an issue for the first time in the negotiation of the australian fta during these negotiations the united states complained that the way the australian government subsidizes the costs for pharmaceuticals may disadvantage number of newer innovative drugs produced in the united states the issue exposed fundamental differences between the us and australian healthcare systems and how each treats costs of pharmaceutical products borne by their citizens19 in congressional consideration of the agreement this issue was widely debated perhaps foreshadowing us trade policy efforts to confront foreign price controls on pharmaceutical products wto compliance legislation as an international organization intended to ensure that trade between countries flows more easily predictably and freely the world trade organization wto serves as forum for international trade negotiations and the settlement of disputes the dispute settlement understanding or dsu provides the procedures to settle disputes and is key to the enforcement of us rights under the wto20 16 crs report rl30498 immigration legislative issues on nonimmigrant professional specialty h1b workers by ruth ellen wassem

issues by lenore sek crs7 since the dsu became effective in 1995 the united states has been heavily involved as both complainant and defendant in slightly more than half of the 300 plus cases filed as complainant the us has used the dsu to ensure that us exporters receive open access and fair treatment in foreign markets as defendant some us practices or laws have been found to be inconsistent with our wto obligations wto member found to have enacted an inconsistent measure is expected to bring its laws into compliance promptly but is also granted reasonable period of time to do so if immediate action is impracticable while the member country is usually expected to withdraw the offending measure compensation and temporary retaliation are available to the prevailing party as alternative remedies if the member has not complied by the established deadline21 although the united states has complied with adverse rulings in several past wto disputes there are some outstanding cases in which wto rulings have not yet been implemented among these cases the 108th congress inherited several disputes where compliance required legislative action the most prominent cases involved us export tax benefit the extraterritorial income tax exclusion eti and its predecessor the foreign sales corporation fsc the 1916 antidumping act and the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of 2002 cdsoa also known as the byrd amendment22 fsceti export benefit the us tax codes foreign sales corporation fsc provisions provided tax benefit for us exporters but in 1997 the european union eu filed complaint before the wto that the provision was an unacceptable export subsidy the wto upheld the complaint and to avoid retaliatory tariffs congress in 2000 replaced the fsc with new export benefit the extraterritorial income eti provisions the eu again complained to the wto that the eti benefit was also an export subsidy and the wto again backed the eu charge while the eu indicated it would not impose retaliatory tariffs as long as the congress was making progress on achieving wto compliance it began imposing punitive tariffs on 4 billion of us exports beginning at 5 on march 1 2004 and increasing by 1 percentage point each month thereafter23 after considering repeal legislation for more than two years the congress replaced the export subsidy with an assortment of new corporate tax breaks that may be acceptable under wto rules the house and senate approved conference agreement on the legislation in october 2004 pl10835724 as result of the repeal the eu is expected to lift the sanctions effective january 1 2005 although its 21 crs report rs21763 wto dispute settlement stages and pending us activity before the dispute settlement body by todd b tatelman 22 crs report rl32014

creation act of 2004 by david l brumbaugh crs8 trade officials have complained to the wto that the statutes grandfathering provisions may be wto violations 1916 antidumping act the 1916 antidumping act allows us parties to sue foreign producers or importers in federal court if they dump their products with the intent to injure us producer and awards treble damages in successful cases while this statute has been seldom used suits were brought against european and japanese steel producers in the 1990s subsequently the eu and japan challenged the law in the dsu in 2002 the dsu determined that the law violated us wto obligations because it provided remedies for dumping in excess of the antidumping duties and other price measures that are permitted under the wtos antidumping agreement25 in response to this ruling the conference report of the miscellaneous tariff bill included provision that repeals the 1916 antidumping act prospectively the legislation however does not appear to affect pending cases filed under the law it is thus uncertain whether this form of repeal will end all wto litigation on the statute particularly due to japans continuing insistence that the repeal end all current court proceedings26 byrd amendment the third high profile compliance case involved the byrd amendment which requires annual disbursement of antidumping and countervailing duties to petitioners and interested parties instead of to the us treasury in the underlying trade remedy proceedings wto panel in 2002 ruled that the cdsoa violates wto obligations in part because it provides an extra protection to industries already benefitting from imposition of dumping and countervailing duty orders when congress did not comply with eliminating or changing the act to conform to wto obligations by the yearend 2003 deadline wto arbitrator was appointed and in august 2004 ruled that eight complaining countries could impose retaliatory duties on us exports in given amount the wto on november 26 2004 authorized seven of the countries to retaliate but restrictions on us exports have been imposed to date unlike the eti case there does not appear to be congressional consensus in favor of repeal while the bush administration proposed repeal of the cdsoa in its fy2004 and fy2005 budgets and repeal legislation was introduced in 108th congress predominant congressional sentiment appears to be against repeal for example 70 senators in 2003 wrote president bush urging negotiations with us trading partners aimed at recognizing right to disburse antidumping and countervailing duties in the manner prescribed by the statute prior to any attempt to change our laws in addition the consolidated appropriations act of 2004 pl108199 included directive to the united states trade representative to initiate wto negotiations aimed at allowing such disbursements the united states 25 crs report rl32014 pp 1519 26 inside us trade japan insists 1916 repeal must end pending cases quiet on retaliation october 22 2004 crs9 submitted such proposal as part of the doha round of negotiations on april 26 200427 congressional support for the wto the eti and cdsoa disputes illustrate tension in congressional views towards the wto some members of congress have charged that some of the wto dispute settlement rulings infringe on us sovereignty by undermining domestic tax and trade remedy laws bush administration trade officials have expressed concerns that some of the panel rulings go too far in determining how wto members should comply with adverse rulings others believe that the us should not implement the adverse rulings until the eu fully lifts its moratorium on biotechnology approvals supporters of the wto dispute resolution process argue that the united states was the chief proponent of creating stronger and more binding dispute settlement process they also claim that the system works in keeping markets open to us exports and that complaints only arise when the system chips away at some of the vestiges of us protection were the united states or other leading wto members to ignore wto findings they argue that the dispute resolution process could be severely weakened congress mixed views on the wto could affect consideration of resolution withdrawing the united states from the agreement establishing the world trade organization section 125 of the uruguay round agreements act the law that implemented changes negotiated in the last round of multilateral trade negotiations permits any member of congress to introduce such resolution within 90 days after the administration submits report analyzing the costs and benefits of us participation in the wto by statute the administration is required to submit this report to congress by march 1 2005 while such resolution may not attract majority support in either house it could serve as focal point for debate on outstanding bilateral trade disputes that are being settled under the aegis of the wto importrelated legislation us policies affecting imports tend to be shaped largely by mixture of economic principles and practical political considerations unanticipated events and broader foreign policy considerations also serve to influence the development of specific policies from year to year28 the case for maintaining relatively open market for the purchase of foreign goods and services rests on the view that imports provide multiple economic benefits for consumers imports provide goods that are often available at lower prices or simply not produced in the united states foreign goods also can benefit us 27 crs report rl32014 wto dispute settlement status of us compliance in pending cases by jeanne j grimmett 28 for full discussion see cohen stephen d joel r paul and robert becker fundamentals of us foreign trade policy westview press 2003 crs10 companies by providing needed inputs at lower prices and by encouraging cost cutting and innovation29 decisions to deviate from the economic rationale for maintaining relatively open policies towards imports usually rest on practical political considerations although consumers and many producers benefit from having access to imported goods and services some workers can lose their jobs and some companies can go out of business due to rapid increases in imports that compete headtohead with domestic production to address displacement international as well as domestic rules have been established to provide temporary relief to those hurt or injured by import competition these rules also stipulate various measures or barriers governments may employ depending in large part on whether the import competition being curbed is considered fair or unfair30 us government policies that affect the relative receptivity or openness of the us market to imports are also affected from year to year by unanticipated events the large and growing us merchandise trade deficit for example may increase demands for protection from import competition as the number of companies and workers hurt by imports increases relative to those helped by exports when the increase in the trade deficit is being accounted for disproportionately by one country much more scrutiny is likely to be given to that countrys trading practices31 foreign policy objectives can also affect import policies efforts for example to forge closer economic and political ties with specific regions or countries can lead to more open or less restrictive policies via the extension of preferential access to the us market congressional actions in 2003 and 2004 reflected the interaction of these cross cutting pressures in five legislative categories 1 protection of american workers and industry from import competition 2 offshoring or outsourcing of service jobs 3 trade with china 4 extension of tariff preferences generally as well as for specific regionscountries and 5 importation of prescription drugs jobs and import competition as trades share of us production exports and imports of goods and services as percent of gdp has risen from around 9 in the early 1960s to around 24 today more firms communities and workers benefit as well as are hurt by trade because the benefits of trade are diffused across the economy and the costs are concentrated and localized groups hurt by trade are often much more concerned and active about the development of us trade policies as result numerous members of congress are often under intense pressure to respond to demands for protection 29 crs report rl32059 trade trade barriers and trade deficits

elwell crs11 from import competition as the number of companies and workers hurt by imports increases protection for the us steel industry was prominent concern of many members of congress in the 108th congress many members in 2003 actively supported the steel industrys efforts to persuade president bush to extend the import restraint regime he had imposed in march 2002 while others supported steelconsuming industries efforts to roll back the import restraints32 large number of members also worked to insure that us antidumping and countervailing duty laws are not weakened in the ongoing doha multilateral negotiations at time of increasing competition rising trade deficit and greater openness to foreign products than ever before such trade remedy tariffs are viewed by some as the only viable form of protection for us domesticallybased producers while not acted on several bills designed to strengthen these laws were introduced33 other industries such as sugar beef and dairy lobbied congress for exclusion from various ftas the administration was negotiating while some of these industries were successful number of members actively lobbied the administration to adopt policy of product or industry exclusions in ftas the textile and apparel and steel industries backed efforts in the house to strengthen and expand both the buy american and berry provisions in the fy2004 and 2005 department of defense dod authorization and appropriations bills the buy american act is the major domestic preference statute governing procurement by the federal government by providing preference for american goods in government purchases the berry amendment is more specific buy americantype provision that requires the dod to give preference to domestically produced manufactured or home grown products notably food clothing fabrics and speciality metals34 in the 108th congress representative duncan hunter chairman of the house armed services committee sought to expand the scope of buy america and establish reciprocity in defense trade especially by restricting the practice of offsets the bush administration large defense contractors and key members of the senate armed services committee opposed the house effort to expand these provisions and for the most part were successful35 with the elimination of global quotas on textile and apparel products beginning in

administration to impose import restraints in order to ensure less disruptive adjustment process other legislative proposals are also likely to be considered36 legislation dealing with more prescriptive countryoforigin labeling requirements for certain food products was also considered in the 108th congress the house agriculture committee approved on july 21 2004 bill hr 4576 to make countryoforigin labeling cool requirements for certain food products voluntary previous legislation the 2002 farm bill as modified by fy2004 agricultural appropriation bill pl 108199 had established mandatory labeling program for fresh produce red meats and peanuts starting september 30 2006 and for seafood starting september 30 2004 the 108th congress adjourned without change in this position some lawmakers support mandatory program as health and safety issue and others counter that cool is marketing issue and should be voluntary37 offshoring of service jobs new wrinkle brought about by globalization was growing alarm about whether us multinationals were increasingly offshoring or relocating service sector jobs to lowwage countries such as india and china the economic report of the president released by the council of economic advisors in february 2004 set off heated debate by calling offshoring good thing for the economy in the long run the report added that offshoring was just new way of doing international trade as the information and communications revolution enables companies to out source wider array of services ranging from routine call center work to higher value software programming medical diagnosis and research and analytical activities many members of congress anxious that offshoring might lead to reduction in us output and corresponding loss of jobs amidst an economic recovery with unusually low job creation were openly critical of the report some responded by offering amendments that would prohibit government agencies from outsourcing work abroad some called for an examination of the us tax code to determine if us tax policy encourages offshoring others called for improving the data the government collects on offshoring so that policymakers can obtain more accurate understanding of this phenomenon still other proposals addressed the dislocation faced by workers in the services sector through amendments to trade adjustment assistance program that would give service workers such as software programmers the same extended unemployment insurance and retraining benefits established for tradeimpacted manufacturing workers38

offshoring aka offshore outsourcing and job insecurity among us workers by linda levine crs13 while much of the debate about outsourcing died down after the presidential primary season ended the flurry of concern does point up underlying anxiety about globalizations impact on jobs particularly during 34 year period where the economy has lost an estimated 24 million manufacturing jobs39 china trade challenge anxiety about job losses to foreign competitors also focused substantially on china public and congressional concerns prompted in part by large and growing bilateral trade deficit pointed directly to chinas increasing ability to manufacture an array of products that could displace us workers in industries ranging from textiles and apparel to auto parts and advanced technology goods in response several bills were introduced to pressure china to eliminate the pegging of its currency to the dollar policy deemed by many as currency manipulation designed in part to keep chinas

scheduled lifting of all import quotas on textiles and apparel on january 1 2005 us companies and labor unions representing textile and apparel workers have been petitioning the administration to provide import protection before disruption occurs41 while the administration has imposed some safeguards on certain textile products it is under pressure from some in congress to do more many analysts have predicted that china could capture as much as 70 percent of the american textile and apparel market over the next two years42 taking harder line towards china however may endanger other

act of 2004 legislation to amend the african growth and opportunity act agoa of 2000 title i pl 106200 passed the house and senate in june 2004 and was signed by president bush on july 13 2004 pl

products and other benefits such as technical assistance to subsaharan african countries that meet certain criteria relating to market reform and human rights the agoa acceleration act of 2004 extends the agoa program to 2015 as well as amends several existing provisions in order to spur investment in beneficiary countries45 by extending the preference program to 2015 supporters hope to expand gains for the beneficiary countries 37 of the 48 subsaharan countries are currently eligible for benefits by improving the stability of the investment climate in africa the agoa acceleration act of

they are not produced in the united states or are produced overseas by us multinational corporation and are imported into the united states by corporation for its own domestic use congressional

in 2003 by opposition from one senator concerned about textiles trade and in 2004 by two senators opposed to providing laos with permanent normal trading relations status the act temporarily reduces or eliminates duties on approximately 400 products mainly chemicals and grants normal trade relations status to armenia and laos for laos the change will reduce tariffs on its exports to the united states from an average level of 45 to roughly 2547 the act also provides additional textile trade benefits to mauritius and includes provision repealing the 1916 antidumping act importing prescription drugs the 108th congress engaged in an intense debate generated by rising prices for prescription drugs as prices have risen so too has consumer interest in purchasing more affordable medications from abroad where prices are estimated to be anywhere from 35 55 lower these price disparities have encouraged us consumers two million by one canadian estimate as well as growing numbers of state and local governments to attempt to import comparable medications from abroad to realize savings48 however under current law only the manufacturer of prescription drug may legally bring it into the united states us pharmacists and wholesalers are only allowed to do so if the secretary of health and human services hhs first certifies that those drugs would be safe and that the program significantly reduced drug costs to us consumers because at this writing hhs has never taken this step consumers pharmacists and wholesalers are prohibited from importing prescription drugs49 this issue was

effectiveness50 the bush administration has generally opposed the legislation asserting that it cannot vouch for the safety and effectiveness of imported drugs that come from unregistered and uninspected facilities in foreign countries the administration has also asserted that allowing drug imports at least in the case of canada would do little to solve the underlying problem this is not only because canada does not have enough drugs to supply the us market but also because us drug companies would probably respond to such move by reducing shipments to canada for importation to the united states at the same time president bush stated in october 2004 in the second presidential debate that his administration was carefully studying the issues to see if the government could ensure the safety of imported drugs in other ways exportrelated legislation us export policy usually entails contradictory mix of policies that both promotes as well as restricts exports export promotion efforts are touted on the basis of their contribution to job creation and healthy economy export promotion advocates commonly emphasize the number of jobs associated with the production of goods for export and that they tend to be higherwage and higherskilled jobs than average the united states tends to promote or expand exports through the provision of subsidized trade financing insurance and guarantees to potential customers of us goods through efforts to reduce trade barriers that restrict access of us exports to foreign markets and through provision of trade information and counseling in contrast to export promotion efforts variety of sanctions restrictions and controls are placed on us exports to achieve wide variety of foreign policy and national security goals the basic framework for restricting or controlling most commercial dualuse exports is the export administration act eaa of 1979 the eaa has been employed to control goods and technology whose sales and use abroad could be detrimental to us national security in addition trade and other economic sanctions have been used to promote the protection of human rights and to punish certain countries for objectionable behavior for example statesponsored terrorism military aggression and proliferation exporters whose economic interests are adversely affected by the imposition of export controls or trade sanctions have repeatedly attempted to lessen their utilization as policy option particularly where the controls or sanctions are imposed unilaterally export controls while disproportionately affecting some sectors account for 12 of us exports some of these export policy issues were the subject of legislative activity in the th 108 congress us export promotion efforts attracted limited amount of legislation in the areas of export financing and market access the restrictive component of export policy was the subject of considerably more legislative activity 50 crs report rl32568

countries of belarus burma cuba and syria export promotion currently over dozen federal agencies promote us exports directly or indirectly the us department of agriculture and the exportimport bank are the main agencies promoting us exports through the provision of subsidized financing insurance and guarantees other agencies such as the overseas private investment corporation opic the department of commerce and the trade and development agency undertake activities that can indirectly facilitate us exports by providing financing investment insurance and other services for us investors in 144 developing countries opic can help promote economic growth that stimulates demand for us exports the office of the us trade representative by negotiating reductions in foreign trade barriers also has the capacity to indirectly facilitate us exports recently these activities have not been controversial although some members of congress argue that funding for export promotion activities represent corporate welfare and should be cut back or abolished nevertheless congress approved fy2005 requests from the bush administration for increases in federal spending on export promotion and extended the operating authority of opic through fy2007 pl 108158 several bills designed to help trade officials negotiate better access to foreign markets were introduced none were acted on economic sanctions the objective of expanding us exports collides with variety of sanctions restrictions and controls placed on us exports as in the past the use of trade to promote foreign policy objectives was an important part of congressional activity in 2003 and 2004 unilateral trade sanctions were one tool utilized in legislation that became law to deal with oppressive or rogue regimes in burma syria and belarus tradefinancing sanction imposed against libya was lifted and numerous provisions affecting us trade sanctions towards cuba were the subject of considerable congressional activity in may 2003 congress reacted to the burmese juntas crackdown on democratic opposition by passing the burmese freedom and democracy act of 2003 pl 108 61 the act bans imports from burma and affects mainly textiles and garments the ban is to remain in effect until the president certifies to congress that the burmese government has made major progress in ending human rights violations and in taking steps towards the establishment of more democratic government51 in the fall of 2003 congress passed the syria accountability act and lebanese sovereignty restoration act pl 108175 the act imposes additional sanctions 51 crs report rs20749 burmaus relations by larry niksch the burmese freedom and democracy act of 2003 was extended by the 108th congress with enactment of hjres 97 as pl 108272 crs18 against syria unless it halts support for terrorism and international terrorist groups among other activities on may 11 2004 president bush implemented the provisions of pl 108175 by banning the export of military and dual use items the export of all items except food and medicines and syrian aircraft landing or overflight rights in the united states however libya remains on the terrorist list pursuant to sec 6j of the export administration act of 197952 congressional concerns about human rights abuses in belarus culminated in the passage of sanctions legislation in the fall of 2004 the belarus democracy act which became law pl108347 on october 20 2004 mandates variety of sanctions on belarus these include prohibitions on strategic exports financial assistance and sense of the congress that the united states should oppose multilateral assistance to belarus these restrictions are to remain in place until belarus meets specific democratic and human rights criteria53 due to the thaw in uslibya relations brought about by libyas renunciation of weapons of mass destruction and payment to families who lost relatives in the downing of pan am 103 some us sanctions have been relaxed the consolidated appropriations act of 2005 pl 108447 authorized the president to lift the ban on exportimport bank financing of us exports to libya the act left in place the current ban on opic activities in libya54 since the early 1960s us policy toward cuba has consisted largely of isolating this communist state through comprehensive economic sanctions while there appears to be broad agreement in congress on bringing democracy to the island congress remains divided on how to achieve that objective in the 108th congress several fy2005 appropriations measures commerce justice and state agriculture and transportationtreasury contained provisions that would have eased cuba sanctions the bush administration had threatened to veto bills if they contained provisions weakening cuba sanctions ultimately all the cuba provisions easing sanctions were stripped out of the fy2005 omnibus appropriations measure pl 108447 hrept 108792 the omnibus bill also contains several other trade provisions including one that requires mexican and canadian trucks to comply with us safety rules and another that outlines priorities for us council designed to combat intellectual property violations as in past congresses numerous free standing bills were also introduced to either tighten or weaken the cuba sanctions regime but action was taken on these measures55 52 crs issue brief

controls in the 108th congress legislation hr 55 was again introduced but not acted on to rewrite and reauthorize the export administration of 1979 eaa the eaa provides the statutory authority for export controls on sensitive dualuse goods and technologies items that have both civilian and military applications including those items that can contribute to the proliferation of nuclear biological and chemical weaponry for many years now efforts to renew the act have been complicated by continued tension between national security and commercial concerns some observers contend that current export controls hurt us business by subjecting technology exports to what they consider cumbersome and ineffective licensing process that costs sales and loses markets to overseas competitors others maintain that current controls are not strong enough to prevent the spread of dualuse technologies to adversaries or potential proliferators and that the eaa legislation as introduced in the 108th congress would further weaken the system congressional interest in eaa reform has been heightened by questions about the efficacy of export controls in the fight against terrorism56 implications for the 109th congress the 109th congress can be expected to face trade agenda that will be at least as extensive as the 108th congress much of the legislation that died in committee may be reintroduced in the 109th congress to address persisting challenges and problems affecting trade negotiations wto rules imports and exports new legislation may also be introduced to deal with statutory requirements and changes in the us political and economic landscape early in 2005 president bush is expected to request that his authority to negotiate trade agreements under expedited congressional approval trade promotion authority be extended for two years beyond its june 30 2005 expiration date the extension would happen automatically unless either chamber passes resolution of disapproval in addition the president is expected to send to congress legislation to implement the us free trade agreement with bahrain early in the first session and may also send legislation to implement the fta with five central american countries cafta and possibly the dominican republic if dispute over recent tax placed on high fructose syrup drinks can be resolved the bush administration will likely
