worldwide the us agency for international deve lopment usaid funds and implements the majority of us tcb programs in fy2005 the millennium ch allenge corporation mcc began to fund tcb activities and in fy2006 and fy2007 it overtook usaid as the agency with the highest tcb obligations other agencies also provide tcb including the us department of agriculture the department of commerce the treasury department the depa rtment of labor and the us trade and development agency ustda the united states also contributes to multilateral funds for tcb and it contributes to multilate ral development banks

broadly defined as development assistance aimed at helping countries bu ild the physical human and institutional capacity to participate in global trade it includes assistance to negotiate implement and benefit from trade agreements such as agreements within the world trade organization wto and regi onal and bilateral free trade agreements many experts consider tcb to be vital for developing c ountries to benefit fro m trade liberalization and to participate actively in the global ec onomy in turn trade liberalization and participation in the global economy are considered important factors in promoting economic growth and poverty reduction this report examines key issues in tcb provides an overview of us and inte rnational tcb programs and explores congressional involvement in tcb tcb is provided by bilateral donors such as the united states the european commission individual european countri and japan korea and canada multilateral institutions such as the wo rld bank the interamerican development bank idb the world trade organization wto and the united nations also provide tcb direct recipients of tc b include government ministries customs officials business owners local nong overnmental organizations ngos and farmers tcb can take the form of work shops onthejob training data collection feasibility studies infrastructure upgrades and efficiency improvements in procedures ideally developing countries incorporate tcb needs in their national development plans and tcb programs are planned in partnership between recipient and donor countries the us government provides tcb assistance to developing countries worldwide on bilateral basis and through contributions to multilateral organizations and established global tcb trust funds the us agency for international development u said has historically provi ded the bulk of us tcb assistance but other agencies such as the us department of agriculture usda us department of comme rce and us trade and development agency ustda also provide such assistance the millennium challenge corporation mcc first provided tcb assistance in fy2005 nd in fy2006 and fy2007 its tcb funding obligations surpassed those of usaid us tcb is not currently discrete line item with its own budget it is funded through veral different initiatives within usaid and other agencies in fy2007 us govern ment agencies reported obligating nearly 14 billion to tcb of which over 1 billion was obligated by the mcc andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33628crs2 1 data was selfreported by us government agencies and can be found

trade organization november 2007 3 for more information on the doha round negotiations see crs report rl32060 world trade organization negotiations the doha development agenda by ian fergussonusaid1 according to the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the united states llocated about 25 of its total official development assistance oda to tcb between 2002 and 20052 interest in tcb has grown in the donor community both in the united states and abroad as developing countries b ecome more involved in trade negotiations trade capacity becomes higher priority issue for them and for donors developing countries from every region have entere d free trade agreement fta negotiations with the united states or the european uni on they have also been heavily engaged in the doha round of wto negotiations in order to conclude the doha round and other trade negotiations deve loping country needs may require consideration and that may include additional resources for tcb congress has several policy interests in tcb first tcb may be included in some potential free trade agreements ftas the united states has concluded fta negotiations with some deve loping countries and congre ss may be asked to consider implementing legislation for these potentia l ftas congress so appropriates funds for tcb through usaid and other budgets congress may play role in oversight of tcb programs to ensure effectiveness and adherence to us interests tcb is also considered compliment to us trade preference programs such as the african growth and opportunity act agoa wh ich congress oversees finally tcb is provided to developing countries through their participation in the wto and has been topic of discussion in the d oha development ag enda dda round of negotiations3 congress may consider implementing legislation for wto agreement and tcb could be important in that discussion defining trade capacity building there is set definition of tcb in trade and development public policy discourse narrow definition of tcb might include only assistance directly related to trade agreements such as assistance to negotiate and implement such agreements however tcb is usually defi ned more broadly to include all types of development assistance that directly affect countrys capacity to participate in trade this broader definition of tcb is assumed for the purpose of this report see the box on page 4 for elaboration on the various ar eas of tcb assistance the assistance contained within the broad definition of tcb includes addressing the regulatory environment for business trade and inves tment supplyside constraints such as low productive and entrepreneuria l capacity and inadequate physical infrastructure such as transport and storage facilities the goals of tcb include overcoming adjustment costs from liberalized trade offsetting high implementation costs of tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33628crs3 4 international lawyers and economists agai nst poverty ileap aid for trade why and howagreements offsetting preference erosion from multilateral liberalization offsetting lost tariff revenue improvi ng negotiating capacity nd addressing supplyside constraints that make it difficult for deve loping countries to compete in world markets4 risk of defining tcb too broadly is that almost any assistance activity can be loosely defined as tcb there are many areas of assistance that focus on domestic policy and capacity issues in developing country for example business regulatory regimes but also have direct consequences for trade however there are other areas of assistance such as providing training to local microenterprises that are not likely to engage in international trade where the linkage to trade is often not clear in some cases two similar projects in different count ries can be similarl described on paper but may be implemented with different objectives in mind one project may be strongly traderelated while another may not qualify strongly as tcb this poses problem when examining the aggregate tcb data it is useful to know the total amounts of tcb assistance provided to diffe rent countries for summary purposes but this data should be viewed as an inexact timate of tcb rather than as definitive tool for measuring tcb assistance trade capacity building has some synonyms it is also referred to as aid for trade or traderelated technical assistance trta especially within the context of the wto some distinctions can be made between these terms but since there is agreement on them they are treated as interchangeable within this report categories of tcb most developing countries lack the phy sical institutional or human capacity to participate effectively in world trade physical capacity includes infrastructure essential to trade such as ports roads and storage facilities institutional capacity refers to the business and trade policy environment in addition to the strength of the financial sector institutional capacity relates to the existence of effective administrative and regulatory regimes including property rights and formal business registration procedures human capacity refers to the technical competence of individuals such as governme nt officials entrepreneurs and producers to contribute to international trade the box on th following page breaks down further the different categories of tcbhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33628crs4 areas of tcb assistance trade facilitation improving the efficiency of international trade flows through reducing the costs and time required for goods to cross

preference erosion impacts and policy responses geneva june 1314 2005why trade capacity building trade capacity building is based on the premise that trade liberalization leads to economic growth for both developed nd developing countries but developing countries do not have the capacity to ach ieve tradeled econo mic growth without assistance on more basic level tc b assumes that donors can have an impact on trade capacity in developing countries tcb is often cited as an important complement to market access which is believed to be necessary but insufficient for developing countries to incr ease participation in trade other reasons given for tcb are to offset preference erosion and the adjustment costs of trade liberalization market access may be insufficient increased market access through preferential treatment trade agreements and other programs may not be sufficient to in crease developing count ries participation in international trade beginning with the generalized system of preferences gsp5 in the 1970s the united states and othe r developed countries have provided increased market access to products from developing countries through trade preference programs trade preference pr ograms provide dutyfree andor quotafree access to certain products fro m certain developing count ries with stated limitations such as rules of origin despite the gsp and other trade preference programs such as the african growth and opportunity act agoa6 most developing countries have not substantially increased their trade globally or with the united states perhaps more importantly ma ny developing countries ve not diversified their exports out of primary commodities low income developing c ountries have faired the worst between 1990 and 2003 low income developing countries only increased their share of the global market for nonoil trade by one half percentage point and least developed countries l dc have only maintained th eir market share during the same time period middle income countries increased their market share by about 14 percentage points7 few exceptions have occurred in countries that have attracted investments in textile and apparel manufacturing some critics blame the lack of trade growth on the preference programs themselves arguing that the rules of orig in are too stringent or that the programs exclude products in which developing countries have competitive advantage8 also the temporary nature of preference programs may add greater uncertainty to an already risky business environment discouraging both foreign and

erosion the terms of the debate in richard newfarmer ed trade doha and development window into the issues world bank november 2005investment other experts believe that trade capacity is more important factor than any of the above it is broadly accepted that many developing countries have not benefitted from market acce ss opportunities because of inadequate knowledge of these opportunities noncompetitive produc tion capacity lack of the necessary exporting infrastructure inability to meet prevailing standards in high value export markets and being crowded out of some markets by domestic support and export subsidies of developed countries9 this view is not new 1980 congressional budget office cbo report found that act ual exports depend on the ability of the economy to produce competitively and prefer ences of the sort granted by gsp may not be sufficient to compensate for the differences in competitiveness among countries or between us producers and those in developing countries10 trade preference erosion trade preference erosion is concern in the few countries where preference programs have had significant impact ch as in lesotho and bangladesh where booming apparel industries have increased incomes and employment trade preference erosion may cause decline in the emerging apparel industries in these and other countries because as trade libera lization occurs their margin of preference is reduced11 the margin of preference is the difference between the cost of the duty andor quota for most favored nation mfn exporters and the developing country exporters receiving preferential treatment with reduced margin of preference the developing countries may longer be co mpetitive with more developed lowercost producers such as china this prospect has prompted certain developing country wto members to oppose tariff reductions in certain goods on the basis that it would diminish their preferences tcb may mitigate the effects of trade preference erosion by helping developing countries to increas their competitiveness in the industries in question and diversify into other areas some observers consider it to be more politically feasible than monetary comp ensation which has been proposed by some developing countries as possible solution adjustment costs the united states and other donors ma provide tcb to help developing country economies

as they are put to use in growth sector s in developing countries this transition period can be especially slow and difficu lt and may never r eally end certain regions especially in rural areas ma not attract new industries to replace employment opportunities lost from the less fficient sectors therefore tcb aims to help developing countries cope with this dislocation the historical context for tcb the development community was skeptical about using trade as vehicle for economic growth and development in the 1960s and 1970s at the time import substitution i ndustrialization isi where deve loping countries limited imports of manufactured products to foster domestic manufacturing sector was the prevailing theory in trade and development aid was used to support i ndustrialization and not to foster trade in the 1980s after the pparent failure of isi policies there was shift in mainstream development thinking to the view that removing barriers to trade and other market distortions would foster growth as the expected gains from trade and economic reforms did not materialize another shift in development thought took place in the late 1990s the development ag enda changed its focus to strengthening institutions that support markets and tr adeled growth development experts recognized that liberalized trade was necessary but not sufficient for increased growth and poverty reduction12 at the same time capacity development became popular term during the 1990s reflecting th need for demanddriven assistance as opposed to assistance imposed from outside and based primarily on what donors were willing and able to provide13 tcb grew from these ideas about trade and development since the beginning of us deve lopment assistance in the 1950s us development programs have had elements of what we now refer to as tcb assistance the types of tcb assistan ce provided from agricultural development to transportation infrastructure have change d based on the evolving focus of overall us development assistance the composition and focus of such assistance over the last 60 years have been determined mainly by changes in us foreign policy prevailing theories of development and domestic

parlance around 1999 even though many of the programs included in tcb had been ongoing for years before tcb the terms used for similar assistance were generally technical assistance or technical coope ration the development of tcb as concept brought some changes to the planning and impleme ntation of tcb programs in the past these programs were conceived as gene ral economic developm ent programs and not necessarily formed with wider trade ag enda in mind more importantly capacity building relies on partnershi p with beneficiaries invol ving variety of actors including government private sector and nongovernmental organizations ngos15 tcb programs are also meant to be planne d in coordination with trade policy with tcb on the agenda trade officials both in the united states and in

billion in 2006 and 2007 it is possible that this pparent fourfold increase over seven years is partly due to greater reporting of tcb assistance by the re sponsible agencies as well as an inclination to include more activities within the definition of tcb however there has also been increased interest in tcb which may have led to greater funding for more programs from fy1999 to fy2005 usaid funded

shows breakdown of the di fferent agencies shares of tcb funding in 2005 some agencies impleme nt tcb funded by other agencies so figure 5 which illustrates tcb assistance imp lementation rather than funding shows slightly wider distribution of tcb implementation across agencies for example the department of labor and the department of agricu lture both fund their own programs and implement tcb activities funded by other agencies such as usaid and the state department this interagency cooperation is an example of agencies coordinating their activities thr ough the interagency group the other category represents greater share of tcb program implement ation because many agencies with relatively small tcb progra ms are funded by other agencies low level of tcb funding by particular agency may not be indicativ of inconsequential involvement in tcb some important tcb pr ograms require less funding than others infrastructure development is inherently more expensive and workshops are less

particular agreement or negotiation source crs based on data from usaid tcb database httpqesdbcdieorgtcbindexhtml the fact that tcb is provided by many different us government agencies has been cited as both an advantage and s ource of concern on the advantage side more agency involvement m eans greater support from wider pool of expertise and funding options in some cases expertise is at least as important as funding and it can be helpful to have us regulatory agencies understand tcb objectives one example of this benefit is the us department of agricultures animal and plant health inspection service aphis aphis is primarily regulatory agency with the responsibility of protecting us agricu lture from foreign pests and diseases obtaining clearance from aphis has been notoriously difficult for agricultural producers from developing countries some have argued that bringing aphis into tcb has not only benefitted veloping countries by provi ding additional expertise but has raised awareness of this problem within aphis the issue of regulatory agencies providing tcb has raised some concerns some observers caution that the mission of regulatory trade agencies generally to protect

compete with commodity grown or produced in the united states there are two exceptions to the bumpers amendment 1 where the activity is designed to increase food security in developing countries and it would not ve significant impact in the export of agricultural commodities to the united states and 2 in the case of research activity intended primarily to benefit american producers usaid

that are party to the international criminal court icc and have not signed an article 98 agreement29 these statutory restrictions are catalogue d and summarized by usaid30 policy issues motivations for trad capacity building trade capacity building is generally regarded as an activity taken on by the united states and other donors for altruistic purposes to help developing countries benefit from trade and achieve poverty reduction there are other possible motivations for tcb that are not as altruistic one possible motivation is to create markets for us exports tcb might achieve this objective indirectly by increasing developing countries incomes which would in turn would allow developing countries to import more goods from the united states tcb can more directly create markets for us exports by influe ncing developing count ries policies such as technical standards to be more open to us goods and by promoting development in sectors that would likely require imports of intermediate products and capital goods from the united states the us exportimport bank facilitates this process by providing loans to busin esses in developing countries to import american capital goods such as factory equipment another possible motivation for providin g tcb is to gain the cooperation of developing countries in trade negotiations bot h bilateral and multilateral by helping trade officials in devel oping countries understand th technical aspects of an agreement they are more likely to complete negotiations and implement the agreement developing count ries are also more likely to be agreeable in negotiations if they expect to receive assistance in implementing the agreement an example ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33628crs28 this can be found in the trade facilitati on negotiations of the wto doha round at first developing countries di d not want trade facilitation to be part of the round at all however once they started receiving tec hnical assistance in trade facilitation and technical assistance became part of the tr ade facilitation negotiations the negotiations moved along more easily than other negotiating areas also technical assistance in trade facilitation caused some countries to make unilatera l trade facilitation reforms without any obligation under wto agreement critics of us trade policy contend that tcb may be used to deflect attention from failure of the united states and ot her donor countries to adopt propoor trade reform they point to high us tariffs on imports produced by developing countries and tradedistorting agricultural subsidies other critics believe that us tcb is influenced more by political objectives than development goals they note that iraq was the thirdlargest recipient of u s tcb funds in 2005 after honduras and nicaragua which both received the majority of their tcb assistance from the millennium challenge corpora tion some observers have also questioned whether the administration uses tcb as way to in fluence developing country trade policies without going through the trade negotiations process conflicting interests trade capacity building may conflict w ith some perceived us interests building the negotiating capacity of deve loping countries may make reaching agreement easier but it might also help them to negotiate more aggressively against us positions also assisting developing countries to be more competitive in world markets may help them to compete against us businesses however the same argument can be made for the benefits of increased competition through tcb as through trade liberalization increas ed competition tends to increase firm productivity and may benef it both consumers and workers through decreased consumer prices and increased wages as in trade liberalization however the benefits and losses associated with increased competition can be unevenly distributed in the economy causing some regions and industries to suffer losses of jobs and incomes disproportionately although one major difference with general trade liberalization is that most tcb recipients are poor countries that are not likely to provide major competition to us business exceptions to this difference may be found in few major agricultural and tex tile producers who receive tcb assistance challenges for trade capacity building one major challenge for tcb as an area of foreign assistance is to coordinate assistance with the trade policy agenda and to effectively integrate tcb assistance and trade into developing countries nationa l development strategies changing trade policies such as reducing trade barriers through free trade agreement fta may require new types of assistan ce to help developing countri benefit from trade in this way trade is not an end in itself but tool for development to fully utilize trade as tool for development it also needs to be considered in all aspects of development planning economic and social policies that have been considered separately from trade in the past may have an effect on countrys competitiveness and ability to benefit from trade therefore policymakers should have an appreciation for

development planning is that national development strategies are typically planned on re latively long timeframe through processes such as the poverty reducti on strategy paper prsp31 while trade needs can change more quickly as result there may be tension between responding to changing trade needs and long term development planning another major challenge for tcb is international donor coordination tcb assistance is provided by wide range of donors in multitude of sectors and there has been some overlap and duplication am ong donors this overlap and duplication of efforts is not only wasteful but it can cause confusion and make programs less effective demanddriven tcb assistance where donor s provide assistance based on the strategies and requests of recipient governments has inhe rent benefits and may help facilitate donor coordination for tcb assist ance to be demanddriven recipients need to be proactive in assessing and communicating their needs and donors need to orient their assistance around t hose stated needs one example of this has been in the tcb provided alongside the caftadr negotiations where there was close communication between usaid ustr and the recipient governments in the context of the negotiations32 there is concern that some tcb recipient countries may lack the capacity to assess and prioritize their needs which would hinder achieving demanddriven assistance tcb recipients have complained that they lack the capacity to coordinate the assistance they receive from various donors it is especially difficult when the assistance comes in the form of multiple shortterm projects rather than long term strategy that is coordinate d with national development plans some steps toward international donor coordina tion have reportedly been taken notably through the oecd and the wto donor coordi nation has been hampered because donor countries and organizations ge nerally prefer to take cred it for their efforts and they tend to have different stra tegies and mechanisms for planning and implementing foreign assistance this leads to assist ance being supplydriven that is driven by what donor countries are able and willin g to provide according to experts assistance must be driven by the partner c ountrys own needs goals and strategies to be effective rather than being driv by the donor countrys administrative priorities33 oecd members agreed to implement this principle of foreign aid in the paris declaration on aid effectiveness34httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33628crs30 35 us government accountability office foreign assistance us trade capacity building extensive but its effectiveness has yet to be evaluated report to congressional requesters gao05150 february 2005 36 organization for economic cooperation and development the development dimension aid for trade making it effective july 2006evaluating the effectiveness of tcb is another challenge the us government accountability office gao i ssued report in february 2005 which determined that the united states government does not effectively monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of tcb programs it recommended that usaid and ustr work together to develop strategy in consultation with other us agencies that provide tcb for evaluating tcb effectiveness35 ustr and usaid have responded to this recommendation and are re portedly in the pro cess of developing evaluation mechanisms measuring the effectiveness of tcb can be difficult because meaningful indicators are not readily available chan ges in trade volumes and other high level indicators are not necessarily attributable to tcb trade volumes respond to many factors of which tcb is just one and not as significant in the short term as economic factors such as commodity price fluctuations lower level indicators such as the number of people trained in wto negotiations may be entirely attributable to tcb but they do not say much about the effects of such training according to the oecd the most measurable and positive outcome of tcb has been in the awareness of wto issues participation in the doha round negotiations and the development of national policy dialogue on trade among the various stakeholders in business government and civil society the oecd finds that where this dialogue has been most robust tcb has been most effective36 this finding may be key in developing framework for evaluating tcb an ongoing challenge for us tcb is that it is just one area in which the united states provides development assistance and it must compete with other priorities for limited resources some of these other development prioritie s involve responding to emergencies where lives are at stake ch as aid in response to natural disasters conflict situations nd severe health concerns it may be difficult to argue for funding for tcb when other areas of assi stance are needed to help people survive tcb may not directly save lives but it c ould in the long term reduce countries vulnerability in dire situa tions by helping to increase incomes and reduce poverty
