sanctuary even president george w bush who campaigned against military involvement in peripheral operations and reiterated his opposition to nationbuilding2 prior to launching opera tion enduring freedom changed his opinion soon after major fighting ended thus the united states embarked on concerted nationbuilding effort the importance of nationbuilding is codified in various highlevel us policy documents the presidents national security strategy specifically mentions afghanistan as we pursue the terrorists in afghanistan we will continue to work with international organizations as well as nongovernmental organizations and other countries to provide the humanitarian political economic and security assistance necessary to rebuild afghanistan so that it will never again provide haven for terrorists 3 secretary of defense donald rumsfelds national defense strategy calls for the capability to defeat adversaries in two separate theaters and to turn one of these operations into more decisive and enduring result to achieve this more ambitious endstate we must plan for extended stability operations involving sub stantial combat and requiring the rapid and sustained application of national and interna tional capabilities spanning the elements of state power 4 likewise one national military strategy goal directs us to prevail against adversaries stability operations are specified as one way to accomplish this end winning decisively will require synchronizing and integrating major combat operations stability operations and significant postconflict interagency operations to establish conditions of stability and security the joint force must be able to transition from major combat operations to stability operations and to conduct those operations simultaneously5 the lack of planning for and erratic execution of postconflict operations in recent american endeavors particularly in iraq likely prompted the publication of national security presidential directive nspd44 and department of defense dod direc tive 300005 mandating unprecedented government attention to this significant issue nspd44 empowers the secretary of state to lead and coordinate the nations efforts to plan and execute reconstruction and stabilization assistance in particular the state department will identify states at risk of instability and develop detailed contingency plans for integrated recon struction and stabilization efforts which are integrated with military contingency plans where appropriate 6 the directive also the united states began the war on terror october 7 2001 by attacking taliban and qaeda targets throughout afghanistan special operations forces embedded with indigenous northern alli ance fighters and followed by small ventional force of coalition units defeated the enemy in 2 months and forced its retreat along the afghanpakistan border once major combat operations ended however we faced crucial question what next while intricate preparation had ensured the destruction of the enemy the short timeline between 911 and 107 precluded adequate postconflict planning often referred to as stability and support operations1 it quickly became apparent however that major effort to rebuild afghanistan was necessary by vi n c n t m d r ye r lieutenant colonel vincent m dryer usa wrote this essay as student of the us army war

these documents either directly or indirectly underscore the importance of afghanistans future to americas security the transla tion of emerging doctrine to actual strategy however has been ad hoc and inconsistent current strategy the strategic objective for afghanistan is to rebuild the country in such way that it will never again become terrorist sanctuary complicating this goal is the latent talibanal qaedaled insurgency that threatens all participants in the reconstruction effort given this circum stance the us government is pursuing several ways in cooperation with the international community to solidify afghanistans future as stable peaceful and selfsufficient nation most of the photos top to bottom 0watt broadcast tower built by iranian government for afghan television afghan

economy analysis of the three primary ways being used to reconstitute the failed state of afghanistansecurity sector reform extension of government influence via provincial reconstruction teams prts and economic assistancereveals serious disconnects in the strategy particularly with regard to the resources or means being applied to accomplish the designated ways security sector reform refers to concerted efforts by the international community to share the burden of rebuilding afghanistans basic security institutions at geneva conference in 2002 various nations agreed to assume the role of lead donor in the five most critical tasks at hand the united states is respon sible for creating an afghan national army germany is working to build national police force italy is charged with judicial reform great britain is leading efforts to combat opium cultivation and japan is responsible for the disarmament demili tarization and reintegration of the militias operating throughout the country each effort has experienced its share of setbacks even the american program the most successful of the five suffers from major endsways mismatches germanys efforts at police reform have been plagued by poor planning and lack of commitment although officials offered strategy paper to address the situation they failed to distribute and coordinate it with other donors particularly the united states the largest financial contributor germany also was slow in prompting the united states to begin training program for patrolmen while berlin concentrated on the officer corps until credible competent and honest police force is operational throughout the country it will be impossible for the central government to extend its influence and enforce its policies italy has fallen short in reforming the afghan judicial system currently character ized by conflicting mix of civil religious and customary laws with few trained judges prosecutors or other justice personnel 9 this reform program seriously lags behind the other sectors due to italys failure to allocate adequate personnel and financial resources it has provided only 10 million annually in addition the international communitys inability to address the problem in holistic fashion and the afghan interior ministrys failure to integrate its own internal and police reforms with judicial restructuring impede what is arguably the most important of the five sectors10 although great britain is tackling the opium issue in close coordination with the afghan interior ministry the united states and the united nations office on drugs and crime the drug trade continues to be not only destabilizing but also one of the most profitable income sources for the common farmer accounting for more than half of the economy eradication policies that do not provide options for alternative livelihoods run the risk of alienating large percentage of the population this problem is compounded by the active involvement of many senior government officials in the drug trade including cabinet officials and provin cial governors president hamid karzai has denounced afghanistans opium cultivation he declared holy war against drugs last year but little progress has been made to reduce it until viable program takes effect the warlords who process and smuggle drugs will continue to hinder government efforts the disarmament demilitarization and reintegration program led by japan in close cooperation with the assistance mission in afghanistan unama and the development programme has enjoyed considerable success accounting for the disarmament demobilization and reintegration of over 60000 former afghan military forces and more than 11000 heavy weapons numerous militias some estimates report as many as 850 groups totaling over 65000 members however are not part of the program these groups are controlled and supplied by local warlords drug bosses and in some cases government officials11 until the karzai administration takes firm stand on eliminating these undocumented militias they will remain latent source of instability and rebellion complicating this issue is the paradoxical reliance of coalition commanders on warlords and their fighters to prosecute the counterinsurgency another overarching challenge asso ciated with security sector reform is the interdependent nature of the five tasks which combine to form complex system of systems where progress is constrained when task execution does not proceed evenly for example credible police force is essential for opium eradica tion but it is useless without functioning judicial system this reality makes coordinated concerted effort on behalf of all five lead nations essential furthermore economic recon struction is inherently linked with the success of security sector reform barnett rubin an architect of the bonn agreement notes that if people cannot make an honest living they will gravitate toward criminal activity for example the heroin industry lawbreakers will seek protection from the historic power brokersthe warlordsthereby diminish ing the rule of law this environment fosters an economy based on illegal transactions significantly reducing the tax base essential for the development and maintenance of an army and police force12 the bottom line is that insufficient means planning people and money have been provided for secu rity sector reform although the strategy is prudent inadequate resources as well as insufficient coordination among the lead donors jeopardize success extension of authority to the outlying provinces is another linchpin in americas strategy to rebuild afghanistans central government provincial reconstruction teamsjoint civilianmilitary organizations whose mission is to promote governance security and reconstruction throughout the country13are the coalitions primary means for addressing this critical goal comprised of robust military contingent and interagency representatives from the sponsoring country as well as an afghan government official these teams are designed to export the stable environment currently provided by the united nationsmandated international security assistance force isaf in kabul these teams generally have been praised for their ability to extend central governmental influence outside the capital but numerous problems limit their effective ness first the goals of the prts are not clear current us strategy fails to adequately address many of the obstacles to an enduring peacendupressnduedu issue 43 4th quarter 2006 jfq special featureand vary depending on their sponsoring countries for example americans focus on quickimpact reconstruction projects and internal force protection british teams concentrate on security sector reform and are willing to intervene in warlord confronta tions german teams are much larger up to 300 personnel with substantial civilian contingent british study notes that the lack of common operating protocols and objec tives weakens unity of effort and leads to confusion among national and international actors who cannot predict from one prt to the next what to expect in terms of exper tise level or sustainability of engagement or focus 14 for example the unwillingness of american prts to provide security for nongovernmental organizations ngos has arguably limited the ability of more qualified agencies to provide reconstruction assistance maintaining clear distinction between ngos and prts has been another source of friction james bishop director of interac tion notes that soldiers carrying weapons and wearing civilian clothes while engaging in humanitarian missions have blurred the necessary distinction between members of the military and humanitarian workers potentially putting the latter at risk 15 although prt steering committee headed by the afghan ministry of the interior is in place it has yet to synchronize and standard ize prt operations throughout the country despite problems the overwhelming consensus is that the prt program has had positive impact on stability and reconstruc tion in afghanistan reality that highlights final deficiency there are not enough teams to engage the major population centers let alone the more rural areas michael mcnerney notes that establishing 22 prts in the 3 years after the collapse of the taliban government is snails pace when dealing with an insurgency 16 future plans call for the establishment of only four addi tional prts by the end of 2007 this would leave at least 8 of the 34 provinces without team absent significantly more prts in the hinterland local militias will remain unsta ble police will be ineffective and widespread poppy production will continue economic assistance is the third major focus of us strategy afghanistan was already one of the worlds poorest nations before it suffered through 23 years of conflict the cost of creating government institutions and functioning infrastructure is stagger ing so several donor conferences have been held to solicit funds the afghan government projects the reconstruction bill to be as high as 275 billion for 2002201017 the united states is the largest contributor to this effort providing over third of the 36 billion pledged by the international community for 200418 unfortunately many countries have failed to deliver their pledges causing significant shortage of funds for designated projects despite the best of intentions many designated projects have not met the stated goals for example only 85 schools of the 286 planned were built or refurbished in 200419 the united states is seeking other funding sources for reconstruction the trea sury department unblocked 145 million in afghan assets that were frozen in 1999 likewise nearly all of the sanctions imposed during taliban rule have been lifted the bush administration is also working on trade and investment framework agree ment designed to create bilateral forum to deepen trade and investment relations with afghanistan and is supporting the countrys membership in the world trade organiza tion20 while many of these programs will provide more money for nationbuilding in afghanistan the efficiency with which the funds are spent is the ultimate determinant of success thus far the record is disappointing alternate strategies most critics of the current strategy contend that it is woefully underresourced or that the ways employed do not adequately address the fundamental requirements of nationbuilding few pundits even argue that the endstate itself is flawed james dobbins rand study of past postconflict efforts shows direct correlation between resources and the capacity to provide secu rity build democratic institutions and foster economic development21 citing kosovo as success he notes that the united states and its allies have put 25 times more money and 50 times more troops per capita into postconflict kosovo than into postconflict afghanistan 22 substantial increases in money and manpower would undoubtedly contribute to the success of security sector reform and facilitate the formation of many more prts but there are risks associated with this approach other critics agree with the endstate of afghan nationbuilding but advocate changes to the ways this strategy is pursued kathy gannon argues that us and north atlantic treaty organization nato cooperation with the warlords and their militias presents the most ominous obstacle to afghanistans transition23 she recommends that we cut all ties to the warlords as quickly as possible while eliminating their influence would tribute to national unification and perhaps weaken the opium trade the difficulty of such an undertaking must be acknowledged these warlords are the same individuals who fought side by side with operation endur ing freedom forces to defeat the taliban and who continue to support coalition forces in their counterinsurgencycounterterrorist campaign gannon contends however that continued reliance on the militias and our ongoing provision of weapons and money to them have increased the warlords prestige and influence and eroded karzais authority et her proposal to sever relations involves significant risk as well if the warlords become disenfranchised they could easily muster sufficient forces to challenge the government in kabul and return the country to chaos isaf is neither large enough nor equipped to counter such retaliation the united states could quickly find itself in quagmire comparable to the soviet experience compounded by probable resurgence of the taliban and qaeda although seeing former taliban leaders and current warlords some accused of war crimes assume seats in the recently elected par liament is disturbing to many afghans and outside observers integration of these indi viduals into the political process is the only realistic way to bolster their collaboration in building democratic institutionbased state another group of experts advocates more sweeping modifications to current strategy claiming that the endstate itself is flawed subodh atal argues that the united states should eschew the goal of larger military presence might incite the largely islamic population and feed claims that imperial america is occupying afghanistandreyer3 jfq issue 43 4th quarter 2006 ndupressnduedu special feature nationbuilding in afghanistan for four reasons24 first external aid has proven to be only marginally effective in reconstitut ing failed states second entanglement in afghan internal affairs diverts american attention from the primary mission of defeat ing the taliban and their terrorist guests third coalition and afghan forces have been unable to provide the security necessary for reconstruction fourth the afghan people may begin to resent the presence of foreign soldiers atal recommends that the united states dedicate all efforts toward defeating the insurgency along the afghanpakistan border and then exit immediately to prevent america from becoming entangled in the great game that has plagued other world powers britain and russia for centuries while this proposal would limit the duration of american involvement in afghanistan the shortterm savings would pale in comparison to the dangers generated retooling strategy there is lack of proposed fixes to improve the current policy most seem constructive yet many involve excessive risk pro ceeding on the assumption that reformed afghani stan is vital us interest the following recommendations would retool the current approach rather than discard it wholesale in addition to dedicating adequate funding for reconstruction the bush administration should immediately implement the following courses of action continue the current security sector reform program but apply diplomatic pressure and perhaps economic incentives to persuade the lead donor countries to redouble their commitment and efforts in terms of personnel assigned and money spent to align the prog ress of the five most critical tasks the united states should volunteer to act as security sector reform coordinator and devise system of accountability and regular synchronization meetings to provide forum for cooperation rather than lamenting the problems caused by the interdependence of the tasks we should capitalize on this interdependence and use it as catalyst to drive collaboration to relieve some of the burden on the lead countries the united nations should be lobbied aggressively to assume more promi nent role in security sector reform particu larly in training police and providing local security during reform activities unama has the mandate to promote national recon ciliation fulfill the tasks outlined in the bonn agreement and manage all humanitar ian relief and reconstruction efforts in country while it has done an admirable job particularly with organizing and monitoring the national elections its expertise has not been fully tapped increase the number of prts operating in the country and expand their mandate to include more active security function the forces for this expansion should come from isaf and the new afghan national army nato has declared that afghanistan is its highest priority stressing that the country is the alliances first mission outside the euro atlantic area 25 et nato members are cur rently contributing only 25 percent of their available forces to isaf although nato has conducted initial planning to expand its operations into the more dangerous eastern and southern portions of the country sig nificant increase in the number of prts is not currently planned including the afghan army in prts will not only alleviate the demand for foreign forces but also add to the legitimacy of the prt mission and refine the training of afghan soldiers as they are mentored by their isaf counterparts increased numbers of teams will strengthen the governments authority beyond kabul and enable judiciary reform disarmament demilitarization and reintegration as well as opium eradication while there is risk that larger foreign footprint will incite nationalistic backlash and provide more targets for insurgents the rand study noted earlier suggests that more soldiers will enhance the probability of eventual success as the prts facilitate improvements of basic living conditions indigenous support will increase which will generate beneficial second and thirdorder effects such as improved intelligence regard ing criminal or insurgent activity develop mechanisms to channel much greater percentage of foreign aid funds through the afghan government for projects trolled by outsiders concrete measures must be taken to overcome bureaucratic obstacles and focus on the maximum employment of indigenous workers this initiative provides an exceptional opportunity to merge security and economic objectives contracting war lords and their militias to execute construc tion projects would give both leaders and their foot soldiers stake in the rebuilding 26 james phillips advocates this approach arguing that dependence on foreign contrac tors should be reduced as quickly as pos sible the united states should place greater effort on building the afghan governments capacity to help its own people by improving public administration and training govern ment officials and afghan ngos to train other afghans 27 while us officials will have to encourage the international com munity to contribute significant amounts to this effort the more difficult task will be applying those assets effectively in particular projects that provide immediate improvement in the lives of warweary impoverished people are most likely to produce longlasting results develop and execute public diplomacy campaign to capitalize on the informa tion element of national power ray millen proposes the construction of network of studios and transmission towers that would target the entire country28 he recommends implementing public awareness campaign designed to educate the population regarding government programs and to foster buyin to the reform process an initiative such as this will be particularly important in the governments effort to combat narcotics traf ficking not only will karzais exhortations against opium production reach wider audi ence but also information regarding alternate employment programs will be easier to dis seminate given the low literacy rate of the country the information architecture should focus initially on oral and visual media to transmit desired messages develop comprehensive plan that coor dinates the plethora of activities currently single party is in charge of the overarching reconstruction effort ostensibly the united nations is but that is as good as saying that one is 29 the us embassy in kabul is striving to guide the rebuilding process but the national security council is probably the only organization capable of orchestrating development of comprehensive

thus far been unsuccessful in establish ing comprehensive blueprint to establish goals and track results the afghanistan research and evaluation unit recommends mechanisms to align priorities and reduce overlap among the numerous lowerlevel coordinating bodies in particular the plan should address n specific roles and responsibilities of the various security organizations n measures to fill security vacuums created by implementation of the disarma ment demilitarization and reintegration program n fielding professional police force n the need to synchronize information operations30 planning per is not normally consid ered component of strategy but in the case of afghanistan events have moved so quickly that the strategy has become disjointed at best and incoherent at worst fundamental strategic adaptations are necessary includ ing new planning leaders of this process must dedicate the time to develop concept that aligns their efforts to realize the vision of transformed afghanistan the national security council nsc is probably the only organization capable of orchestrating the development of comprehensive design that addresses all aspects of assistance military nongovernmental and economic therefore president bush should immediately task the nsc to work with key allies to accomplish this critical task once plan is in place fully manned us embassy should be capable of guiding it to successful outcome the reconstruction of afghanistan is monumental endeavor complicated by the nearly total destruction of the infrastructure and an ongoing insurgency helping afghani stan become stable representative democ racy that enforces the rule of law and respects human rights will be challenging while it is difficult to find an allencompassing docu ment outlining
