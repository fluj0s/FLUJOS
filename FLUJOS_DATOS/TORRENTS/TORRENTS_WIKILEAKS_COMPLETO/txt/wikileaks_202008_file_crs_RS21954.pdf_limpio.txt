retirement plan figure that has remained relatively stable for the past quartercentury over the past 20 years however there has been shift in coverage from traditional pensions also called defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans such as those authorized under 401k of the internal revenue code irc according to the bureau of labor statistics only 21 of workers in the private sector participated in defined benefit plan in 2005 whereas 42 participated in defined contribution plan about 11 of privatesector workers were in both types of plan at their current job in 2005 defined benefit db plans typically are funded entirely by the employer and they are required by law to offer the retiree the option to receive his or her benefit in the form of guaranteed lifelong annuity 1 defined contribution dc plans consist of individual accounts in which workers can accumulate savings for retirement prior to enactment of the revenue act of 1978 pl 95600 dc plans also were typically f unded exclusively by employer contributions this law added 401k to the irc allowing employees to make pretax contributions to employersponsored retirement savings plans in 2006 workers can defer taxes on up to 15000 of wage or salary income that is directed to an employersponsored retirement plan established under 401k 2 after 2006 the maximum annual deferral will be indexed to the consumer price index3 employers also can contribute to 401k plans section 415c of the internal revenue code defines the maximum allowable contribution to 401k plan including both employer and employee contributions the maximum contribution is 44000 in 2006 g7g151g155g152g149g149g150g142g151g157g561g18g155g138g140g157g146g140g142g156g561 in traditional defined benefit plan employees typically do not need to enroll in the plan to accrue benefits workers automatically earn benefits under db plan provided that they are in covered group of workers and work the required number of hours per year4 in contrast most employers who sponsor 401k plans require employ ees to enroll in these plans voluntarily one reason for this difference is that db plans in the private sector usually are funded entirely by the employer whereas most dc plans and all 401k plans require the employee to contribute to the plan employers who require employees to enroll voluntarily in 401k plans do so for several reasons 1 participants in most dc plans must decide how much to contribute up to the legal limit or lower limit established by the plan sponsor 2 participants in many dc plans must decide how to invest their contributions and 3 several states have laws that require employers to secure workers permission before making any payroll deductions other than those required by law such as income tax withholding and the social security and medicare payroll taxes 1 db plan also can offer to pay the worker his or her accrued benefit as single lumpsum payment but the employee must be offered the option of an annuity 2 the same limits also apply to 403b annuities and 457 deferred compensation arrangements 3 workers age 50 or older can make an additional contribution of 5000 in 2006 this amount will be indexed to inflation in years after 2006 4 employers can if they choose exclude employees with less than one year of service or who work fewer than 1000 hours per year

whose employers offer plan choose to participate the bureau of labor statistics reports that in 2005 53 of workers in the private sector were employed at establishments that offered dc plan but just 42 of employees at private establishments participated in plan consequently the participation rate among employees whose employer offered dc pl an was 79 in contrast the bls reports that 22 of workers in the private sector were employed at establishments that offered defined benefit plans and 21 participated in those plans yielding participation rate in these plans of 955 g11g20g21g561g20g158g149g146g151g144g156g561 employers who sponsor 401k plans often prom ote participation among their employees by providing them with information on the importance of saving for retirement and the tax savings that result from participating one way to achieve high rates of plan participation is to enroll employees automatically rather than the default option being that the employee will not be included in the plan unless he or she actively enrolls the default under automatic enrollment is that some of the employees pay will be deducted and directed into retirement account unless he or she instructs the employer not to do so the irs has issued several rulings in recent years to clarify for employers that they are permitted to enroll employees in 401k and 403b plans automatically through payroll deduction provided th at the employee is notified in advance and has the option to drop out of the plan unless the employee elects otherwise he or she is presumed to be participating and an amount set by the employer such as 3 of pay is deducted from the employees pretax pay and contributed to the 401k plan in 1998 the irs issued ruling clarifying that automatic enrollment in 401k plans is permissible for newly hired employees revenue ruling 9830 the irs issued second ruling in 2000 stating that automatic enrollment also is permissible for current employees who have not already enrolled in the plan revenue ruling 20008 5 in 2004 the irs published general information letter that clarified two previously ambiguous points the letter stated that 1 the amount deducted from the employees pay and contributed to the plan can be any amount that is permissible under the plan up to the annual contribution limits under irc 402g and 2 the plan can automatically increase the employees contribution over time such as after each pay raise again the irs emphasized that employees must be fully informed of these plan provisions and they must have the option to change the amount of their contribution or to stop contributing to the plan altogether g18g149g138g151g561g18g138g155g157g146g140g146g153g138g157g146g152g151g561 the irs has promoted automatic enrollment through these official announcements mainly to increase participation among moderate and lowerincome workers the irs has noted that the rate of participation in elective retirement savings plans tends to be lowest among these workers6 evidence from surveys and case studies suggests that automatic enrollment results in higher rates of participation in 401k plans in

of automatic enrollment the average participation rate at these companies increased from 68 three months before automatic enrollment was implemented to 77 at the time of the survey studying the effect of automatic enrollment at three companies that adopted it between 1997 and 1998 economists james choi david laibson and brigitte madrian found that participation increased to between 86 and 96 after automatic enrollment took effect after three years of service the participation rate among employees hired under automatic enrollment was 30 percentage points higher than among employees hired before automatic enrollment was implemented 7 according to the psca 11 of 401k and profit sharing plans used automatic enrollment in 2004 automatic enrollment was more common in large plans than in small plans it had been adopted by 1 of 401k plans with fewer than 50 participants and by 31 of plans with 5000 or more participants in survey of mainly large firms the benefits consulting firm hewitt associates found that 24 used automatic enrollment in 2005 up from 14 in 2003 deloitte consulting recently reported that 23 of the 830 plan sponsors it surveyed in 2005 and 2006 had instituted automatic enrollment g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 automatic enrollment has been shown to increase participation rates in 401k plans among eligible employees there are however two othe r important decisions that participants in 401k plan must make or that must be made for them how much to contribute to the plan and how to invest those contributions plan sponsors who have adopted automatic enrollment generally have been conservative in setting the contribution amount and in choosing investments for employees who have been enrolled automati cally both the psca and deloitte consulting report that the most common contribution rate for employees who are enrolled in plan automatically is 3 of pay these contributions are typically invested in stable value fund money market fund or target retirement date fund8 many plan sponsors are reluctant to set the default contribution rate for automatic enrollment higher than 3 of pay because that rate was used in examples of permissible automatic enro llment practices published by the irs employers also tend to choose conservative investmentsthose with little risk of capital loss such as money market funds and stable value fundsdue to concerns about their liability as plan fiduciaries if the investments they have chosen decline in value financial analysts generally agree that contribution equal to 3 of pay is too small and that the rate of return on money market funds and stable value funds is too low for most workers to build an adequate retirement fund over the course of their careers 9 lifecycle funds and target retirement date funds allocate contributions among investments based on generally agreed upon principles of diversification they are more likely then money market funds or stable value funds to result in adequate retirement savings over lifetime 7 james j choi david laibson and brigitte c madrian plan design and 401k savings outcomes national tax journal vol 522 june 2004 pp 275298 8 stable value funds typically invest in bonds and achieve rates of return 2 to 3 percentage points higher than money market funds most include guaranteed investment contract gic with an insurance company the insurance company invests the money and guarantees the investors rate of return it keeps any returns above the guaranteed rate 9 many employers also provide matching contributions common match rates are 50 of the first 6 of pay that the employee defers or 100 of the first 3 of salary the employee defers

funds typical in plans that have automatic enrollment would be of less concern to policymakers if participants took an active role in managing their contribution amounts and investment choices unfortunately many participants in retirement plans behave passively and for them the default choices often become permanent this is concern not only for work ers who would not otherwise have enrolled in the plan but also for participants who would have elected voluntarily to participate in the plan and whoif not for the plans default contribution rate and default investment fundswould have chosen higher contribution rate and more appropriate investments for their retirement accounts researchers have found that there is substantial amount of inertia among participants in 401k plans with respect to managing their accounts 10 relatively small percentage take great interest in managing their retirement funds regularly increasing their contributions and rebalancing their accounts many plan participants however seem to accept the default contribution percentages and investment choices associated with automatic enrollment as implicit investment advice or as an endorsement by their employer that these are somehow the right choices for them to clarify its interpretation of federal law with respect to contribution rates under automatic enrollment the irs issued general information letter on march 17 2004 stating that the automatic contribution level may be more or less than the 3 that it had used in previously published examples of acceptable practices under automatic enrollment if the employer offers matching contributions for example the automatic contribution rate can be higher or lower than the percentage that is matched by employer contributions the letter also stated that the automatic contribution percentage can be increased or decreased over time under specified schedule one based on years of service for example the employer must describe the details of the change in the required notice to employees of their right to select another contribution rate the irs letter also stated that increases in the automatic cont ribution percentage can be triggered by future increases in an employees pay or by bonuses ag ain the required employee notice must describe exactly how this would affect participating employees the rulings and letters issued by the irs may encourage more firms to adopt automatic enrollment and to couple it with automatic increases in the contribution rate until the employee reaches some agreedupon maximum contribution level analysts point out however that employers who adopt automatic enrollment should be sure to put the participants contributions into appropriate investment funds as he or she gets older lifecycle funds for example progressively invest more in bonds and less in st ocks as the employee approaches retirement age lessening the chance of large capital losses employees also should be reminded continually that they have the right to change their contribution amount or to choose alternative investment funds one successful model of automatic enrollment coupled with progressive increases in the employee contribution rate was developed by economists richard thaler of the university of chicago and shlomo benartzi of ucla called save more tomorrow smart it asks workers to contribute portion of their future raises into their 401k plan this way workers can raise their future contribution rate without experiencing drop in takehome pay in case study of the smart plan thaler and benartzi found that most workers 78 who were asked to participate agreed to do so and most who joined 80 continued with scheduled increases through at least 10 see james choi david laibson brigitte madrian and

employer makes matching contributions the match rate for highly compensated employee cannot be greater than the match rate with respect to the same rate of deferral of nonhighly compensated employee also if the plan makes matching contributions it must assure that matching contributions are not provided for elective deferrals in excess of 6 of pay and that the match rate does not increase as the rate of an employees elective deferrals increases plans with automatic enrollment must provide that employees with at least two years of service are 100 vested in employer contributions employees are always 100 vested in their own contributions each employee eligible to participate in the plan must receive notice of his or her right to elect not to have automatic deferrals made on the employees behalf or to elect to defer different amount the employee must be informed how contributions made under the automatic enrollment arrangement will be invested in the absence of any investment election
