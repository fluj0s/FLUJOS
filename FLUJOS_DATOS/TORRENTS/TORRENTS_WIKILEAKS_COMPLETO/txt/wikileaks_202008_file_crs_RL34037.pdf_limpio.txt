g18g152g160g142g155g156g561 the use of the term vote of confidence to reflect senate house or joint congressional action on resolution concerning an official of the executive branch might be somewhat misleading because of the particular nature and impact of confidence votes in parliamentary democracies vote of confidence has technical meaning and concrete consequences only in parliamentary form of government in which the continuance of the executive in office is dependent on its maintaining majority support in the parliament or one house thereof the american system of separated powers on the other hand makes provision for votes of confidence in the parliamentary sense except through the process of impeachment accordingly action by the congress or of either house can have any practical effect similar to that of parliamentary vote of confidence for example votes of confidence or votes of censure in the british parliament 1 are votes instituted in parliament by the opposition party which if they succeed indicate that the government longer has the support of the majori ty of parliament including the governments own party members and thus lead to diss olution of the government and new elections2 under the us system of government with the constitutional scheme of separated powers the legislaturecongressdoes not impact directly the removal of officials in the executive branch of the federal government other than thr ough impeachments adoption of resolution expressing lack of confidence could have symbolic effects as an expression of the sense of congress or of either house vote expressing confidence of the senate or the house in particular official of the government while it may certainly have political implications would have specific legal import 1 although the phrase vote of confiden ce is generally used in the united states to describe the process in england the completed vote on motion introduced by the opposition is referred to as vote of censure 2 erskine mays

such as an opinion that the president should remove an official or that cabinet official should resign or to otherwise formally reprimand censure or express disapprobation or loss of confidence concerning an executive official has been debated and questioned from time to time in the house and the senate 3 in early congressional considerations some members of congress in their opposition to resolutions which declared either an opinion of praise or disapproval of the executive cited the lack of an express constitutional grant of authority for the house or the senate to state an opinion on the conduct or propriety of an executive officer in the form of formal resolution of censure or disapproval 4 others have argued including during the more recent consideration of the impeachment of president clinton that impeachment was the proper and exclusive constitutional response for congress to entertain when the conduct of federal civil officers is called into question rather than resolution of censure5 concerning judicial officers precedents indicate that the house has on occasion either rejected or not dealt with attempts to consider censure motion of federal judges offered by the judiciary committee as an alternative to articles of impeachment and parliamentarians have noted an apparent disinclination of the house to consider censure as part of the impeachment procedure 6 it has however become accepted congressional practice to employ simple resolution of one house of congress or concurrent resolution by both houses for certain nonlegislative matters such as to express the opinion or the sense of the congress or of one house of congress on public matter and resolution expressing an opinion of confidence in or other expression of censure or disapproval of an executive branch official within concurrent or simple resolution 3 ii hinds precedents of the house of representatives hinds precedents 1569 p 1029 1907 while the house in some cases has bestowed

sense of the senate or house resolution7 the absence of express constitutional language that the congress or the house or the senate individually may state its opinion on matters of public import in resolution of praise or censure is not necessarily indicative of lack of capacity to do so or that such practice is per unconstitutional it is recognized in both constitutional law and governmental theory that there are of course number of functions and activities of congress which are not expressly stated or provided in the constitution but which are nonetheless valid as either inherent or implied components of the legislative process or of other express provisions in the constitution or are considered to be within the internal authority of democratic legislative institutions and elective deliberative bodies generally 8 the practice of the house senate or congress to express facts or opinion in simple or concurrent resolutions has been recognized since its earliest days as an inherent authority of the congress and of democratic legislative institutions generally and the adoption of sense of the house or senate resolutions on various subjects and in reference to various people is practiced with some frequency in every congress 9

these resolutions expressing the disapproval of congress or of either house with an official of the executive branch have in the past sometimes been submitted and occasionally adopted13 for recent years it has been possible to identify resolutions of this kind systematically through search of the legislative information system of the congress lis which includes database of introduced measures extending back to the 93rd congress 19731974 an initial search identified simple and concurrent resolutions described with any form of the terms confidence censure or condemnation on the basis of information independently acquired about resolutions offered in the early 1950s against secretary of state dean acheson the search was also was extended to include simple and concurrent resolutions described with any form of the term resignation from among the measures identified by these searches those relating to federal officials other than members of congress were selected 14 these searches together yielded 31 resolutions submitted from the 93rd through 109th congresses 19732006 and directed against federal officials information about the subject and form of these 31 measures is presented in appendix g22g142g155g150g156g561g152g143g561g6g146g156g138g153g153g155g152g139g138g157g146g152g151g561g23g156g142g141g561 it appears that such resolutions have been stated not usually in terms of confidence but more often in terms of censure or condemnation or as calls for resignation of the 31 resolutions identified by the search 13 expressed censure of the official condemnation of the official or his or her actions or both the remaining 18 resolutions called either for the official in question to resign or for the president to request resignation making this form of disapproval the most common among measures identified from recent times only one of the 31 resolutions referred explicitly to loss of confidence and this language was contained only in the preamble of resolution that also called for resignation although the term confidence was not necessarily expressly stated in nearly all of these resolutions however such opinion was obviously implied by the actual wording of number of the resolutions previous to sjres 14 nevertheless resolu tion known in recent times has stated only loss of confidence unaccompanied by reference to any other form of disapprobation the use solely of this language might suggest lack of awareness that the reference to loss of confidence in continued resolution would generally not be considered to be privileged resolution see 3

by other terms in which resolutions with similar prospective effects have been couched the use of confidence language would not suffice actually to endow the proposal uniquely with any such distinctive or special force g18g155g142g138g150g139g149g142g156g561 most of the resolutions identified that were submitted in or after 1973 have included preamble stating the reasons for the congressional disapproval of the total of 31 just three lacked such preamble the current sjres 14 which also lacks preamble accordingly represents less common variation

declared themselves to be statements of the sense of the congress or of the house acting usually in those terms though few refer instead to the sentiment or judgment of congress or either house this form of language again appears consistent with an understanding that any such measure could have symbolic rather than determinative effects this language appears to have been included in measures of this kind less frequently since 1996 105 th congress but is adopted by sjres 14 g8g152g155g150g561g152g143g561g15g142g138g156g158g155g142g561 all 31 of the resolutions identified through the electronic search were either concurrent resolutions or simple resolutions of one house search was conducted for joint resolutions because of the inappropriateness of this form of measure to the kind of action possible in the american system for this reason conclusion can be offered about whether any earlier measures to express disapproval of federal official have taken the form of joint resolution use of simple and concurrent resolutions suggests awareness that adoption of such measure would have imperative force parallel to that of vote of confidence in parliamentary system by contrast even though the language of sjres 14 explicitly disavows any mandatory intent by stating itself as an expression of the sense of the senate the measure is couched as joint resolution joint resolutions are normally lawmaking vehicles and require passage by both chambers and presentation to the president it is not clear what proponents intend by submitting the measure in this form which would have the effect of affording the house of representatives and the president role in stating what the sense of the senate is it is conceivable that the use of this form of measure in the current case implicitly indicates an intent to achieve effects resembling those of an actual vote of confidence g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g159g142g561g3g140g157g146g152g151g561 congress did not finally adopt any of the 31 resolutions identified in the present search and on none but two did any floor action occur at all in 1997 105 th congress the house adopted hconres 197 declaring that sara

measures for the period preceding the availability of electronically searchable data in the historical period before that covered by the lis database nevertheless several instances are known in which the house or the senate expressed specific opinion disapproving of conduct of an executive official or suggesting that particular executive officer resign or be removed by the president15 the instances discussed in this section constitute only examples of congressional actions they are known not to compose comprehensive list of all resolutions to censure executive and judicial officials that may have been adopted or considered by either house accordingly available information can permit definite assertion whether vote of confidence fully similar to that proposed by sjres 14 has ever previously occurred in american history it might be considered unlikely however that resolutions critical of officials during earlier periods of history would have been couched solely in terms of confidence because proponents would likely have understood that these terms have technical meaning only in parliamentary system of government

the censure and disapproval of secretary alexander hamilton in 1793 the texts of which were considered by historians to have been drafted by thomas jefferson for introduction by representative william branch giles of virginia 16 in 1860 the house of representatives adopted resolution stating that the conduct of the president and his secretary of the navy was deserving of its reproof in matter concerning the alleged conduct of president buchanan and his secretary of the navy in allowing political considerations and alleged campaign contribution kickbacks to influence the letting of government contracts to political supporters rather than the lowest bidder 17 after debating both the substance of the charges and the authority of the house to adopt such resolution characterized by one member as censuring indiscriminately the president of the united states and the secretary of navy18 the house adopted the resolution 1066119 15 the examples discussed in the section on censure and

condemnation of president clevelands attorney general ah garland concerning his refusal to provide certain records and papers to the senate about the removal from office of district attorney by the president20 in 1896 the house adopted resolution where it found that united states ambassador by his speech and conduct has committed an offense against diplomatic propriety and an abuse of the privileges of his exalted position and therefore as the immediate representatives of the american people and in their names we condemn and censure the said utterances of thomas f bayard 21

part of an executive officer and urged the president to seek the officers resignation without expressing specific term of censure or condemnation or specific expression of loss of confidence for example after having conducted investigations into the conduct of the administration of the new york customhouse by mr henry smyth and finding that there is not sufficient time prior to adjournment to finish the matter the house expressed in resolution henry smyths unfitness to hold the office and recommended that he should be removed from the office of collector 22 similarly the senate in 1924 during the teapot dome investigation passed resolution indicating its sense that the president immediately request the resignation of the secretary of navy23 in the 81st and 82nd congresses 19491952 six resolutions were submitted containing demands for the resignation of secretary of state dean acheson and one seeking that of secretary of defense george c marshall all of these resolutions unlike many more recent measures lacked preambles setting forth the reasons for the action these measures provide one of the few earlier instances known that were described as proposing votes of confidence in the respective officials three of the seven resolutions explicitly stated popular loss of confidence along with but not instead of the calls for resignation although one like the 1983 instance discussed earlier did so only in the preamble several of these resolutions apparently including those whose text did not contain this explicit phrase were also described in public discussion as declarations of confidence finally during the same time period loss of public confidence in secretary acheson was declared by votes of the republican conference in at least one chamber these events illustrate that resolution may be described as confidence measure without having the characteristics that would make it equivalent to an actual vote of confidence in parliamentary system 20 17

actions resolutions have been introduced and considered in each house of congress in the past and on occasion have been adopted wherein the house or the senate has expressed the sense of the institution that an official in the executive branch has engaged in conduct worthy of censure condemnation or other expression of disapprobat ion should resign or be removed by the president and in few circumstances expressly stating in the preamble or the operative portion of the resolution that the public or the particular house of congress has lost confidence in the official such actions and proposals would appear to be in the nature of sense of congress or sense of the senate or house resolutions in which it has been the practice for the senate or the house to address certain nonlegislative matters such as to express the opinion or the sense of congress or of one house of congress on public matter 24 aside from obvious symbolic political or publicity implications there are specific legal consequences in the passage of such resolution nor is there any legal significance or consequence for the senate or the house to choose one phrase of disapprobation or condemnation over another or to include or not to include the concept or expression of loss of confidence in an official several features of sjres 14 seem to make explicit its difference from an actual vote of confidence such as could occur in parliamentar system but others suggest failure to take account of that difference to the extent that the resolution purports to present proposition functionally similar to vote of confidence in parliamentary system present knowledge does not permit identifying any similar proposition as having been offered in the past on the other hand to the extent that the present resolution purports to present such proposition it cannot under the american constitutional system succeed in doing so instead the proposition actually presented by the resolution can only be that of expressing congressional disapproval of federal official and in that general respect the resolution is not dissimilar from number of others that have been offered from time to time throughout american history 24 7 deschlers precedents ch 24 6 riddick frumin riddicks senate procedure 1202 1992 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34037 g561 g5g20g21g556g351g561g3g153g153g142g151g141g146g161g495
