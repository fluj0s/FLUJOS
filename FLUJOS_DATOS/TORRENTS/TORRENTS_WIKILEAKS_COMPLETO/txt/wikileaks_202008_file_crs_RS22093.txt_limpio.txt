more information on iraq see crs report rl31339 iraq post saddam governance and security issues by kenneth katzman introduction since the us invasion of iraq in march 2003 us policy has been focused on maintaining the territorial integrity of iraq and rebuilding its state institutions including national army and police forces that reflect iraqs diverse ethnic and sectarian makeup however the sunnidriven insurgency and overall us political reliance on shiites and kurds two historically persecuted iraqi groups emboldened by the overthrow of the saddam hussein regime have complicated us efforts to forge truly national iraqi military as has been widely reported shiites and kurds comprise disproportionate amount of the iraqi security forces isf it is becoming increasingly evident that some iraqi shiite and kurdish leaders do not believe in the bush administrations vision of an iraq in which all communities share power and the new security forces are representative of iraqi society at large with sign of discernible progress toward national reconciliation on the horizon there is an ever increasing risk that ustrained iraqi soldiers and police will be used by shiites and kurds to implement narrow parochial political agendas that exacerbate sectarian strife in crs2 iraq many observers believe that shiite parties and militias the badr brigade controlled by the supreme council for islamic revolution in iraq and the mahdi army controlled by muqtada sadr through their influence in the iraqi interior ministry and its police forces are pursuing this strategy the iraqi army ia has been less politicized due to overall us control over many of its divisions1 nevertheless as the united states transfers authority over the ia to iraqi commanders and the ministry of defense mod the risk of ia penetration by either shiite militias or sunni insurgents increases dramatically historical background since its creation at the hands of the british in 1921 the iraqi army has never been able to effectively integrate the countrys arabs and kurds as the army has traditionally been strong institution and source of pride among many iraqi sunni and some shiite arabs sunni arab officers who had served in both the ottoman empire and the arab revolt against that empire in world war i formed the core of the nascent army which was primarily designed to be an internal security force with little or ability to project power beyond iraqs borders during the british mandate 19201932 the british effectively httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22093 controlled the iraqi army but curbed its expansion by relying on british air power and an ethnicallyreligiouslybased unit known as the assyrian levies which was controlled by the ministry of the interior and was used as bulwark against turkish meddling in the north and as counterinsurgency force against rebellious segments of iraqi society such as the shiites and kurds after iraq obtained full independence in 1932 its sunni army officers became outwardly more politicized culminating in the overthrow of the monarchy in 1958 by major general abdulkarim qassim sunnis continued to dominate the officer corps of the iraqi army and by the early 1960s sunnis composed 70 of all officers in the iraqi army of whom 45 hailed from mosul with shiites making up 20 and kurds and other minorities 102 relations between sunni shiite and kurdish officers were tense due to repeated kurdish revolts in northern iraq and institutional discrimination against shiites within the army saddam hussein who himself had formal military training purged the army of anyone considered to be potential threat to him and to the ruling baath party he created number of overlapping security agencies and filled them with members of his immediate family and larger tribe saddam largely ignored the regular iraqi army with the exception of the elite republican guard units as power within his regime was based largely on his special security agencies which kept close tabs on iraqi officers saddam continued the practice of relegating shiites to low level positions and to conscripts within the regular army shiites took disproportionate amount of casualties on the front lines of the iran 1 according to the congressionallymandated department of defense quarterly status report of november 2006 the coalition and the government of iraq are committed to creating an iraqi military that reflects the ethnic and religious fabric of iraq with diverse units loyal to the nation not sectarian interests there are however indications that political forces in iraq have influenced senior military appointments on the basis of sectarian affiliation 2 ahmed s hashim military power and state formation in modern iraq middle east policy winter 2003 vol10 iss4 p29 crs3 iraq war in the 1980s ultimately like other ruthless dictators saddams preference for loyal internal security forces and elite military units succeeded in preventing regular army units from attempting to overthrow the regime disbanding the iraqi army the us decision to disband the iraqi army in may 2003 has been the subject of continuing debate many critics point to that decision order 2 dissolution of entities as among the most important factors in destabilizing iraq after the cessation of large scale military operations although observers expected us officials to prohibit the upper echelon of saddams security forces from rejoining the army the initial decision to exclude regular army officers and conscripts surprised many analysts who had argued for the administration to distinguish between saddams privileged inner core and the largely neglected regular army ambassador l paul bremer iii former head of the coalition provisional authority cpa defended the policy noting the role the decree had in reassuring the kurds that the cpa was serious about creating united iraq and convincing them not to secede3 current us training efforts

headed by army lieutenant general martin dempsey who recently stated that the iraqi army has the opportunity to be the single institution that can elevate the narrative beyond regional local religious interests and in most cases they are succeeding in doing so in other words becoming that institution of national unity4 the iraq study group report recommends that the highest priority be given to training the isf and that only the most highly qualified us officers should be assigned to embedded teams5 although many observers consider us advisory efforts crucial to boosting isf morale and combat effectiveness critics charge that us training efforts are hampered by several challenges that may be difficult to overcome in the short term us trainers have complained that they themselves were insufficiently prepared to train foreign soldiers and have only rudimentary understanding of the iraqi military and culture in addition an overall shortage6 of qualified us trainers and arabic

officers in advisory roles to senior iraqi officers who have far more combat experience finally us soldiers who make up the military training teams have formal authority over iraqi commanders complicity between iraqi ministries in baghdad and politicallymotivated commanders in the field is commonplace and according to one us soldier right now we cannot even fire iraqi army leaders whom we know cooperate with insurgents or are incompetent7 on january 10 2007 president bush tacitly acknowledged the lack of capability of the isf by announcing that we will increase the embedding of american advisers in iraqi army units and partner coalition brigade with every iraqi army division currently 4000 coalition trainers are embedded in iraqi units that figure is expected to either triple or quadruple in the coming months this increase not net increase also reflects an expansion of mission to include operations as well as training overall the pentagon estimates that approximately 325000 iraqi personnel are in the isf both army and police however due to poor iraqi record keeping it is uncertain how many iraqi soldiers remain in service as noted in numerous us military and independent studies on the rebuilding effort chronic absenteeism8 and high desertion rates lead iraqi units to be in constant state of undercapacity averaging around 6570 strength at any given httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22093 moment9 currently it is not illegal for an iraqi soldier to abandon his unit or go awol according the us defense department ia awol rates exceed 50 when units were directed to deploy to areas of combat outside of their normal areas of operations shiite militias although militias independent of the iraqi armed forces were declared illegal under cpa order 91 june 2004 in an effort to combat the insurgency and increase the number of iraqi forces serving in the field iraqi and us officials early on allowed some militias to infiltrate their members into the regular iraqi security forces in reality these militias badr brigade10 and kurdish peshmerga remained independent in retrospect many observers have decried that decision asserting that it favored shortterm political expediency over iraqs national longterm interests under successive iraqi transitional and permanent governments shiite militias operating under the guise of paramilitary police and army units have used the sunni insurgent threat to expand their reach paralyzing any attempt to forge nonsectarian iraqi military the shiite political parties that control the militias have through the us guided political process gained control over the iraqi government making outside efforts 6 continued there were only 700 us police trainers for an iraqi police force of more than 100000 see us

disband the militias politically unfeasible the badr brigade and the mahdi army each have penetrated various police agencies badr is believed to control elite paramilitary police brigades that can operate anywhere in iraq sadrs mahdi forces are believed to have penetrated the 140000strong facilities protection service11 us oversight of the iraqi police did not initially focus on sectarianism as potential issue according to major general joseph d peterson who was the third american general since 2003 charged with overseeing iraqi police training when we stood them up we didnt ask are you sunni or are you shia they ended up being 99 percent shia now when we look at that we say they do not reflect the population of iraq12 although the current iraqi interior minister jawad bolani who succeeded bayan jabr former officer in the military wing of sciri has fired corrupt interior ministry employees and even disbanded whole police brigades accused of acting as death squads shiite militias have proliferated and may longer answer directly to their leadership the battle for baghdad many analysts believe that under the current iraqi government headed by prime minister nouri kamal maliki shiite the iraqi army has been underutilized and circumvented particularly in the capital of baghdad by httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22093 paramilitary police forces widely believed to be operating in collusion with shiite militias as us and iraqi policy makers formulate and revise plans to secure the capital the maliki government has been criticized for deploying only two of six additional ia brigades it pledged to reinforce in baghdad during operation together forward in the summer of 2006 many believe that malikis hesitation stems from his dawa partys governing alliance with shiite radical leader muqtada sadr and the fact that ia soldiers serving in baghdad were recruited locally and therefore more likely to be loyal toward sadr and other shiite leaders the iraq study group report asserts that the iraqi government under maliki has rejected sustained security operations in sadr city vast baghdad slum protected by mahdi army fighters ia units from outside the capital may be more willing to crack down on shiite militias like the mahdi army engaged in sectarian violence as shiite soldiers recruited elsewhere may have fewer kinship and tribal ties to shiites in baghdad according to one us army colonel serving as an advisor to iraqi army units in baghdad what the iraqi army cant do is protect soldiers when they go home or protect their families its very very difficult thats why solution has to be political one and not military one13 on january 18 2007 iraqi officials announced that for the first time it had taken significant action against the mahdi army by arresting dozens of its senior leaders sunni distrust of the isf in the sunni majority province of anbar the locus of the sunniled insurgency sunni participation and cooperation with us and isf stabilization efforts are severely hampered by the threat of insurgent reprisals againstcollaborators and their families the local sunni population views the isf as hostile force loyal to

iran us and iraqi military commanders have conducted town hall meetings in several sunni provinces in order to convince tribal leaders to encourage their members to join the isf this strategy has met with limited success though some tribal leaders bent on ridding their towns of foreign fighters have contributed local fighters to the isf on temporary basis overall sunni arabs have demanded that rather than working with existing isf units they be allowed to raise their own tribal militias many analysts believe that tribal units from sunni areas would be too susceptible to insurgent infiltration iraqi sunni arabs are unwilling to serve outside their home provinces as required by the iraqi army sunnis who do serve in the isf take enormous risk to their personal safety and the safety of their families shiite control of the ia according to january 2007 angeles times report the ias 5th division stationed in diyala province region north and east of baghdad with mix of sunnis shiites and kurds was penetrated by shiite militia and subsequently conducted an intimidation campaign against the provinces sunni population according to the report the provincial commander was chosen by the badr brigade14 colonel brian d jones who was the commander of us forces in diyala httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22093 suggested that the ias operations in diyala came on orders from the central government in baghdad according to col jones i believe this is larger plan to make diyala shia province rather than sunni province15 kurdish loyalties many analysts have questioned whether over the long run the isf can successfully integrate iraqi arabs and kurds since the start of us efforts to rebuild the iraqi army the combination of the sunni character of the insurgency in conjunction with the poorer quality of the arab sunni and shiite recruits forced us and iraqi officials to rely heavily on the kurdish components of the security forces the iraq armys second and third divisions have large kurdish components reportedly kurdish brigades of the ia may be deployed to baghdad in the coming months kurdish leaders have insisted on retaining their own militias some military analysts note that kurdish recruits are more loyal to their tribal and political party leaders than they are to the central government in baghdad calling into question the viability of single unified iraqi army the combination of long history of kurdisharab conflict the use of chemical weapons against kurdish villages between 19881990 and kurdish desires for autonomy may have produced strong antipathy among kurdish politicians for strong centralized military force in iraq according to massoud barzani leader of the kurdish democratic party one of the two main kurdish parties we want to keep our peshmerga because they are symbol of resistanceits not matter to be discussed or negotiated16 14 promising iraqi province is now tinderbox angeles times january 7 2007 15 sectarian rifts
