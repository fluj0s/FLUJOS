for and against recession in the near termhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34484crs2 4 for more information see crs report rs22793 what is recession who decides when it starts and when do they decide by brian w cashell 5 national bureau of economic research the nbers business cycle dating procedure oct 21 2003 p 2 6 ibid 7 there are two major official employment series kept by the bureau of labor statistics the current employment series known as the payroll series and the current population continuedhow recessions are defined recessions are officially designated by the national bureau of economic research nber nonprofit research organization4 according to popular belief recessions are periods of two or more consecutive quarters of negative economic growth while historical recessions have often followed this pattern it is not the official definition in f act the 2001 recession did not follow this pattern economic growth contracted in the first and third quarters of 2001 but not the second rather the nber defines recession as significant decline in economic activ ity spread across the economy lasting more than few months normally visible in real gdp real income employment industrial production and wholesaleretail sales5 gross domestic product gdp da ta is released quarterly and the latter four measures are available monthly since recessions ar dated on monthly basis gdp data does not offer enough precision for the nbers purposes of the four monthly factors the nber places particular emphasis on real pers onal income excluding transfers and on employment since both measures reflect activity across the entire economy the committee places less emphasis on the industr ial production and real sales series which mainly cover the manufacturing and goodspr oducing sectors of the economy6 typically the nber does not announce th at the economy has entered recession until the recession is well under way for good reason by definition persistent downturn cannot be identifie d until it has persisted for example the recession which began in march 2001 was not announced by the nber until november 2001 as it turns out the nber later identified november as marking the end of the 2001 recession thus it is possible that at some future date the nber could identify the economy as currently experiencing recession figures 1 and 2 show real personal income l ess government transfers and employment respectively before during and since the 2001 recession while both figures show clear and sustained downturn in 2001 neither shows similar downturn to date real personal income has flattened since mid2007 but has not shown any persistent decline it fell but only modestly during the 2001 recession employment has declined in the firs t four months of 2008 but only modestly compared to past recessions7 industrial production has been flat but shown nohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34484crs3 7 continued series known as the household series the nber and most economists favor the payroll series because it has larger and more robust sample for that reason the payroll series is discussed in the main text and shown in figure 2 in 2008 the two series have moved together the unemployment rate is calculated from the household series and has also shown slight deteriora tion in the second half of 2007downward trend since mid2007 retail sales fell in february but rose in january and march 2008 on balance recession may have already started but it is too soon to be sure since data do not exhibit smooth trend source crs calculations based on data

from the current employment statistics as used by the nber what causes recessions in the long run economic growth is dete rmined solely by the growth rate of productivity nd capital and labor inputs that determine the overall production of goods and services what is sometimes referred to as the supply side of the economy but in the short run growth can be influenced by the rate of overall spending also known as the demand sid of the economy the pattern caused by these shortterm fluctuations in spending is known as the business cycle overall spending includes consumer spendin g business spending on capital goods government spending and net ex ports exports less imports spending and production are equalized by prices b ecause prices adjust gradually spending can temporarily grow fa ster or slower than the potential growth rate of the supply side of the economy recessions are characterized by situation where spending is not growing fast enough to employ all of the economys labor and capital resources recessions can come to an end because government has used fiscal or monetary policy to boost spending or because spending recovers on its own when prices have gradually adjuste d then the economy begins period of expansion economic booms eventually give way to overheating which is characterized by situation where spendi ng is growing too fast and labor capital and productivity cannot grow fast enough to keep up in this scenario faster economic growth can become too much of good thing because it is unsustainable overheating is typified by rise in inflation because there is greater demand for goods than supply of goods prices begin to rise overheating then gives way to recession while the pattern is predictable the timing of the pattern is not some expansions are longer than others124000126000128000130000132000134000136000138000140000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008thousandsfigure 2 nonfarm employmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34484crs5 8 for more information see crs report rl30391 inflation and unemployment what is the connection by brian cashellalthough there is foolproof way to di fferentiate between changes in growth being caused by cyclical forces and structural forces movements in the inflation rate offer good indication when inflation is rising growth is probably above its sustainable rate because overall spending is growing too fast and when inflation is falling growth is probably below its sustai nable rate because ove rall spending is too sluggish inflation is not perfect indicator of cyclical activity however because sudden spikes in th price of specific goods sometimes cause overall inflation to temporarily change volatile energy prices are the prime example of when change in inflation may not be indicative of the stage of the business cycle employment and th business cycle just as rapid economic growth can be too much of good thing so too can rapid increases in employment and decreases in the unemployment rate as explained above the economys potential grow th rate is determined by the growth rate of inputs to the production process such as labor when employment rises faster slower than the labor force grows the unemploymen t rate will fall rise with enough employment growth at some point all available labor will be utilized in the production process and this will happen before the unemplo yment rate reaches zero unemployment never reaches zero because some workers will always be in the process of leaving an old job and finding new one and some workers will always be in the wrong place at the wrong time for the skills they have compared to the skills needed for local employment opportunities the rate of unem ployment consistent with employment for all workers who do not fall into these two categories is known as the natural rate of unemployment or full employment or the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment nairu8 if overall spending is growing rapidly enough unemployment can be temporarily pushed below the natural rate when unemployment is pushed below the natural rate too many jobs will be chasing too few workers causing wages to rise faster than productivity but wages cannot persistently rise fa ster than productivity because again overall spending cannot grow faster than production assuming labors share of income remains constant wages can temporarily rise faster than productivity but the result would be rising inflation in recessions the process works in reverse because spending is insufficient to match potential production businesses lay off workers this causes the unemployment rate to rise above the natural rate as unemployment rises workers moderate their wage demands in order to find scarce jobs or keep existing jobs as result inflation falls what causes the business cycle expectations play an important role in the business cycle and peoples expectations are not always rational john maynard keynes described the cause of the business cycle as animal spirits or peoples tendency to let emotions particularly swings from excessive optimism to excessive pessimism influence their economic actions for example businesse s make investment decisions based onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34484crs6 9 for more information see crs report rl31608 the effects of oil shocks on the economy review of the empirical evidence by marc labontetheir projections of future rates of return which will depend on future sales and so on these inherently uncertain projections change as current conditions change if businesses believe economic conditions will be unfavorable in the future they will not make investments today reducing the growth rate of gdp from what it otherwise would have been likewi households may postpone purchases of durable goods or housing if economic conditions look unfa vorable peoples pr ojections of the future may be overly influenced by the present or recent past even when expectations are rational expectations can change as unexpected events occur economic shocks also pl ay dominant role in the business cycle shock refers to any sharp and sudden change in economic circumstances on the demand or supply side of the economy th at disrupts the steady flow of economic activity well known example is an ener gy shock when the price of energy suddenly rises it disrupts both production b ecause energy is an important input to the production process and consumer mand because energy products account for sizeable portion of consumer purchases9 other prominent shocks include natural disasters global events that influence fore ign trade financial market unrest and so on sudden change in expectations that affects consumer or investment spending can also be thought of as shock to aggregate demand since these shocks are typically unpredictable the bus iness cycle remains unavoidable policy can also play an important role in the timing and shape of the business cycle the speed at which recession ends can depend on the amount of monetary and fiscal stimulus although overheating may not be directly caused by stimulative policy sometimes policymakers do not rea lize the economy is beginning to overheat until it is too late expansions often end when in order to offset the rise in inflation monetary policy is tightened to reduce overall spending to the point where it is growing at the same pace as overall supply again in the process of policyinduced deceleration the economy can easily overshoot and begin to contract in essence policymakers trade off lower rate of economic growth in the short run to achieve more stable and higher average growth rate over time current recessionary pressures as discussed in the last section r ecessions are started by negative economic shocks or the normal boom and bust pattern inherent in the business cycle both of these factors may be present currently the economy has undergone an energy shock in the form of sudden spike in energy pr ices while boom and bust pattern is only modestly visible in price inflation data it is starkly present in the housing market furthermore the housing downturn has spille d over into financia l markets and the resulting pullback in credit offers anot her potential recessionary channel although any one of these factors in is olation might not be powerful enough to cause recession depending on their sever ity in concert they could an economy wide recession would result if spillover effects from the downturn in these three areashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34484crs7 10 output data by industry are released with considerable lag the most recent industry data available show that 80 of the slowdow n in growth in 2007 was caused by decline in output in the financial sector and cons truction and slowdown in growth in real estaterental housing and mining while grow th slowed somewhat across many industries these data suggest that problems in housing and the financial sector were still mostly contained in those industries in 2007 sour ce bureau of economic analysis advance gdpbyindustry statistics press release bea 0817 april 29 2008 11 based on government data from the office of federal housing oversight for resales of owneroccupied homes with conforming mortga ges private sector data sources show sharper decline in house prices 12 for indepth analysis see crs report rl34244 would housing crash cause recession by marc labontecaused activity in the rest of the economy to decline as well in the fourth quarter of 2007 declines in residential investment and inventorie s dragged down gdp growth but the other sectors of the economy grew at relatively healthy rates in the first quarter of 2008 weakness in the economy was more widespread10 the following sections will discuss the channels thr ough which these shocks could lead to an economywide slowdown for each factor housing bust after years of rapid appr eciation national house pri ces flattened in 2006 and have fallen slightly since11 larger price declines have occurred in several regional markets there have already been rge drops in house sales and residential investment house building since the ri in prices during the preceding housing boom was unusually large it is difficult to say how deep and longlasting the housing downturn will be given the central role that the housing boom has played in the current economic expansion many observers fear that crash in the housing market will lead to an economywide recession12 they are concerned that the fall in house prices could spill over into decline in aggregate spending through four channels first builders could respond to lower pri ces by reducing resi dential investment an important component of gross domestic product gdp this effect has already been felt with the rate of residential inves tment falling by double digits since mid 2006 and reducing overall gdp growth by bout one percentage point on average all else equal while this drag on growth may persist in coming quarters most observers agree that it is unlikely to get much larger this suggests that the drag from the slowdown in house building is too small to cause recession by itself second the fall in housing prices could l ead to decline in consumer spending through negative wealth effect some economists have argued that when house prices were rising households responde d to their greater housing wealth by increasing their consumption spending were prices to fall presumably the effect would be reversed this effect is difficult to measure and faces some theoretical objections for example every housing tr ansaction is composed of buyer and seller when house prices fall selle rs are made poorer but buyers are made wealthier in the sense that they are pr ovided an opportunity to devote less of their income to mortgage payments nd more to other consumption httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34484crs8 13 lower housing sales would require financial institutions to shift some of their activity from mortgage lending to other types of lend ing or investments while this would not necessarily affect the overall profitability of the financial sector some institutions might find the shift in lending difficult particular ly if they are small and heavily reliant on mortgage lending 14 for information on mortgage resets see crs report rl33775 alternative mortgages by edward murphythird the reset of mortgages to higher payments for many recent buyers has led to significant increase in the share of households suffering fro m financial distress as evidenced by the rise in the mortgage default rate resets can occur because borrowers took out adjustable rate mo rtgages or mortgages with introductory payments that later increase during the runup in house prices both types of mortgages increased sharply for some homeowners fall in prices would eliminate the option to refinance to avoid the distress these homeowners may then be forced to reduce consumption spending in respons rise in defaults can feed back through and deepen the housing downturn fourth since mortgages are backed by the value of the underlying house fall in prices could feed through to financial sector instability this channel will be discussed in the next section liquidity crunch since efficient financial intermediation is vital to healthy economy if housing downturn caused widespread harm to the financial sector the overall economy could suffer change in the value of house has dir ect effect on the value of loan but falling prices would be harmful to the fi nancial system if homeowners responded by defaulting on existing loans13 for the value of the mortgage to exceed the value of the house even after prices have fallen the loan would have to have high loanto value ratio loan made fa irly recently and probably to first time homeowner it should be noted however that loantovalue ratios have risen sign ificantly in the past few years because homes are being purchased with smaller downpayments and because existing homeowners have borrowed against their equity overall default rates ve risen since late 2006 for reasons beyond the traditional causes of unemplo yment illness divorce nd so on default rates on subprime loans which are loans made to borrowers with weak credit profiles have risen more rapidly default rates on all adjustable rate mortgages prime and subprime have risen as well and the problem may worsen in the near future as significant share of existing mortgages are forecast to adjust to higher interest rates falling prices can lead to rising defaults by preventing borrowers from escaping through refinancing or selling mortgage that they cannot afford mortgages can either be unaffordable because borrowers c ould not really afford them in the first place or they can become unaffordable when adjustable mortgages reset to higher payments14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34484crs9 15 sivs are offbalance sheet entities established but not owned by commercial banks an siv finances the purchase of longterm mbs by selling shortterm notes and commercial paper the spread between the long and shortte rm rates is profit for the concept to work the siv must be able to borrow cheaply triplea rating is basic requirement to secure that rating the siv generally agrees to maintain certain levels of collateral and the sponsoring banks often commit themselves to pr oviding lines of credit if the siv becomes unable to raise funds in the market 16 see crs report rl34182 financial crisis the liqui dity crunch of august 2007 by darryl getter mark jickling marc labonte and edward murphy today some mortgages are held by depository institutions and some are securitized and sold on the secondary market as mortgage backed securities mbss one rationale for the development of secondary market was to move non diversified risk off of bank balance sh eets and disperse it throughout financial markets so far the increase in default rates has not resulted in any widespread problems for depository institutions there is fear however that as the mortgages underlying the mbs default they will be brought back onto the banks balance sheets either through guarantees made to mbs investors or structured investment vehicles sivs15 although securitization may have soften ed the blow of the housing crash for commercial banks it s caused widespread financial turmoil in secondary markets even though subprime mbss are only small part of overall fina ncial markets the repricing of mbss to reflect the housing downturn has been untidy leading to bankruptcy for many nonbank mortgage lende rs that rely on securitization and for mbs investors in august 2007 problem s with mbss spilled over into other financial markets leading to widespread liquidity crunch in which financial intermediation ceased to function smoothly16 at this point it is too soon to tell how quickly financial markets will recover from the liquidity crunch and if the crunch will have lasting effects on the rest of the economy since the beginning of the liquidity crunch financial institutions particularly investment banks have written off large losses as result of the fall in asset prices these losses could lead the banks to cu rtail new lending through balance sheet effect when the value of banks assets declines then its capital will also decline if its liabilities remain constant the bank may then wish to replenish its capital by taking on fewer new loans if banks ma ke fewer loans then all bankfinanced projects could decline including busine ss capital investment unrelated to housing through this channel the liquidity cr unch could spread to the overall economy energy shock because of the central role energy play s in the functioning of the us economy and its unusual price volatility changes in ener gy prices tend to have greater short term impact on the economy than changes in the prices of most other goods energy shocks can have macroecono mic consequences in terms of higher inflation higher unemployment and lower output histori cally energy price shocks have proven particularly troublesome for the us economy sharp spikes in the price of oil havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34484crs10 17 products with high menu costs are those wh ich are costly to reprice and therefore have sticky prices restaurant menus periodicals and catalog items are examples of products with high menu costs 18 if rising energy prices affect the econom through this transmission mechanism then falling energy prices should have the opposite effect on the economy they s hould temporarily lower inflation and raise output all else equalpreceded nine of the 10 postwar rece ssions but since the current economic expansion began in 2001 energy prices have spiked on several occasions economic theory suggests that economies suffer from recessions due to the presence of sticky prices if markets adjusted instantly then recessions could be avoided whenever economic conditions changed price and wage changes would automatically bring the economy back to full employment in actuality however there are menu costs17 information costs uncertainty and contracts in the us economy that make prices sticky as result adjustment takes time and unemployment and economic contraction can result in the interim when oil prices rise suddenly it directly raises the energy portion of inflation measures such as the consum er price index energy prices make up about 9 of the consumer price index as result the overall inflation rate is temporarily pushed up since other prices do not instantly adjust and fall if other energy prices rise at the same time as has often been the case then the effect on overall inflation will be magnified because energy is an important input in the production process the price shock raises the cost of production for many industries transportation accounts for majority of oil consumption in the united states but hydrocarbons are also used for heating and industrial uses such as the pr oduction of plastics because other prices do not instantly fall the overall cost of production ri ses and producers respond by cutting back production which causes the cont raction in output and employment all else equal there may also be adjustment costs to shifting toward less energy intensive methods of production and these could temporarily ve negative effect on output typically the effect on output occurs over few quarters18 the effects described thus far can be t hought of as occurring on the supply side of the economy oil shocks may also aff ect aggregate demand when energy prices rise they involve an income transfer fro m consumers to producers since producers are also consumers aggregate demand is likely to fall only temporarily as producers adjust their consumption to their now higher incomes this adjustment is likely to be less or to take longer when the income recipients are foreigners than when they are americans since the united states is net importer of oil the net effect on us aggregate demand depends on how foreign oil producer s use their increase in wealth the adjustment to the wealth transfer from c onsumer to producer is transmitted through the international balance of payments how the increase in oil prices affects the current account deficit measure that primarily consists of the trade deficit depends in turn on how foreign oil producer s decide to use this purchasing powerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34484crs11 19 this point is not always explicitly made in the time series analyses reviewed below which tend to end their estimates at the last time lag that yields statistically significant results or arbitrarily cut off the estimates after few lags to meet statistical criterion concerning the limit on the number of variables allowed 20 see crs report rl32591 us terms of trade significance trends and policy by craig k elwellif they use it to purchase us goods then us exports would increase and there would be little effect on the current account ficit if they use it to purchase us assets whether corporate stocks treasur bonds or by simply leaving the revenue in us bank account then it would repres ent an inflow of foreign capital to the united states which would increase the cu rrent account deficit the purchase of us assets would stimulate total demand in the united states through lower interest rates thereby offsetting the contractionary effects of the larger trade deficit at least in part and possibly with lag or the foreign oil producers may use their increased wealth to purchase other countries goods or assets in which case the adjustment process in the united stat could take longer second effect on demand can be expected to occur because the rise in energy prices will probably push up th overall price level because other prices do not fall immediately in the face of decline in mand the increase in the price level will reduce the real value of the available amount of money in the hands of buyers and this reduction in the value of money will also reduce spending third effect on demand can occur if the rise in energy pr ices increases uncertainty and causes buyers to defer purchases this effect is also likely to be of shortrun nature the magnitude of all three effects will depend on how much energy prices rise and how long they remain high both the inflation and output effects of energy shocks are temporary that is once prices adjust the economy returns to full employment and its sustainable growth path19 this observation yields an important insight it is not the level of energy prices that affects economic growth and inflation but rather the change in energy prices thus if policymakers are c oncerned about the effect of energy prices on output and inflation they should focus mo re on rising energy prices than high energy prices even if the high pri ces are permanent the only permanent macroeconomic effect of higher energy prices is their negative effect on the terms of trade the terms of trade is the ratio of export prices to import prices20 it means that the united states has to give up more of the goods it produces than previously to obtain barrel of oil permanently higher energy prices lead to onetime permanent decline in the terms of trade and the standard of living of us consumers all else equal popular leading indicators of recessions as discussed below using policy to avoid recession requires accurate predictions of where the economy is head ing before it has already slowed down forecasters are always looking for leading indicators reliable signs of where the economy is headed in the short run this section focuses on popular leadinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34484crs12 21 further objection to leading indicators is that they fall foul of the lucas critique economist robert lucas argued that one cannot assume that past relationships between economic variables will remain stable in the future because economic actors learn about past relationships and adjust their behavior accordin gly for example once there is consensus that specific economic variable is leadin g indicator of recession economic actors are likely to react to changes in that indicator in way that they did not previously 22 for analytical purposes only the yields on u s treasury securities are used in order to hold the risk factor constant the yield on private sector securities can vary across time because investors change their evaluation of thei r riskiness unlike private sector securities treasury securities have virtually zero default risk 23 in this report inversion does not necessarily mean that the yield on all shorter term treasury securities was above those on longer term debt it only means that the federal funds rate was above the yield on all marketable treasury securitiesindicators of recessions these indicators should not be thought of as the cause of recessions rather forecasters attempt to identify predictable patterns within economic data if the same economic for ces that cause recession first surface in leading indicators then leading indicators can be watched to spot recession before it emerges measure could also be leading indicator because it is more readily available than gdp data gdp data is released quarterly with lag of about month after the quarter has ended nd is subject to significant revisions in later months leading indicators will be successful only if the business cycle features predictable patterns if every business cy cle is unique then leading indicators based on past experience may have little predictive power going forward since the economy is constantly changing and r ecessions are infrequent it may be that indicators that were useful few recessions ago ie few decades ago are longer relevant in todays economy21 the remainder of this section will discuss some of the most famous leading indicators to explain why their predic tive power is believed to be high yield curve inversion the yield curve inversion is wellknow n recession indicator yield curve refers to graph plotting the yield on securities by maturity from three month to thirty years in the case of us treasuries typically interest rates are higher on securities with longer time to maturity prior to each of the last six nber designated downturns 1269 1173 0180 0781 0790 and 0301 the yield on all maturities of us treasury s ecurities fell below the federal funds rate the rate that the federal reserve targets to conduct monetary policy22 in the discussion to follow this will be referred to as an inversion of the yield curve23 it should be noted that the time that elapses between the month the inversion occurs and the subsequent nberdesigna ted peak in economic activity is not constant the number of months prior to th peak that the inve rsion occurred and the peak have been 20 monthsdecember 1969 8 monthsnovember 1973 15 monthsjanuary 1980 9 monthsjuly 1981 16 monthsjuly 1990 and 9 months march 2001httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34484crs13 24 rising federal funds rate is also consistent with an increased demand for those funds the sign of vigorous economic expansion by letting the rate rise the fed may also be tightening money and credit growth relative to wh at would be the case if it had held the rate constant however this tightening will be ss than would be the case if it actually reduced the supply of those fundsalthough the structure of treasury inte rest rates has d good predictive record it is not perfect there have been two economic contracti ons since the federal funds market was developed in 1954 that we re not preceded by an inversion those beginning in august 1957 and april 1960 in addition inversions occurred in both june 1966 and august 1998 with subse quent economic contraction the 1957 1960 and 1966 anomalies ma be due to the early and limited nature of the federal funds markets and the fact that this rate was not then the main vehicle for carrying out monetary policy it is now widely accepted that the decline in longer term treasury yields in the 1998 episode was asso ciated with an international flight to quality following the financial crisis in ea st asia in the last half of 1997 and the debt default by russia in the summer of 1998 between june 2004 and june 2006 the fede ral reserve executed 17 equal hikes of ¼ percentage point in the federal funds rate raising the target rate from 1 to high of 525 the yields on short matu rity treasury secur ities have risen in harmony with the federal funds target the yields on longer term treasuries have not this has resulted in flattening of the yi eld curve by late july 2006 the yields on all treasury securities were below the target on federal funds where they remained until late 2007 when fed easing brought th federal funds rate below the 30 year treasury yield to understand why yield curve inve rsion might precede recession it may first be useful to explain wh the yield curve is usually upward sloping investors are only willing to take on more risk if they recei ve higher rate of return in this case the greater riskiness of longer term treas uries comes not from default risk but from interestrate risk the price of bond fluc tuates inversely with changes in interest rates and bonds with greater maturity length will change in value more than short term bonds for given change in interest rates thus even if investors expected interest rates to be constant over the next five year s fiveyear bond would have to offer higher rate of return than oney ear bond to compensate for interest rate risk in order for investors to be indifferent between the two nd this results in an upward sloping yield curve next consider what could cause yiel d curve inversion an inversion usually occurs as result of rising federal funds rate which is consiste nt with tightening of monetary policy the federal rese rve reduces the supply of federal funds pushing up the federal funds rate with fe wer reserves banks are forced to reduce loans and sell other assets leading to re duction in the growth of money and credit and ultimately reduced rate of total spending if this reduction is large enough it can cause an economic contraction24 an additional incentive for banks to contract credit following an inversion is that the rate they must now pay to borrow reserves is above what they can earn using those reserves for the acquisition of very safe assets borrowing for say five years c ould be financed by issuing five year notehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34484crs14 25 stock and watson found that the commercial pa perus treasury spread did not predict the 2001 recession but the junk bond yield spre ad did james stock and mark watson how did the leading indicator forecasts perform during the 2001 recession federal reserve bank of richmond economic quarterly vol 89 3 summer 2003or by issuing one year note and rolling it over into new note each time it matures as result there is relationship between interest rates at different maturities if longterm rates are partly determined by the average of present and future shortterm rates then the yield curve would become inverted if shortterm rates today were higher than shortterm rates expected in the future this would occur when the federal funds rate was rising if investors expected it to fall in the future for example if they thought that the higher rate was going to reduce gdp growth they might expect that the fed would be forced to reduce the target rates in the future to increase gdp growth why is there time lag between the yi eld curve inversion and the recession in this case the delay is because of the lag between the change in fed policy and the slowdown in economic activity that tig htening of credit conditions eventually causes as economists are prone to argue the time that elapses from decrease in the growth of money and credit to decreas in the growth of money spending is not uniform mainly because economic cond itions differ when monetary policy is tightened it can be both long and of variable length this accounts for the variable lag reported above between the month the i nversion occurs and the month in which the economy reaches business cycl peak with long and variable lag and cases of false positives such as 1998 some skeptics have questioned whether the yield curve is really useful recession predictor credit spreads forecasters have also focused on th credit spread as business cycle predictor the credit spread refers to the difference in yield on two assets that have the same characteristics except that one is riskier than the other many different assets have been used to measure credit spreads including the spread between treasury bills and commercial paper and between highly rated and lower rated bonds credit spreads are seen as measure of investors perception and tolerance of risk when spreads are higher investors require higher rate of return to be willing to take on risk when the economy sl ows down more firms fail and investors become more fearful of risk the financial turmoil that has gripped markets since august 2007 has led to sharp increase in cr edit spreads with treasury yields falling sharply while other asse t yields have risen25 but just as financial market downturns do not always translate into economic downturns rise in credit spreads does not always accurately predict recession for example financial turmoil in 1998 led to sharp rise

in recession corporate earnings would be expected to fall for the market as whole and this would reduce stock prices if the slowdown were anticipated by investors th fall in prices would happen before the economy began to slow if the combined wisdom of the marketplace is accurate stock prices could potentially offer valuable information bout the future path of the economy even if investors cannot accura tely forecast future economic growth movements in stock prices may provide useful real time information about the current economy given that econo mic data is released with lag and recessions are not declared until after the fact as discussed in the next section stoc k prices are seen as providing useful enough information that they are one of the conference board s leading indicators moreover stock prices fell in the months before the 2001 r ecession but econometric analysis has mostly found th at stock prices do not predict economic growth27 one exception is an article by estr and mishkin that found stock prices to be statistically significant recessi on predictor up to four quarters forward28 evidence presented by hamilton and lin ggests that while recessions and bear markets go hand in hand recessi ons have often started before the decline in the stock market29 index of leading indicators it may be that single measure can reliably predict recession so some forecasters have attempted to evaluate several measures simultaneously for example the conference board priv ate firm compiles wellknown composite index of leading indicators and tracks th index on monthly basis its index is composed of the following measures 1 average weekly hours manufacturing 2 average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34484crs16 30

overidentification where va riables are included that ju st coincidentally moved in concert with the economy in the past without any structural relationship if the past correlation was coincidental it is unlikely to result in accurate predictions in the future of course some indicators in the compos ite may be more important than others weekly manufacturing hours and the money st ock have the largest shares in the index the index is supposed to provide pr edictions about all stages of the business cycle whereas some indicators may be mo re useful for predicting downturn than others according to forecaster edward leamer the interest rate spread unemployment claims and building permits in that order are the best predictors of when recession will start 30 filardo shows that while the composite of leading indicators has predicted most past recessions successfully its usefulness is limited by the fact that the lead time between th prediction and the onset of the recession is highly variable and the index has at times predicted false positives ie predicted recession when recession occurred31 policy responses just as an economic slowdown is caused by market forces market adjustment will also cause economic activity to eventu ally recover on its own but policymakers may prefer to use stimulative policy to attemp t to hasten that adjustment process in order to avoid or at least ameliorate the detrimental effects of cyclical unemployment by definition stimulus propos can be judged by its effectiveness at boosting total spending in the econom total spending includes personal consumption business investment in plant nd equipment residen tial investment nethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34484crs17 32 crowding out is likely to be less of c oncern if the economy enters recession since recessions are typically characterized by falling business investment 33 if foreign borrowing prevents crowding out the future size of the economy will not decrease but capital income will accrue to foreigners instead of americans 34 for more information see crs report rs 21409 the budget deficit and the trade deficit what is their relationship by marc labonte and gail makinen 35

less imports and government spending stimulus could be aimed at boosting spending in any of these categories fiscal stimulus fiscal stimulus can take the form of higher government spending direct spending or transfer payments or tax re ductions but either way it can boost spending only through larger budget deficit deficitfinanced increase in government spending directly boosts spending by bo rrowing to finance higher government spending or transfer payments to househol ds deficitfinanced tax cut indirectly boosts spending if the recipient uses the tax cut to increase his spending if an increase in spending or tax cut is finan ced through decrease in other spending or increase in other taxes the economy woul d not be stimulated since the deficit increasing and deficitdecreasing provisions would cancel each other out since total spending can be boosted onl temporarily stimulus has longterm benefits and may have longterm costs most notably the increase in the budget deficit crowds out private investment sp ending because both must be financed out of the same finite pool of national saving with the great er demand for saving pushing up interest rates32 to the extent that private inve stment is crowded out by larger deficit it would reduce the future size of the economy since the economy would operate with smaller capital stock in the long run in recent years the us economy has become highly dependent on foreign capital to finance business investment and budget deficits33 since foreign capital can come to the united states only in the form of trade deficit hi gher budget deficit could result in higher trade deficit in which case the higher trade deficit could dissipate the boost in spending indeed conventional economic th eory predicts that fiscal policy has stimulative effect in an economy with perfectly mobile capital flows34 s m economists argue that these costs outweigh the benefits of fiscal stimulus the most important determinant of stimu lus macroeconomic ffect is its size the recently adopted stimulus package pl 110185 increases the budget deficit by about 1 of gross domes tic product gdp the major provisions of the package were tax rebates for indivi duals and investment tax in centives for corporations which would be expected to boost c onsumption and capital investment respectively35 in healthy year gdp grows bout 3 in the

see for example options for responding to shortterm economic weakness testimony of cbo director peter orszag before the committee on finance january 22 2008 37 note also that in january 2008 cbo estimated that if supplemental military spending to maintain current troop levels overseas and an alternative minimum tax patch are enacted and expiring tax provisions are extended th 2008 deficit could increase by another 42 billion compared to 2007 contraction in full calendar year ce 1991 thus swing from expansion to recession would result in change in gdp growth equal to at least 35 percentage points stimulus package of 1 of gdp could be expected to increase total spending by about 1 for the year with th effect concentrated in the quarters that the stimulus was delivered36 to the extent that spending begets new spending there could be multiplier effect that makes the total increase in spending larger than the increase in the deficit offsetting the multiplier effect the increase in spending could be neutralized if it results in crowding out of investme nt spending larger trade deficit or higher inflation the extent to which the increase in spending would be offset by these three factors depends on how quickly the economy is growing at the time of the stimulus an increase in th budget deficit would lead to less of an increase in spending if the economy were growing faster the effectiveness of the stimulus package in the current environment may also depend on the nature of the slowdown if the fundamental problem retarding economic growth is credit crunch caused by banks desire to re pair their balance sheets it is unclear how much genera l boost to consumer spending and tax incentives for firms to invest can solve the problem in judging the need for fiscal stimulus policymakers might also consider that stimulus is already being delivered in addition to the stimulus package passed in february from two other sources first the federal budget has automatic stabilizers that cause the budget deficit to automati cally increase and thereby stimulate the economy during downturn in the absence of policy changes when the economy slows spending on entitlement programs such as unemployment compensation benefits automatically increases as program participation rates rise and the growth in tax revenues automatically declines as the recession causes the growth in taxable income to decline in addition to the stimulus package the congressional budget office projected in march 2008 that under cu rrent policy the budget deficit would increase by another 42 billion in 2008 compared to 200737 second the federal reserve has already delivered large monetary stimulus its actions will be discussed in the next section monetary policy the federal reserve can use expansiona ry monetary policy to boost spending in the economy by lowering the overnight in terest rate called th federal funds rate the fed alters interest rates by adding or withdrawing reserves from the banking system lower interest rates increase interestsensitive spending which includes physical investment ie plant and equipm ent by firms residential

report rl34427 financial turmoil federal reserve policy responses by marc labontehousing construction and consumer durable spending eg automobiles and appliances by households in addition wer interest rates would stimulate the economy by reducing the value of the dollar all else equal which would lead to higher exports and lower imports changes in the federal funds rate lead to changes in spending with lag38 beginning in september 2007 before data were publicly available to demonstrate that economic growth had slow ed the fed began lowering the federal funds rate since then it has lowered the ra several times th fed has also greatly increased its direct lending to the financ ial sector through the discount window and series of new lending initiatives incl uding lending to nondepository institutions for the first time in ma rch 2008 it financed the purchase of 30 billion of assets from the investment bank bear stearns to prevent it from filing for bankruptcy the assistance was unprecedented for its size na ture and recipient bear stearns was not member of the federal reserve system39 some critics have argued that financial institutions will be relatively unresponsive to interest rate cuts until they have strengthened their balance sheets thus they argue that the feds moves are wellintentioned but will prove ineffective others argue that the fed has neglected the risk that excessive monetary expansion will result in problem of rising inflati on they argue allowing market forces to adjust would be better for the economy than rate cuts in the l ong run ev if it deepened the downturn in the short run since monetary policy affects the economy with lag it is too soon to say whet her the fed or its critics are correct are recessions unavoidable if recessions are usually caused by declines in aggregate spending and the government can alter aggregate spending through changes in monetary and fiscal policy then why is it that the government cannot use policy to prevent recessions from occurring in the first place while r ecessions should theoretically be avoidable there are several real world problems that keep stabilization from working with perfect efficiency in practice first many of the economic shocks th at cause recessions are unforeseeable by the time policymakers can react to the shocks it may be too late to avoid recession as their name suggests economic shocks tend to be sudden and unexpected few energy analysts predicted that the price of oil would rise from less than 20 per barrel in 2001 to about six times as high today if the rise in price could not be predicted then neither could its effects on the economy second there is time lag between chan ge to monetary or fiscal policy and its effect on the economy because individual be havior adjusts to in terest rate or tax changes slowly it will take time for firm s to boost investment in response to lowerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34484crs20 40 blue chip economic indicators january 2001interest rates and the tax incentives include d in the stimulus package also although the stimulus bill became law in february 2008 consumers did not begin receiving their rebate checks until may because of lags an optimal policy would need to be able to respond to change in econo mic conditions before it occurred for example if the economy were going to fa ll below full employment next year policy would need to be changed this year to prevent it third for stabilization policy to be effective given lags policymakers must have accurate economic forecasts yet even shortterm economic forecasting particularly in the case of turning point s in the business cycle is notoriously inaccurate in january 2001 the congressional budget office the office of management and budget th federal reserve and virtually all major private forecasts predicted growth between 20 and 31 for the year40 in reality the economy entered recession two months later and grew by 08 for the year given the important role of unpredic table shocks in the business cycle perhaps this should not be surprise fourth since forecasts are not always accurate our understanding of the economy is limited and the economy does not always respond to policy changes as expected policy changes do not always prove to be optimal in hindsight for example if the natural rate of unemplo yment nairu rises and policymakers do not realize it they may think that expansionary policy is needed to reduce unemployment economists believe that this is one reason inflation rose in the 1970s fifth in the case of monetary policy changes in shortterm interest rates do not lead to oneforone changes in longterm interest rates longterm interest rates are determined by supply and demand and many factors ter that equation besides shortterm interest rates yet many types of spending may be more sensitive to long term rates reducing moneta ry policys effectiveness one reason the housing boom continued after 2004 was that mortgage rate s increased far less than the federal funds rate sixth since policy changes do not lead to large and rapid changes in economic activity for the reasons listed above it ma take extremely large policy changes to forestall recession yet policy changes of that magnitude coul d be destabilizing in their own right extremely large swings in interest rates could impede the smooth functioning of the financial system and lead to large swings in the value of the dollar large increases in the budget deficit could hamper the government s future budgetary flexibility uncertainty is an argument in favor of more modest policy changes finally policys influence on the economy is blunted by the open nature of the us economy in an era of increasing globalization as discussed above the expansionary effects of increases in the budget deficit have been largely offset by increases in the trade deficit in recent years likewise the contractionary effects of higher shortterm interest rates have not led to significantly higher longterm rates because of the ready supply of foreign cap ital nevertheless higher shorttermhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34484crs21 interest rates would still ve contractionary effect on the economy through the larger trade deficit that accompanies foreig n capital inflows but if foreign capital flows kept longterm interest rates such as mortgage ra tes from rising in response to contractionary monetary policy capital mobility may have rendered monetary policy unable to effectively counteract th housing bubble an open economy is also one that is more influenced by devel opments abroad as the economys openness has increased over time foreign economic s hocks positive or ne gative have had larger effect on the united states and domestic events including policy changes have had smaller effect
