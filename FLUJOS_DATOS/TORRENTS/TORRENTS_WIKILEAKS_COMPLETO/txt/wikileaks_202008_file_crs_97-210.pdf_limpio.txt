for national defense other major legislation includes 1 the defense appropriations bill that provides funds for all military activities of the department of defense except for military construction 2 the national defense authorization bill thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97210 see appropriations for fy1998 defense by stephen daggett crs report 97205 for details1 on the defense authorization and

appropriations bill provides funds for civil projects carried out by the us army corps of engineers the annual defense authorization bill authorizes all the activities in the defens appropriation measures described above therefore major debates over defense policy and funding issues including military construction can be also found in the authorization bill since issues in the defense authorization and appropriations bills intertwine this repor t highlights salient parts of the authorization bill along with the military constructio n appropriation process most funds appropriated each year must be expended in that fiscal year militar construct ion appropriations are an exception since these funds are made available fo r obligation for five fiscal years the separate military construction appropriations bill dates to the late 1950s when large defense buildup occurred in response t intercontinental ballistic missile threats and the soviet launch of sputnik defe nse construction spending soared as facilities were hardened missile silos were constructed and other infrastructure was built the appropriation s committees established military construction subcommittees to deal with this new level f activity consequ ently the separate military construction bill was created the first stand alone military construction bill was in fy1959 pl 85852 previously militar constru ction funding was provided through annual defense appropriations or supplementa l appropriations bills military construction appropri ations are the major but not the sole source of funds for facility investments by the military services and defense agenc ies the defense appropriations bill provides some funds for real property maintenance in operation and maintenanc accounts in addition funds for construction and maintenance of morale welfare an d recreationrelated facilities are partially provided through proceeds of commissaries recreation user fees and other

veto authority on the m ilitary construction appropriations law pl 10545 eliminating 382 projects in 24 states totalling 287 million see table 6 the 287 million savings will go directly to deficit reduction and not to the department of defense the chair of the presidents national economic council gene sperling explained to the pr ess on october 6 that the main savings from the line item veto comes not from what you lineitem but from the savings that you get by encouraging fiscal discipline in future bills he continued that for the line item veto to have its power as deterrent effect on unnecessary spendingthe president has to be willing and is willing to use it when necessary the president used three criteria to line item veto projects added by congress 1 the pr ojects were not in the department of defenses future years defense pla n fydp 2 design work for the projects was not completed and therefore the project could not be executed in the coming fiscal year 3 the projects would provide substantial contribution to improving the quality of life of us troops the congress can send the vetoed items back to the pre sident with majority vote this is called disapproval bill if the president vetoes t hem again twothirds majority is needed to override disapproval bills the congress considered two disapproval bills s 1292 which would have reversed the cancellation of 36 of the 38 project s see senate action below for details and hr 2631 which reinstates all 38 projects the house passed hr 2631 on november 8 1997 by 36264 vote then the house passed version was approved by the senate on novemb er 9 1997 by voice vote obviating the need for conference committee the president vetoed hr 2631 on november 13 1997 despite the white house s admission that they used erroneous data for some of the canceled projects the office fhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97210management and budget omb has refused to confirm which projects or how many wer vetoed by mistake the projects were restored by veto override of hr 2631 during the second session of the 105th congress on february 5 1998 the house took the first step by voting 34769 to overturn the presidents veto on february 26 1998 the sena overrode the veto by vote of 7820 with the veto overturned funding is restored for the 38 targeted projects senate act ion on october 9 the senate appropriations committee held hearing on th use of the line item veto on the military construction appropriations bill the witnesses were military budget officials from the army air force and navy chairma n stevens stated that the purpose of the hearings was to gather factual information on th criteria used for t he 38 projects that were vetoed the senators also stated their opinions on the presidents use of the line item veto on the bill according to the clinton administration the vetoed projects needed to meet all thre criteria see above to be put on the veto list the criteria did not hold up to the data th military officers provided on particular projects first the data showed that 33 of the 3 8 projects were in the pentagons f ydp second some of the projects did have design work in progres s and that the original information that president received on design work for som projects was incom plete also these were executable projects defined in the testimony as contracts that could be started in fy1998 third the commit tee questioned the white houses judgement of the quality of life merit of the 38 projects most of the 38 projects did not meet two out of three criteria for inclusion on the veto list chairman stevens stated that bas ed on these facts that he would introduce disapproval bill to overturn the veto on october 24 the senate appro priations committee approved s 1292 to overturn 34 of the 38 line item vetoes in the military construction appropriations hr 2016 pl 105 45 four items fr om indiana wisconsin and south dakota were left out of the disapproval measure since senators from these states did not want to vote for veto override or go n record opposing the line item veto on october 30 the senate passed s 1292 as amended with two more indiana projects by 6930 vote see the disapproval bills section above for information on passage and the veto override process house action on october 22 the house national security committee hnsc held heari ng on the line item veto and canceled projects in the military construction an d defense appropriations bills although jurisdiction for remedying line item vetoes resides in the committee on appropriations the hnsc stated that it was important to investigate the data and proce ss that the president used to choose projects to veto as in the senat appropriations committee hearin g on the line item veto the witnesses for the hnsc hearing were military budget officials from the army air force and navy hearing testimony i s located at httpwwwhousegovnsc the purpose of the hearing was to establish the record on the specific items that were vetoed the rati onale for the cancellation and the effect the delay of the projects may have on the armed f orces the hnsc was concerned about the use of the line item veto and som members called for repeal of the law others focused on the chronic underfunding of th defense budget and that the savings fro m the canceled projects went to us treasury and out of the defense budgethttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97210members were irked that the vetoed projects were considered pork by the president and media those members pointed out that the added projects went through rigorous screening process by the hnsc were requested by facilities as priority projects and that many of the projects were in the presidents future years defense plan fydp the military budge t officers admitted that erroneous data on the design status was passed from the pentagon to omb the members were distressed that their congression offices had more uptodate data on the design of projects than the pentagon and president inadequate and outofdate data highlighted the flaws of the decision process to cancel projects the hnsc invited the deputy secretary of defense john hamre and the director of omb franklin raines to the october 22 hearing however both declined to testify some members of the hnsc were incensed these top officials did not attend the hearing especially after it became clear that the process questions the members were interested in could only be answered by hamre and raines the house national security committee would like to have another hearing on the line item veto with john hamre and franklin raines in attendance representative skeen from new mexico introduced hr 2631 in early october which would reverse the cancellation of the 38 vetoed projects the house called up the bill under suspensio n of the rules on november 8 the measure passed by 35262 vote see th disapproval bills section above for details on passage and the veto override process conferenc agreement

on september 17 the bill was signed into law pl 10545 by the president on september 30 the conference agreement used savings of 1088 mill ion from reestimations of inflation and adjustments of foreign currency fluctuations these savings were taken as lumpsum from the military construction appropriations bill total see table 4 the conference committee rejected the practice of using prior year savings for current fy1998 program and instructed the pentagon to use the traditional method of requestin g rescissions of funds by account and fiscal year see prior year savings for current yea r

th conference report emphasized that defense committees must be notified of the transfer f brac construction money and that construction money cannot be reprogrammed th conference was concer ned that historic family quarters are costly and tasked the pentagon to work with appropriate federal agencies to reduce the cost the conference report als directed the dod and armed services to report on

military construction and 23 is for the obligations of the base realignment and clo sure accounts see table 4 or srept 10552 for chart comparing the presidents request the house bill and the senate bill in section 125 of their bill the senate appropriations committee used june 199 7 inflation numbers from office of management and budget to reduce military construction nato infrastructure and base realignment and closure accounts by 31 million the sac directed that the inflation savings be applied to family housing accounts on pro rata basis therefore the 31 million inflation savings is taken as lump sum over the entire militar construction and family housing budget see table 4 the senate appropriations committee highlighted barracks construction programs medical facilities and environmental compliance projects in their bill the sac approve d 6599 million for the barracks construction program to p rovide single service members better barracks and dormitories this recommended level is 172 million over the budget request and 919 under the fy1997 level an additional 2085 million for medical facilities and 1036 million for environmental cleanup projects were added by the senate although th bill totals are almost the same active and reserve forces fared differently in the house and senate bills in the house active forces fared better than reserve forces the reverse is true in the senate bill which added 392 million for guard and reserv facilities compared to the houses increase of 155 million on july 22 the senate approved the sac recommendations for the fy1998 militar appropriations act the vote was unanimous except for the votes cast by the senators from arizona mccain and kyl in the senate floor debate sen mccain protested against what he called the additional lowpriority and unrequested military construction projects which totalled 682 million he asked that the additional projects 42 active duty and 50 reserve guard be printed in the record sen mccain also worried about the trend for senators to earmark d esign and planning funds which previously were left for the discretion of the armed services departments budget resolution the budget

hearings and legislation on the fy1998 military construction budget have highlighted overseas expenditures prior year savings for current year programs base realignment and closure brac concerns government performance and results act honest budgets and the future years defense plan for military construction housing as important to the quality of life for servicemembers improving the utility infrastructure of military facilities vision 21 consolidating testing evaluation centers and laboratories and real property maintenance reporting requirements past debates cong ressional additions to the administration request in recent years th congress has added significant amounts to annual administratio n military construction budget requests this year is exception for example the congress added 479 million i n fy1996 and 850 million in fy1997 to the military construction accounts in appropriations action on the fy1998 request the hou and senate added approximately 800 million more than the clinton administrations request in authorization action the house added 75 0 million and the senate added 707 million congress ional additions to the military construction budget have been common an d controversial throughout the 1990s three themes explain the pattern of reoccurrin g congressional additions first some members of the military construction subcommittees have believed that military construction has been chronically underfunded and therefor ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97210 for dis cussion of this and related issues see crs report 91669 military construction 6 current controversies and longterm issues by martin cohen and stephen daggettadditional funds are needed this theme was echoed in the fy1998 reports from the house appropriation committee and the defense authorizing committees second often congress has different prior ities than the administration as reflected in frequent congressional cuts to overseas construction requests an d contributions to the nato security investment program third other members of congress as senator bond commented during the floor debate on fy1996 military construction appropriations believe that dod counts on congress to add money to guar d and reserve programs in recent years congress has added large amounts for national guard and reserve construction projects as much as 4018 million in fy1995 see table 5 debate over congressional additions to the military construction budget involves several overlapping issues military construction proponents including facility advocates in th military services argue that military facilitie s have been systematically underfunded for many years even some say in the midst of the buildup of the early to mid1980s this line of argument was prominent during house appropriations committee markup of the fy1996 military construction bill some complained that t he funding level was up 28 from the prior year while others defended the increase s simply making good previous shortfalls in funding for new const ruction and maintenance the house report on the fy1997 bill hrept 104 591 cited current dod backlog of deferred maintenance and repair for family housin g alone that totaled over 45 billion dollars dod facility managers have fallen below their goal to allocate 3 of the plan t replacement value of dod facilit ies for annual construction and maintenance although this 3 goal is below the average for public facilities nationwide actual dod funding s typically run at 1 to 2 of plant replacement value therefore the replacement cycle fo r defense facilities is 50 to 100 years and facility proponents welcome any congressiona l additions6 finally congressional military construction subcommittees authorization as well as appropr iations subcommittees have frequently taken issue with administration militar construction priorities in the early 1990s for example the committees frequently reduced amounts requested for construction overseas on the grounds that troop levels abroad should be reduced and that allied burden sharing contributions should increase and reallocated the funds to domestic projects in addition congressional committees have added unrequeste d funds for quality of life improvements such as day car centers and barracks renovation the congress has argued that the military services have tended to neglect these areas in favor of warfighting investments the debate over added projects the mccain criteria in 1994 the senat debate on the military construction appropriations bill focused the amount of congressional additions to the re quest despite constraints on overall defense spending senator mccain in particular objected to the provision of substantial amounts for projects that th administra tion had not requested he argued that such projects largely represent k barrel spending and come at the expense of higher priority defense programs in senat floor consideration of the military construction bill that ye ar the managers accepted mccain amendm ent that called for criteria to be applied to additional projects his amendmen t included provision that any added project should be on the military lists of critical ye t unbudgeted projects the mccain ame ndment was not incorporated into the final conferencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97210version of the bill however and the conference agreement provided over 900 million fo r unrequested construction projects the national defense authorization act for fy1995 pl 103337 however incorporated senator mccains criteria as sense of the senate provision providing that the unrequested projects should be 1 essential to the dods national security mission 2 not inconsistent with the base realignment and closure act 3 in the services future years defense plan see below 4 executable in the year they are authorized and appropriated and 5 offset by reductions in other defense accounts through advice from the secretary of defense the purpose of the criteria is to help the congress rate the relative importance f different projects though sense of the senate provision does not have the force of law the mccain criteria have been used in senate authorization and appropriations debates fo r fy1996 and fy1997 the criteria were also cited in the house fy1997 debates by members of the porkbusters coalition in practice debates have focused on justifying project s according to the first four criteria while ignoring the offset criteria in debate on the fy1997 military construction appropriations senator mccain noted that since fy1990 congress has added nearly bi llion dollars year in unrequested military construction projects hr 3517 the fy1997 military construction bill exceeded th administration request by 900 million in the house version and b 700 million in the senate bill during house floor debate on the fy1997 bill representative minge cochair wit h senator mccain of porkbusters coalition ceded the house bill largely adheres to the mccain criteria he voted again st the measure however because it exceeded the presidents request by 90 0 million including 300 million for 42 projects not in the dods longrange plan in debate on the fy1998 military construction appropria tions conference report senator mccain continued to point out congressional adds he noted that the congress added 12 9 projects totalling 941 million the national guard and reserve received 268 million of the additional congressional money senator mccain pre sented the list of extra projects in the congressional record in letter to the president and on his web pag httpwwwsenategovmccainmilconftxt current issues overseas expenditures the house national security committee noted in its title 28 of its report hrept 105132 that it

appropriations committee is also concerned about overseas construction with the likelihood of reductions in the size of the us military overseas military presence may decrease the sac noted that the request of 600 million for overseas construction is 24 of the construction budget therefore the committee cautioned the pentagon to b conserv ative in committing funds and consider leasing facilities or sharing with the hos t nationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97210the sac also instructed the pentagon to report by october 15 on the new fundin g demands that would be made on the nato infrastructure account because of nat expansion in the senate debate over the military construction act senator murray the ranking member of subcommittee mentioned instruction to the administration to execute burdensharing agreement with qatar for prepositioning of equipment in southwest asia prior year savings for current year programs the defense authorizin g committees disallowed the practice of fu nding current programs with prior year savings the authorizers reduced military construction title by approximately 55 million the amount of prior year savings budgeted for fy1998 in their report srept 10529 the senate armed services committee noted that this trend started in the fy1997 budget request with 1 2 million of prior year savings which escalated to 55 million of prior year savings budgeted for fy1998 programs dods use of prior year savings reinforces the committees concern that the pentagon is trying to overprogra m the limited amount of money budgeted for military construction budgeting prior year savings in the sasc view limits the flexibility to fund cost variations and complete projects with justifiable cost increases the senate and hous authorizing com mittees expects the dod to fully fund future military construction requests without using savings the house appropriations committee objected strongly to this method of financing but allowed it in the this years budget request the senate appropriations committee als rejected the practice of prior savings for current programs in its report base realignment and closure brac concerns the senate appropriations committ ee asked the general accounting office to continue its annual review of the bas realignment and closure accounts to help the committee validate requests for individua l projects the report would be due may 15 1998 the senate appropriations committee noted that many of the housing privatizatio n initiatives contain various mechanisms that shift financia l risk and liability to the government some of these guarantees insulate private interests against future brac actions forc reductions or extended deployments the committee commented that housing projects with these guarantees could be an advantage to base in future brac rounds therefore th commit tee has added provision for the pentagon to notify the congressional defens committees of all pri vatization agreements which contain any clause providing consideration for brac force reductions and extended deployments government performance and results act the house and senate appropriations commit tees inserted language into the military construction appropriations act repor t hrept 105150 and srept 10552 stating that implementation of the governmen t performance and results act gpra pl 10362 is to be priority for all agencies f government starting with fy1999 gpra requires agencies establish performance goals and measures the hac report states that they will consider these measures in the fy199 9 appropriations cycle it is likely that this report language will appear in each of the thirteen fy1998 appropria tion bills the sac noted that the dod has begun to incorporate gpra into the departments planning pro gramming and budgeting system ppbs see section on honest budgeting below for more information on ppbs honest budgets and the future years defense plan for militar construction

financial plan the longterm plan extends over sixyear period and is known as the future years defense plan fydp in the fy1998 hearings the chairman of the house subcommittee on militar construction representative ron packard chastised the depar tment of defense for repeatedly failing to submit honest budgets reflecting real service priorities he complained that the military construction request traditionally leaves out necessary projects especially for th national guard and reserve and yet the rvices expect congress to add them mr packard wanted the subcommittee to get out of the business of adding money for projects that th administration had not requested but yet supposedly needs he also wanted dod an d services to use the future years defense plan fydp rigorously to set priorities for thei r construction projects and integrate guard and reserve needs in testimony on the fy1998 request to the military construction subcommittee of the house appropriations committee the dod comptroller john hamre admitted that do d needs to undertake good detailed planning for the military construction budget and has t done this in the past hamre also conceded that the dod has not evaluated the accuracy of the military construction fydps and that he sees need for that assessment in the fy1998 house committee on appropriations report hrept 105150 th committee supported coherent future years defens plan fydp for military construction at the project level of detail and encouraged efforts to reconcile annual adjustments in thi s plan this report language echoed themes heard in the fy1998 hearings which asked fo r coherent planning for guard and reserve facility needs guard and reserve project additions the ranking minority member of the house subcommittee on military construction representative bill hefner stressed in the fy1998 hearings the importance of the guard and reserve forces in the bosnian operation he then questioned whether the guard and reserve shou ld have better and more professional budget system to reflect that role hamre admitted that there is history of the guard not being able to get projects they think are crucial for their mission into the armys fydp and that he i s working with the servic to get more forthright budget including the guard and reserves dod comptroller hamre agreed that if the dod is going to honor the total force concept that the pentagon needs to go better job of building budget that includes the guard an d reserves the house committee on appropri ations in their report hrept 105150 directed the army national guard to report backlog facility requirements develop nationwide armory infrastructure plan and submit future years defense plan fydp with the army national guard and air national guard military

key quality of life issue in the pentagon and in congressional debates ove r military construction the department of defense has found that about twothirds of military housing both family quarters and barracks are substandard because of size safety r condition the fy1998 pentagon construction plan includes money for 5900 new housing8 units and 11000 barracks living spaces in 1995 th endefense secretary perry established an external advisory committee and an inhouse executive committee to look at quality of life issues two major housin g initiatives emanated from th ose committees private

fy1998 by 10 to 37 billion compared to the fy1997 enacted amount of 41 billion representative hefley chairman of the house national security military installatio ns and facilities subcommittee said he felt betrayed by the reduction since he had the understanding that the privatization concept was to augment not replace government funding defense officials defended their proposal 10 since the

lackland air force base texas everette naval station washington fort carson colorado camp pendleton california and albany marine corps logistics base georgia there have been complex issues to work out with these new partnerships in the lackland air force base case for example the dod and local community needed to sort out whether the private developer would pay local taxes the house appropriations committee noted in its in its fy1998 report hrept 105 150 that the housing revitalization support office hrso has just completed its first year of operati ons for managing the dods military housing privatization efforts the hac i s concerned with heavy use of consultant s by the office since it believes that the hrso should develop inhouse expertise in private sector operations to effectively manage this program improving the utility infrastructure of military facilities hearings on th fy1998 military construction request also reflected the interest of the committees in th potential

could save money the house appropriation s committee noted that in their fy1998 report hrept 105 150 that infrastructure such as water and sewer systems electrical systems communic ation systems and transportation systems do not receive sufficient priority i n military construction plans the hac encouraged the dod to look at installationwid infrastructure projects and t program and budget for the work and to study the feasibility of privatizing utility systems the senate armed services committee added section 2802 in s 936 to their defense authorization act on the sale of utility systems of
