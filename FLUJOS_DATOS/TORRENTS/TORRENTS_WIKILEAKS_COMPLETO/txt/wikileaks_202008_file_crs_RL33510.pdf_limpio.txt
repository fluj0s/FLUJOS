especially troubled during the 109th congress in 20052006 beset by the increas ing complexity and unpredictability of taiwans democratic political environment as well as by prc actions underscoring beijings assertion that it had the right to use force to prevent taiwan independence in his second term that began in 2004 taiw ans president mocratic progressive party dpp member chen shuibian increasingly flouted commitments made to us officials and disavowed key concepts long embraced by his nationalist party kmt opponents the status quo that ther is only one china and taiwan is part of it and instead adopted the more pr ovocative position that taiwans status quo is that it already is an i ndependent sovereign country two developments concerning taiwan were particularly nettlesome to

reunification gnr chens original statement to this effect made on january 29 2006 was rprise to us officials who responded by publicly reiterating the us onechina policy and by exerting behindthescenes pressure in taiwan to fore stall the action but presiden t chen toughened his rhetoric in ensuing weeks and reportedly made his final decision that the nuc and gnr should cease at sp ecial meeting of taiwans national security council on february 27 2006 chen linked this decision specifically to the prcs anti secession law targeting taiwan in response to these two events and to other political developments in taiwan notably series of corruption scandals involving chen administration officials and the presidents family members leading to plummeting political support the bush

and feared it could significantly raise tensions across the taiwan strait critics also feared the law could be used to harass independence advocates in taiwan by for example labeling them criminals and demanding their extradition from third party countries for their part taiwan authorities denounced the enactment of the law and temporarily suspended further talks with beijing on holding directcharter cargo and holiday passenger flights between the two sides chens 2006 decisi on to abolish the nuc and its guidelines was the first policy decision he specifi cally linked to the 2005 prc antisecession law abolishing the national unification council and guidelines many observers saw taiwan president ch shuibian as having shifted his policy stance beginning in 2006 in favor of more active pro independence positions that were aggravating to beijing and problematic for us policy one key such controversy during the 109th congress came as result of president chens announcement on february 27 2006 that ta iwans national unification council nuc would cease operations and the guidelines on national unification the guidelines would cease to apply president chen first mentioned he was considering scrapping the nuc and the guidelines on january 29 2006 that statement was surprise to us officials who responded by publicly reiterating the us onechina policy2 senior taiwan official in charge of crossstrait policy initially sought to soften the edges of chens january 2006 statement by saying that any decision was still long way off3 but president chen toughened his rhetoric in ensuing weeks reportedly telling visiting us congressman that the nuc and its gu idelines were an absurd product of an absurd era that should be abolished the dpps central standing committee voted on

2006 stating we expect the taiwan authorities publicly to correct the record and unamb iguously affirm that the february 27 announcement did not abolish the national unification council and did not change the status quo9 according to state department official the march 2 statement along with an earlier january 30 statement represent the coordinated fully cleared viewpoints of the united st ates

motivations it is not certain whether the nuc decision grew out of quiet liberative decisionmaking process within close group in the dpp pangreencoaliti on or whether it was born wholly intact on january 29 2006 when president chen made his original reference to scrapping the advisory body what is clear is that chens january 2006 statement appeared to catch most observers by surprise including highranking members of the dpp the united states officially stated that it d not been informed or consulted prior to chens statement12 taiwans premier tsengchang addressing the legislative yuan ly

another demonstr ation of president chens propensity for calibrated provocation on issues involving the prc and taiwans political status19 whatever the motivations the nuc decision appeared to serve multiple purposes it reminded both the prc and the united states that taiwan is an independent actor with its own policy agenda by redefining the public political debate it distracted attention from the dpps poor showing in local december 2005 elections and it put the kmt on the political defensive criticism and other reactions members of the panblue kmt opposition coalition denounced the nuc

abolish the nuc and strongly criticized his ultimate decision to cease its operations saying it was dangerous step toward the pa th of taiwan independence21 by many accounts though prc reaction to the nuc decision was muted when compared to beijings previous reactions to provocative develo pments in taiwan in statement on february 26 2006 for instance the prcs taiwan affairs office repeated the warnings against moving toward independe nce that it had made in 2004 statement criticizing chen shuibian s reelection but it avoi ded repeating the earlier statements threat to crush moves toward

flights between china and taiwan shared evenly between mainland and taiwan airlines dur ing four public holidays and for other special occasions44 the flights began with the 2006 midautumn festival

6444 billion from january september 2006 accounting for 204 of taiwans total foreign trade45 this increasing economic interconnectedness with the prc put special pressure on taiwans dpp government in

compromise opposition party kmt visits to china in addition to adopting the anti secession law prc officials during the 109th congress sought to increase pressure on the chen government by inviting taiwan opposition leaders to visit china and meet with prc president hu jintao in beijing both taiwans nationalist party kmt chairman lien chan and people first party pfp chairman james soong accepted these invitations making eightda visits to china in april and may 2005 while some viewed the visits as positive development for taiwanprc relations others saw them as beijings effort to exploit

the march 2 statement reads we have seen reports that senior taiwan officials have said with respect to the national unification council that there is distinction between abolish and ceasing activity and that the ffect of taiwans action earlier this week was to abolish the council we have been informed however that the reports quoted taiwan officials we expect the taiwan au thorities publicly to correct the record and unambiguously affirm that the february 27 announcement did not abolish the national unification council did not chan ge the status quo and that the assurances remain in effect our understanding from the authorities in taiwan was that the action taiwan took on february 27 was deliberately designed not to change the status quo as chen shuibian made clear in his 7point statement abrogating an assurance would be changing the status quo and that would be contrary to that understa nding we believe the maintenance of taiwans assurances is critical to preservation of the status quo our firm policy is that there should be unilateral change in the status quo as we have said many timesas president chens more assertive and di visive push for separa taiwan status began to pose growing problems fo r this us policy approach taiwan provocations faced with competing pressures and with continuing transformations in both the prc and taiwan systems bush administration officials in 20052006 at times appeared to be trying to rein in president chen and seemed to place more public caveats on us support for taiwan administration officials were seen as particularly miffed by the nati onal unification council controversy in the spring of 2006 which caught us officials by surprise and raised new concerns for the white house about the credibility of the chen administration the uncharacteristically pointed language in the state departments written march 2 2006 statement directed at taiwan appears to validate this view49 during this period us officials nd members of congress faced increasing pressure to take any number of actions these pressure s included to reassess the fundamentals of us china taiwan policy in light of changing circumstances to reinforce american democratic values by providing greater support for taiwan and possibly support for taiwan independence or to abandon taiwan in favor of the geopolitical demands and benefits of close uschina relations increasing pressure for us involvement for the most part taiwan and prc officials long have maintained that the united states should remain uninvolved in issues concerning taiwans political status but prior to and during the 109th congress us officials came under subtle but increasing pressure from both governments to become directly involve d in aspects of crossstrait ties prc officials late in 2003 began quietly urging the united states to pressure chen shui bian into shelving plans for an island wide referendum in 2004 they pressed us officials to avoid sending the wrong si gnals to taiwan defined as those encouraging independence aspirations mbers of the taiwan government began suggesting to us officials that the taiwan relations act needed to be strengthened or reevaluated and sought us support fo r chens constitutional reform plans in the month between chen shuibians janua ry 2006 statement that he would consider abolishing the national
