pnl leader calin popescutariceanu who formed an alliance consisting of the pnl and the pd supported by the democratic union of hungarians in romania udmr and the tiny conservative party the pnlpd alliance was an uneasy one in part reflecting the fact that single party won majority in the parliamentary ections since taking office the governing coalition has suffered from continual infighting in addition to reported personal animus between basescu and tariceanu nsions have arisen as re sult of differences over social and fiscal policy generally the centerright pnl is more oriented toward free markets and smaller government while the centerleft pd favors traditional european social democratic social model in addition the two leaders crossed swords over the issue of iraq citing human and fi nancial costs tariceanu on j une 29 2006 called for romania to withdraw its troops from iraq the governments supreme council on national defense which must approve such move denied the proposal the following day observers speculate that the plan for withdr awal put forward shortly before basescus july 2006 trip to washington dc may have been intended to embarrass the romanian president during his visit2 romanias next elections are scheduled for late 2008 but some observers doubt the current government will last that long in the fall of 2006 basescu called for snap ballot in the hope of capitalizing on his partys risi ng popularity but the pnl argued that early elections would only divert attention and energies from efforts to institute reforms directed at joining the eu in january 2007 the hope of accession had been the glue holding the coalition together however now that romania is in the european union eu see below the government may be more susceptible to collapse shortly after romanias eu accession the psd announced th at it would seek to oust basescu on april 2 tariceanu stated that he would form new cabinet without the pd effectively dissolving the coalition on april 19 the pa rliament voted to suspend basescus presidency pending public impeachment refe rendum in may 19 plebiscite however large majority 74 voted in favor of basescu analysts believe that the referendum likel strengthened basescu and the pd while weakening tariceanu and the pnl accordingl basescu and his s upporters interpreted the results as form of public noconfidence vote in the government and renewed the call for new elections solution still resisted by the other parties however some observers argue that basescu is now politically somewhat isolated they claim that he has succeeded in casting himself as an outsider and that while this may have enhanced his popularity it has not improved his ability to work with other elected fficials to solve the nations urgent problems many romanians worry that their countrys government will remain both unstable and stalem ated in the months ahead economic conditions romanias post1989 stopandgo approach to economic reform
