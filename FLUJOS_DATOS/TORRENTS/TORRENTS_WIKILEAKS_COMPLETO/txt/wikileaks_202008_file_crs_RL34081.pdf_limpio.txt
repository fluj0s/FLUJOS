1935 has earmarked the equivalent of 30 of annual customs receipts to support the farm ctor through variety of activities today most of this annual appropriation is transferred to the us department of agriculture usda account that funds child nutrition programs ie 57 billion transferred of approximately 7 billion total however the secretary of agriculture has long had broad discretion in how to spend the non transferred unobligated and carryover money which now amounts to approximately 15 billion annually the secretary historically has chosen to use much of this nontransferred money to purchase nonpricesupported commodities like meats poultry fruits vegetables and fish which are diverted to school lunch and other domestic food programs and to fund farm economic and disaster relief activities among other things the 110th congress in may 2008 passed new omnibus farm bill pl 110234 provisions in this new law now spell out more explicitly how the secretary is to use the annual section 32 appropriation one section of pl 110234 requ ires new higher minimum levels of fruit vegetable and nut purchases in fresh frozen canned or dried forms to support domestic nutrition programs separate section requires the department to use section 32 to fund fresh fruit and vegetable program for participating elem entary schools with spending to grow from 105 million in fy2009 to 150 million by fy2012 anot her part of the new law delineates how the secretary is to allocate the annual section 32 appropriationin order to cover the cost of the fresh fruit and vegetable purchases separately usdas fy2008 appropriation part of the consolidated appropriations act 2008 pl 110161 also appears to limit somewhat the availability of section 32 monies it rescinds total of 684 million including 184 million that otherwise was projected to be available in fy2008 for surplus purchases called estimated future needs in ams budget parlance and 500 million in prior unobligated balances these congressional actions may be expected in effect to limit the wide discretion that policymakers have long exercised with rega rd to program spending under this account meanwhile various members of congress and their constituents still want to ensure that portion of the section 32 fund will continue to be availableand be used when necessaryto help producers recover at least portion of their losses when natural disasters or unanticipated economic setbacks arise and to help domestic nutrition programs through surplus purchases

30 of annual us customs receipts the appropriation was first created to assist depressionera produ cers of nonpricesupported commodities the law specifies that section 32 funds are to be used only for 1 encouraging the export of farm products through producer payments or other means 2 encouraging the domestic consumption of farm products by diverting surpluses from normal channels or increasing their use by lowincome groups and 3 reestablishing farmers purchasing power the secretary of agriculture has always had considerable discretion in deciding how to achieve these broad objectives unused amounts of up to 500 million year may be carried into the next fiscal year some believe this discretion is too broad essentially providing the secretary with blank check to spend money without enough guidance from congress others believe such flexibility is desirable if the secretary is to respond to problems in unpredictable agricultural markets or the needs in domestic nutrition programs most of the annual section 32 appropriation for example in fy2007 more than 57 billion of approximately 7 billion is simply transferre d by annual appropriation laws to the us department of agriculture us da account that funds child nutrition programs however the secretary of agriculture acting through the departments agricultural marketing service ams has chosen to use smaller but still significant portion of section 32 fundsthe portion not transferredto purchase nonpricesupported commodities like meats poultry fruits vegetables and fish which are then used in school lunch and other domestic food programs these purchases are intended both to fulfill requirements under other federal laws that such commodities be provided and also to support farm prices in addition the secretary has chosen to use other nontransferred funds to provide direct or diversi on payments to producers for disaster or economic losses and to provide food commodities to victims of natural disasters among other activities the 2008 farm law pl 110234 which congress approved in may 2008 spells out more explicitly how the secretary is to use the annual section 32 appropriation this is expected in effect to limit the wide discretion that policymakers previously exercised with regard to program spending under this account

nutrition programs through the annual ie fy2007 usda appropriation 83 million the equivalent of 30 of customs revenue from fish product imports transferred to the commerce department for fisheries activities this left 1778 billion to which was added 147 million in unobligated fy2006 money that was carried into fy2007 further upward adjustment was made to account for the recovery of 139 million in money that was committed earlier but not spent bringing the amount available for obligation to 1464 billion from this 465 million was designated for planned ams commodity purchases to partially fill the commodity assistance entitlement set by the school lunch act this law mandates usda commodity support for each meal servedin fy2007 an average of more than 17 centsfor total of 919 million to buy these commodities 454 million provided from usdas fy2007 child nutrition appropriation was added to the 465 million set aside from section 32 funds 200 million in additional commodities were purchased to fulfill another school lunch act requirement that at least 12 of assistance be provided to schools in the form of commodities 102 million was made available by usda in direct payments mainly to compensate florida crop producers for hurricane and disease losses and some for livestock payments 11 million went for disaster relief foods eg for hurricane katrina 47 million was used for ams administrative expenses for direct food purchasing including the cost of setting up new webbased supply management system and for oversight of federal marketing orders 2 million was used for the removal of defective commodities primarily canned beef stew contaminated by coli bacteria 57 million was used for emergency removals of surplus commodities throughout the fiscal year 55 million for various fruit and vegetable products 1 million for lamb and nearly 1 million for geese 2 subtracting the above spending ams had potential carryout or unobligated balance of 581 million at the end of the year however the section 32 law permits more than 500 million to carried into the subsequent fiscal year so ams returned the excess or 81 million to the us treasury the appendix to this report contains tables that provides more detailed accounting of section 32 spending by type of activity for each year from fy1992 through fy2007 followed by narrative explanation of each activity 2 as noted earlier such emergency purchases are provided as bonus to schools over and above their entitled amounts and to other designated domestic food assistance programs

purchases are perhaps the bestknown use of section 32 funds they began shortly after passage of the 1935 law and continue today usda seeks outlets for these purchases that do not disrupt private markets more specifically section 32 pays for direct purchases of commodities that are not covered by agricultural price support through usdas commodity credit corporation ccc unlike ccc price supported commodities eg milk grains and oilseeds cotton sugar section 32 does not specif which commodities must be assisted at what levels or how except within the three broad purposes described on page 1 such decisions are left to the secretary of agriculture early in the program usda began donating section 32 purchases to lowincome families and schools on the premise that the donations would supplement not displace normal food purchases by these recipients distribution of section 32 commo dities is credited with stimulating growth of the national school lunch program actually school lunch and other domestic nutrition programs have been benefitting in two ways from section 32 funds first as noted much of the section 32 permanent appropriation simply is transferred into usdas food and nutrition service fns child nutrition account how much to transfer is determined by congressional appropriators based on usdas recommendations this transfer is supplemented by separate direct appropriation provided through the annual usda appropriation law the commingled funds are then used to provide cash and commodity subsidies to schools and other eligible program sponsors for meals served to children second smallerbut still significantamount of section 32 money is used to purchase non pricesupported commodities directly and provide them to schools and to other domestic feeding programs these purchases are made for fns through usdas agricultural marketing service ams some of these commodities 650 million worth in fy2007 are mandated for example sections 6 13 and 14 of the richard b ru ssell national school lunch act pl 79396 entitle schools and other child nutrition program sponsors to commodities worth specific dollar amounts other commodities are provided as bonus to schools and other domestic food programs these commodities are obtained separately when ams makes emergency commodity purchases to relieve farm surpluses that occur throughout the year bonus purchases were valued at 57 million in fy2007 the lowest level of such purchases since fy1996 g7g151g157g146g157g149g142g150g142g151g157g561g18g158g155g140g145g138g156g142g156g561 in planning the mandated or entitlement commodity purchases usda agencies consult with major commodity organizations and devise by early spring tentative purchase plan for the next school year purchases may begin in may the plan is based on prior year purchases likely school needs expectations of available funds and any anticipated surplus or other market conditions in the coming year among other things ams issues the bid specifications for purchasing the products generally in processed form for delivery to state dropoff points the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34081g8g138g155g150g561g138g151g141g561 g8g152g152g141

according to long time observers some other producer groups and domestic food program interests had contended at the time that diverting so much money to th payments threatened the solvency of the contingency fund needed to make the many bonus purchases throughout the year for fruit vegetable poultry pork and other commodity groups suffering surpluses andor low prices also commodity recipients especially food banks pointed out that they rely heavily on section 32 bonus foods even though such foods are not entitlements to help supplement their resources to help pay for the disaster program and still cover normal contingency purchases officials made several adjustments in various usda spen ding accounts for fy2003 strains on the section 32 budget also were relieved somewhat when congress approved provision in the omnibus fy2003 appropriation resolution hjres 2 transferring 250 million from the ccc account to replenish the section 32 account to carry out emergency surplus removals the administration turned to section 32 in fy2004 fy2005 and fy2006 spending more than 13 billion over the four years in direct payments primarily to producers of fruits vegetables and nursery crops for hurricane andor disease lossesfor example 100 million in fy2007 to growers whose trees were eradicated to combat citrus canker other notable portions went for livestock assistance for various losses in disaster assistance package included within the fy2005 military construction appropriations act pl 108324 congress transferred 90 million from the ccc account to the section 32 account to cover some of the past spending g17g157g145g142g155g561g21g142g140g157g146g152g151g561g345g344g561g23g156g142g156g561 usda also uses its broad discretionary authority to spend section 32 money on other activities for example in fy1999 it used 1783 million to make direct payments to hog producers affected by low market prices an emergenc fy1999 appropriation pl 10631 included an extra 145 million to reimburse section 32 for portion of these costs export subsidies and related activities also have been supported in the past section 32 funded pilot food stamp program in the early 1960s paid for production and diversion payments to other producers in past years and supported several supplemental feeding programs congress itself periodically designates other uses for example it designated an additional 75 million for section 32 in 1983 jobs law pl 988 to purchase and distribute foods to needy families in high unemployment areas congress earmarked 10 million of section 32 funds for the special purchase of sunflower oil in fy1988 and 50 million for similar program in fy1994

recommendations was to spend an additional 275 billion of section 32 funds spread over 10 years to purchase more fruits and vegetables for the domestic nutrition programs with the aim of increasing recipients consumption of these products this would have brought total fruit and vegetable purchases mandated and bonus combined to approximately 500 million or more per yearalthough the exact level would depend on how usda calculated current average purchases httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34081g8g138g155g150g561g138g151g141g561 g8g152g152g141 g561g21g158g153 g153g152g155g157g561g23g151g141g142g155

increase section 32 spending beyond current baseline projections however it was unclear at the time how the administration could avoid new spending unless it diverted some current section 32 spending from other commodity purchases eg of meat poultry fish or from other potential section 32 uses such as future disaster assistance

several provisions aimed at fulfilling the goal of increased fruit and vegetable consumption whil maintaining section 32 spending within the budget baseline first under the nutrition title title iv 4304 amends the richard b russell national school lunch act after 42 usc 1769 to authorize new program to provide fresh fruits and vegetables in selected elementary schools nationwide targeting those with higher numbers of students who are eligible for free or reduced price meals the program is to replace similar smaller one funded at about 20 million in fy2008 under 4304 funding is mandated in the following amounts to come from section 32 40 million on october 1 2008 65 million on july 1 2009 101 million on july 1 2010 and 150 million on july 1 2011 for each succeeding july 1 the 2011 amount is to be adjusted for inflation second the billin 14222 in title xiv the miscellaneous titlespells out explicit instructions on how each years section 32 money must be allocated these instructions are intended as way to fund the fresh produce program without raising spending above the budget baseline as estimated by the congressional budget office cbo they contain statutory formula that essentially caps section 32 unobligated funds that is the amount the secretary through ams is permitted to spend after transfers for use in the child nutrition programs and to commerce for fisheries activities these annual caps rise gradually from 1173 billion in fy2009 to 1322 billion in fy2017 and thereafter are tied to inflation under the new law the funding for the fresh fruit and vegetable program noted above is required to come out of these capped unobligated amounts after subtracting this funding the remainder is the maximum that the secretary is permitted to spend for all other traditional section 32 activities such as surplus commodity purchases farm economic and disaster assistance administration of marketing orders and so fo rth for example in fy2009 105 million of the 1173 billion cap must be used for the fresh fruit and vegetable program that will leave 1068 billion for all other section 32 activities thus the apparent effect of the new farm law is to constrain policymakers historical discretion in section 32 spending decisions separate provision in the new law 4404 in the nutrition title seeks to resolve differing perceptions of directive in the 2002 farm bill to spend not less than 200 million of section 32 funds annually to buy fruits vegetables and other specialty crops for domestic nutrition programs usda has maintained that it already spends more than this level each year when both mandatory and contingency bonus purchases are counted in fact section 32 specialty crop purchases averaged 308 million annually over fy2000fy2006 according to usda purchase data examined by crs the 2002 farm bill conference report had directed that the 200 million should be in additional purchases and senate reports accompanying annual usda appropriations have reminded usda of these farm bill instructi ons however usda officials argued that these instructions were not binding because they were in report language rather than in the law itself httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34081g8g138g155g150g561g138g151g141g561 g8g152g152g141 g561g21g158g153 g153g152g155g157g561g23g151g141g142g155

shall purchase in addition to the purchases made under the 2002 law the following amounts of fruits vegetables and nuts for domestic nutrition programs 190 million for fy2008 193 million for fy2009 199 million for fy2010 203 million for fy2011 and 206 million for fy2012 and each subsequent year in other words the department is now bound by law to purchase at least 390 million in fruits vegetables and nuts in fy2008 minimum that will gradually increase to 406 million by fy2012 these purchases can be purchased in frozen canned or dried as well as fresh forms under 4404 the additional purchases required by the 2008 farm bill match cbo projections as to what the department is likely to spend in future years other language in pl 110234 also will affect section 32 under 4305 in the nutrition title the secretary is required to purchase whole grains and whole grain products for use in the school lunch and breakfast programs under 14222 in the miscellaneous title the secretary must make available in fy2009 only 4 million in section 32 funding for these purchases further reducing the unobligated pot of section 32 money

several occasions congress has provided additional funds to the section 32 account ie over and above amounts made available by the permanent appropriation in order to address other specific situations this occurred for fy2005 for example when congress directed usda to transfer 90 million from the commodity cred it corporation ccc the funding mechanism for the departments farm price and income support programs to help cover some of the costs of section 32financed disaster payments to florida producers of fruits vegetables and nursery crops hit by hurricane losses transfer also was made at congresss direction for fy2003 when 250 million was moved from the ccc to help recover portion of the costs of section 32 funded drought assistance program that totaled more than 1 billion over fy2002fy2003 see line 17 under the obligations entries for fy1999 congress appropriated an extra 145 million to help cover about 178 million in direct payments to hog producers in response to

fns to cover portion of the cost of the child nutrition programs for example for fy2007 the total child nutrition appropriation was 13345 billion this total is primarily based on the entitlement spending requirements of the national school lunch act 42 usc 1751 et seq and the child nutrition act of 1966 42 usc 1771 et seq to meet this total spending level the annual appropriation provided 7614 billion and designated that the other approximately 5731 billion come from sect ion 32 these yearly determinations of how much to directly appropriate and how much to transfer from section 32

for each meal served in fy2007 this rate averaged more than 17 cents per meal served for total of 919 million another school lunch act requirement has mandated that at least 12 of total assistance cash plus commod ities combined be in th form of commodities to reach this level usda had to spend anot her 200 million for commodities bringing total commodity entitlement spending to 1119 billion to buy these commodities usda used 665 million in section 32 money the amount in this line plus 454 million in child nutrition account money in past fiscal years usda had budgeted appr oximately 400 million for the section 32 share of these costs this number dropped to 200 million in fy2003 as funds were shifted to help cover the costs approximately 1 billion for special livestock drought assistance program announced in 2002 the lost 200 million in child nutrition entitlement commodities were still purchased the department moved some unobligated balances from other child nutrition

has never spent the full amount state option contracts are intended to be used to assist state commodity distribution agencies to convert bulk or raw usda commodities into products that can be more easily used by domestic feeding programs net costs to section 32 are not incurred because the states reimburse usda the department asserts that this setaside avoids the need to have states pay usda upfront for further processing histor ically the states have requested such contracts for poultry products4

defective commodities but rarely spends the full amount the money is intended to be available in case ams must respond quickly to remove commodity obtained by usda for any domestic food program that is later found to pose health risk for example the 36000 spent in fy2005 was for recall of catfish and 67000 in fy2004 for recall of ground beef in fy2007 ams replaced 19 million in beef stew found to

supported commodities ie commodities that do not receive mandatory support through the ccc over the course of the year the department decides whether it should conduct such purchases based on requests made by agricultural or industry groups andor the ad vice of its own commodity experts who for each purchase analyze economic conditions such as farm prices and production levels the premise is that removing products from normal marketing channels helps to limit supply and thereby increase prices at the start of each year the department predicts how much it may need to spend for these so called emergency surplus removals and the figure usually amounts to several hundred million dollars this figure is published in the departments annual budget justifications to congress as estimated future needs for fy2006 the departme nt initially estimated its future needs at 4163 million but as the tables indicate the ac tual spending was about 81 million unspent funds from this obligation item are

as the contingency fund are usually distributed to domestic feeding programs as bonus foods that is these additional commodities are over and above the entitlement commodities such programs receive under other authorities as the tables indicate the value of emergency surplus removals has varied widely from recent low of 562 million in fy1996 to 2265 million in fy2004

such payments may be in exchange for destruction of crop or for diversion to livestock feed andor to use as commodities for domestic feeding programs for example ams made diversion payments for potatoes in fy1997 9 million and fy2001 119 million the last year any diversiontype payments were made some of the crop went to livestock feed and some to domestic feeding

program which provided payments to cattle lamb and buffalo producers in 37 states to compensate them for drought losses in 2001 and 2002 total of 1729 million was used for this program in fy2002 and another 867 million in fy2003 apparently an unprecedented level for this type of activity under section 32 at the time the spending raised concerns among other producer groups and among domestic food program interests that there might not be sufficient funds in fy2003 and beyond to conduct emergency surplus removals see line 15 above in response officials made several adjustments in other usda spending accounts and also received 250 million from the ccc in order to replenish section 32 g343g350g495g561g17g157g145g142g155g561g6g146g155g142g140g157g561g18g138g162g150g142g151g157g156g561 these have been made to agricultural producers for either economic or disasterrelated reasons usually these payments are transferred to usdas farm service agency fsa for disbursement in fy1999 for example section 32 funded total of 1783 million in direct payments to smallersized hog producers as part of broader usda effort to assist the industry during time of historically low prices in fy2001 397 million in direct payments were made to lamb and sheep producers experiencing economic losses in fy2003 and fy2004 respectively 8 million and 18 million were used for ewe lamb replacement and retention program again for sheep producers who were dealing with economic and droug ht problems the secretary also approved total of 4222 million to be disbursed over two fiscal years fy2004 and fy2005 as direct payments to fruit vegetable and nursery plant growers affected by florida hurricanes another 700 million went for direct payments in fy2006 portion of it to pay growers whose trees were removed by usdas animal and plant health inspection service citrus canker eradication program and other portions for hurricane relief and for livestock grazing losses in fy2007 another 100
