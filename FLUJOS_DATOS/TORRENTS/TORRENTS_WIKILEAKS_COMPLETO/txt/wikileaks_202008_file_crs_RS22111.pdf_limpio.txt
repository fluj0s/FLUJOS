amnesty as well as special provisions to allow certain aliens to adjust to legal permanent resident lpr status are among the most controversial issues of us immigration policy president george w bush has proposed comprehensive immigration reform that includes an expanded guest worker program and an increase in permanent legal immigration as key components1 among the thorny questions raised by such proposals are would unauthorized aliens ie illegal aliens currently in the united states be eligible for the visa and would the proposal include mechanism for guest workers to obtain lpr status2 during the 109th congress the senate passed the comprehensive immigration reform act of 2006 s 2611 which would have enabled certain groups of unauthorized aliens in the united states to obtain legal permanent residence and certain guest workers to adjust to lpr status3 this report summarizes the main options for foreign nationals currently in the united stateslegally or illegallyto become lprs as discussed more fully below most of these options would hinge on congress enacting special legislation immigrant admissions as well as adjustments to lpr status are subject to complex set of numerical limits and preference categories that give priority for admission on the basis of family relationships needed skills humanitarian concerns and geographic diversity4 when congress first codified the assortment of immigration laws into the immigration and nationality act ina in 1952 the assumption was that most aliens who would receive lpr status would be coming to the united states from abroad indeed 30 years ago more than 80 of the 386194 aliens who became lprs of the united states had arrived from abroad in fy2005 658 of all lprs were adjusting status within the united states 5 that the number of lprs arriving from abroad has generally remained around 400000 for the past 30 years while the total number of lprs now hovers around one million annually highlights the contribution that aliens adjusting to lpr status after being in the united states is making to the growth of permanent legal immigration in addition to lprs each year millions of foreign nationals come temporarily on nonimmigrant visas eg tourists foreign students and intracompany business transfers it is estimated that annually hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals either overstay their nonimmigrant visas or enter the country illegally and thus may become unauthorized aliens 6 recent analyses estimate the average growth in unauthorized alien residents at 700000 to 800000 annually as of march 1 the white

become lprs without leaving the country and as figure 1 illustrates most involving unauthorized aliens would require congress to enact law to adjust status under current law aliens must be in the united states legally on temporary visa and eligible for lpr visa 9 aliens fleeing persecution may be granted asylum10 orin very limited circumstancesunauthorized aliens may become lprs through cancellation of removal by an immigration judge even aliens in the united states legally on temporary visa can only adjust to lpr status if they qualify under the statutory set of numerical limits and

states to adjust to lpr status if the alien becomes eligible on the basis of family relationship or job skills without having to go abroad to obtain an immigrant visa ina 245 was limited to aliens who were here legally until 1994 when congress enacted threeyear trial provision commonly referred to as 245i that allowed aliens here illegally to adjust status once they became eligible for an lpr visa provided they paid large penalty fee in 2000 congress temporarily reinstated 245i through april 30 2001 pl 106554 11

enacted statutes that enable certain aliens in the united states on recognizedbut nonpermanentbasis to adjust their status to legal permanent residence when they are not otherwise eligible for an immigran t visa since the codification of the ina in 1952 there have been at least 16 acts of congress that have enabled certain aliens in the united states in some type of temporary legal status to adjust to lpr status most of these adjustment of status laws focused on humanitarian cases eg aliens paroled into the united states by the attorney general or aliens from specific countries who were given blanket relief from removal such as temporary protected status tps deferred enfo rced departure ded or extended voluntary departure evd12 the other major group of aliens adjusting status through special provisions involved nonimmigrants and typically were employmentbased13 beneficiaries of these special provisions included nonimmigrant alien physicians who had graduated from medical school or qualified to practice medicine in foreign state and were fully and permanently licensed and practicing medicine in us state on january 9 1978 non immigrant retired employees of international organizations andor their immediate families who have lived in the united states for specified periods of time totaling at least 15 years for eligible adults and 7 years for children and nonimmigrant nurses here as of september 1 1989 who had been employed in the united states as registered nurses for at least three years before application for adjustment and whose continued employment met specified certification standards g14g142g144g138g149g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g561 the issue of whether aliens residing in the united states without legal authorization may be permitted to become lprs has been debated periodically and at various times congress has enacted legalization programs in 1929 for example congress enacted law that some consider precursor to legalization because it permitted certain aliens arriving prior to 1921 in whose case there is record of admission for permanent residence to register with inss predecessor agency so that they could become lprs in 1952 congress included registry provision aimed 11 for background and analysis see crs report rl31373 immigration adjustment to permanent resident status under section 245i by andorra bruno 12 for

codified the ina and this provision ultimately evolved into an avenue for unauthorized aliens to legalize their status14 when congress passed the immigration reform and control act irca of 1986 it included provisions that enabled several million aliens illegally residing in the united states to become lprs generally legislation such as irca is referred to as an amnesty or legalization program because it provides lpr status to aliens who are otherwise residing illegally in the united states 15 although legalization is considered distinct from adjustment of status most legalization provisions are codified under the adju stment or change of status chapter of ina there were two temporary legalization programs created by irca16 the pre1982 program provided legal status for otherwise eligible aliens who had resided continuously in the united states in an unlawful status since before ja nuary 1 1982 they were required to apply during 12month period beginning may 5 1987 the speci agricultural worker saw program provided legal status for otherwise eligible aliens who had worked at least 90 days in seasonal agriculture in the united states during the year ending may 1 1986 they were required to apply during an 18month period beginning june 1 1987 and ending november 30 1988 approximately 27 million aliens qualified for legal status under the pre1982 and saw programs of this total 16 million or 59 qualified under the pre1982 program and 11 million or 41 qualified under the saw program17

adjustment of status to otherwise illegal aliens who meet certain criteria generally aliens seeking this type of relief are those who have established deep roots in the united states and who can demonstrate good moral character as well as hardship to their family here if they are returned to their native country decisions to grant relief are made on caseby case basis this avenue formerly known as suspension of deportation is now called cancellation of removal as result of the illegal immigrant reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira of 1996 pl 104208 division c in addition to changing the terminology iirira established tighter standards for obtaining this relief the hardship threshold previously was extreme hardship to the alien the aliens citizen or permanent resident alien spouse children or parent now the language states exceptional and extremely unusual hardship the length of time the alien had to be physically residing in the 14 for background and analysis see crs report rl30578 immigration registry as means of obtaining lawful permanent residence by andorra bruno 15 some consider the nicaraguan adjustment and central american relief act nacara of 1997 legalization program because the primary beneficiaries were nicaraguans and cubans who had come to the united states by december 1 1995 but who had not been given any recognized legal status typically afforded to humanitarian migrants such as temporary protected status or deferred enforced departure others view the nicaraguans as having special status because the nicaraguan review program of thenattorney general edwin meese gave special attention to the nicaraguans who had been denied asylum 16 act of nov 6 1986 pl 99603 100 stat 3359 the legalization provisions under discussion here were
