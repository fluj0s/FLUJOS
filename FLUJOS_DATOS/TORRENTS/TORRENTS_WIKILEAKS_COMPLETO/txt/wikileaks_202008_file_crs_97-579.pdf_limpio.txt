employees henry cohen legislative attorney american law division summary the federal tort claims act ftca 28 usc 1346b 26712680 makes the united states liable in accordance with the w of the state where tort occurs for some of the torts of its employees committed within the scope of their employment it also makes federal employees immune from all lawsuits arising under state law for torts committed within the scope of their employment the ftca does not prevent federal employee from being sued for violating the constitution or federal statute that authorizes suit against an individual sometimes congress wishes to immunize private organization or its employees or vol unteers from tort liability one way it may do so is to enact statute declaring that the organization or its employees or volunteers shall be deemed federal employees for purposes of the ftca this report discusses the pros and cons of this type of statute nd then provides examples of more than 50 such statutes pros and cons the reason that congress has sometimes declared private organizations or individuals federal employees for ftca purpos is generally that it has concluded that potential liability or the high cost of liability insurance could discourage an organization or its employees or volunteers from doing the work it does thus the basic argument in favor of these statutes is that by immunizing potential defendants from tort liability they encourage work that congress deems to be in the public interest in addition because the united states has deep pockets these statut can also benefit some plaintiffs an injured party who prevails in an action against the united states is more likely to be compensated fully than one who pr evails against private party in general however these statutes probabl leave injured parties worse off first they arguably remove an incentive for individuals protected by them to exercise due care in the performance of their duties second they leave some injured parties with nohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97579crs2 remedy because the ftca makes the united states liable for only some of the torts of its employees in general the ftca makes the united states liable for the torts of its employees to the extent that private employer would be liable for the torts of its employees under the law of the state where th tort occurred however the ftca has exceptions under which the unite d states may not be held liable even though private employer could be held liable under state w these exceptions include suits by military personnel for injuries sustained incident to service suits based on the performance of discretionary function in tentional torts claims arising out of combatant activities claims arising in foreign country and others in addition the ftca does not permit awards of punitive damages and does not allow jury trials and plaintiffs in tort cases tend to prefer jury trials the supreme court has held that the ft ca makes federal em ployees immune from suit under state law for torts co mmitted within the scope of employment even when an ftca exception precludes recovery against the united states united states v smith 499 us 160 1991 the same appa rently would be the case with respect to organizations or individuals who are not fe deral employees but who are declared federal employees for ftca purposes consequently in considerin g whether to make private organization or individual federal employee for ftca purposes congress may wish to balance the benefits of immunizing the or ganization or individual from liability against the likelihood of leaving potential plaintiffs without remedy way that congress might protect both plai ntiffs and defendants would be to allow the defendants to be sued but provide for the united states to take over the defense of the suit and to pay any damages for which the defendants are held lia ble this way plaintiffs would not be precluded by the exceptions in the ftca from recovering against the united states partial precedent for this approach was the national swine flu immunization program pl 94380 1976 wh ich made an action against the united states under the ftca the exclusive remedy for persons having claims in connection with the swine flu immunization program of the 1970s against vaccine manufacturers but it removed or relaxed several of the ftca exceptions th at might have preclude d recovery in some cases statute may declare the employees of private entity to be federal employees for purposes of the ftca but not declare the entity itself to be federal employee for purposes of the ftca it may instead declare the entity to be federal agency for purposes of the ftca or it may remain silent as to the status of the entity if it declares the entity to be federal agency for purposes of the ftca then the entity would be immune from tort liability because under the ft ca only the united states may be sued if it remains silent as to the status of the entity then the entity presumably could be sued in addition to the united states and would not have the benefit of the exceptions such as the discretionary function exception that protect the united states from liability perhaps however the entity could argue that since its employee is federal employee for purposes of the ftca its employee should not be deemed its employee for purposes of state tort law if an entitys employees are not deemed its employees for purposes of state tort law then the entity would not be responsib for its employees torts in deciding this question court would of cour consider the language nd legislative history of the particular statute involvedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97579crs3 1 for additional information on this provisi on and the preceding
