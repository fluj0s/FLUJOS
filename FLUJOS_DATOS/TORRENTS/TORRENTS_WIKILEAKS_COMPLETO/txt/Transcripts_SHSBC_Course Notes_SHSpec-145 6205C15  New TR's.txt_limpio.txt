6205c15 shspec145 new trs above tr4 there is tr which is auditor query this is the 2wc tr for cchs and model session in cchs the pcs physical reaction is considered to be an origination the auditor asks what happened just then pc what auditor that jerk of your head just then pc oh i had somatic auditor thank you this is the only communication used in the cchs if the pc originates something verbally you acknowledge it per tr4 and go on do not indulge in any extensive 2wc on the pcs answer to your query you ask the 2wc question at the end of command cycle this prevents him from taking control of the session though by the end of the command cycle he will frequently have forgotten what it was this form of 2wc is intended only to exteriorize the pc from somatic by getting him to look at it if his answer when you ask what happened doesnt pertain to the physical change you noticed you can ask what happened with your shoulder etc otherwise the pc can grind on and never notice what he is doing it is allowable to encourage him bit eg by asking how is it going as needed but this should only be done rarely there are emeter drills to teach auditors to recognize body motion and pc sell pcs will try to make items appear to read or to make ruds look clean by gradually loosening their can grip learn to set up the meter smoothly and quietly so that you dont distract the pc needle pattern reading is rather new needle pattern is series of missed withholds culminating in constantly active needle it is dirty needle that can be wide or narrow you can and should correct such pattern get the ruds back in if you get dirty needle on calling goal you need to know that the goal isnt in it is kicking because there is missed withhold connected with it goals and items can be held in and made to look like goals and items by suppressions invalidations and missed withholds if you are good at it you can tell whether pc has missed withhold or an invalidation by the needle pattern you can and should correct the needle pattern to keep the pcs ruds in so that you can do routine 3 needle patterns vary from little buzzt patterns not just tick to larger patterns it is rare to find one on goal or item but it causes trouble if it is there so clean up the missed withhold inval reads with tick the dirty needle has given routine 3 more trouble than anything else there is tr for testing for clean needle described in an hcob of recent date it asks if something is free ie clean on the needle and then repeats the same action this applies to all auditing you go out by the same door you came in in other words when leaving an item you must check it for cleanness by using exactly the same phrase you originally used when starting to run the item if you ask has this goal been invalidated dont leave it with are there any more invalidations on this goal that is different question and you dont know if the first one cleared so this applies to all metered questions and if you are checking something tell the pc that that is what you are doing the best ptp process is the responsibility process what part of that problem could you be responsible for possibly q and with the pc ranges from doing what the pc says to worrying about what the pc was worried about q and tempters could be done as drill to teach the student to just clear his original question holding up against pc suggestions is also an anti q and drill holding constant against adversity is learning to answer with the usual when the unusual is being demanded of you
