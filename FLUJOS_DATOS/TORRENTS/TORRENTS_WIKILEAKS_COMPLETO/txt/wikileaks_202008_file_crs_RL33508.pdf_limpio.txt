in the united states is expected to grow both in numbers and as percentage of the total population over the next 25 years through 2030 in 2002 bipartisan commission created by congress issued report quiet crisis in america which detailed the need for affordable assisted housing and supportive services for elderly persons and the shortage the country will likely face as the population ages the department of housing and urban development hud operates number of programs that provide assisted housing and supportive services for lowincome elderly persons defined by hud as households where one or more person is age 62 or older to ensure that elderly residents in hudassisted housing can remain in their apartments as they age this report describes those programs along with current developments in the area of housing for elderly households hud operates five programs that designate assisted housing developments for either lowincome elderly residents alone or lowincome elderly residents and residents with disabilities the primary hud program that provides housing for lowincome elderly households is the section 202 program established in 1959 it is the only hud program that provides housing exclusively for elderly residents the section 221d3 below market interest rate and section 236 programs are mortgage subsidy programs that provide housing for all age levels but have properties specifically dedicated to elderly households the public housing and section 8 projectbased housing programs also have projects dedicated to elderly households in addition to providing housing hud operates four supportive services programs for elderly persons residing in hudassisted properties the congregate housing program service coordinator program and resident opportunity nd selfsufficiency program for elderly persons and persons with disabilities each provide services such as meals and assistance with activities of daily living to help residents remain independent the assisted living conversion program gives grants to hudassisted developments so that they can convert units or entire buildings into assisted living facilities among current issues involving hudassisted housing for elderly residents is housing preservation in its report quiet crisis in america the commission on affordable housing and health facility needs for seniors in the 21 st century noted that units of affordable housing for lowincome elderly households could be converted to marketrate housing in the coming years due to mortgage maturity and prepayment another concern is the deterioration of existing housing developments two similar bills both entitled the section 202 supportive housing for the elderly act hr 2930 and s 2736 would amend current law to increase the opportunities for building owners to refinance properties and use proceeds to improve the facilities both bills would also create new project rental assistance program for units in certain section 202 developments and would revise the definition of assisted living facility hr 2930 was approved by the house on december 5 2007

congress created bipartisan commission to study the housing needs of the senior population as it ages the commissions final report entitled quiet crisis in america warned of the nations growing senior population and the lack of affordable housing and supportive services programs to meet future demand1 the percentage of individuals aged 65 and older is beginning to make up larger percentage of the total united states population and is expected to continue to grow through 2030 2 between 2000 and 2030 the number of persons age 65 and older is expected to grow from 350 million to 715 million and from 124 of the population to 1963 in particular the oldest old those individuals aged 85 and older are becoming larger share of the elderly population raising concerns about the availability of supportive services in addition to affordable housing the bipartisan housing commission estimated that the aging of the population will result in the need for an additional 730000 units of affordable housing by 2020 4 the department of housing and urban developm ent hud operates number of programs that provide both housing and supportive services for elderly households hud defines elderly persons as households composed of one or more persons at least one of whom is age 62 or older5 five hud programs provide affordable rental housing for lowincome elderly households of these five only one the section 202 supportive housing for the elderly program provides housing exclusively for elderly persons the other four programs provide housing for all age groups but allow some properties to be devoted primarily to housing elderly residents the section 236 and section 221d3 programs provided subsidized loans in the 1960s and early 1970s so that developers could build lowinco housing some of which included buildings dedicated to elderly residents neither program makes new loans although some buildings still have active mortgages the public housing and projectbased section 8 programs also dedicate some buildings for use primarily by elderly households in addition to housing hud funds four supportive services programs for elderly residents in its subsidized properties these programs are the congregate housing program the service coordinator program the resident opportunity nd selfsufficiency ross program for elderly persons and persons with disabilities and the as sisted living conversion program each program works to allow elderly persons living in hudeligible properties to remain in their apartments through assistance and services this report provides summar of the hud programs that provide multifamily rental housing for lowincome elderly households and their related supportive services programs it also discusses funding and current issues in the area of assisted housing for lowincome elderly persons the report does not include comprehensive look at all housing programs that serve elderly households however major sources of as sistance that are not discussed

the section 202 supportive housing for the elderly program is the only hud program that provides housing exclusively for elderly households with more than 268000 units available for elderly households this does not include section 202 units for persons with disabilities it provides more than any of the other hud rental housing programs that designate housing for elderly residents9 established as part of the housing act of 1959 pl 86372 and last authorized in fy2003 pl 106569 the current version of the section 202 program makes capital grants and project rental assistance available to developers so that they can build housing that is affordable to very lowincome elderly households the program was not always structured this way however and has changed several times since its inception during the nearly 50 years that the section 202 program has existed the system of providing financing for developments has changed from loans to grants the tenant population targeted has moved from moderateincome elderly households to very lowincome elderly households and the program has gone from serving only elderly households to serving elderly and disabled households and then back to serving elderly households exclusively the hist ory of section 202 is important because many projects developed in the early years of the program continue to operate under the rules in place at the time they were built the history of the section 202 program can be divided into three distinct phases based primarily on changes to its financing structure and the income eligibility of tenants from 1959 to 1974 the program provided housing units affordable to m oderateincome elderly and disabled families by extending lowinterest construction loans to nonprofit developers between 1974 and 1990 the program continued to extend loans to developers but added section 8 projectbased rental assistance to subsidize tenant rents so that developers could afford to rent units to lowincome elderly and disabled households those with incomes at or below 80 of area median income or beginning in 1981 very lowincome households those with incomes at or below 50 of area median income 10 finally beginning in 1990 hud replaced the section 202 loan program with 6 for more information on section 8 vouchers see crs report rl32284 an overview of the section 8 housing programs by maggie mccarty 7 for more

available at httpwwwgaogovnewitemsd05174pdf although the section 202 program longer provides housing for persons with disabilities be tween 1965 and 1992 section 202 housing was developed for both elderly and disabled households the total number of section 202 units available for both elderly and disabled households is 320000 10 in 1981 the housing and community development amendments pl 9735 required that section 202 units be made available primarily to very lowincome households

the section 202 program was established in 1959 its purpose was to provide housing for moderateincome elderly tenantsthose with too much income for public housing but insufficient income for marketrate housing 11 through the program the government loaned funds to private nonprofit developers so that they could build housing for elderly families and individuals unlike most of its loan programs hud made the section 202 loans directly to developers rather than insuring loans from private lenders 12 the interest rates on the loans were lowapproximately 3and had duration of up to 50 years13 the developers assisted by lowinterest mortgage payments could set rents in their buildings at levels that were affordable to elderly households with moderate incomes at the time there were income eligibility restrictions on the properties between 1959 and 1968 developers constructed 45257 section 202 units in 335 projects with an average of 135 units per building most of which were efficiency apartments 14 in 1962 hud began setting rents for section 202 properties on communitybycommunity basis the new rents were meant to be affordable for lowermiddle income elderly households and they varied across the country 15 in 1968 hud set income eligibility limits for all section 202 developments at the higher of 135 of public housing limits or 80 of area median income16 to make units affordable for lowincome elderly tenants those with incomes at or below 80 of area median income congress enacted rental subsidy program called the rent supplement program described later in this report as part of the housing and urban development act of 1965 pl 89117 17 those tenants receiving rent subsidies made up relatively small percentage of total tenants during the early years of the section 202 program however18 the eligible tenant population for the section 202 program changed in 1964 when nonelderly handicapped individuals and families were added to the definition of elderly families as part of the housing act of 1964 pl 88560 yet very few tenants who were considered nonelderly handicapped participated in the section 202 program between 1964 and 1974 although data

were nonelderly handicapped19 in fy1970 the section 202 program was not funded for the first time since its enactment the nixon administration did not propose any new funds for the program and congress did not appropriate them the administrations rationale was at least in part that the large size of the section 202 loans had negative effect on the size of the federal budget20 this was due to the fact that the program showed only expenditures and not the offsets made when developers paid back the section 202 loans21 between 1970 and 1974 the section 202 program did not fund any new construction projects housing for elderly households was instead constructed using the section 236 mortgage subsidy program established as part of the housing and civil rights act of 1968 pl 90448 discussed later in this report of the section 202 properties funded prior to 1974 there are approximately 278 buildings representing more than 39000 units that still have active loans22 these properties continue to accept tenants according to the rules in place at the time they were developed section 202 developments that applied for hud funds prior to 1962 are not subject to income limits while those constructed after 1962 but prior to july 1972 are subject to the income limits approved by hud at the time23 in addition in the years since many pre1974 section 202 developments were

1974 the housing and community development act of 1974 pl 93383 both reactivated the section 202 program and instituted number of changes the primary change was to make section 8 projectbased rental assistance available to building owners section 8 projectbased rental assistance is rent subsidy that at the time made up the difference between 25 of tenant income and market rate rent as established by hud tenant payments were later raised to 30 of income and was available only to lowincome nants although the law did not restrict section 202 units only to those households that qualified for section 8 projectbased rental assistance the availability to owners of the rental subsidy mean t that more lowincome tenants began to live in section 202 projects change from the programs previous tendency to serve mostly moderate income elderly families 24 contracts for section 8 projectbased rental assistance payments between hud and section 202 owners were initially set for up to 20 years

available to developers when the program was reactivated however pl 93383 changed the interest rate raising it from 3 to the us treasurys cost of borrowing while the duration of the loan term dropped from 50 years to 40 years another change was in the distribution of section 202 loan funds prior to 1974 section 202 developments were largely concentrated in urban areas26 however the housing and community development act directed that 20 to 25 of funds go to nonmetropolitan areas27 by 1988 the share of section 202 units located in cities with populations less than 10000 rose to 115 compared to 27 through 197428 final change to the section 202 program in pl 93 383 was the requirement that section 202 developments support state and local plans to provide services such as transportation homemaker services and counseling and referral services to elderly tenants in 1981 the tenant income guidelines for section 202 units that receive section 8 projectbased rental assistance were changed as part of th omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1981 pl 973529 the law required that hud units receiving ction 8 projectbased rental assistance including section 202 projects be made available primarily to very lowincome households those with incomes at or below 50 of area medi an income the law specified that of the units receiving section 8 projectbased rental assistance prior to 1981 10 could be occupied by households with incomes between 50 and 80 of the area median income those households considered low income while only 5 of new units could be occupied by families earning between 50 and 80 of the area median these percentages were later changed to 25 and 15 respectively 30 between 1974 and 1988 an estimated 128636 additional units of section 202 housing were built using construction loans and section 8 projectbased rental assistance31 the average size of developments declined from 153 units in developments built between 1959 and 1974 to 92 units in developments built between 1975 and 1984 to 56 units in developments built between 1985 and 198832 only 54 of the units built between 1974 and 1985 were efficiencies compared to more than 60 prior to 1974 however

developers need not pay them back as long as the properties are made available to very lowincome elderly households for at least 40 years the change in financing was prompted by concern about the costs involved in paying back section 202 loans under the section 202 loan program developers often used section 8 project based rental assistance to service their loan debt in addition to using it to supplement tenant rentsits intended purpose 34 at the time pl 101625 was enacted it was estimated that approximately 75 of section 8 project rental assistance was used by developers to service their loan debt leaving only 25 for rent subsidies and improvements35 under the new program of capital grants it was thought that developers wo uld longer need to use rental assistance to make loan payments allowing hud to make lower project rental assistance payments requiring less budget authority 36 both the method of providing projectbased rental assistance and the way in which development cost limitations for section 202 projects are determined also changed as result of pl 101625 rental subsidies are longer provided through the section 8 program meaning that rents are not based on section 8 fair market rents fmrs37 the new project rental assistancereferred to as pracis meant to ensure that owners have the ca pacity to determine the needs of residents for supportive services coordinate those services and identify sources of funding to deliver the services 38 although the duration of the new project rental assistance contracts was initially 20 years huds current practice is to extend new rental assistance contracts for three years in addition pl 101625 provided that project development costs be calculated on the basis of factors specific to constructing section 202 projects rather than using fmr standards as had been the case these new factors include the prevailing costs of construction rehabilitation and acquisition of property the costs of special design features for elderly residents and the costs of adding congregate space 39 the new system is meant to ensure that all areas of the country have adequate funds to develop and maintain secti on 202 housing under the old system of fmrs those areas of the country with low fmrs of ten could not afford to develop section 202 projects40 another significant change in pl 101625 was the removal of housing for persons with disabilities from the section 202 program congress began to initiate the split between housing for elderly and disabled households in the housing and community development act of 1987 pl 100242 specifying that 15 of total section 202 funds should be devoted to housing for persons with disabilities in pl 101625 congress directed that beginning in 1992 housing for persons with disabilities be

with the section 202 program developers of section 811 housing receive capital grants and project rental assistance to construct rehabilitate or acquire housing for very lowincome individuals with disabilities the advent of section 811 has not completely eliminated section 202s role in serving disabled households however section 202 developments constructed before 1992 continue to provide housing for persons with disabilities according to the rules that existed at the time of construction between 1993 and 1998 the section 202 program cr eated approximately 27632 units of housing for elderly households41 hud estimates that funds appropriated in the years fy1999 through fy2007 were sufficient to support nearly 51000 units42 in this phase of the section 202 program developments have become smaller with an average of 50 units per project and have virtually efficiency units43 the developments also serve slightly older population in 1983 the average age was 72 and in 1999 it was 75

residents are age 76 or older44 one of the most recent changes to the secti on 202 program occurred in 2000 as part of the american homeownership and economic opport unity act pl 106569 until enactment of pl 106569 section 202 developers could not use low income housing tax credits lihtcs in conjunction with the section 202 capital grants lihtcs provide incentives for the development of affordable rental housing through federal tax credits administered through the internal revenue service 45 the section 202 grants could not be combined with lihtcs due to the ownership requirements of the section 202 program section 202 owners were required by statute to be private nonprofit entities however for nonprofit organization to successfully use lihtcs they must partner with forprofit entity that will be able to take advantage of the financial benefits of the tax credits the value of tax credits is that they reduce an investors federal income tax liability annually over 10year period because nonprofit organizations are tax exempt by definition they cannot benefit from the tax credits in order to make it possible for owners of section 202 properties to benefit from the lihtcs the homeownership and economic opportunity act ma forprofit limited partnerships eligible owners under the section 202 program see section 831 of the act under the changed law private nonprofit organizations may partner with forprofit entities as long as the nonprofit organization is the sole general partner or owner and still be eligible property owners as required by hud statute

field offices of the funds available hud allocates 85 to metropolitan areas and 15 to nonmetropolitan areas46 the formula for allocating section 202 funds to the hud field offices looks at relevant

marketrate rents52 the program was and continues to be run by the federal housing administration fha through the program private lenders extended fhainsured loans with interest rates of 3 and durations of up to 40 years to developers of multifamily rental housing projects of at least five units 53 lenders then sold the mortgages to the federal national mortgage association fannie mae54 the

units in 3601 developments by 197662 but after january 1973 when president nixon imposed moratorium on the new construction of subsidized housing the program did not receive new funds although it has continued to subsidize existing developments the section 236 program assisted both private and nonprofit owners of rental housing projects for lowincome and moderateincome households by insuring mortgages for construction or substantial rehabilitation of buildings and by subsidizing the mortgage payments under the program project owners borrowed funds from private lenders at the market interest rate and the government then made and continues to make subsidy payments to the owners called interest reduction payments irps so that owners effectively pay an interest rate of only 1 on their mortgages by paying the low 1 interest rate ow ners are expected to be able to charge tenants affordable rents each section 236 unit has both basic rent and market rent the basic rent is the payment amount needed to operate the project at 1 mortgage interest rate and the market rent is the amount needed to operate the project at the actual mortgage interest rate 63 tenants pay the higher of the basic rent or 30 of their income initially tenants paid 25 but rent cannot exceed the fair market rent amount64 households with low incomesat or below 80 of area median incomeare eligible for section 236 housing approximately 66000 units 23 of all section 236 units are reserved for elderly residents65 in order to help make section 236 housing more affordable to lowincome households some projects receive rent subsidies through program called rental assistance payments rap congress enacted the program in 1974 pl 93383 to ensure that tenants need not pay more than 25 of their income toward rent building owners were able to receive rap for up to 20 of the units in project subject to increase or decrease at the discretion of the secretary in addition section 236 owners were eligible to receive rent supplement payments originally developed for the section 221d3 bmir program and made available to the section 236 program in the housing and urban developmen t act of 1968 pl

younger tenants67 rather units for elderly residents were to be integrated with those of nonelderly families despite this desire not to segregate elderly tenants by 1960 the first elderlyonly public housing development had been created68 today more than 76000 public housing units are designated exclusively for elderly residents69 beginning in 1961 persons with disabilities were included in the definition of elderly families for purposes of the public housing program combining elderly and disabled residents in public housing has been controversial during the early years of public housing for elderly persons disabled residents made up only small proportion of residents however the number of residents with disabilities in public housing for the elderly began to increase in the 1980s and early 1990s for at least two reasons first individua ls with mental illnesses were less likely to be institutionalized as result of the availability of outpatient mental health care and were therefore in need of affordable housing70 second factor was passage of the 1988 fair housing act amendments pl 100430 the amendments added handicapped individuals to the class of individuals protected from discrimination in the provision of housing the definition of handicapped included individuals with alcohol and drug addictions71 as result of the increase of younger disabled residents in public housing often with mental illnesses and addictions public housing authorities faced greater number of incidents of disruptive behavior and many elderly residents reported feeling unsafe72 due to the conflicts between tenants with disabilities and elderly residents in 1992 congress allowed public housing authorities phas to design ate buildings as elderly only disabled only or elderly and disabled only73 in 1996 the public housing opportunity extension act of 1996 pl 104120 streamlined the process for designating buildings as elderlyonly if pha wants to change the composition of building to only elderly residents it must submit plan to hud to ask for approval if the plan is approved phas cannot evict nonelderly residents with disabilities although phas may help residents relocate if they want to move the law also requires that if pha is unable to rent an available unit to an elderly household within 60 days it must make the unit available to nearelderly tenants where the head of household or spouse is age 50 or older if the unit cannot be rented to nearelderly families then it must be made available to all families 67 house committee on banking and currency housing act of

substantial rehabilitation programs made rental assistance available to developers th at were creating new and rehabilitated rental housing for lowincome families74 from the inception of the program owners were able to develop properties dedicated for use by elderly and disabled families today elderly and disabled households continue to live together in section 8 projectbased housing although owners may give preference to elderly families pl 102550 75 unlike public housing most section 8 properties may not completely exclude residents with disabilities the statute requires that owners continue to reserve some units for disabled households the number is either the number of units occupied by disabled families in 1992 or 10 whichever is lower if owners are unable to rent units to elderly families they may give preference to nearelderly disabled families after the section 202 program section 8 projectbased housing provides the most housing dedicated specifically to elderly

was the first program to make funds available so that hud housing facilities could provide services for elderly residents the purpose of the program was to prevent senior residents of section 202 and public housing developments from moving to nursing homes by providing meals and other supports like housekeeping case management personal care and transportation in 1990 the cranstongonzalez national affordable housing act pl 101625 expanded eligible developments to include those assisted under section 8 projectbased rental assistance contracts and those assisted through the section 221d3 and section 236 programs cranstongonzal ez also specified that congregate housing funds could be used to renovate properties to make them accessible to elderly residents with mobility problems and to hire service coordinators to assist residents since 1995 new congregate housing contracts have been awarded but hud continues to fund contracts that were already in existence through funds appropriated to the service coordinator program described below 79 to receive congregate housing funds nonprofit owners and public housing authorities applied to hud for funds current regulations provide that hud will pay up to 40 of congrega housing costs grant recipients must pay 50 of costs and elderly participants must make payments that total at least 10 of total program costs80 not all project residents are eligible for congregate housing services they must be frail defined as deficient in at least three adls 81 eligible project residents are identified by committee appointed by grantees and made up of three individuals at least one of whom is medical professional who are competent to determine the abilities of elderly residents82 78 the atrisk category applies only to the service coordinator program 79 although the presidents budget for fy1996 did not propose funds for the congregate housing program it did propose that projects similar to the c ongregate housing program would be funded

2736 would direct hud to delegate to state housing finance agencies hfas the ability to process capital grants both bills would also provide that upon expiration of contract for section 202 rental assistance hud shall adjust the contract to account for reasonable project costs as well as the increased costs of project reserves service coordinators and supportive services the bills would also make change to the definition of private nonprofit organization under current law nonprofits must have governing boards that are responsible for operation of the section 202 project hr 2930 and s 2736

give section 202 project owners authority to give preference to homeless elderly applicants various provisions in hr 2930 and s 2736 would address refinancing of existing section 202 properties currently section 202 owners may refinance their properties if they agree to operate the project under terms at least as advantageous to tenants as the terms of the existing loan and if the refinancing results in lower interest rate and reduced debt service under hr 2930 and s 2736 the new loan would not be required to have lower interest rate as long as the project owner would use the new funding to address the projects physical needs s 2736 would further require owners who refinance to continue to ma intain affordability for twenty years beyond the term of the existing loan and would allow refinancing that results in increased debt service costs to occur only when the interest rate on the original mortgage was at or below 6 another change to existing law contained in both bills would be new preservation project rental assistance program for owners with section 202 units that were built prior to 1974 when most units did not receive rental assistance 98 the bills would also expand the ways that owners could use the proceeds from refinancing to include payment of equity and developers fees additionally provision in both bills would limit huds ability to put conditions on the amount of proceeds that section 202 owners may realize from sale or refinancing or the way in which owners use the proceeds hud would only be able to impose conditions on the amount or use of proceeds if there were an existing contract be tween hud and the project owner that authorized the conditions and whereas s 2736 would create mortgage sale demonstration project in which section 202 loans would be sold to state hfas hr 2930 would require hud to conduct study of the potential costs and benefits of such demonstration project both hr 2930 and s 2736 would change the definition of assisted living facility under current law an assisted living facility is owned by private nonprofit corporation is licensed by the state or locality makes available certain supportive services and provides separate dwelling units for residents the two bills would each change the definition so that private nonprofit organizations may meet the requirements either through state or local licensure or by providing certain supportive services to assist residents with activities of daily living finally s 2736 would create national senior housing clearinghouse within hud to disseminate information about available rental units for elderly tenants and characteristics of those rental units the clearinghouse would incl ude not only units in section 202 facilities but also units subsidized through the section 8 program the low income housing tax credit the assisted living conversion program and other programs that subsidize units dedicated for use by elderly households information would be made available to prospective residents through website and tollfree number the provision in hr 2930 and s 2736 regarding the delegated processing of section 202 capital grants to state hfas was included in pl 110289 the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 which was enacted on july 30 2008 under this provision those grantee organizations that are awarded section 202 capital grants and that also intend to use low income housing tax credits to develop their properties may have their state hfa review and process the capital grant instead of hud because hfas are the agencies that administer tax credits 98 however some pre1974 properties later r eceived rental assistance through the rent supplement program and the loan management set aside program

market will lose assisted housing units for elderly tenants because private and nonprofit owners of section 202 221d3 and 236 developments have obligation to continue providing subsidized housing beyond their contract terms therefore owners may eventually convert these units to marketrate rental housing jeopardizing the availability of affordable housing for their tenants affordable housing units may be converted under several circumstances first when hudsubsidized mortgages reach maturity or when owners decide to prepay their mortgages they may decide to convert the units to marketrate rentals second possibility is that owners receiving section 8 projectbased rental assistance could lose or terminate their contracts final concern is that owners of older buildings will not have enough funds to modernize or renovate deteriorating facilities and units will be unavailable because they are not habitable congress has enacted several laws that have attempted to prevent the loss of affordable housing units due to these factors g21g142g140g157g146g152g151g561g344g342g344g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g561 most owners of section 202 properties may prepay their loans with hud approval however in general they must maintain the affordability of the units 99 congress initially addressed the prepayment of section 202 mortgage loans in 1 984 pl 98181 by allowing prepayment only if property owners continue to operate their properties on terms at least as favorable to tenants as the terms under the original loan agreement up thro ugh the original date of loan maturity in 2000 the american homeownership and economic oppo rtunity act pl 106569 added provisions that allow owners to refinance as part of the prepayment if the terms of the new loan result in lower interest rate and reduced debt service pa yments hud will then make at least 50 of its savings from reduced rental assistance payments available to owners to assist tenants either through supportive services facility improvements or rent reductions for unassisted tenants in the 110th congress legislation has been introduced th at would make some changes to the way in which section 202 loans are refinanced see the previous section for discussion of hr 2930 and s 2736 99 some section 202 loans made during the late 1970s and early 1980s may be pr epaid without hud approval

initial mortgage subsidy contracts between hud and property owners in the section 221d3 and section 236 programs had duration of 40 years100 in order to attract developers to the program hud gave owners the right to prepay their mortgages and potentially leave the program after 20 years101 by the late 1980s many section 236 and 221d3 project owners were in the position to prepay their mortgages and charge market rate rents displacing the low income tenants who lived in their developments recognizing that hud could lose thousands of affordable housing units in the coming years 102 in 1990 congress enacted title vi of the cranstongonzalez national affordable housin g act pl 101625 the lowincome housing preservation and resident homeownership act lihprha the act created incentives for building owners to continue offering affordable housing through the section 221d3 and section 236 programs103 lihprha continued to allow owners to prepay their mortgages after 20 years but only as long as the change did not create economic hardship for current tenants or reduce the availability of lowincome housing housing near jobs or housing for minorities104 to convince owners to maintain affordable properties hud could ensure that owners receive rent subsidies sufficient to guarantee an 8 return after mortgage payments and operating expenses were paid and adequate reserves were established if building owners still chose to prepay their mortgages and begin charging marketrate rents hud protected tenants by issuing enhanced section 8 vouchers enhanced vouchers require building owners in low vacancy areas or with elderly tenants and tenants with disabilities to accept the vouchers allowing tenants to remain in the building at the lower rental amount for up to three years 105 the law also required owners to pay 50 of tenant moving expenses lihprha has not been funded since fy1997 pl 104204 but during the 1990s it is estimated to have preserved 110000 units of section 221d3 and section 236 housing106 current law requires that owners give section 221d3 and section 236 tenants at least 150 days notice when they plan to prepay their mortgages107 100 see senate

housing units for elderly households are supported with section 8 projectbased rental assistance contracts when section 8 rental assistance contracts began to expire in the 1990s many owners began to opt out of the program in its fy1998 hud appropriations act pl 10565 congress responded to the optouts by providing that contracts for rental assistance with hud could be renewed at rental rates up to the rate prevailing in the market whenever market rate rents exceed the contract rent market rent is based on either the rent levels of comparable unassisted properties in buildings area or on area fair market rent levels as determined by hud this provision is sometimes called mark up to market and it attempts to give incentives to owners to stay in the section 8 program even if they could otherwise make more money in the private market if owners decide to opt out of the rental assistance program tenants may qualify for enhanced section 8 vouchers that they may use to either remain in the building or move elsewhere 108 pl 10565 also created the marktomarket program for cases in which section 8 payments exceed marketrate rents marktomarket allows those owners with abovemarket rents to renew their rental assistance contracts with hud although at lower rate while also restructuring their outstanding debt on the property the program is designed both to ensure that hud pays reasonable market rents for subsidized properties and to provide incentives for owners of assisted properties to renew their contracts with hud

the most recent census estimated that 24 million grandparents were raising grandchildren and that of this number approximately 19 of grandparents were poor109 the hud guidelines governing the section 202 section 221d3 section 236 and certain section 8 projectbased assistance programs specifically prohibit the exclusion of children from these developments owners may not exclude otherwise eligible elderly families with children from elderly properties 110 guidelines governing public housing developments are less specific although the guidance states that there is nothing in the definition of elderly family that excludes children many elderly families today consist of grandparents with custody of grandchildren this is an elderly family111 even if developments designed for elderly reside nts do allow children however they might not be equipped to serve families with both elderly members and young children for example most units in elderly housing developments are either efficiencies or have only one bedroom and may not have the space to accommodate family members in addition elderly developments might lack common spaces where children might play or the afterschool programs that are often part of hudsubsidized comp lexes for families 108 42 usc 1437ft 109 tavia simmons and jane lawler dye grandparents living with grandchildren 2000 us census bureau october 2003 pp 1 9

grandchildren congress enacted the living equitablygrandparents aiding child ren and youth legacy act in 2003 as part of the american dream downpayment act pl 108186 the legacy act provides for the funding of housing units in the section 202 program for elderly residents raising grandchildren or other relatives age 19 or younger congress did not fund the legacy act until fy2006 when it appropriated 396 million for an intergenerational families demonstration project on april 25 2008 hud released notice of funding availability nofa to solicit grant applications for legacy act funds 112 the available funds are expected to support two to four grants for retrofitting existing facilities for intergenerational housing developing new facilities or creating an annex to an existing project113 rental assistance will also be available for eligible grantees the legacy act also called for hud together with the census bureau to produce study of the affordable housing needs of grandparents raising grandchildren in april 2008 hud released report to congress on intergenerational housing needs and hud programs 114 the report describes the number characteristics and housing conditions of grandparentheaded households and households with other relatives raising related children the report estimates that that 265000 grandparentheaded households and 225000 households headed
