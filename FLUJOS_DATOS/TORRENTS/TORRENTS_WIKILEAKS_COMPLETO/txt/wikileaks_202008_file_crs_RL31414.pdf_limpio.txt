meant to project the future budgetary path of current policy they are not meant to be best guess of future budgetary outcomes without baseline projection policymakers would be in the dark when planning the budget nevertheless an overriding focus on the baseline projection will lead to conclusions that can be radically misleading for three reasons first baseline projections are only as accurate as the assumptions underlying them arguably better guess of th probable path of the budget under current policy might be achieved by modifying three assumptions in the cbo baseline one that discretionary spending will remain constant as share of gdp rather than growing at the rate of inflation two th at current troop levels will be maintained abroad in 2007 three that recent tax reductions and relief from the alternative minimum tax amt will not be allowed to expire modifying these baseline assumptions and accounting for the additional debt service require d to finance these policies yield an estimate th at federal budget deficits would be 7 trillion more over fy2009 through fy2018 period than that s hown by the baseline projection while the baseline shows the budget returning to surplus by 2012 the budget remains in deficit throughout the 10year budget window if these alternative assumptions are used instead the effects of the altern ative assumptions grow over time by 2018 the alternative baseline defic it is 1 trillion compared to baseline surplus of 223 billion second budget baseline estimate s and projections are highly sensitive to small changes in underlying assumptions and economic factors economic forecasts remain subject to extremely large margins of error even over short time periods thinking of the baseline projection as cer tain outcome distorts the policymaking process although the baseline predicts the budget would return to surplus by 2012 under current law projection uncertainty m eans that there is 42 chance it will still be in deficit that year third baseline projections are limited to 10year period and thus give indication of the unique situation the unite d states faces beyond that horizon the retirement of the baby

budget window cbo projects cumulative 10year surplus of 03 trillion with the budget returning to surplus in 20121 but will actual deficits in the future turn out as differently from this projection as was the case in the last five years what lessons can be drawn from this turn of events and what role should budget projections play in policy decisions what baselines can do both cbo and the office of manageme nt and budget omb produce baseline projections of the budget miannually the purpose of the baseline is to project revenues and outlays under cu rrent policy over the next 10 years concise definition of the baseline comes from cbo the baseline is intended to provide neutral nonjudgmental f oundation for assessing policy options it is not realistic because tax and spending policies will change over time neither is it inte nded to be forecast of future budgetary outcomes rather the projections refl ect cbos best judgment about how the economy and other factors will affect federal revenues and spending under existing policies2 thus headlines such as cbo baseline pred icts that the budget will be balanced by 2012 or changes in the baseline projecti ons prove policy change was unaffordable are misuse of the baseline as indicated in the cbo quote the baseline is not best guess of future policy outcomes the proper way to use baseline is as ruleofthumb estimate for the budgetary ramifications of current policy this offers the policymaker means to measure the relative effects of proposed gislation in the context of the overall budget current policy is very narrowly fined in these projections it does nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31414crs2 include proposals made in adopted budg et resolutions bills passed by only one chamber or even bills passed by both chambers but not yet signed into law what baselines cannot do without baseline projection policymakers would be in the dark when planning the budget nevertheless an overriding fo cus on the baseline projection can lead to radically misleading conclusions th is is true for three reasons first baseline projections are only as accurate as the assumptions underlying them critics have argued that several of the underlyi ng assumptions or rules followed by cbo and omb in making the budget baselines are not as realistic as they could be applying alternative assumptions to the baseline could significantly increase the projected size of the deficit as discussed more fully below the baseline treatment of discretionary spending supplemental sp ending on military operations in iraq and afghanistan expiring tax provisions and the alternative minimum tax are four assumptions that have been criticized second budget estimates and projections ar highly sensitive to relatively small changes in the underlying assumptions nd economic factors these changes can have substantial effects on the deficit projection and the effect on the projection compounds when extrapolated into the future in particular our understanding of the economy remains limited nd economic forecasts remain subject to extremely large margins of error even over short time periods thinking of the baseline projection as certain outcome can distort the policymaking process third baseline projections are limited to currentyear expenditures for 10 years although one would expect 10 years to be more than adequate time horizon to assess the course of future policy the united states faces unique situation beyond that horizon the retirement of the ba by boomers under current policy their retirement coupled with rising medical co sts would lead to large expansion in funds dedicated to social security and medicare that is likely to place an unsustainable strain on gove rnment finances because their retirement will mostly occur outside the 10year window the baselin does not reflect this problem in narrow sense it should not reflect the pr oblem for the baseline is not supposed to advocate policy changes nevertheless to the extent that the baseline frames the budget debate critics argue th at baseline that makes unsustainable policy appear sustainable is misleading all three of these issues are discussed in detail below discretionary spending discretionary spending presents special problem to budget estimators accounting for about onethird of total ou tlays it includes most spending in policy areas such as the military transportation education and the environment unlike entitlements there are few legal determinants of its levels instead it is determined annually at the discretion of legislators because lmost all discretionary fundinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31414crs3 comes through annual appropr iations congress has sign ificant control over the amounts involved and there is easy way to distinguish between new policies and the extension of current policy this means that there is obvious growth rate of discretionary spending to use in baseline budget for ecasts arguably the most useful rate of baseline discretionary growth for policymakers is whatever rate is most realistic although the budget enforcement act bea as amended requires that omb and cbo assume discretionary spending will stay constant in inflationadjusted terms in their respective baselines such an adjus tment is not the only reasonable one for example assuming discretionary spending grew at an average historical rate remained constant on perper inflationadjusted basis or remained constant as percentage of gdp would each produ ce different budget results for total discretionary spending to tal outlays and the deficit than does the inflation adjustment requirement smaller rate of increase would slow overall outlay growth reducing the size of future defic it projections higher rate of increase would speed total outlay growth incr easing future deficit projections the baseline assumption that overall discretionary spending will stay constant in real or inflation adjusted terms has two implications first although discretionary spending is ssumed to keep up with inflation there is adjustment for expected population growth under the baseline therefore future discretionary spending can buy the same amount of ro ads or military equipm ent or government services but there will be fewer of them per person second since the economy as measured by gross domestic product gdp is assumed to grow in real terms over the next 10 years but real discretionary spending is assumed to remain constant discretiona ry spending would fall as percentage of gdp this implies that as society becomes wealthier it will not want to spend any of its additional wealth on governmentprovided discreti onary goods and services although there are undoubtedly some govern mentprovided goods and services on which people may not wish to spend thei r additional wealth it is not obvious why this would be true of tota l discretionary spending as implied by the baseline over 10 years the alternate assump tion that nonsupplemental discretionary spending stays constant as percentage of gdp would increase cumulative outlays by 14 tr illion over the baseline levels supplemental spending will be discussed in the next section if outlays are increas ed then absent other policy changes there will be larger national debt and higher outlay for debt service in addition to raising discretionary outlays by 14 trillion assuming discretionary spending stays constant as share of gdp increases debt servi ce costs by 02 trillion the cost of this alternative assumption grows over time in 2018 it dds 280 billion plus 70 billion in debt service to the deficit assuming higher rates of discretionary spending growth is not inconsistent with the baselines purpose to project current policy the baseline is not meant to make value judgments about say what future rate of discretionary spending growth is most desirable its goal is to make the most accurate projections of current policy one way to determine what assumption is most accurate is by looking at what has happened to discretiona ry spending growthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31414crs4 3 of course some of the histor ical change in discretionary spending is due to policy changes which would not be reflected in baseline but for discretionary spending there is objective way to disentangle the policy ch anges from the policy already in placehistorically3 as seen in figure 1 total discretionary spending has in fact fallen slowly as percentage of gdp for decades much of the decline in the 1990s came from decline in military spending as re sult of the peace dividend following the end of the cold war nonde fense discretionary spending ro slightly as percentage of gdp in the 1970s fell in the early 1980s then stayed relatively constant through the 1990s from 2001 to 2005 defense spending grew faster than gdp since then it has held approximately steady as sh are of gdp from 2001 to 2003 nondefense discretionary spending grew faster than gdp since then it s held approximately steady as share of gdp discretionary sp ending was lower than originally planned in fy2007 because of the decision to operate on continuing resolution for the entire year source cbo although discretionary spending fell as percentage of gdp it grew more quickly than the rate of inflation in all but one year between fy1975 and fy1989 thus using the baseline assumption would have underestimated discretionary spending throughout this period in the 1990s discretionary spending fell in real terms from fy1990 to fy1995 but then grew more quickly than the rate of inflation from fy1996 to the present removing th fall in defense spending nondefense discretionary spending grew more quickly than inflation th roughout th 1990s and 2000s with the exception of 1996 at least for nondefense discretionary spending assuming spending would stay constant as percentage of gdp is the only assumption that would not consistently underpredict spending levels historica lly for better or worse the baseline051015 19621966 1970197419781982198619901994 199820022006 of gdp nondefense discretionary defensefigure 1 discretionary spending as of gdp

granted in 2008 and unused budget authority from prior fiscal yearsassumption that discretionary spending will stay constant in inflationadjusted terms through fy2018 would reduce total discretiona ry spending as share of gdp to its lowest level ever since data has been collected supplemental spending on military operations and disasters supplemental discretionary spending which includes military activities in iraq and afghanistan and natural disaster relief outside of the normal appropriation process poses particular problem for th baseline the baseline extends whatever budget authority was granted for the current fiscal year at the time the baseline was projected and adjusts it for inflation over the next 10 years4 supplemental spending for the current year that is passed after the baseline is released will not be included in the baseline as of january 2 008 congress had authorized 88 billion for supplemental spending in iraq and afghanistan5 which has been included adjusted for inflation in each year of the 10year baseline it is difficult to say what assumption about supplemental spending best represents current policy for baseline purposes on the one hand the baseline underestimates military spending in fy2008 unless troop levels abroad are dramatically reduced immediately cbo timates that at least 30 billion more is expected to be spent before fy2008 ends which will increase the deficit relative to the baseline on the other hand assuming th at the government will continue to spend 115 billion year in real terms for the ne xt 10 years is probably an overestimate although including anything less could reas onably be defined as policy change in the baseline context remember the baseline is not meant to be best guess of the future if the 30 billion is added to the base line in 2008 and exte nded adjusted for inflation throughout the 10year projecti on then spending over 10 years would rise by 332 billion plus 103 billion in debt service this assumption is not current policy in the sense that it would still not be sufficient funding to maintain current troop levels over 10 years alternatively if troops we re gradually reduced to 30000 by 2010 the deficit would be reduced by 305 billion plus 35 billion in debt service over 10 years besides military spending congress routinely authorizes unplanned supplemental spending in response to emer gencies in some years such as 2005 following hurricane katrina supplemental sp ending is quite large in other years it is much smaller the baseline extends whatever level of supplemental spending occurred in the last year because non military supplemental spending varies from year to year in some years extending the current year amount would be too high over the baseline window and in others too lowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31414crs6 6 until 2005 omb made similar assumptions to construct its baseline in 2005 the baseline was changed to incorporate certain policy change s such as extending expiring tax cuts and not extending emergency spending to compare cbo and omb baseline estimates use the omb bea baseline deficit found in omb analytical perspectives february 2007 7 for more information see crs report rl33641 tax expenditures trends and critiques by thomas l hungerford 8 for more information see crs report rl30149 the alternative minimum tax for individuals by gregg esenweinexpiring provisions some government spending and tax pr ovisions especially tax credits have expiration dates cbo is required to assume in their baseline estimates that all tax measures unless earmarked to trust fund and small spending programs will expire as scheduled since that represents current policy according to the law6 the baseline reflects this assumption by increasing revenues when the measure is due to expire or reducing outlays when the program is due to expire but most of these expiring provisions have proven very durable and are routinely extended the 10year cost of extending these provisions is 438 billion plus 97 billion in debt service some examples of expiring tax provisions include credits or deductions for fuel cell vehicles qualified zone academy bonds we lfaretowork medical savings accounts research and experimentation and ec onomic development empowerment zones7 the routine renewal of minor tax pr ovisions has made the proper baseline treatment of expiring provisions tricky for years but baseline treatment of expiring provisions became particularly difficult after the decision to make the major tax cuts of 2001 the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act egtrra pl 10716 and 2003 the jobs and growth tax relief reconc iliation act of 2003 jgtrra pl 10827 both of which ex pire in 2010 due to congressional budget rules clearly expiration of the tax cut was not goal of its proponents and there have already been several pr oposals to make it permanent including the presidents fy2007 budget proposal few would say that policy had not changed if tax cuts received in 2010 disappeared in 2011 cbo estimates that if egtrra and jgtrra were renewed the deficit would rise by 23 trillion plus 04 trillion in debt service over 10 years almost all of the cost comes after 2010 and grows ove r time in 2018 making egtrra and jgtrra permanent would reduce revenues by 344 billion not including resulting debt service these estimates do not include expiring provisions related to the alternative minimum tax which if allowed to expire would take back some of the tax cuts the problem for the baseline pos ed by the amt is discussed in the next section alternative minimum tax amt the alternative minimum individual income tax amt is parallel tax system that is meant to ensure that all taxpay ers accrue at least so minimum tax liability8 because of the reduction in regular income tax rates and because the amt is nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31414crs7 9 crs report rs21817 the alternative minimum tax amt income entry points and take back effects by gregg esenweinindexed for inflation more and more people fall under it each year jgtrra increased the amt exemption and changed its treatment of tax credits temporarily in recent years the changes made in jgtrra have been extended for one year at time and the changes are currently due to expire at the end of 2008 as result under current law the number of households falling under the amt would rise from 4 million in 2006 to nearly 50 million in 2016 the baseline assumes that the jgtrra changes will be allowed to expire as scheduled many critics have argued that this is not realistic baseline assumption since the amt was originally intended to affect only few very wealthy individuals alternative scenarios that prevent the number of amt taxpayers from growing rapidly would result in significantly larger deficit projections for example if the higher exemption and treatment of tax cr edits under the amt that recently expired were extended and adjusted for inflation the deficit would increase by an estimated 724 billion and increase interest paym ents by 189 billion over 10 years critics argue that the interaction of th amt under current law with the major tax cuts also misrepresents the cost of cu rrent policy for exam ple married couple with two children claiming the standa rd deduction and earning 80000 year in 2008 will find that about 60 of their eg trrajgtrra tax cut has been taken back by the amt9 revenue estimates of the recent tax cuts including the baseline assume that this would occur if they did not the revenue estimates of the tax cuts would be much higher if expiring am t provisions were exte nded when all other expiring tax provisions were made permanen t then the deficit would increase by 13 trillion plus debt service costs of 03 trillion over 10 years this is 598 billion more than the sum of the estimates of the two policy changes in isolation accuracy of forecasts the baseline is inherently uncertain because it rests on number of unpredictable assumptions about the future indeed it should be viewed not as precise estimate but rather as the midpoi nt on continuum of highly uncertain outcomes even in the very near future uncertainty looms large between january and the end of the fiscal year revisi ons in economic and technical assumptions reduced the surplus in 2001 by 72 billion table 1 shows the probability distribution fo r the deficit based on economic and technical errors not policy changes to historical projections three months into the fiscal year cbo projects that the ba seline deficit would equal 15 of gdp in fy2008 if the economic and technical erro rs in cbos january baseline projection are equal to the historical average there is 25 chance that nine months later the actual deficit will be above 22 of gdp and 25 chance it will be below 08 of gdp as the projection moves further into the future the errors get larger although cbo projects baseline surplus for 2012 it predicts 42 chance of deficit instead in 2012 there is 25 chan ce that the budget will be back in surplus equal to 24 of gdp under current policy and 25 chance that the deficit

are based on current policy as defined by the official baseline the historical errors in cbos projec tions stem from two sources errors in cbos economic forecasts and technical errors which refer to all changes in budgetary outcomes that cannot be attribut ed to policy or economic changes for example projections can prove inaccurate because titlement program participation rates turn out to be different or taxable income rises faster or slower than projected the economic errors imply shortcoming on the part of cbo the accuracy of their forecasts has typically been comp arable to private sector forecasters historically economic forecasts have been particularly inaccurate at spotting turning points in the business cycle and the most recent recession was exception in january 2001 cbo the administration the fe deral reserve and virtually all major private forecasts predicted growth between 20 and 31 for the year in reality the economy grew by 08 many economis ts are worried th at the economy may enter recession in 2008 on average r ecent recessions have increased the budget deficit by 16 of gdp absent policy ch anges over the 10year budg et window recessions have relatively small effects on the baseline projections and small changes in assumptions about growth in the labor force and productivity have large effects since 2001 economic changes to the base line have been significant only in 2002 and 2003 by contrast technical change s have been major factor each year10 much of the downward revision in the ba seline forecast in 2001 was attributable to the fact that tax revenues fell even more quickly than cbo predicted given the ratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31414crs9 11 for brief explanation see crs report rl33623 longterm measures of fiscal imbalance by d andrew austin in testimony before the house financial services committee on feb 12 2003 federal reserve chairman alan greenspan proposed that the government adopt accrualbasis accounting like

revenues if policy change or tax cut cost more in reality than its original score this would also appear as technical error what does this uncertainty imply for policymaking it implies that half of the time policymakers will find themselves with more money than anticipated half the time they will find themselves with less setting goals such as balancing the budget or reducing the deficit by half

caused by technical and economic factors there is also policy uncertainty for example spending on unanticipated future wars and natural disa sters which is not budgeted for in baseline projections troubles on the horizon social security medicare and medicaid unlike corporations the government considers only currentyear liabilities in its budget for two reasons first it is ty pically assumed that only the current budget surplus or deficit affects aggregate dema nd in the current economy second unlike corporations the government has the power to alter its revenue taxes or spending levels as necessary to meet almost any fu ture funding need cr itics have argued that since the baseline projects the budget for only the next ten years it is unable to guide policymakers on longer term policy issu under the current accounting system longrange projections indicat that the government faces very large liabilities in its social security medicaid which covers longterm care and medicare programs beginning in the second decade of this cen tury under current policy the retirement of the baby boom generation rising medical costs and longer life expectancy will put enormous pressure on government finances if the government used accrualbasis accounting like corporations then unfunded liabilities would be recorded in the current year deficit as they were accrue d and current deficit projections would be much larger11 to fund these liabilities when th ey accrue would require large budget surpluses using todays cashflow accounting one study has placed the governments total unfunde d liabilities at 71 trillion in present value terms12 benefits paid under these pay as you go programs are financed through payroll taxes on current workers over the next 30 years the ratio of workers per beneficiary is expected to fall from 34 to about 2 table 2 illustrates the projected path of future government outlays under current policy in 2000 total spending on social

2040 the difference between future spending on these programs and the governments future tax revenue is the unfunded liability that can only be financed through higher taxes lower benefits than promised under current law or the issuance of debt the liabilities cannot be financed solely through debt issuance however because the size and persistence of the shortfall would quickly l ead to unsustainably large budget deficits as shown in the table under current reve nue policy total outla ys would rise from 203 in 2006 to 389 in 2080 this large rise occurs under the assumption that all spending outside social security dicare and medicaid would fall to 67 by 2020 its lowest level in the postwar period and continue to fall to 59 of gdp by 2080 budget deficits would become unsusta inably large at some point probably by the 2060s to balance the budget each year under these spending assumptions taxes would need to rise continually to 247 of gdp in 2080 from 184 of gdp in 2006

it would arguably be impractical to give say 75httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31414crs11 year projections the institutional role in the budget debate that the baseline currently occupies and incorporating longterm liabilities into the baseline could be seen as favoring this issue over other policy issues that people may believe to be equally or more important perhaps altering the baselines role from one of neutrality to advocacy nevertheless it can be argued that to the extent that the baseline frames the budget debate and makes unsustainable policy appear sustainable it is also misleading in this case conclusion the sensitivity of the baseline to alternative assumptions the budget baseline is meant to be proj ection of current policy this gives lawmakers means of evaluating how po licy proposals affect the budget the baseline is not meant to be prediction of the future for baseline to be useful it should give as accurate description of current policy as possible unfortunately there is obvious definition of current po licy so some arbitrary assumptions must be made to construct baseline critics have questioned whether some of these assumptions could be altere d to be more realistic arguably better guess of the pr obable path of the federal budget under current policy extended might be achieved by modifying five assumptions in the cbo baseline first that nonsupplemen tal discretionary sp ending will remain constant as share of gdp rather than gr owing at the rate of inflation second that supplemental military spending will be increas ed so that current troop levels in iraq and afghanistan can be maintained in 2008 and following baseline conventions that spending level will be extended throughout the budget window third that expiring tax provisions extenders that are routinely extended will not be allowed to expire in the future fourth that recent tax cuts egtrra and jgtrra will be extended rather than allowed to expire fifth that the alternative minimum tax amt relief will be extended and adjusted for inflation rather than allowing the amt to take back most of the income tax cuts modifying these baseline assumptions and accounting for the additional debt service require d to finance these policies yield an estimate that the fe deral budget deficit would equal 67 trillion over fy2009 through fy2018 period rather than the 03 trillion surplus projected in the official baseline these changes are illustrated in table 4 the effects of the alternative assumptions gr ow over time by 2018 the alte rnative baseline deficit is 1

since january 2007 supplemental spending is excluded from this category b for the purposes of this table the cost of extending the amt includes the interactive effects when the amt and tax cuts are extend jointly another conceptual mistake sometimes made in reference to the baseline is to treat the underlying assumptions as highly predictable the baseline is the midpoint in an wide array of possible outcomes because our understanding of the demand for government services the growth rate of taxable income and the economy in general and causes of the business cycle in particular is limited there is high degree of uncertainty surrounding these estimates even over short time intervals over longer time periods uncertainty grows wh ich is an argument counseling against policy changes whose budgetary effect gr ows over time although the baseline projects that the budget will be back in surplus in 2011 there is 42 chance it will remain in deficit that year reasonable changes in baseline assumptions made in table 4 suggest that under current policy the budget deficit will ri rather than fall throughout the 10year window outside the 10year window budget deficits get larger and current policy becomes unsustainable because of the budg etary pressures associated with the retirement of the baby boomers current deficits exacerbate these pressures
