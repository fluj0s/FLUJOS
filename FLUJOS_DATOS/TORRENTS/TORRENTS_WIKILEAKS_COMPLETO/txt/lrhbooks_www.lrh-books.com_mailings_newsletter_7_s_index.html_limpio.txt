scientology by l ron hubbard the average man is up against problems he is asking himself how can i make more money how can i make my wife faithful to how can i help my children grow up these questions absorb tremendous quantity of his energy but he cant do anything about it because he is so immersed in it so in scientology processing he resolves these questions he understands what hes doing and he turns from man who is simply puzzled static being into somebody who is more than that there are two distinct divisions in scientology the first is philosophic the second is technical under the philosophic heading one discovers the ways and means of forming new ways of life and evaluating or creating standards of livingness and beingness scientology concludes and demonstrates certain truths these truths might be considered to be the highest common denominators of existence itself they have the aspect of precision observation rather than philosophic hazardings when treated as precision observations many results occur when regarded as philosophic opinions only more philosophy results by this knowingness alone and without processing individual technical application it should be understood clearly that new way of life could be created or an old way of life could be understood and better endured or altered under the technical division we have long series of developed processes which applied immediately and directly to life or an organism thereof produce desirable changes in the conditions of life this division comprises applied scientology or scientology applied philosophy and contains standard technology i looked early and long at man to find out what methods he used to survive how he adapted himself to environments in his attempt at survival and what i found was that man advanced to the degree that he preserved his spiritual integrity that he preserved his values that he remained honest that he remained decent and i found that he disintegrated or deteriorated to the degree that he abandoned these things the average man is up against problems he is asking himself how can i make more money how can i make my wife faithful to how can i help my children grow up these questions absorb tremendous quantity of his energy but he cant do anything about it because he is so immersed in it so in scientology processing he resolves these questions he understands what hes doing and he turns from man who is simply puzzled static being into somebody who is more than that we see governments and societies desperately trying to help man they are trying however to solve his problems for him and their efforts to do this have not resulted in any great advance for man the real work is to put individuals into mental condition where he can confront his own problems and solve them to put him in position where he can confront life better where his reaction time is better where he can identify the factors in his life more easily and so he looks around starts solving his own problems and betters his own life that is an essential difference between scientology and other efforts to help man l ron hubbard this excerpt was taken from the book scientology 08 the book
