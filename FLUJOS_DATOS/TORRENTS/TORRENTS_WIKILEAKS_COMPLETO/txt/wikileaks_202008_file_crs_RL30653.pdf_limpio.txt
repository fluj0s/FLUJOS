to mitigate the data shortcomings with regard to conducting trend analysis researchers have utilized multiple databases to determine if they are telling the same story in general they are despite the strong state of the economy through 2000 full implementation of the adas employme nt provisions in the mid1990s and the employment rate of all workingage persons with disabilities failed to improve in recent decades analysts have examined variety of explanations for the lagging employment opportunities of people with disabilities including the seemingly increased share of adults with disabilities so severe that they report being unable to work expansion of the social security disability and supplemental security income programs and enactment nd implementation of the ada the results of this research have prompt ed some to suggest that enhancing the employment prospects of all members of the population with disabilities might involve subsidizing the cost of employer accommodations and helping those already employed retain their jobs among othe r things this report will be updated as warrantedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30653contents introduction 1 c t i n s b t h c n g r s s n d d m i

introduction the congress enacted major legislation concerning the employment of people with disabilities as early as the 1930s thr ough the establishment of wage rates for such individuals below the federal minimum wage this and subsequent laws share focus on individuals with disabilities as current or potential workers learning whether public policy is on the right track is particularly important at the current time because of the positive relationshi p between age and disability as the incidence of disabling health conditions rises with age eg hearing impairments arthritis and limitations on activities due to heart disease and as the large babyboom generation has been entering the midtolate working years disability is likely to become increas ingly common and potentially increasingly costly to society eg increased utilization of medical and rehabilitative services as well as decreased receipt of income and payroll taxes from forgone individual earnings2 moreover new advances in medi cine have allowed people to live with previously lifethreatening impairments and among students who typically are expected to go from school into the wo rkplace those served by the individuals with disabilities education act idea part b have increased over time3 this report begins with summary of federal actions taken during the 20th century related to the employment of people

report closes with an examination of the limited trend statistics on the employment situation of workingage adults with disabilities to determine how they fared in recent decades and mentions policies that have been suggested actions by the congress and administration the national industrial recovery ac t nira of 19331935 addressed the employment disadvantages of disabled individuals4 by establishing productivity based subminimum wage arranged th rough system of certificates5 with time these individuals came to be identifie d in one of three classifications employees of sheltered workshops where the wage floor was set by charitable institution employees in the private forprofit sector where the wage floor couldnot be less than 75 percent of the minimum wage in the industry and employees who by virtue of disab ility were employed in industrial homework the nira was declared unconstitutional in may 1935 and the above requirements were longer operative in 1938 the congress passed the fair labor standards act flsa section 14 of the act established reduced wage for the employment of individuals under special certificates issued by the us department of labors wage and hour administrator whose earning capacity was impaired by age or physical or mental deficiency or injury statutory floor was established but the wage floor for disabled workers at priv ate forprofit firms was administratively set at not less than 75 of the standard federa l minimum wage workers in sheltered workshops run by charitable organization were to be paid on the basis of their earning capacity under the 1966 flsa amendments the wage rate for persons w ith disabilities was statutorily set at not less than 50 of the basic flsa minimum for both competitive industry and sheltered workshops with an exception for work activity centers pl 89601 in 1986 section 14c was agai n amended removing the distinction between workshops and work activity cente rs and eliminating the statutory minimum wage

population with disabilities at rates comparable to other equally qualified workers as contributors to the groups poor employment and earnings outcomes some believe that the success of the laws employment provisions is be st determined by whethe r the employment rate of workingage adults with disabilities incr eases because lack of job opportunities appears to be an even bigger problem than wage discrimination for this protected class7 yet it is easy matter to separate the impact of legislation from host of other factors that are opera ting simultaneously eg changes in economic conditions in private sector provision of health be nefits and in job requirements away from manual labor and toward higher levels of educational attainment as well as toward teamoriented workplaces toward the close of the d ecade the congress turned its attention to the supply side of the labor market in the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 among other things pl 106170

part of the education departments office of special education and rehabilitative services nidrr leads the interagency committee on disability research 11 under the ada for example an individual meets the finition of disability if heshe has physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities has record of such impairment or is regarded as having such an impairment precisely who fits this definition is unclear however as indicated by recent court decisions for more information see crs report rl33304 the americans with disabilities act the definition of disability by nancy lee jones disability is much more narrowly defined in the ssdi and ssi programs where the emphasis is on ones capacity to work to qualify as having disability under the programs person must be unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity because of medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or has lastedis expected to last for continuous period of at least 12 months 12 national council on disability achieving independence the challenge for the 21st continuedfrom providers of their own choice to assi st them to get jobs or increase their earnings9 recent administrations also have undert aken various initiatives that focus on the poor labor market outcomes of indivi duals with disabilities executive order 13078 issued by president clinton on ma rch 13 1998 created the presidential task force on employment of adults with disabilities it was charged with seeking ways to increase the share of the adult popula tion with disabilities that has job among other things that same year the us department of educations national institute on disability and rehabilitation research nidrr announced funding under the rehabilitation act of 1973 for six new rehab ilitation research and training centers to develop information that addresses the employmentrela ted issues of persons with disabilities10 in 2000 the us department of labor dol requested applications for work incentive grants to assist states creating their onestop delivery systems under the workforce investment ac t of 1998 pl 105220 to provide comprehensive employment and training services to people with disabilities and the following year the office on disability policy was established within the dol the relatively recent implementation of these policies and programs makes it difficult to gauge how successful they ve been at enhancing the employment prospects of persons with disabilities the varying definitions of disability contained in programs and surveys compound the problem11 perhaps most importantly so too does the lack of accurate statistics on individuals with di sabilities derived from surveys that have asked consistent stions over time the national council on disability noted in 1996 that despite considerable discussion in the last decade about the limitations of databases and the need for database specifically designed to answer policyrelevant questions about people with disabilities l ittle improvement has been evident12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30653crs5 12 continued century washington dcus government

charges of eo 13078 recogniz ed the data shortc omings related to the labor force status of persons with disabilities it required the presidential task force on employment of adults with disabilities to design and implement statistically reliable and accurate met hod to measure the employment rate of adults with disabilities as soon as possible but later than the date of termination of the task force 30 days after submitting its final report on july 26 2002 the 10th anniversary of initial im plementation of the adas employment provisions data derive d from this methodology shall be published on as frequent basis as possible the bureau of labor statistics and ce nsus bureau in cooperation with the departments of education and health and human serv ices the national council on disability and the presidents committee on employment of people with disabilities have been among the numerous organizations working toward this end the accomplishment of this charge has been complicated by the fact that 1 universally agreedupon definition of disability does not exist and 2 data source is lacking that incorporates both labor force and disability questions which have undergone testing to determine whether people understand what is being asked ie validity and to which people respond in consistent manner over time ie reliability at the present time the us bureau of the census collects selfreported information from individuals on the disab ility and labor force status of household members through the decennial census american community survey current population survey survey of income and program participati on and national health interview survey14 disability typically is not the primary focus of these surveyshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30653crs6 15 sharon stern and matthew

2005federal databases on disability and labor force status census of population and the american community survey acs disability questions are included on the longform of the decennial census of population the number and nature of disa bility questions have differed over time the 1970 form asked about work disability the 1980 form about work disability and the ability to use public transportation nd the 1990 form about work disability the ability to go outside the home alone to shop or visit doctors office and about self care eg bathing or dressing without ssistance the work disability questions were fairly consistent from 1970 throug h 1990 ie having physical mental or other health condition that prevents an individual from working or that limits the amountkind of work an individual can do the disability questions were substan tially revised on the 2000 longform based on the judgment of panel of experts and followup testing households that received the revised questi onnaire were asked whether physical mental or an emotional condition of at least six months duration creates difficulty in working at job or business going outside the home alone to shop or visit doctors office dressing bathing or getting around inside the home or learning remembering or concentrating in addition questi on was included on whether respondents have longlasting sensory impairments eg blindness or subs tantial limitations on physical activities eg reaching or climbing stairs the census bureau intends that the longform of the decennial census be replaced by the more frequently administered comparatively new acs the disability questions in the 19992002 acs we re changed from their original 1996 1998 version to agree with those on the 2000 longform the acs questionnaire was changed in 2003 to address the see ming overreporting of disability in the 2000 census and in earlier surveys by moving the questions location and altering instructions to reduce misinterpretation it appears that these changes have reduced the presumed overreporting15 in addition the census bureau will be conducting national content test in 2006 which among many other things will determine whether new disability questions will be introduced in the 2008 acs thus at present neither the decenni census nor the acs can provide data suitable for analyzing changes over time in the employment status of persons with disabilities current population survey cps the purpose of the cps is to enable the us bureau of labor statistics bls to provide timely information on the labor force status ie employed unemployed or not in the labor force and characteristics eg demographic and occupa tional of the population ra ther than replying yes or to the question about whether they had

of ssdi and ssi benefits the number of beneficiaries will be less than the number of persons who report they have functional or activity limitations because the government programs require that disability be proved medically and because some eligible individuals may not apply for the programscriteria for being employed or unemployed the response disabled is deleted from the record because of this researchers have information on the disability status of employed and unemployed persons from the basic cps16 in march the cps includes supplem entary questions about income respondents have been aske d annually since march 1980 whether health problem or disability prevents them from working or limits the kind or amount of work they can do it is much like the work disability question that appeared on the 19701990 census longform those who say they have work disability are then asked whether they receive income based on the disab ility eg workers compensation the ssdi and ssi programs and th black lung program some researchers cross tabulate the work limitation response from the march supplement with the labor force status question in the basic cps to develop employment rates for persons with disa bilities because the basic and march supplement questions were not designed for this purpose testing to determine whether they provide valid and reliable estimate of the number of people with work disabilities has never been undertaken the bls therefore considers use of the current version of the cps for this purpose to be inappropriate while acknowledging that work limitationbased questions are not the ideal way to identify the size of the workingage population with di sabilities some analysts nonetheless argue that nationally representative employmentfocused data sets like the cps can be used to monitor trends in the employment outcomes of the workingage population with disabilities17 emphasis added survey of income and progr am participation sipp the survey gathers demographic and econo mic data by asking core set of questions that is periodically supplemented with questions on different subjects eg the health and disability topical module the two principa l ways that have been used to define disability in surveys are in terms of 1 limitations on sensory physical or mental functioning and 2 limitations on activities eg paid employment due to chronic health conditions or impairments18 by and large the sipp relies on the former approach and the national health interview survey described below on the latter some observers believe that definition based on functional limitations is superior to one based on activity limitations both approaches generally rely on the medical model of disability that focuses on individuals rather than on environmental factors which not only can affect peoples actua l performance but also how those with equally disabling conditions reply to survey questionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30653crs8 19 john m

on employment of adults with disabilities the second report nov 1999 22 mcneil employment earnings and disability 23 attrition has to do with an in crease in the nonresponse rate among sample units over the life of survey timeinsample bias has to do with the propensity of individuals to offer different replies to the same questions depending on the number of times they have been asked those questionsrespondents to the sipp are considered to have disability if they indicate that they experience difficulty performing certa in sensory or physical functions eg seeing words in newspapers or lifting an object weighing 10 pounds activities of daily living adls eg eating or getting around inside the home or instrumental activities of daily living iadls eg going outside the home or keeping track of bills people who indicate that they have physical mental or other health condition that prevents them from or restricts the kindamount of work they can perform around the house or at job also are deemed to have disability in addition respondents who state that they us assistive devices eg wheelchairs or canes have specific conditions eg developmental disord ers or alzheimers disease or are under age 65 and covered by certain benefit prog rams eg ssi are considered to have disability over the years there has been some cognitive pretesting of the sipp disability questions to ascertain their validity it has long been argued however that asking people whether they are limited in the kind amount of work they can do lacks face validity because their responses would depend upon environmenta l conditions eg the presence of workplace accommodations19 for this reason question was added to allow respondents to indicate whether they have condition which makes finding job or remaining employed difficult without stating that they are limited regardless of environmental considerations the sipp s disability module and core questionnaire have been fair ly consistent since 1990 but as just discussed questions were added to try to better capture the meaning of disability20 the presidential task force on employme nt of adults with disabilities found that the sipp produced sizeable fluctuations in the disability status of individuals within just years time21 which suggests that at least some of its disability estimates lack reliability22 as individuals in the sipp are interviewed at fourmonth intervals over two or more years the longitudinal survey is subject to attrition and to timein sample bias23 both of which can adversely affect the quality of estimates derived from one period to the next moreover change in administration of the work disability question to the 1996 panel as oppos ed to earlier panels of respondents has yielded noncomparable estimates

to say the problem may reside less with the questions themselves than with the way analysts have utilized the sipp national health interview survey nhis the purpose of the national center for health statistic s annual survey is to pr ovide information on chronic health conditions health status health care utilization and disability in addition several federal agencies and priv ate foundation funded twopart disabi lity supplement that was conducted along with the 1994 and 1995 nhis as the most comprehensive survey on disability since 197826 it contains plethora of information that allows construction of variety of definitions for disability the supplements questionnaire was widely review ed by interested parties in the disability community voluntarily tested by persons with disabilities in the national centers cognitive questionnaire lab and pretes ted by some 250 households the annual nhis is ongoing it asked consistent disability and labor force questions between 1982 and 1996 although the survey underwent major revision in 1997 some of the earlier disability ques tions were carried forward results from the annual nhis like those from the disa bility supplement typically are made available for tabulation and analysis by members of the research community rather than regularly being releas ed in center publications in the annual nhis prior to 1997 in dividuals were considered to have disabilities if they reported chronic condition or an imp airment that prevented them from or limited their ability to perform agedependent major life activities eg attending school in the case of children age 517 or taking care of oneself in the case of someone at least 70 years old or limited their ability in any way to perform any other activities eg social or family pursuits respondents aged 1869 who reported that an impairment or health problem completely prevented them from working or restricted the kindamount of work they c ould perform were deemed to have work limitations the nhis also asked people if they needed assistance in performing adls or iadls as in th sipp respondents with limitations who needed assistance did not necessarily indicate that they had conditions or impairments that restricted their ability to work in those instances where individuals identified an activity limitation they were asked about the specific health condition that led to the limitation and how long it lasted beginning with the redesigned 1997 nhis questionnaire some changes were made to the abovedescribed items for example the questions which determinehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30653crs10 27 for example while in all three surveys pe rson without job must look for work to be classified as unemployed the cps specifies the actions the individual must undertake to fulfill its definition of actively seeking employment if the person does not take one of these actions heshe will be counted in the cps as nonparticipant in the labor force in the nhis and sipp as an unemployed member of the labor forcework limitation were reworded to ascertain if physical mental or emotional problem prevents or restricts the kind amount of work person can perform to eliminate an upper age limit and to allow acute in addition to chronic conditions as causes of work disability questions similar to those in the sipp were added to ascertain the presence of functional limitations in context that is not activity specific eg the degree of difficulty walk ing or lifting the questions are asked only for one randomly chosen adult per family included in the survey other differences between the federal data sources the timeliness of results differ the population census is conducted once every 10 years and statistics derived from it are released with considerable lag shortcoming that the acs was developed in part to overc ome information from the annual nhis and the sipp are ava ilable with fairly lengthy lag as well in contrast results from the march cps supplement are released bout six months after it is conducted and selected labor force data from the monthly cps are published the month after it is conducted the composition of the samples also diffe rs the labor force questions in the redesigned nhis are administered only to t hose respondents age 18 or older in the decennial census acs and sipp to thos age 15 or older and in the cps to persons age 16 or older moreover unlik the nhis and cps both of which cover the civilian noninstitutional population the si pp includes members of the civilian and military resident population excludi ng armed forces personnel living in military barracks these th ree surveys exclude the institutionalized population which is covered by the decennial census nd is expected to be covered by the acs the questions in the surveys also have re ference periods of varying length which can affect an individuals bor force status sipp res pondents are asked about their activities over fourmonth reference period during which lengthy interval person could very well have been employed and unemployed before the 1997 revision nhis respondents were asked about their labor force activity during the twoweek period preceding the interview the reference period subsequently was changed to the week before the interview is held in the cps an individual is counted as employed if heshe worked for pay or pr ofit for one hour or in the case of family business for 15 hours on an unpaid basis during the oneweek reference period that precedes the survey week or as unemploye d if heshe was available for work and actively sought job during the four weeks preceding the survey week as neither the sipp nor the nhis has the same precision as the cps in determining labor force activity an individual who is deemed out of the labor force in the cps could be counted as an unemployed worker in the two other surveys27httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30653crs11 28 nancy mathiowetz and

designing questions to identify people with disabilities in labor force surveys history of the work of bls to measure the employment level of adults with disabilities draftalthough these various factors can imp act the quality of survey estimates perhaps the most important factor that affects efforts to collect quantitative information on persons with disabilities is one of definition some observers have concluded that work disability is multidimensional co mplex concept that investigators do not know how to define well disability or limitations in participation are result of complex interaction among an indi vidual and his or her attributes the physical and social environment and the accommodations and barriers to participation the measurement of disability is further confounded by the fact that all characteristics whether in trinsic individual characteristics or characteristics of the environment change with time28 how much progress has been made in the development of timely accurate and reliable employment statistics on persons with disabilities the presidential task force established the employment rate measurement methodology work group ermm which is composed of some 15 federal agencies the ermm has been working on implementing eo 13078s charge concerning the development of timely accurate and reliable labor force data for persons with disabilities the ermms longterm goal has been in corporation of questions in the cps that would enable the release of labor force estimates for people with disabilities as is done for other population groups eg women and racia lethnic minorities toward that end after they had undergone extensive testing numerous questions on disability and labor force status were asked as part of the national comorbidity survey ncs in 2001 and 200229 the hope was that small subset would perform as well as the full battery of questions in order to minimize the burden that would be placed on res pondents were di sability questions

labor force status suffer from various shortcomings in an effort to mitigate th data limitations researcher s sometimes have taken the approach of utilizing multiple surveys to determine whether they are telling the same story generally speaking they are the impact of changing economic conditions 19811992 as shown in table 1 the proportion of the populati on with disabilities that was in the labor force ie employed or unemployed dropped by 45 during the recession of the early 1980s at the same time the labor force pa rticipation rate of the population without disabilities declined by lesser degree 10 similarly during the recession of the early 1990s the labor force participation rate of the workingage population with disabilities fell to greater degree relative to the rate among people without disabilities 41 nd 08 respectively conversely over the 19831990 period when the economy was ex panding the labor force activity of individuals with disabilities rose much more than activity among individuals without disabilities 140 and 88 respectively table 1 percent change in the labor force participation rate of 18 to 64yearolds by disability status 19811992 periodpercent change in

shown in edward h yelin and patricia p katz labor force trends of persons with and without disabilities monthly labor review oct 1994 one might conclude based upon these da ta that the labor force status of persons with disabilities is more sensitive to the business cycle than that of persons without disabilities in other words pers ons with disabilities appear to be harmed more by downswings in the economy and he lped more by economic upswings as discussed in the following section however this relationship seemingly did not hold up during the strong and lengthy econo mic expansion that

stapleton and burkhauser the decline in employ ment of people with disabilities what happened during the 1990s economic expansion the 1990s could have been among the best of times for the workingage population with disabilities because of in particular order enactment of the previously mentioned legisl ation advances in assis tive technologies and the existence of an extremely tight labor market31 not only would robust economic conditions be expected to encourage pe ople who might have given up looking for jobs to reenter the labor force but so dwindling supply of workers would be expected to make firms more willing to hire and if necessary train persons whom they previously might not have considered or might have avoided the timing of employers clamoring for workers could have

includes survey respondents who said that they had health condition or impairment that limited the kindamount of work they could do but did not prevent them from working much different picture of the decad emerges based upon unemployment data both nhis and cps data suggest that the decrease in unemployment among labor force participants was significant and steeper for persons with than without disabilities35 the explanation for this seeming paradox is that the employment rate is populationbased measure and so individuals in the population are uninterested in working eg retirees or c onsider themselves unable to work eg due to poor health in contrast th unemployment rate is based upon more narrowly defined group of people those w ho already have or are actively seeking jobs that is to say those who want to nd who consider themselves able to work an alternative employment rate of people with disabilities who report they are willing and able to work shows statistically sign ificant

disabilities shrank substantially during the 1990s expansion one explanation that has been posited for the poor labor market performance of the aggregate population with disabilities dur ing the last decade is change over time in its composition specifically shift toward people who report they are unable to work the increase in inability to work seems evident among both men and women and across the age spectrum except for youth age 1829 these selfreports appear to be supported by ss subjective measures that s how an increased prevalence of poor health status more severe f unctional limitations and greater need for personal assistance with adls and iadls among persons with disabilities the increased selfreporting of inability to wo rk among the population with disabilities may thus be legitimate nd accurate reflection of real worsening in the degree of work limitation36 assuming that the share of persons with severe work disabilities remains elevated it could prove difficult to narro w the wide gap between the employment rates of people with and wit hout disabilities this finding also raises fundamental question about whether all adu lts with disabilities including those with very work limiting impairments are likely to be able to participate in the labor force and to succeed at finding and keeping jobs the 106th congress responded affirmatively to this question when it passed the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 as its intent is increasing work activity among portion of the adult population with severe disa bilities namely ssd i and ssi benefi ciaries who have medically demonstrated physical or mental impairments of long duration that impede their participation in the labor force policy analysts have examined other explanations for the comparatively poor labor market performance of the populati on with disabilities during the 1990s they include expansion of the ssdi and ssi programs unintended consequences associated with enactment and implementation of the ada increased health care costs and changes in the makeup of th population eg edu cational attainment the results of this research have prompted some to suggest that improvement in the employment outcomes of persons with disabilities might be attained by on the demand side subsidizing the cost of em ployer accommodations and by on the supply side assisting already employed persons with disabilities retain their current jobs among other things37
