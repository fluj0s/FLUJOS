unoccupied until it reentered earths atmosphere in july 1979 disintegrating over australia and the indian ocean skylab was never intended to be permanently occupied but the goal of permanently occupied space station with crews rotating on regular basis employing reusable space transportation system the space shuttle was high on nasas list for the postapollo years following the moon landings budget constraints forced nasa to choose to build the space shuttle first the first launch of the shuttle was in april 1981 when nas declared the shuttle operational in 1982 it was ready to initiate the space station program in his january 25 1984 state of the uni on address president reagan directed nasa to develop permanently occupied space station within decade and to invite other countries to join on ju ly 20 1989 the 20th anniversary of the first apollo landing on the moon president george h w bush voiced his support for the space station as the cornerstone of ngrange civilian space program eventually leading to bases on the moon and mars that moonmars program the space exploration initiative was not greeted with enthusiasm in congress primarily duehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33568crs2 to budget concerns and ended in fy 1993 although the space station program continued president clinton dramatically changed the character of the space station program in 1993 by adding russia as partne r to this already in ternational endeavor that decision made the space station part of the us foreign policy agenda to encourage russia to abide by agreements to stop the proliferation of ballistic missile technology and to support russia economica lly and politically as it transitioned from the soviet era the clinton administr ation strongly supported the space station within certain budget limits the international space station program thus began in 1993 with russia joining the united states europe japa n and canada an intergovernmental agreement iga established three phases of space station cooperation the iga is treaty in all the countries except the united states where it is an executive agreement it is implemented thr ough memoranda of understanding mous between nasa and its c ounterpart agencies during phase i 19951998 seven us astronauts remained on russias space station mir for long duration several month missions with russian cosmonauts russian cosmonauts flew on the us sp ace shuttle seven times and nine space shuttle missions docked with mir to exchange crews and deliver supplies repeated system failures and two lifethreatening emergencies on mir in 1997 raised questions about whether nasa should leave more astronauts on mir but nasa decided mir was sufficiently safe to continue the program mir was deorbited in 2001 phases ii and iii i nvolve construction of the international space stati on itself and blend into each other phase ii began in 1998 and was completed in july 2001 phase iii is

crews d three members two russians and one american or two americans and one russian crew size was temporarily reduced to two one american one russian while the us shuttle was grounded in order to reduce resupply requirements the numbe r of astronauts who can live on the space station is limited in part by how many can be returned to earth in an emergency by lifeboats docked to the st ation only russian soyuz spacecraft are available as lifeboats each soyuz can hold three peopl limiting crew size to three if only one soyuz is attached the plan is that crew size will grow to six once assembly is completed the flight of the shuttle endeavour scheduled for november 2008 is aimed at beginning prepara tions for sixperson crew each soyuz must be replaced every six months the replacement missions are called taxi flights since the crews bring new soyuz up to iss and bring the old one back to earth therefore under norma l conditions the long duration expedition crews are regularly visited by taxi crew s and by the space shuttle bringing up additional iss segments or exchanging expedition crews when the shuttle is unavailable expedition crew s are taken back and forth on the taxi flights in order to contract for soyuz service to the iss nasa has needed an exemption from the iran nonproliferati on act ina pl 106178 which banned us payments to russia in connection with the international space station iss unless the us president determined that ru ssia was taking steps to halt proliferation of nuclear weapons and ssile technology to iran in 2005 congress amended ina to exempt soyuz flights to the iss from the ban through 2011 it also extended the provisions of the ina to syria and nort h korea and renamed it the iran north korea and syria nonproliferation act

june 2006 http wwwexpl orationnasagov documentsreportsnasa_researc h_and_utilization_plan_for_the_isspdfas costs continued to rise congress voted to legislate 25 billion cap on development of the iss program plus 177 billion for associated shuttle launches in the fy2000fy2002 nasa authorization act pl 106391 in january 2001 however nasa announced that the cost would be over 30 billion 72 above the 1993 estimate and 5 billion above the gislated cap nasa explained that program managers had undere stimated the complexity of building and operating the station the bush administration signaled it supported the legislated cap would not provide additional funds nd nasa would have to find what it needed from within its human space flight account core complete configuration in february 2001 the bush administration announced it would cancel or fer some iss hardware to stay within the cap and control space station costs the decision truncated construction of the space station at stage the administration called core complete in 2001 the space station program office at johnson space ce nter jsc estimated that it would cost 83 billion from fy2002 tofy2006 to build th core complete configuration described at that time as all the us hardware planned for launch through node 2 plus the launch of laboratories being built by europe and japan nasa subsequently began distinguishing between us core complete the launc hes through node 2 which prior to the columbia tragedy was scheduled for february 2004 and international partner ip core complete which include d the addition of european and japanese laboratory modules then anticipated in 2008 the new policy was followed by presid ent bushs january 2004 vision for space exploration which directs that us research on iss be restricted only to that which supports the vision new research plan incorporating the presidents vision was issued by nasa in june 2006 as mandated by the 2005 nasa authorization act pl 1091551 at january 2005 heads of agency mee ting the partners endorsed final configuration of iss but nasa subsequently announced changes to it the agency now plans to conduct only 16 instead of 28 shuttle launches to the iss all before the end of fy 2010 september 30 2010 and has dropped plans to launch the centrifuge and its accommodation module and russias science power platform the agency plans to meet with the other iss partners to discuss these changes the changes to the iss are largely due to the new direction nasa is taking in response to the vision for space explorati on the vision calls for development of crew exploration vehicle now named or ion to take astronauts to and from the moon and crew launch vehicle now named ares i orion also can take them to and from the iss and nasa administrator griffin stated at september 19 2005 press conference that orion would be used to take crews to and from the iss and to serve as lifeboat for them if orion is built as announced it would fulfill the ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33568crs5 commitment to build crew return capability and allow the iss crew size to increase to its originally planned complement of seven an earthorbit capability is planned by 2014 although nasa now considers early 2015 more likely with the ability to take astronauts to and from the moon following later than 2020 table 1 us space station funding in

sts114 on july 26 2005 and it successfully landed on august 9 on july 27 however nasa announced that piece of foam had detached from st s114s et during launch similar to what happened to columbia cameras and other sensors on discovery and on the international space station to which discovery was docked for much of its mission imaged the orbiter and determin ed that it was not damaged but further shuttle launches were suspended meanwhile the images revealed that two gapfillers ceramic coated fabric pl aced between thermal protection tiles were protruding on the belly of the orbiter that could have affected aerodynamic heating during reentry one of the discovery astronauts removed them during space walk the second rtf mission sts121 was sc heduled for september 2005 but deferred

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33568crs7 current plans for the shuttle include nine more flights to complete the iss before the shuttle is permanently grounded in 2010 also planned is another flight to service the hubble space telescope following the columbia disaster then administrator sean okeefe had cancelle d the hubble servicing mission partly on the grounds that shuttle astronauts would not be able to reach the iss as haven in case the shuttle was unable to return to earth the decision was put under review by the new administrator michael griffi n and on october 31 2006 he announced that the hubble mission would be undertaken in 2008 the servicing would extend the life of the telescope through 2013 to d eal with emergencies nasa planned to prepare launch on need mission with second shuttle ready to launch on rescue mission if the first was found defec tive during the servicing mission the launch was in final stages of prep aration when major data handling unit already in place in the hubble telescope failed in late september 2008 backup unit in the telescope was activated but the service mission was revised to include carrying second data handling unit which had been stored on earth to replace the failed one nasa determined that asse ssing and preparing the second unit for installation and service would delay the mission til may or june of 2009 the shuttles future nasa attempted unsuccessfully for many years to develop second generation reusable launch vehicle r lv to replace the shuttle in 2002 nasa indicated the shuttle would c ontinue flying until at least 2015 and perhaps 2020 or beyond the columbia tragedy and president bushs 2004 vision for space exploration to return astrona uts to the moon by 2020 and someday send them to mars forced nas to revise that plan the presidents vision calls for the shuttle program which absorbs approximately 25 of nasa s annual budget to be ter minated in 2010 primary motivation is to make that funding ava ilable to implement other aspects of the vision although there also is concern bout shu ttle safety congress has been debating the vision including its impact on the shuttle and on us human access to space some members wanted to terminat the shuttle earlier than 2010 because they feel it is too risky andor that the f unds should be spent on accelerating the vision others want to retain the shuttle at leas t until new spacecraft the crew exploration vehicle cev is available to take astronauts to and from the iss the cev is now planned for 2015 at the earliest leavin g multiyear gap during which us astronauts would have to rely on russia for access to the iss the 2008 nasa authorization act p l 110422 included provision requiring nasa to terminate or suspend any activity of the agency that if continued between the date of enactme nt of this act and april 30 2009 would preclude the continued safe nd effective flight of the sp ace shuttle after fiscal year 2010 if the president inaugurated on january 20 2009 were to make determination to delay the space shuttles sc heduled retirement sec 611d shuttle budget funding for the shuttle for fy2008 was 3981 billion for fy2009 nasa requested 2982 billion for the shu ttle but that am ount reflects nasas new system for funding program overhead costs which created new crossagency support account by th new accounting system the comparable

and issues for congress by daniel morgan and carl behrens issues for congress in passing the 2005 nasa authorizati on act pl 109105 congress basically agreed with the presidents plan for dir ecting nasas attention to return to the moon and manned missions to mars include d in the moonmars vision is the plan to end flights of the space shuttle in 2010 and restriction of us experiments on the iss mostly to those that forwar d the goal moonmars goal number of critical questions remain however adequacy of funding is the ch ief question raised about nasas activities in presenting the moonmars vision the president did not request significantly increased money for nasa despite chronic indications that the missions it was already charged with were underfunded nasa has responded to the new mission by cutting back funding for its other activities primarily in sc ientific research and aeronautics although discoverys return to flight mission of july 2006 was success the ability of the shuttle fleet to carry out enough flights to complete construction of th iss by 2010 is still in question with history of more than hundred successful missions it might be assumed that another 15 or so would be considered more or less routine but instead each launch is still major and risky event the great complexity of the vehicle and the extreme environment in which it operates require constant attention to possible accidents and malfunctions many of wh ich must be addresse d on an ad hoc basis the future role of the iss is also unclear assuming that enough shuttle flights are made to carry out core completion of the station by 2010 it is not clear what will be done with the iss after that in particular there will be gap of several years between retirement of the shuttle in 2010 and beginning of flight of the crew exploration vehicle to be designed for the re turn to the moon but able to serve as vehicle to reach the iss
