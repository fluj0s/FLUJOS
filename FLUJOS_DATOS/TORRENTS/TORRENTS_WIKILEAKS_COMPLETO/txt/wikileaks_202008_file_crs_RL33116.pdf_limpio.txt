participation in employersponsored retirement plans from nationally representative sample of american households congressional re search service analysis showed that between 1998 and 2003 the percentage of privatesector workers whose employer sponsored re tirement plan increased from 620 to 648 the percentage of privatesector workers who participated inemployersponsored retirement pl ans increased from 431 in 1998 to 468 in 2003 564 of workers in the private sect or worked for an employer that sponsored defined contribution pl an dc such as 401k plan in 2003 an increase of 41 percentage points over the sponsorship rate in 1998 410 percent of privatesector workers participated in 401ktypeplans in 2003 an increase of 56 percentage points over the participation rate in 1998 among workers whose employers offered dc plan in 2003 726 participated in the plan an in crease of 49 percentage points over 1998 the variables with the strongest positive relationship to the likeli hood of participating in plan are length of serv ice with an employer and monthly earnings among workers whose employer sponsored plan men those over age 35 married workers college graduates fulltime workers home owners those at small establishments and those whos employer contributed to the plan were more likely than others to have participated in fined contribution plan neither the workers race nor the presence of children in the family had statistically significant relationship to employee participation many workers who did not participate in defined contribution plans belie ved that they were ineligib to participate in 2003 28 of respondents said that they had not worked for their current employer long enough to be eligible 29 sa id that they did not work enough hours to be eligible and 9 said that their par ticular job was not covered by the employers plan hr 1508 and hr 1960 of the 109th congress would promote automatic enrollment in 2003 the median employee monthly salary deferral into 401ktype plans was 158 or 1896 on an annual basis eigh tyfive percent of employees deferred less than 500 per month into these plan s in 2003 only 3 of participants contributed 1000 per month to defined contri bution plans equivalent to the annual maximum of 12000 in effect during 2003 am ong all privatesector workers who participated in defined contribution pl ans in 2003 the mean

of income and program participation the census bureau collects information on participation in employersponsored retirement plans through its sipp the house holds selected to participate in the sipp are nationally representa tive sample of the civilia n noninstitutionalized population of the united states the sipp is longitudinal survey meaning that it measures changes in the economic and demographic characteristics of individuals and households over time househol ds participating in the 2001 panel of the survey were interviewed once every four months over period of three years at each interview respondents were asked to provide informa tion covering the four months since the previous interview this fourmonth span is called the reference period for the interview while it was designed as longitudinal survey data from the sipp also can be used to study characteristics of the population at point in time crosssectional analysis by looking at the information from any particular four month reference period periodically speci topical modules are included in the survey to ask questions about specific s ubjects topical module 7 fielded in 1998 and again in 2003 asked questions about workers participation in employer sponsored retirement planshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33116crs2 the sipp is an important source of in formation about the demographic and economic status of american households the large sample size of the sipp allows it to be used to analyze the demographic and economic characteristics of various sub populations of interest to policy makers the 2001 pa nel of the sipp began with 35000 households the seventh wave of th 2001 panel of the sipp on which the analysis in this report is based included more than 29000 households by collecting data on labor for ce participation sources of income and pa rticipation in federal and state programs the sipp pr ovides wealth of information about government programs and their effects on the economic situations of families and individuals two kinds of retirement plans defined benefit and defined contribution employersponsored retirement plans ar legally classified as either defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans in defined benefit db plan the employer makes commitment to prefund the workers retirement benefit the value of the benefit is usually based on the employees salary and number of years of service with each year of service worker accrues benefit equal to either fixed dollar amount per month or year of service or percentage of his or her final pay or careeraverage pay defined contribution dc plans such as those authorized under 401k of the internal revenue code are much like savings accounts maintained by the employer on behalf of each participating employee in 401k plan the employee defers receipt of current income to deposit it on pretax basis into retirement account in many 401k plans the employer also contributes to the plan and the amount of the employers contribution often depends on the amount the employee contributes to the plan when the worker retires the retirement benefit that he or she receives is the balance in the account which is the sum of all the contributions that have been made plus inte rest dividends and capital gains or losses the worker sometimes has the option to ta ke the accrued benefit in th form of an annuity series of fixed payments for the rest of his or her life but most departing workers choose to receive lumpsum distribution from the plan in recent years many employers have c onverted their traditional defined benefit pensions to hybrid plans that have characteristics of both db and dc plans the most popular of these hybrids has been the cash balance plan cash balance plan looks like dc plan in that the accrued benefit is defined in terms of an account balance the employer makes contributions to the plan and pays interest on the accumulated balance however in cas h balance plan the account balances are merely bookkeeping devices they are not individual accounts that are owned by the participants because the employer is co mmitted to paying bene fit that is less than the sum of all contributions plus interest cash balance plans are legally classified as defined benefit planshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33116crs3 1 according to the department of labor 97 of privatesector empl oyees whose employers offered db plan in march 2005 were enrolled in the plan in contrast the participation rate among workers whose employer offered defined contribution plan was 78 see national compensation survey employee benefits in private industry in the united states mar 2005 us department of bor bureau of labor statistics summary 0501 aug 2005 2 workers in the public sector usually are re quired to contribute to their defined benefit pension plan but privatesector db plans typically are funded exclusively by the employerparticipation in employersponsored retirement plans all types between 1998 and 2003 the percentage of privatesector wage and salary workers whose employers sponsored retirement plan of any kind increased from 620 to 648 table 1 the percentage of privatesector wage and salary workers who participated in employersponsored reti rement plans increased from 431 in 1998 to 468 in 2003 in table 1 workers are shown as having been included in retirement plan if they repor ted on the sipp that they participated in either defined bene fit pension plan or defined c ontribution plan such as those authorized under 401k and 403b of the in ternal revenue code in most defined contribution plans workers must elect to pa rticipate in defined benefit plans all eligible workers usually are included in the plan1 they do not have to enroll in the plan or contribute

and 2003 the percentage of workers whose employer sponsored retirement plan increased at establishments of all sizes but workers at small and medium business establishmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33116crs4 3 the takeup rate is the percentage of workers participating in plan divided by the percentage offered plan among parttime workers in 2003 the takeup rate was 321560573 while among fulltime workers the takeup rate in 2003 was 531685775 4 see us department of labor bureau of labor statistics national compensation survey employee benefits in private industry in the united states mar 2005 summary 0501 aug 2005were less likely than those at large establishments to work for an employer that sponsored retirement plan consequently workers at establishments with fewer than 25 employees were less than half as likely as workers at establishments with 100 or more employees to have participated in an employersponsored retirement plan in 1998 or 2003 while 640 of workers at establishments with more than 100 employees participated in an employe rsponsored retirement plan in 2003 just 456 of workers at establishments with 25 to 99 employees and only 308 of workers at establishments with fewer than 25 employees participated in retirement plans workers employed on parttime basis were less likely than those employed full time to work for an employer that sponsored retirement plan or to have participated in plan if it was offered in 2003 560 of parttime workers were employed at establishments that offered retirem ent plan compared to 685 of fulltime workers and onl 321 of parttime workers participated in employersponsored retirement plans that year compared to 531 of fulltime workers thus the take up rate among parttime workers offered retirement plan was 573 compared to 775 among fulltime workers3 participation in defined contribution plans the data displayed in table 1 show the percentage of workers participating in employersponsored retirement plans of an kind whether define d benefit defined contribution or both types of plan the number of defined benefit plans has been declining for the past 20 years defi ned contribution plans are now the most common form of employersponsored re tirement plan in the united states according to recent statistics from the department of labors national compensation survey 53 of workers in the private sector worked for employers that offered defined contri butions plan in march 2005 while just 22 worked for employers that offered defined benefit plans4 because participation in defined contribution plans usually requires the employ ee to elect to defer some of his or her salary into the plan participation rates in dc plans depend on both the percentage of employers who offer plan and the percenta ge of employees who elect to contribute policymakers who wish to adopt public po licies that will max imize participation rates in these plans must therefor understand how employees who elect to participate differ from those w ho do not elect to participate participation in defined c ontribution plan s in 1998 and 2003 shown in table 2 is the percentage of privatesector workers whose employer sponsored defined contribution plan along with two measures of partic ipation in defined contribution plans the first column for each year shows the percentage of workers whose employer offered dc plan in 1998 and 2003 and the second column shows the percentage of workers who were dc plan participants in those years the participation rate in the second column of table 2 thus takes into account bothhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33116crs5 5 not all workers whose employer offers plan are eligible to participate federal law allows employers to exclude workers who have completed less than one year of service or who work fewer than 1000 hours during the year 6 in relatively small percentage of plans the employer contributes regardless of whether the employee defers some of his or her pay into the plan even in these plans however the employer contribution is typically greater if the employee also chooses to contributeworkers who were offered plan and did not participate and workers who could not participate because they were not offered plan5 overall 564 of workers in the private sector worked for an employer that sponsored defined contribution plan in 2003 an increase of 41 percentage points ove r the sponsorship rate in 1998 forty one percent of privatesector wage and sa lary workers participated in dc plans in 2003 an increase of 56 percentage points ove r the participation rate in 1998 the third column for each year in table 2 shows the participation rate in dc plans among workers whose employer offered plan this is sometimes called the takeup rate among workers whose employers offered dc plan in 2003 726 participated in the plan an increase of 49 percentage points over the 677 ta keup rate in 1998 table 2 shows rates of defined contribution plan sponsor ship and participation categorized by several employee and employer characteristics in both years workers with less education lower monthly earni ngs and those who worked at small establishments were substantially less likely than other workers to have worked for an employer that sponsored defined contribution retirement plan in 2003 for example while 701 of workers with co llege degree worked for an employer that sponsored defined contribution retirement plan just 47 of hi gh school graduates worked for an employer that sponsored dc plan plan sponsorship also is strongly correlated with workers earnings while 697 of workers with monthly earnings of 2000 or more worked for an employer that sponsored defined contribution retirement plan only 403 of workers with earnings under 2000 worked for an employer that sponsored dc plan similarly workers at small and medium business establishments were less likely than those at large establishments to work for an employer that sponsored define d contribution retirement plan in 2003 in 2003 738 of workers at establishments w ith more than 100 employees worked for employers who sponsored defined contribu tion plans but just 576 of workers at establishments with 25 to 99 employees nd 386 of workers at establishments with fewer than 25 employees worked for em ployers that sponsored such plans participation rates in fined contribution plans usually depend not only on the percentage of employees who worked for em ployers that sponsor plans but also on the proportion of eligible employees who elect to defer some of their salary into the plan6 takeup rates in defined contribu tion plans in 1998 and 2003 varied by number of employee and employer charact eristics workers under age 35 african american workers women unmarried worker s those without college degree those with monthly earnings under 2000 renters parttime workers and those who worked at establishments with fewer than 100 employees all had relatively low take up rates also workers whose employer di d not contribute to the plan had takeup rate of 62 compared to 75 among work ers whose employer contributed to the plan this is not shown in table 2 because comparable data are not available for 1998httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33116crs6 table 2 participation in defined contribution plans

been adjusted to 2003 dollars data represent 931 million workers and 330 million defined contribution plan participants in 1998 an d 977 millio n workers and 401 millio n defined contribution plan participants in 2003httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33116crs7 statistical analysis of participation rates the takeup rates shown in table 2 illustrate how participation rates vary according to the economic and demographic tr aits of workers nevertheless these simple descriptive statistics have an important shortcoming in that they show the relationship between participation and only one other variable at time whether worker participates in defined contribu tion plan is affected by many variables simultaneously for example workers with less education and those with lower monthly earnings have lower takeup rates than workers with college degree and those with aboveaverage earnings howeve r workers with less education also are likely to have lower earnings which of these two variables has the stronger statistical relationship to plan participation one way to answer this question is to study how participation ra tes vary among workers w ho have the same level of education but different monthl earnings and then to examine how participation rates vary among workers who have the same monthly earnings but different levels of education such an analysis can be c onducted by employing statistical technique called multivariate regression analysis to study the relationship between worker participation in defined contribution plans and set of variables describi ng employee economic and demographic characteristics the congressional research service crs developed regression model in which the dependent response variable coul d have two possible values 1 true if an employee whose employer s ponsored defined contribution plan participated in the plan and 2 false if the worker did not participate the independent variables crs tested were the workers age race sex marital status level of education presence of one or more children in the family home ownership parttime or fulltime employment monthly earnings establishment size length of service with current employer and whether the employer contributed to the plan the model included only workers who repor ted that their employer sponsored defined contribution plan for some or all of its employees full results of the model are shown in table a11 in appendix i our analysis found that the variables with the strongest statistical relationship to the likelihood of participa ting in defined contributi on plan were the employees length of service with their employer and their monthly earnings other statistically significant variables were the individuals age sex marital status level of education home ownership usual number of hours work ed monthly earnings establishment size and whether the employer contributed to the plan after controlling for these characteristics neither the workers race nor the presence of children in the family had statistically significant relationship to employee participation in dc plan in other words all else being equal there was difference in the probability of participating in dc plan according to race or presence of children in the family given that the worker was employed at an establishment that sponsored plan in the regression model workers were grouped into three categories with respect to their length of service with their current employer 1 less than two years 2 two to five years and 3 more than five years among all workers whose employer sponsored defined contribution plan those who had been with their current employer for two to five years were 131 more likely to have participated in defined contribution plan th an employees with less than two years of servicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33116crs8 7 due to limitations of the data this variable did not distinguish between employer matching contributions and employer c ontributions that were made regardless of whether the employee contributed to the planworkers who had been with their current employer for more than five years were 363 ie nearly four times more likely to have participated in dc plan than workers with less than two years of service with their current employer crs grouped respondents reported monthly earnings in 2003 into four categories under 2000 2000 to 2999 3000 to 4999 and more than 5000 relative to workers with monthly earni ngs of less than 2000 t hose who had earnings from 2000 to 2999 were 68 more lik ely to have participated in dc plan given that their employer sponsor ed plan those with earnings between 3000 and 4999 were 146 more likely to have participated in dc plan than workers with monthly earnings under 2000 workers with monthly earnings of more than 5000 were 217 more likely to have participated in dc plan than workers with monthly earnings under 2000 crs grouped the workers ages into four categories under 35 35 to 44 45 to 54 and 55 or older relative to recipi ents under age 35 workers age 35 to 44 and those age 45 to 54 were 37 and 44 more likely respectively than those under 35 to have participated in defined contribution plan give n that they worked for an employer that sponsored pl an recipients age 55 and older were 24 more likely than those under 35 to have participated in dc plan given that one was offered crs classified workers into three gr oups designating their highest year of education up to 12 years of school one to three years of college and four or more years of college having completed college was significantly and positively related to the probability that the worker participated in defined contribution plan other things being equal college graduates were 51 more likely than those with just high school education to have participated in defined contribution plan relative to those with high school education or less workers with one to three years of college were neither more nor less likely to have participated in dc plan given that they worked for an employer that offered plan home ownership and being married were positively and significantly related to the probability that worker participated in defined contribution plan offered by his or her employer homeowners were 29 more likely to have participated in defined contribution plan than renters othe r things being equal married individuals were 39 more likely than unmarried pers ons to have particip ated in defined contribution retirement plan working parttime was negatively related to the likelihood of participa ting in defined contribution pl an given that one was offered parttime workers were 38 less likely to have participated in dc plan than full time workers all else being equal an employer contribution also was significant variable other things being equal work ers whose employer c ontributed to the plan were 95 more likely to have participat ed than workers whose employer made contribution7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33116crs9 8 workers can be excluded from participating in plan if they have been with an employer for less than 12 months or if they work less than 1000 hours in yearon the sipp business establishments are classified into three sizes based on the number of employees those with fewer then 25 employees those with 25 to 99 employees and those with 100 or more employees compared to workers at establishments with fewer than 25 employ ees those who worked at establishments with 25 to 99 employees were 17 less likely to have participated in dc plan the coefficient for the variable indicating an establishment w ith 100 or more workers was not statistically significant reasons for not participating employee participation in fined contribution plans is voluntary even in plans that adopt automatic enrollment plan s ponsors must allow em ployees the opportunity to opt out of the plan raising partic ipation rates requires that policymakers understand the reasons that roughly quarter of employees at firm s that sponsor these plans do not participate in them the si pp included series of questions in both 1998 and 2003 that asked workers whose empl oyer sponsored defined contribution plan but who did not participate why they were not participa ting respondents were allowed to give more than one reason for not participating in the plan results of the surveys from 1998 and 2003 are shown in figure 1 in both 1998 and 2003 most workers whose employer sponsored dc pl an but who were not plan participants said that the reason they did not participate was they believed they were not eligible in 2003 for example 28 of respondents re ported that they did not participate because they had not worked for their curre nt employer long enough to be eligible twentynine percent of respondents replie d they did not work enough hours to be eligible to participate and 9 of re spondents said their particular job was not covered by the employers plan it is cl ear from these responses that substantial proportion of workers who do not participat in defined contribution plans believe they are not eligible to participate close examination of workers responses to other questions about their jobs indicates that some may hold the mistaken belief they are not eligible to participate in their employers defined contribution pl ans for example 24 of workers who said they had not worked long enough to be eligible to participate in the plan also reported they had worked for that employer for more than two years similarly 35 of those who said they did not work enoug h hours to be eligible for their employers plan reported they worked fulltime and 41 reported they always worked 35 or more hours per week8 it appears from these respons some workers believe they are ineligible to participate in their employers dc plan may be misinformed and could participate if they better understood the rules governing plan eligibility in addition to those who do not participate because they believe that they are ineligible substantial numbers of eligible employees do not participate in employer sponsored defined contribution plans becau they believe they cannot afford to forego current income to contribute to the plan in 2003 19 of nonparticipating workers said they could not afford to cont ribute to the plan and 11 said they did not participate because they didnt want to tie up their money while the reduction inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33116crs10 takehome pay that would result from immediate salary deferrals may present hardship to some workers there are stra tegies employers can adopt that would make contributing to retirement plan relatively painless for their employees some employers for example allow employees to commit portion of their future pay raises to the retirement plan this allows the worker to begin contributing to the plan without experiencing reduction in take home pay likewise workers who do not contribute because they are reluctant to put money into plan until retirement can sometimes be persuaded to participate if the plan allows participant loans or hardship withdrawals in either case educating em ployees about the options available to plan participants and about the im portance of saving for retir ement are key strategies to boosting plan participation source crs analysis of the

patrick purcellautomatic enrollment in defined contribution plans in defined benefit plans participation is determined mainly by whether the employer offers plan generally all eligible employees accrue benefits in db plan without having to enroll or to contribut to the plan from their pay participation in defined contribution plans depends on both employer sponsorship rates and the rate at which eligible employees elect to participate in the plan sometimes called the takeup rate the employee contri bution required in many dc plans is one reason that participation is voluntary and that employees must elect to participate in these plans although some plan sponsor s automatically enroll eligible employees into their defined contribution plans this is still relatively uncommon practice according to the profit sharing401k council of america 84 of dc plans surveyed had automatic enrollment in 2003 automatic enrollment was most common in large plans 242 and l east common in small plans 1111 contributory dc plans requi re decisions about both the amount of salary to be deferred into the plan and how these salary deferrals will be invested many employers are reluctant to make these decisions for employees who have not elected to participate in part this reluctance is due to the possibility that the employer might be held liable in the event that the default investment choices made by the employer result in financial losses to the employee in some cases another obstacle to automatic enrollment has been state laws that prohibit deductions from employee pay other than payroll taxes that have not been specifically authorized by the employee12 irs rulings on automatic enrollment employers who sponsor 401k plans ofte n promote participation in the plan among their employees by providing them with information on the importance of saving for retirement and the tax savings that result from participating another way to achieve high rates of plan participation is to enroll employees automatically rather than the default option being that the employee will not be included in the plan unless he or she actively enrolls th default under automatic enrollment is that some of the employees pay will be deduc ted and directed into retirement account unless he or she instructs the employer not to do so the irs has issued several rulings in recent years to clarify for employers that they are per mitted to enroll employees in 401k and 403b plans au tomatically throug h payroll deduction provided that the employee is notified in advance and has the option to drop out of the plan unless the employee elects otherwise he or she is presumed to be participating and an amount set by the empl oyer such as 3 of pay is deducted from the employees pretax pay and contributed to the plan in 1998 the internal revenue service i rs issued ruling clarifying that automatic enrollment in 401k plans is permissible for newly hired employees revenue ruling 9830 the irs issued second ruling in 2000 stating thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33116crs17 13 revenue ruling 200035 states that automatic enrollment is permitted in 403b plans for employees of educational and charitable or ganizations revenue ruling 200033 states that automatic enrollment is permitted in 457b plan s for state and local government employees announcement 2 00060 states that automatic enrollm ent is permitted in irsapproved prototype 401k plans standardized plans used largely by small businesses 14 the internal revenue code prohibits re tirement plans from discriminating in favor of highlycompensated employees nondiscriminati on testing can be avoided if the plan makes minimum contributions for all employees th contributions provide safe harbor from the nondiscrimination testing to which th plan would otherwise be subjectautomatic enrollment also is permissible for current employees who have not already enrolled in the plan revenue ruling 2000813 in 2004 the irs published general information letter in response to public inquiry that clarified two previously ambiguous point s the letter stated that 1 the amount deducted from the employees pay and contributed to the plan can be any amount that is permissible under the plan up to the annual contri bution limits under irc 402g and 2 the plan can automatically increase the employees contribution over time such as after each pay raise again the irs emphasized that employees must be fully informed of these plan provisions and they must have the option to change the amount of their contribution or to stop contributing to the plan altogether legislation in the 109th congress hr 1508 emanuel and hr 1960 tman both would amend 401k and 403b of the internal revenue code to encourage employers to automatically enroll eligible employees in retirement savings plans under both bills employees could choose to optout of automatic enro llment hr 1508 would apply automatic enrollment to all eligible employees while hr 1960 would enroll automatically employees who are newly eligible af ter enactment of the legislation both hr 1508 and hr 1960 would exempt plans that adopt approved automatic enrollment procedures from nondiscrimination sting and would provide protection under erisa 404c for the default inves tments under automatic enrollment plans thus relieving employers of fiduciary liability for investment losses that might result from those investments14 hr 1508 would require employers who use the matching contribution safe harbor to adopt automatic enrollment in their 401k plans hr 1960 would not requi re any employers to adopt automatic enrollment under hr 1508 the minimum contribution percentage by eligible employees would be 3 for the first plan year with increases in automatic contributions of either 1 or 2 for each subsequent year up to maximum 9 for any plan year under hr 1960 contributions would have to be gin at 3 of compensation and increase 1 each year until reaching 8 both bills would permit distributions of contributions with some restrictions to employees who retroactively elect to opt out after having been enrolled automatically in the plan both bills would

observing the dependent variable having value of 1 yes when pa rticular independent variable is changed given that every other independent variable is held constant at its mean value the model estimates coefficient also called parameter estimate for each independent variable and calculates the standard error of the estimate the standard error measures how widely the coefficients are likely to vary from one observation to another in general the greater the absolute value of the parameter estimate the more likely it is to be statistically significant statistical significance is expressed in confidence intervals that are measured at the 10 level 05 level and 01 level if variable is significant at the 05 confidence level for example there is only oneintwenty chance that it is not related to the depende nt variable in the way that the model has predicted the model also generates for each independent variable statistic called the odds ratio the odds ratio is measure of how much more or less likely it is for specific outcome to be observed when pa rticular independent variable is true x1 than it is when that independent variable is false x0 for example in this model marital status is measured as having value of 1 if the worker was married and 0 otherwise in table ai1 this variable is shown as having an odds ratio of 139 this means that the dependent variab was 39 more

questions do not distinguish between defi ned benefit and defined contribution plansappendix ii comparison of the sipp and the cps the data analyzed in this report derived from the census bureaus survey of income and program participation indicate that both the percentage of workers whose employer sponsored retirement plan and the percentage of workers participating in employersponsored re

percentages fell between 1998 and 2003 see table aii1 according to data from the sipp 635 of civilian nonagricultura l wage and salary workers age 18 and older worked for employers that offered

oyerspons ored retirement plans in 1998 and 2003 is not unusual surveys can produce different results for variety of reasons results may differ for example if either survey sample is not truly representative of the population this is called sampling error results also may differ if the surveys ask substantially different questions or if errors occur during the process of editing the data this is called nonsampling erro r while it is not unusual that the point estimates of retirement plan sponsorship nd participation in 1998 and 2003 differ between the cps and the sipp it is troubling for policy analysts that the two surveys show the trends in sponsorship and participat ion moving in opposite directions between these two years both the sipp and the cps are surveys of households conducted by the census bureau and both surveys ask questions about retirement plan sponsorship and participation the sipp asks far more questions than the cps but the first two questions on the sipp on which the data in table aii1 are based are very similar to the two questions on the cps the ques tions asked by the two surveys appear to be similar enough that relativ ely little of the difference in the point estimates in any given year could be attributed to differe nces in the questions that were asked the first two retirement plan questions on the sipp are1 now id like to ask about retirement plans offered on this job not social security but plans that are sponsored by your em ployer this includes regular pension plans as well as other kinds of retirement plans like thrift and savings plans 401k or 403b plans and deferred profitsharing and stock plans does your employer have any kind of pens ion or retirement plan for anyone in your company or organization 1 yes 2 2 are you included in such plan 1 yes 2 the two retirement plan questions on the cps are1 other than social security did the emplo yer that name worked for last year have pension or other type of retirement plan for any of the employees 1 yes 2 nohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33116crs23 17 in both surveys the changes in the estimated percentages of workers whose employer offered retirement plan and in the percenta ge of workers participating in those plans between 1998 and 2003 were statistically significan t ie the changes were greater than the standard error of the point estimates produced by the two surveys2 was name included in that plan 1 yes 2 another way that surveys can differ is in the period of time covered by the questions they ask this is called the refe rence period of the survey one reason that the point estimates of retirement plan sponsor ship and participation in any given year differ between the sipp and the cps is that the reference periods for the questions differ between the two surveys the re ference period for the pensionrelated questions on the sipp is the month preceding the interview date the retirement module of the 2001 panel of the sipp was fi elded between february and may of 2003 with roughly one fourth of the sample being interviewed each month and so the reference period for about onequarter of the survey respondents was for the job they held on the last day of january 2003 th reference periods for the other three quarters of the sampler were the months of february march and april respectively in contrast the annual soci and economic supplement to the cps which includes two questions about retirement plan spons orship and particip ation is fielded each year during march and it refers to the long est job held by the respondent during the previous calendar year thus the refere nce periods for the sipp and the cps differ substantially enough that one could reasona bly expect that they might yield results that differ by several percentage points fo r any given year however while questions that refer to retirement plan sponsorship nd participation in the longest job held in the previous calendar year might produce diffe rent results than questions that refer to the job held on the last day of the pr evious month the diffe ring reference periods do not necessarily explain why the trends in coverage measured by the two surveys moved in opposite direc tions between 1998 and 200317 both the sipp and the cps are surveys of sample of households that are intended to be representative of the ci vilian noninstitutional re sident population of the united states however neither surv ey is based on simple random sample of the population in order to allow analysts to study the economic and demographic characteristics of specific subpopulations such as lowincome households and minority households both the sipp and th cps use complex sample designs that oversample some geographics areas house holds and individuals are then assigned weights that when summed add up to th actual number of households and persons in the united states the sample selection and sample weighting processes could introduce errors into one or both surveys that would result in differences in the population measures derived from each not all of the households that are selected to participate in survey do so and not all survey participants provide complete and consistent answers to all of the survey questions in many instances in which particular question is not answered called item nonresponse sta tistical methods are used to impute response to thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33116crs24 question these imputation methods use st atistical models to predict likely responses to specific questions based on actual responses provided by survey participants that are similar to the nonres ponding participant in certain key respects differences in imputation methods or erro rs in implementing the imputations could produce differences in results between two surveys in conclusion there are number of reasons why the results of household surveys might differ these reasons include the phrasing of questions the reference period of the questions the sample selection process sample weighting and the imputation methods used for item nonrespons among others in the case of the cps and sipp pensionrelated questions neither the differences in the phrasing of the questions nor in the reference periods for the questions appear to be the likely source of the opposite trends that the two surveys show in retirement plan sponsorship and particip ation between 1998 and 2003 crs asked number of economists and pub lic policy analysts who have worked with the cps and the sipp what they thought were the most likely causes of the different trends in retirement plan sponsor ship and participation shown by the two surveys between 1998 and 2003 none of these experts were able to offer definitive explanation for the differen ces but several pointed to the sample weighting and imputation processes as likely causes b ecause the sampleweighting process and the imputation methods employed in both the cps and the sipp are under the control of the census bureau it may be possible for census to coordina these procedures more closely between the two surveys and thereby provide more consistent results between the two surveys in the future
