region8 in september 2008 the argentine government maintained that inflation over the past 12 months amounted to 87 while private economists forecast rate of about 20 for 2008 down from previously estimated 25 because of decline in commodity prices and falling demand for argentine exports9 during visit to new york in late september 2008 president fernández assert ed that inflation was not

argentinas relations with the international monetary fund imf were c ontentious in 2003 after months of tough negotiations argentina reached threeyear standby agreement that provided credit line of about 125 billion although imf accords are not normally politically popular the accord was widely praised in ar gentina as an agreement with realistic fiscal targets that would enable argentina to deal with such issues as employment and social equity argentina suspende d its imf loan program in 2004 because of imf pressure to complete debt negotiations with bondholders and adopt supporting economic reforms in january 2006 arge ntina ultimately chose to repay its 95 billion debt owed to the imf rather than accede to imf policy directives while the move was politically popular in argentina some critics argue that it might have been fiscally imprudent given the alternatives of paying down more expensive debt or spending it on alternative needs such as infrastructure or social spending in early september 2008 the fernández government announced that argentina would repay its defaulted 67 billion owed to paris club countries in one lump sum using its foreign reserves rather than renegotiating refinancing package which normally requires imf monitoring but the global financial crisis appears to have scuttled these plans rather than paying back its defaulted paris club debt all at once which would deplete the countrys 47 billion in foreign reserves the government was reportedly looking to pay it back in installments until 202511 in addition to the us government argentin

next three years19 the argentine stock market reacted swiftly to the governments nationalization proposal with almost 30 drop over two days the pension nationalization proposal needs to be pproved by congress and the fernández government has asked for it to be comple ted by the end of n ovember opponents in argentinas congress reportedly would suppor t the nationalization if the government guaranteed that the assets would only be spent on retirees and not used for other purposes energy crisis president fernándezs administration wa s hard hit early on with significant power outages that left areas of buenos ai res without power for three days in january 2008 the outages are the legacy of the previous kirchner governments policy of imposing price caps on electricity prices which in turn created disincentive for investment in electricity production wh ile the price caps were popular politically they have resulted in degradation of the electricity network at time when demand has been increasing because of the boo ming economy in mid2008 the fernández government began taking more significant measures needed to improve the nations electricity capacity over the longterm in late july the government announced that it would raise electricity and natural gas distribution tariffs on residential users although poorer households would be exempt the low rates had been disincentive for investment in electricity production and natu ral gas production20 argentina has been net exporter of natural gas for number of years especially to chile but as the argen tine economy started to boom domestic demand for natural gas increased this caused argentina to cut back on its gas exports to chile beginning in 2004 which has increased nsions in bilateral relations at the same time argentina began importing gas from bolivia to satisfy demand in the northern region of the country which is not well supplied by argentinas domestic natural gas transmission network21 for variety of reasons however bolivia has not been able to fulfill its contract to sell gas to argentina as result in 2008 argentina resorted to importing liquified natural gas to fulfill its gas need s the

amount of gas that bolivia currently supplies work on the pipeline has begun however and there is skepticism that it will be built24 farmers strikes and reject ion of export tax increase another crisis that besieged the fernández government early in her administration was farmers strike that began in midmarch 2008 in response to the governments tax increase on the export of soybean and sunflower seed products farmers reacted by setting up some 400 roadblocks around the country for about three weeks and refusing to release much of their production president fernández criticized the farmers for protesting while earning record profits and said she would not yield to any extortion25 the protests led to food shortages in supermarkets and to increased social tensions between supporters and opponents of the governme nt in late march the government offered to make some cessions to the farmers but these were rejected in early april the four principal farmers unions declared 30day truce one casualty of the crisis was argentina s economy minister martin lousteau who resigned in late april because of the protracted conflict with farmers and also reportedly because of his frustration with the governments unwillingness to deal with inflation26 lousteau was succeeded by carlos fernández reported to be staunch ally of former president kirchner in may and june 2008 farm ers conducted series of three more strikes protesting against the export tax until presid ent fernández agreed to send the export tax increase to congress for debate while argentinas lower house of

political defeat for both president fernández and her hus band former president kirchner who thought that they had enjoyed majority of support in both legislative chambers particularly difficult for fe rnández was that vice president julio cobos was the tie breaking vote that defeated the measure the defeat not only demonstrated the strength of argentinas farming sector which received support from the urban middle class but also reflected the independen ce of argentinas congress which had been viewed as rubber stamp for the kirchne rs for some observers the vote was rejection of the governing style of the kirc hners described by some as style based on confrontation and intimid ation of political opponents27 human rights argentina has made significant progress in human rights in recent years the previous kirchner government took steps to be able to bring to justice those responsible for past human rights abuses that occurred under military rule in the late 1970s and early
