industry and trade foreign affairs defense and trade division the ussingapore free trade agreement effects after three years summary the ussingapore free trade agreement fta pl 10878 went into effect on january 1 2004 this report provides an overview of the major trade and economic effects of the fta over the three years ending in 2006 it also includes detailed information on key provisions of the agreement and legislative action the ussingapore fta has provided greater access for us companies has been instrumental in increasing bilateral trade and has provided reassurance to singaporeans of us interest in the country as citystate singapore operates as an entrepot with essentially free trade under the fta concessions dealt mainly with providing greater access for american service providers and with strengthening the business environment in areas such as the protection of intellectual property rights and access to government procurement in 2006 the united states ran 69 billion surplus in its merchandise trade with singapore up from 14 billion in 2003 us exports of goods to singapore surged by 49 from 166 billion in 2003 to 247 billion in 2006 however even with this rapid increase in us exports the us share of singapores imports declined from 16 in 2003 to 13 in 2006 this suggests that factors other than the fta particularly the overall growth in singapores imports contributed greatly to the increase major us exports to singapore include machinery electrical machinery aircraft optical and medical instruments plastic and mineral fuel oil on the us import side noteworthy development is that imports of pharmaceuticals from singapore have risen dramatically from 009 billion in 2003 to 24 billion in 2006 the fta did not lower the us tariff rate for pharmaceuticals since they already enter the united states duty free what appears to have occurred has been the development of singapore as regional center for multinational pharmaceutical companies that are stepping up exports negotiations for the ussingapore free trade agreement were launched under the clinton administration in december 2000 the fta became the fifth such agreement the united states has signed and the first with an asian country according to the us trade representative the fta broke new ground in electronic commerce competition policy and government procurement it also included what the us trade representative considers to be major advances in intellectual property protection environment labor transparency and customs cooperation the ussingapore fta required congressional implementation under expedited trade promotion authority legislative procedures the debate over implementation of the fta fell between business and free trade interests who would benefit from more liberalized trade particularly in services and labor or anti globalization interests who opposed more ftas because of the overall impact of imports on jobs and the general effects of globalization on income distribution certain jobs and the environment specific provisions of the agreement also generated debate this report will be updated as circumstances warrant contents trade in goods 2 trade and market

an overview of the major trade and economic effects of the fta over the three years ending in 2006 it also includes detailed information on key provisions of the agreement and legislative action the ussingapore fta essentially eliminated tariffs on all goods traded between the two countries it also included market access measures and other provisions related to trade in services investment rules of origin intellectual property rights government procurement licensing of professionals telecommunications worker rights the environment capital controls and dispute settlement the fta has provided greater access for us companies has been instrumental in increasing bilateral trade and has provided reassurance to singaporeans of us interest in the country at time when many in the region perceive that the united states has been focused on the middle east and has been neglecting asia this seems to have benefitted overall bilateral relations the fta has provided certain advantages exclusively to american businesses but many of those advantages are being extended to other nations as well the country is aggressively concluding ftas with other countries and regions as citystate singapore operates as an entrepot and shipping center and basically has free trade it imposes import restrictions on only handful of goods under the fta singapores concessions dealt mainly with providing greater access for american service providers particularly financial services and with strengthening the business environment in areas such as the protection of intellectual property rights and access to government procurement in 2006 the united states ran 69 billion surplus in its balance of merchandise trade with singapore up from 14 billion in 2003 us exports of goods to singapore surged by 49 from 166 billion in 2003 to 247 billion in 2006 major us exports to singapore include machinery electrical machinery aircraft optical and medical instruments plastic and mineral fuel oil for details of us exports and imports by sector see table 2 and table 3 us trade with singapore has increased faster than anticipated before the fta however even with this rapid increase in us exports the us share of singapores imports has declined from 16 in 2003 to 13 in 20061 the main reason for this is that singapores overall trade is booming 1 data sources for this introductory overview are provided in later sections of this report crs2 the us balance of trade in services with singapore has declined from 40 billion in 2001 to 38 billion in 2003 and further to 26 billion in 2006 while us receipts of royalties and license fees have risen 3 billion in 2006 us payments for other private services as well as for travel and transportation also have risen us access to the singaporean market through direct investments however seems to have been enhanced considerably under the fta us income from assets in singapore rose from 67 billion in 2003 to 143 billion by 2006 this more than offset the 12 billion decline in the us surplus in services trade with singapore over the same period as an example of us service providers in singapore under the fta citibank has been able to expand its operations there it has 50 of the credit card market offer innovative products such as biometric identification for bill paying and partner with the subway system to issue credit cards that double as subway fare cards and to locate branches and atm terminals in and around subway stations on the us import side noteworthy development is that imports of pharmaceuticals from singapore have risen dramatically from 009 billion in 2003 to 24 billion in 2006 singapore is now the second largest exporter of cardiovascular medicaments to the united states the fta did not lower the us tariff rate for pharmaceuticals since such products already enter the united states duty free what appears to have occurred has been the development of singapore as regional center for multinational pharmaceutical companies this apparently was partly triggered by provisions in the fta that required singapore to strengthen its intellectual property protection the singaporean government also has provided incentives for multinational biomedical companies to locate research and production in the country most of the major pharmaceutical companies of the world have established subsidiaries in singapore and are exporting part of their production singapore has relatively high labor standards it ratified the international labor organizations minimum age convention in 2005 this brought the number of ilo conventions the country has ratified to more than 20 including core conventions that cover child labor forced labor collective bargaining and equal remuneration as city state with 34 million people and an area roughly the size of the washington dc area inside the beltway singapores environmental challenges relate primarily to industrial pollution strictly regulated urbanization and preservation of natural areas the country touts itself as garden city it recycles all waste water appears clean and uses variable tolls to alleviate traffic congestion the united states has not formally raised environmental or labor issues with singapore under the fta for background information see crs report rl31789 the ussingapore free trade agreement by dick k nanto trade in goods since the ussingapore fta came into

underlying trends that do not bode as well for the united states although singapores share of us exports to the world has remained at about 23 to 24 singapores imports from the united states have been declining relative to those from many other countries of the world as shown in table 1 and figure 3 in 2001 the united states accounted for 164 of singapores imports by 2006 that share had fallen to 125 despite the rapid growth in us exports there the share of singapores imports accounted for by malaysia and japan also have fallen while the shares of china taiwan south korea and the rest of the world have risen this implies that singapore is diversifying its imports away from its traditional sources of the united states malaysia and japan and buying relatively more from china taiwan and other countries of the world the united states and malaysia still are singapores largest sources of imports but chinas share is rising crs5 table 1 singapores import market shares percent rank import

talks negotiations were intense over singapores import restrictions on few products even though singapore is largely freetrade nation it has restrictions on imports of specific controlled items including chewing gum and has import duties on beer stout and local beverage called samsu under the fta singapore allowed imports from the united states of chewing gum with crs6 therapeutic value excluding nicotine gum to be sold in pharmacies the country also dropped all duties on beer stout and samsu from the united states under the fta us exports of beer made from malt harmonized system code 2203 rose from 0352 million in 2003 to 0549 million in 2005 and to 0915 million in 2006 as share of singapores total imports of beer however in 2006 the united states accounted for about 05 of the total and ranked 18th among all sources of beer imports the top five sources were malaysia mexico belgium the netherlands and south korea2 among these countries only south korea has free trade agreement with singapore with respect to chewing gum the data on singaporean imports do not show appreciable imports from the united states in 2006 out of total of 1089000 chewing gum imports hs 170410 none came from the united states there was 588000 in chewing gum that came from indonesia and 420000 that came from south korea in 2005 singapore reported that it had imported 1000 in chewing gum from the united states3 trade and market access in services us business interests point out that the greatest potential effect of the us singapore fta is likely to be increased access by us companies to singapores market in services services are provided in two ways in crossborder transactions and from subsidiaries in the trading partners economy services such as insurance shipping provision of intellectual property and travel often are sold across borders and are counted as exports and imports other services such as accounting legal services and banking often are provided directly to the consumer through overseas subsidiaries of us companies these transactions usually do not appear as exports or imports although the repatriation of profits from such activity is counted as an income flow the united states has traditionally run surplus in its balance of services trade with singapore this is shown in figure 4 under the fta this balance has declined from 40 billion in 2001 to 38 billion in 2003 and further to 26 billion in 2006 2 data are from global trade atlas 3 data are from global trade atlas crs attempted to obtain export data from major us chewing gum company but it declined to cooperate likewise the international chewing gum association would not provide crs with data on exports to singapore crs7 figure 4 us balance of trade with singapore in services and

source data from us bureau of economic analysis among the four components of trade in services the united states ran surpluses in two and deficits in two in royalties and license fees the us surplus increased from 25 billion in 2001 to 29 billion in 2006 some of this rise in fees for intellectual property likely can be attributed to strengthened intellectual property protection in singapore resulting from the fta in other private services the us surplus has fallen from 19 billion in 2001 to 07 billion in 2006 in military and government transactions the trade balance is small and varies from year to year it was 004 billion in 2001 02 billion in 2002 and 02 billion in 2006 in travel and transportation the balance trends toward an increasingly large us deficit most of this is in transportation particularly shipping as well as in passenger fares and travel this negative balance grew from 03 billion in 2001 to 09 billion in 2006 increased market access in services under an fta therefore may or may not result in an improvement in the us bilateral trade balance in services it depends on what kind of service is being traded and the relative comparative advantage of each country us service providers moreover may find it more advantageous under the increased access and strengthened intellectual property regime engendered by an fta to locate subsidiary in the fta partner country this may reduce us exports of private services but also may increase royalties and payments from use of intellectual property and earnings from operations in the host country in the singapore case us income from assets owned in singapore increased from 39 billion in 2001 to 67 billion in 2003 and after the fta jumped to 143 billion by crs8 20064 this more than offsets the 12 billion decline in the us surplus in services trade with singapore financial services in financial services singapore made several key concessions under the fta in 2007 the government lifted the ban on new licenses for fullservice and wholesale american banks licensed fullservice banks from the united states two as of 2007 are now able to offer all their services at an unlimited number of locations under the first two years of the fta uslicensed fullservice banks were able to operate at up to 30 customer service locations branches or offpremise atms nonus fullservice foreign banks have been allowed to operate at combined 25 locations locally incorporated subsidiaries of us banks are able to apply for access to the local automated teller machine atm network on commercial terms and branches of us banks are to obtain access to the atm network by 20085 citibank in particular has been expanding its presence in singapore from four branches in 2004 it now has eleven fullservice branches and more planned6 it was the first in singapore to introduce biometric payment system that allows payments without credit cards based on fingerprint identification it also has joined with the singapore mrt subway system to provide credit cards that double as subway tickets and to locate atms and branches in and around subway stations7 citibank has 50 share of the singapore credit card market8 as of mid2006 citibank along with the other major foreign banks had created their own atm network9 rather than join that of the local banks american banks are allowed under the fta to enter the domestic atm network if financial considerations warrant such move legal services in general foreigners in singapore cannot practice singapore law without local credentials employ singapore lawyers to practice singapore law or litigate in local courts since june 2004 however us and other foreign lawyers have been allowed to represent parties in arbitration in singapore without the need

be admitted to the singapore bar11 electronic commerce the fta contains stateoftheart provisions on electronic commerce including national treatment and mostfavorednation obligations for products delivered electronically affirmation that services disciplines cover all services delivered electronically and permanent dutyfree status of products delivered electronically intellectual property rights ipr protection the fta provided the impetus for the singapore government to amend its laws to create one of the strongest ipr regimes in asia12 in july 2004 amendments to the trademarks act the patents act the layout designs of integrated circuits act registered designs act new plant varieties protection act and new manufacture of optical discs act came into effect this was followed in 2005 by an amended copyright act and broadcasting act singapore also has implemented or ratified various international conventions or treaties dealing with iprs singaporean officials have indicated that

2005 one of the strongest increases in the value added of overseas affiliates of us multinational corporations was in manufacturing operations in singapore the attractiveness of the country as manufacturing base for the asiapacific region was heightened by the enactment of the united statessingapore free trade agreement which facilitates the shipment of inputs to production from the united states in 2005 us affiliates in singapore accounted for 15 of singapores gdp up from 132 in 2004 and second only to the share in gdp of us affiliates in ireland 185 in 2005 us nonbank affiliates in singapore employed 123600 persons held assets of 1507 billion had sales of 1627 billion and generated net income of 187 billion this net income in singapore exceed that by us nonbank affiliates in japan 150 billion australia 130 billion or china 79 billion for the same year15 us imports from singapore just as us exports to singapore have increased since the ussingapore fta came into effect in 2004 so also have us imports overall us imports from singapore rose by 09 from 2001 to 2003 and by 156 from 2004 to 2006 not adjusted for inflation this however was considerably below the growth of all us imports of 102 over the first period and 26 since the fta came into effect by sector however the growth rates for imports vary considerably figure 5 shows the growth rates for the three years prior to and for the three years after the fta was implemented for the top 29 products by 2digit harmonized system code imported from singapore in 2006 the value of these products ranged from low of

apparel from singapore have not increased significantly over the 20042006 period imports of woven apparel fell the most significant gains have been in us imports of pharmaceuticals from singapore imports of such products jumped from 009 billion in 2003 to 24 billion in 2006 over the first nine months of 2007 imports of pharmaceuticals from singapore had reached 22 billion an increase of 264 over the corresponding period in 2006 the vast majority 98 of these imports were cardiovascular medicaments hs 3004909120 the market for drugs in the united states in 2006 was 174 billion so imports from singapore accounted for about 13 of the us market singapore is now the second largest source of imports into the united states of cardiovascular medicaments ireland is the largest with 33 of such us imports in 2006 it is followed by singapore with 21 sweden with 12 and france with 10 in 2004 singapore accounted for 1 of such imports while ireland accounted for 59 imports of cardiovascular medicaments from ireland have held steady from 2004 at about 37 billion whereas those from singapore sweden and france have grown rapidly16 16 global trade atlas crs12 the increase in imports of pharmaceuticals from singapore cannot be attributed to reduction in us tariffs under the fta pharmaceuticals already enter the united states duty free rather what appears to have occurred is the development of singapore as regional center for multinational pharmaceutical companies both for manufacturing and for research and development two major factors have contributed to this the first is the strengthening of intellectual property protection and new or revised laws in singapore the second is the development of biomedical industrial park tuas medical park for pharmaceutical companies to locate production and other facilities plus research complex called biopolis that houses biomedical research institutes councils and related organizations multinational companies have come to dominate the manufacture of pharmaceuticals in singapore these include merck sharp and dohme aventis glaxosmithkline pfizer scheringplough wyeth and eli lilly17 singapore is increasingly becoming base for both regional and global pharmaceutical production for growing number of multinational companies the government goal is to have at least ten multinational pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities operational in singapore by 2010 much of the production is for export particularly to the united states and europe exports from other asian countries also flow into singapore for reexport the country exports more pharmaceuticals than any other asian tiger economy hong kong taiwan and south korea18 before the fta sizable proportion of singapores pharmaceutical exports were transshipments from other countries while such reexports continue to increase exports of domestic production now dominate figure 6 shows singapores global exports of pharmaceuticals and the rapid increase in domestic exports

intraindustry the old economic model of trade in which each country specializes in certain products and exchanges them for others in which it has comparative disadvantage only remotely resembles trade between industrialized economies populated by multinational enterprises in many cases the united states both imports and exports products in the same sector some of this trade may occur within manufacturers supply chain that may straddle several countries for example an electronic product may be designed and marketed in the united states but final assembly may be in singapore using components from the united states as well as from other economies in the region the us balance of trade in goods with singapore is shown in figure 7 by twodigit harmonized system codes the balance of trade by sectors also indicates how trade with singapore may be affecting sectoral employment in the united states the first observation is that the us aerospace and electrical machinery producers are doing well relative to singapore most other sectors also are experiencing either small surpluses or small deficits in bilateral trade less than 1 billion the sectors not shown in figure 7 had balances with an absolute value of less than 50 million on the deficit side the exceptional sector was pharmaceuticals deficit accounting for about 13 of the us market this industry in singapore however is dominated by multinational drug companies some headquartered in the united states the effect on us employment in the drug sector therefore is unclear and so far relatively small crs14 figure 7

in the ussingapore fta labor obligations are part of the core text of the trade agreement both parties were to reaffirm their obligations as members of the international labor organization and they are to strive to ensure that their domestic laws provide for labor standards consistent with internationally recognized labor principles the agreement also contains language that it is inappropriate to weaken or reduce domestic labor protections to encourage trade or investment the agreement further requires parties to effectively enforce their own domestic labor laws this obligation is to be enforceable through the agreements dispute settlement procedures singapore has ratified 24 ilo conventions 20 in force including five core conventions that cover child labor ratified in 2001 forced labor collective bargaining and equal remuneration ratified in 2002 the country ratified the minimum age convention in november 2005 after the fta went into effect unless otherwise indicated the other conventions were ratified in 1965 the united states has ratified 14 ilo conventions 12 in force including 2 forced labor and child labor of the five core conventions19 in 2004 singapores national labor force was made up of approximately 218 million workers of which nearly 420000 were unionized and represented by 68 19 international labour organization see website at httpwwwiloorg crs15 unions the number of unionized workers was up from 338311 workers in 2002 almost all of the unions which represent virtually all of the union members were affiliated with the national trade union congress ntuc an umbrella organization with close relationship with the government environmental issues in the ussingapore fta both parties agreed to ensure that their domestic environmental laws provide for high levels of environmental protection and that they are to strive to continue to improve such laws they are not to weaken or reduce domestic environmental protections to encourage trade or investment the agreement also requires that parties effectively enforce their own domestic environmental laws this obligation is to be enforceable through the agreements dispute settlement procedures since singapore is an island 34 million population the size of the washington dc area inside the beltway it has virtually natural resources its environmental issues are characteristic of highly urbanized city it has problems associated with mining forestry or largescale agriculture singapore touts itself as the garden city of the east it is relatively clean ordered and wellplanned waste water is purified and recycled the restricted space available in the country raises issues pertaining to industrial pollution tightly regulated urbanization and the protection of the few natural areas still existing vehicular traffic is alleviated by charging special tolls to travel into the inner city during rush hours and by levying taxes and other fees on new or used cars20 cargo security the closer economic links established under the fta appear to have assisted in areas such as cargo security in december 2007 singapore announced that it was to conduct sixmonth trial project under the secure freight initiative under this initiative 100 of usbound shipping containers are to be scanned for nuclear or radiological materials before being loaded on ships singapore is to be one of seven ports participating in the trial21 the ports command in singapore already had been cooperating with the united states in various security initiatives it now scans about 15 of the 24 million cargo containers that pass through its ports and it is able to scan an incoming container 20 tan alan kj preliminary assessment of singapores environmental law united nations online network in public

ussingapore fta also generated noneconomic effects at time when many in southeast asia perceive that the united states is distracted by events in the middle east and not paying enough attention to asia the fta provides some degree of reassurance of us interest in the region it also created bandwagon effect as malaysia thailand and south korea soon followed with negotiations of their own for an
