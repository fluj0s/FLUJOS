the di strict in which congress approves the citys budgets well beyond the october 1 start of its fiscal year the citys ected leaders contend that the delay in congress s approval of the citys budg et hinders their ability to manage the districts financial affairs and negatively affects the delivery of public services proponents of increased budg et autonomy can point to the bush administrations budget for fy2004 which included statement in support of budget autonomy for the district of columb ia and the fact that the district has produced 10 consecutive balanced budgets si x of them without the supervision of the financial control board an argument against granting the city budget autonomy is that it could be viewed as an abdication of congress s constitutional responsibility to exercise legislative control over and oversight of the nations capital the seat of the government such lack of oversight of the citys financial affairs could result in the city slipping back into fiscal crisis

implications district of columbia budget autonomy an analysis of hr 733 110th congress current budget process and structure authority for congressional review and approval of the districts budget is derived from the constitution and the district of columbia selfgovernment and government reorganization act of 1973 home rule act pl 93198 87 stat 774 the constitution gives congress the pow er to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever pertaining to the district of columbia1 in 1973 congress granted the city limited home rule powers and empowered citizens of the district to elect mayor and city council at the same time however c ongress retained the power to review and approve all district laws including the districts annual budget under the districts home rule charter the mayor must submit operating and capital budgets to the city council for review and adoption by date specified by the council2 the charter also mandates that th proposed budget submitted by the mayor must assume that expenditures will not exceed resources and requires that certain elements be part of th mayors budget submission3 in addition the charter requires that the pr oposed budget include fouryear financial management plan outlining the projected longterm impact of current spending when appropriate the mayor may prepare at his discretion or at the direction of the council supplemental or deficiency budget to address the need for additional expenditures and must identify the potential sources of revenues that will be used to address the deficiency the council must act on the budget nd any supplemental appropriations including the reprogramming of funds whic h must be offset by reductions within 56 calendar days of receiving the budget from the mayor the approved budget must then be transmitted to the president who forwards it to congress for review modification and approval both the president through his annual budget submission and congress may pr opose financial assistance to the district in the formhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34032crs2 of special federal payments in support of specific activities or priorities congress must approve the districts budget as one of the appropriations bills district of columbia appropriations acts typically consist of three titles or parts title i includes special federal payments or contributions for specific activities or priorities these are additional sums gran ted to the district outside of the normal federal grant process to address specifi c congressional prioritie s most recently these special federal payments have incl uded but have not been limited to funding of court operations and defe nder services emergency planning and security and education initiatives including college ition assistance support for public schools school choice scholarships vouchers and public charter schools title ii of district appropriations acts consists of the districts operating and capital budgets including enterprise f unds the operating budget is supported by revenues from local taxes fees charges and federal assistance available to all eligible state and local governments the capital budget is sustained through bond sales and annual appropriations title iii consists of general provisions governing various aspects of the operations and functions of district government the general provisions included in recent district of columbia appropriations acts can be grouped into six categories that address fiscal and budgetary matters related to ficit spending limits on the reprogramming of funds prohibitions of the use of solesource contracts and re quirements for emergency and contingency reserve funds impose administrative controls facilitate congressional oversight and reporting limit use of appropriated funds for advocacy of district statehood or congressional voting representation address educational issues related to the payment of attorney fees in individuals with disabilities education act idea actions and impose limits restrictions and prohibitions on the use of federal or local funding to carry out specific social policies such as abortion services needle exchange and medical marijuana on occasion congress has used the districts appropriations act to authorize specific initiatives including school vouchers the ch ief financial officer act and charter schools under fourth title once forwarded by the president to congress typically during the first weeks of june the districts budget moves throug h the congressional ppropriations process this includes subcommittee hearings whic h may take place before the actual budget submission to congress subcommittee and committee markups in both houses committee reports and votes floor

and governmental affairs subcommittee on oversight of government management the federal workforce and the district of columbia and the senate committee on appropriations subcommittee on financial services and general governmentconsideration nd final passage4 all of this is supposed to happen within approximately 120 calendar days before the beginning of the districts fi scal year on october 1 city leaders have consisten tly expressed concern that congress has repeatedly delayed passage of the appropr iations act for the district in which congress approves the citys b udgets well beyond the start of its fiscal year the citys elected leaders contend that delay in congresss approval of its budget hinders their ability to manage the districts financial affairs and negatively impacts the delivery of public services during the past decade the approval of the districts annual budget has been delayed by complications in the congressi onal appropriations pro cess rather than being enacted on its own the district of columbia appropriations act has often been folded into omnibus or consolidated appr opriations acts and continuing resolutions as documented in table 1 fy1997 was the only

of columbia budget autonomy act of 2007 hr 733 110th congress introduced on january 20 2007 by congressw oman eleanor holmes norton is the latest in series of bills dating back to 1981 that would provide budget autonomy for the district of columbia see the appendix the bill was introduced by dc delegate eleanor holmes norton and cos ponsored by representative tom davis when the district of columbia govern ment reorganization and selfgovernment improvement act home rule act pl 93198 87 stat 774 was enacted in 1973 granting the city limited selfgoverning authority it retained congressional authority to review and approve the districts annual budget as part of the congressional appropriations process th home rule act includes several prescriptive provisions governing budget submission financial management and borrowing authority several of these provisions were put in place in response to the fiscal crisis the city faced during the 1990s hr 733 would allow the district to fo rego congressional re view and approval of its operating and capital budgets financed with local revenues the bill would also remove several budget sub mission and financia l management reporting requirements and restrictions on the citys borrowing authority proponents of increased budget autonomy can point to the bush adminis trations budget for fy2004 which included statement in support of budget aut onomy for the district of columbia5 and the fact that the district has produced 10 consecutiv balanced budgets six of them without the supervision of the fi nancial control board budget submission requirements summary of proposed changes hr 733 would eliminate substantive elements of the districts home rule charter governing the budget submission process specifically the bill would remove language that establishes different fiscal year starting points for the district of columbia general gove rnment october 1 to september 30 public education instituti ons including public schools charter schools and the university of the district of columbia july 1 to june 30 and the armory board january 1 to december 31 the bill would also eliminate provisions that prescribe the content and timing of the mayors proposed budget submission to the council such as the inclusion of multiyear budget plan for all agencies mu ltiyear capital budgets and annual program performance reports httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34032crs6 6 the independent agencies include district of columbia auditor district of columbia judicial nomination commission court system the zoning co mmission of the district of columbia the public service commission th armory board the commission on judicial disabilities and tenure and the district of columbia water and sewer authority 7 the district of columbia financial responsibility and management assistance act of 1995 established the definition of control pe riod as any period where the district fails to service its debt defaults on any loan has large cash deficit or requisitions funds from the us treasury pl 1048 209 109 stat 97dictate the timetable for council consideration of the proposed budget currently 56 days restrict the mayors and counc ils ability to alter the budget submissions of specific independent agencies6 and require 30 legislativeday congre ssional review period for district budget acts instead of allowing ch acts to take effect on the date stated in the act policy implications of proposed changes hr 733 renders inapplicable large portions of the home rule act notably the requirements for congressional review section 2b of hr 733 states that the process by which the district of columbia develops and enacts the budget fo r the district gove rnment for fiscal year and the activities of the district government for fiscal year shall be established under such laws as may be enacted by the district those portions of the dc code that dictate the timing and content of the budget process would remain in effect during control year7 for noncontrol years the policy implications of hr 733 are highly dependent upon the nature of the laws that would eventually be enacted by the dist rict should congress approve hr 733 the district would have the power to change its fiscal year or otherwise alter its budget processes to better serve its constituents without having to go through congress change in the fiscal year may more closely reflect the needs of the district decoupling the district general budget fro m the appropriations process could result in shorter budget cycle allowing fo r more accurate revenue and expenditure estimates the current budget approval pro cess involves the mayor the council the congressionally created chief financial officer cfo the president the office of management and budget the appropriation committees of the house and senate and the full congress the process requires at least 15 months to complete typically the process has exceeded 15 months enactment of hr 733 would not preven t congress from intervening in district budgetary matters even if autonomy were gr anted for the part of the districts budget financed by locally raised revenues congress would still need to appropriate federal funds for certain functions that are carried out by the district but financed by the federal government as special federal payments this includes for example corrections courts and defe nder services security nd emergency planning and selected education initiatives such as the college access program school choice scholarships and public charter schools furthermore hr 733 may not preventhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34032crs7 congress from adopting future proposals including socalled social policy provisions that would limit the districts ab ility to spend its own funds as well as federal funds on certain goods or services congress could always pass freestanding legislation restricting the use of the dist ricts own source revenues or include such restrictions or prohibitions as general provisions in district appropriations bill such actions would run counter to the intent of hr 733 and the principles of home rule moreover the rules of both chambers bar th inclusion of legisl ation in appropriation bills any attempt to include social riders or other legislative provisions in district appropriation bills could be challenged on point of order however the house or senate could adopt pr ocedural rules governing federa l appropriations for the district that would allow for the inclusion of legislative provisions that would impose restrictions on the use of di strict funds or authorize new programs for instance during consideration of the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2004 hr 2765 the house approved rule hres 334 which allowed the consideration of an amendment hamdt 368 authorizing sc hool choice program without the rule point of order could have been raised challenging the amendment as legislation in an appropriations measure financial management requirements summary of proposed changes the bill would remove certain provisions and financial manage ment reporting requirements incl uded in the home rule charter specifically the bill would strike provisions that limit the citys ability to increase spending based on an increase in revenues after congress has approved fiscal year appropriation require the mayor to submit comple financial repor t to the council by february 1 of each year require the city to maintain an emergency reserve fund equal to 2 of operating expenditures as identif ied in the comprehensive annual financial report cafr submitted by the cfo and dictate the uses of such fund and require the city to maintain c ontingency reserve fund of not less than 4 of operating expenditures as identified in the cafr submitted by the cfo and dictate the use of such fund establish the position of the district of columbia auditor require the mayor annually to deve lop and submit to the house and senate oversight and appropriations committees and the government accountability office gao pe rformance accountability plan for all departments agencies and prog rams of the government of the

performance accountability report forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34032crs8 8 the following constraints are similar to thos selfimposed constitutionally or statutorily by other state and local

appropriations committees and the government accountability office gao not late r than march 1 of each year fiveyear financial plan for the government of the district of columbia that contains description of the steps the government will take to eliminate any differences between expenditures from and revenues attributable to each fund of the district of columbia during the five years beginning after the submission of the plan require the cfo to submit financial compliance report to the house and senate oversight and appropriations committees on the progress made in executing the plan and to have the report evaluated by gao and omb which must report their findings to the house and senate oversight and appropriations committees not later than april 15th of each year and require the cfo to submit quarterly financial and budgetary status reports to the house and senate oversight committees and appropriations subcommittees policy implications of proposed changes the bill would render moot certain provisions and financial reporting requirements put in place to ensure that congressional committees of jurisdiction have sufficient information from which to exercise informed oversight and appropriations responsib ilities on the one hand eliminating congressiona l review of the districts budget and financ ial management process is consistent with promoting selfgovernment and local autonomy and does not necessarily imply the elimination of performance and financial plans and reports on the other hand the absence of any fo rmal congressional re view and oversight process may hinder congresss ability to guard against waste fraud and abuse and to ensure that the nations capital is financially solvent another implication is that the district would be less of federal city members woul d have less say on district financial matters borrowing restrictions summary of proposed changes the bill proposes to allow the district to enact laws that establish the the process and rules that the district would follow in borrowing funds rather than the congressi onally approved structure currently included under the citys home rule charter8 the home rule charter currently contains limitations on the amount of borrowing the district may undertake general obligation bonds or treasury capital project loans shall be issued during any fiscal year in an amount which would cause the am ount of principal and interest required to be paid to exceed 17 of the dist rict revenues d c code 120603bhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34032crs9 additionally revenue anticipa tion bonds can be issued but the total amount shall not exceed 20 of the total anticipated revenue of the district fo r such fiscal year dc code 120472b the dc code also establishes the manner in which bonds may be issued it requires that certain provisions appear in the act that au thorizes the issuance of bonds it places constraints on the payment sche dule for issued bonds eg annual payments beginning not more than 3 years after th date of such bonds and ending not more than 30 years after such date it institute s special annual tax to cover the principal and interest due on such bonds it also tablishes that all district bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the district of columbia and not that of the united states it contains number of other provisions that blish other protocols relating to the roles played by the mayor and the council in the issuance and payment of bonds except in the case of control year hr 733 would make almost all of the current language related to district borrowing nonbinding important exceptions to this general theme are stated in the bill hr 733 would retain the full faith and credit of the district the nonapplicability of the full faith and credit of the united states and federal and district tax exemp tion for districtissued bonds and notes policy implications of proposed changes while much of the existing language would become nonbinding signif icant provision in hr 733 is that the process and rules by which the district of columbia issues bonds or otherwise borrows money shall be established under such laws as may be enacted by the district as result of this provision it is unclear what rules or laws would be established to regulate issu ance of bonds by the district if hr 733 were enacted it is possible that the district would maintain the protocols and procedures set forth by congress in the home rule act an important past example of district policy in the wa ke of repealed c ongressional ma ndate may be that of the budget reserve fund the budg et reserve fund was at one time but is longer congressionally mandated despite the repeal of the congre ssional mandate the district continues to maintain budg et reserve fund at the level originally mandated by congress 50 milli on however the legislative changes that the district would actua lly undertake are unknown it cannot be stated with certa inty what impact the current limitations and regulations on borrowing has on the districts financial health or its ability to govern the proposed changes would allow the distri ct to establish its own laws governing the borrowing process some benefits of this might include the ability of the district government to respond to pa rticular circumstances quick ly by raising the borrowing cap or by allowing special issuances of bonds not currently outlined in the dc codehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34032crs10 another implication of borrowing autonom for the district is that given the power to borrow according to its own laws and rules the district government can be held accountable by its constituents in th event of poor decisions surrounding the management of its borrowing authority th district would need to set up financial institutions including borrowing regulations and limitations that would serve its constituents needs efficiently and maintain financial stability while considering hr 733 congress may want to inquire of the district what laws it intends to pass and what procedures it intends to maintain repeal or establish in order to ensure good borrowing practices in the future these changes would likely take some time to establish in the interim it may make sense for congress to require that the district establish certain tempor ary institutions or to propose timeline for the creation of relevant district laws while granting the district the power to alter such institutions or laws at some future time arguments for and against district budget autonomy arguments for and against budget autonom for the district may be grouped into three general categories constitutional and philosophical accountability and governance and best prac tices and economic impact arguments in favor of budget autonomy constitutional and ph ilosophical arguments the citizens of the district of columbia have democratic right to elect representatives with the authority to make decisions over the expenditure of their constituents ta x dollars without needing federal approval accountability and governance arguments without its own authority to enact an annual budget and with congressional constraints that make the process cumbersome district government cannot be held singularly accountable since responsibility for final passage is sh ared between the district and the federal governments best practices and econom ic impact arguments involving the district in the c ongressional appropr iations process extends the districts budget process by six months or more as result spending and revenue estimates are often based on incomplete or dated information this make s the budget less reliable and incurs economic costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34032crs11 in theory it is more efficient to have single body in charge of budgetary matters rather than splitting financial decision making between two bodies with vastly di fferent objectives and priorities arguments against budget autonomy constitutional and ph ilosophical arguments congress has constitutional obligation to maintain oversight over the affairs of the district it ca nnot surrender that obligation except through constitutional amendment the district of columbia is the seat of the federal government and as such the policies and practices of the district should represent not only the interests of the citizens living in it but also the interests of the entire nation maintaining cong ressional oversight helps to ensure that this is the case accountability and governance arguments without congressional oversight there is guarantee that the district will not once again fall in to financial tr ouble lineitem approval of the districts budget is an important safeguard against future financial trouble should the district governme nt perform poorly under budget autonomy it could trigger another ta keover by the financial control board serving as an agent of the federal government best practices and econom ic impact arguments other cities have state governments which to some degree oversee the activities of local governments to ensure that they comply with state and federal regulations if th district govern ment acts as both city and state it will lack counterbalance that is present in other citieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34032crs12 policy questions should hr 733 become law what changes might be enacted by district officials regarding the budget process the fiscal year revenue estimation financial manageme nt safeguards contingency and emergency reserve funds borrowing limits protocol for issuance of general obligation bonds if congress does not grant the district full budget autonomy which specific provisions currently in place are regarded as particularly burdensome and of high priority for removal by dist rict officials some examples might include the power to change the fiscal year dates or rela x requirements for the reserve fund if full budget autonomy is not approved what would be an appropriate compromise what prevents the district from passing needed changes to the home rule act through congress under the prevailing legisl ative structure including improvements in the budget process and the fiscal year how have delays in congre ssional approval of the dist ricts budget harmed the operation of the district
