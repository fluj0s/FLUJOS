years ago lead editorial in the washington post was titled failing of oversight it highlighted serious fl aws in congresss overs ight of the central intelligence agency cia1 in replay of that theme the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states commonly called the 911 commission declared that congressional oversight of intelligence and counterterrorism is now dysfunctional commission members urge d congress to strengthen its oversight of intelligence and homeland security by considering the adoption of number of reforms joint committee on intelligence for example they also stated that of all our recommendations for revampin g the intelligence and homeland security structure strengthening congressional ove rsight may be among the most difficult and important2 whether congresss general performance of oversight is dysfunctional across theboard is an issue that people may disa gree about especially given the additional resources more professional st aff laws the inspector ge nerals acts for example or budget procedures stricter reprog ramming requirements for instance the legislative branch acquired to monitor and supervise executive agencies and programs many individual lawmakers are also diligent and effective overseers still there is significant sentiment today that congress needs to do much more to improve its capacity to properly oversee the intelligence community that is to review monitor and supervise th implementation of public policy oversight has long been topic of concern on capitol hill and in other quarters as well viewed by many members as tedious thankless and timeconsuming oversight is often given rela tively limited attention despite its critical role in holding federal agencies and official s accountable for their actions

many house and senate members prefer to focus their activity congresss watchdog role is crucial fo r many reasons besides holding public officials accountable there is another important purpose th at merits mention given the ongoing public debate about restructuring the us intelligence community oversight shines the spotlight of public attention on many significant issues allowing the american people to make inform ed judgments about executive performance policy success or failure nd the conduct of the officeholders who serve in the nationally elective branches the info rming function of congress wrote woodrow wilson in his classic 1885 study of the legi slative branch should be preferred even to its legislative functi on as he emphasized unless congress have and use every means of acquainting itself with the acts and dispositions of the administrative agents of the government the country must be helpless to learn how it is being served and unless congress both scrutinize these things and sift them by every form of discussion the country must remain in embarrassing crippling ignorance of the very affairs which it is most important it should understand and direct4 another fundamental goal of oversight is to protect congresss policymaking role and its place in our constitutional paration of powers system as the first branch of government the huge growth in the size and reach of the executive branch the fourth branch of govern ment has produced policymaking rival to the congress administrators do more than simply faithfully execute our laws according to the intent which may be vague of congress federal agencies are filled with knowledgeable career and noncar eer experts who among other things write rules and regulations that have the force of law formulate policy initiatives for the white house and congress interpret statutes in ways that may expand their discretionary authority or conversely undercut legisla tive intent and shape policy development by the congress in part by selling their ideas to lawmakers and committees via hearings agency reports and other means the large influence of the federal establishment highlights the critical role of oversight in checking unwarranted administrative actions and asserting or reasserting congresss authority over executive entities oversight is also crucial to the lawmaking process only by investigating how statute is being administered can congress discover deficiencies in the original statute and make necessary ad justments and refinements the purposes of this report are to provide

subcommittee on intelligence 8the 911 commission report p 420intelligence community and finally offer few summary observations definition of oversight is appropriate at the outset because it can influence perspectives on the adequacy of the review function oversigh t has two basic meanings first it denotes some form of supervision watchfulness or review of legated authority to executive branch entities and officials often reactive in nature it may also be proactive and prospective oversight is properly speaking an extension of the legislative process5 lawmaking implies an obligation to monitor statutory implementation how much monitoring is done by congress is not easy to measure quantitatively because it is subsumed in many hearings meetings or informal briefings whose purposes may be seconda ry to reviewing program and policy administration6 the second meaning of oversight implies failure to notice something that is overlooked or omitted recurrent issue is the extent to which congress overlooks executive branch activities plai nly the view of the 911 commission is that congress is inadequately organized or motivated to monitor intelligence and homeland security matters in systematic manner the sense of the commission is that congress has too many committees and subcommittees largely operating independently of one another that collect information on intelligence and homeland security issues this decentralized and often compartmentalized structure collects huge amounts of disparate informati on but single committee has the responsibility to connect the dots and view the bigger picture7 as the commission asserted unity of effort in executive management can be lost if it is fractured by divided congressional oversight8 on the other hand the more committees and subcommittees that are engaged in oversight the greater the chances that important matters will not fall through the cracks or be overlooked by congress competitive and creative oversight can help to ensure that important issues are uncovered questions pursued to their conclusion and alternative viewpoints raised to resolve public problems

oversight oversight is an implicit constitutional obligation of the congress according to historian arthur schlesinger jr the framers believed it was not necessary to make specific referen ce to oversight in the constitution it was not considered necessary to make an explicit grant of such authority wrote schlesinger the power to make laws implied the power to see whether they were faithfully executed9 over the years congress has bolstered its ability to carry out its obligation to oversee the bureaucracy thr ough various laws amendments to the house and senate rulebooks and periodic increases in staff and budgetary resources for its committees including oversight and investigation subcommittees brief overview of several core characteristics of oversight highlights the forces and factors that influence how this activity is carried out on capitol hill multiple overlaps the traditional rules and practices of the house and senate make it virtually impossible to eliminate all committee overlaps in the oversight area as noted there are be nefits associated with committee redundancy and overlap such as more eyes and minds monitoring administrative activity the legislative reorganization act of 1946 form alized in law the oversight function of congress that act required house and senate committees to exercise continuous watchfulness of the agencies and progra ms under their jurisdiction implicitly the 1946 law divided oversight among thr ee types of committees authorizing committees were assigned legislative oversight reviewing programs and agencies under their jurisdiction th appropriating committ ees conducted fiscal oversight scrutinizing agency spending and the house and senate governmental affairs panels acquired wi deranging investigative ove rsight conducting probes for waste inefficiency or corruption in th federal government to varying degrees congressional committees conduct each type of oversight in addition house and senate rules provide certain authorizing committees with oversight authority that stre tches beyond their jurisdicti onal mandate this authority is called special oversight in the h ouse and comprehensive policy oversight in the senate both of these 1970s additions to chamber rules are akin to the broad review authority granted the house government reform committee and the senate governmental affairs committee the house education nd workforce committee for instance has the authority house rule x clause 3 to review study and coordinate on continuing basis laws programs and government activities relating to domestic educational programs and institutions and programs of student assistance within the jurisdiction of other committees the senate foreign relations committee as an example has the author ity senate rule xxv to study and review on comprehensive basis matters relating to the national security policy foreign policy and international economic policy as it relates to the foreign policy of the

protecting congre sss policymaking role other objectives include evaluating program administration and performance eliminating waste fraud and abuse clarifying legislative intent correcting executive abuses of authority ensuring that programs are being run in an efficient and costeffective manner and eliminating unwanted or unnecessary programs there are also number of political purposes associated with oversight such as protecting favored agencies and programs from public cr iticism advocating pa rticular policy preferences airing administrative failures or achievements generating favorable publicity for programs responding to reque sts from special interests to influence agency decisions or winning electoral support from constituents or various groups oversight in brief does not focus only on management and imp lementation issues it occurs in political context where the relationship between congress and administrative entities can range from cooperation to conflict multiple incentives and disincentives despite the importance of oversight pass it and forget it lawmaking sometimes occurs on capitol hill this is not to suggest that committees and subcommittees do not hold regular oversight hearings and meetings often aimed today at rooting out government waste and abuse instead analysts and others suggest th at longterm institutional changes have contributed to the decline of oversight such as members shorter workweeks packed schedules term limits on chairmanships and eroding salaries for investigative staff members10 as further disincentives overs ight requires large investments of time energy and staff resources to ferret out administrative inadequacies the impact of oversight on bureaucratic be havior is often murky nd there is the perception of insufficient electoral political or institutional rewards for oversight work agencies may also resist congressional probes forcing committees and subcommittees to persist over number of years and to use coercive tools at the command of congress including subpoenas and holding ex ecutive officials in contempt on the other hand there are certain in centives that can stimulate oversight activity among them are divided gove rnment congress one or both chambers controlled by one party and the white house by the other press and media attention peer recognition as an effectiv and diligent overseer public dissatisfaction with government performance the scarcity of fiscal resources which may encourage members and committees to scrutinize federal programs for waste and inefficiency and electoral support from constituents clearly congressional influence over the executive branch is substantial if committ ees and subcommittees choose to exercise their review authority especially in sustained rather than sporadic manner oversight of the intelligence community selected background information since the creation of the central intelligence agency cia in 1947 and other component s of

218congress has oscillated between relative passivity and aggressiveness in monitoring the intelligence community passiveness wa s largely the order of the day from 1947 to the mid1970s the chairs of the house and senate armed services and appropriations committees ostensibly exercised oversight over the cia through special subcommittees but it was minimal at best the relevant committee chairs who had few staff resources and secure space or place to keep classified materials often used informal meetings as their preferred form of oversight for example allen dulles the director of the cia dci could have an afternoon bourbon with senate armed services chairman richard russell and breakfast chat with house armed services chairman carl vinson and that satisfied the need for accountability of activities rang ing from the successful c oup against president jacobo arbenz guzman of guatemala in 1954 to th covert funding of international student groups and foundations11 leverett saltonstall member of the senate armed services committee and the appropriations subcommittee on defense expressed widely shared attitude among members during this period in 1956 he re marked that it is not question of reluctance on the part of cia officials to sp eak to us instead it is question of our reluctance if you will to seek info rmation and knowledge on subjects which i personally as member of congress and as citize n would rather not have12 that same year senator richard russell who chaired either armed services or appropriations for much of the 1950s and 1960s and who headed the cia subcommittees on both panels from 19691971 expressed comparable view voicing opposition to the creation of joint intelligence committee russell said it is difficult for to foresee that increased staff scrutiny of cia operations would result in either substantial saving s or significant increase in available intelligence information if there is one agency of the government in which we must take some matters on faith without constant examination of its methods and sources i believe this agency is the cia13 added representative robert ellsworth the political zeitgeist of the time was that the cia

on cia operations and budget requests but most members had little knowledge of these ma tters and voted to provide billions of dollars to the intelligence community hidden in differe nt accounts of the defense department and other federal entities w ithout any inkling as to their amounts or purposes the cold war struggle against the communist challenge which had broad national support contributed to congresss genera l unwillingness to question the foreign intelligence activities of the cia there were few exceptions to this pattern of deference such as the bay of pigs debacle and the vietnam war basically both chambers deferred to the president and the cia in nearly all matters involving intelligence policy congressional passivity in overseeing the intelligence community changed significantly by the mid1970s conf luence of factors triggered congresss willingness to assert its authority over the cia for example the vietnam war and watergate weakened confidence in the pres idency and encouraged in that oftquoted phrase an invitation to struggle between the legislative and executive branches over the direction of intelligence policy congresss trust in the cia eroded when contrary to earlier cia statements it lear ned in 1974 that the agency was involved in covert actions to overthrow chilean president salvador allende who was killed in military coup there were also revela tions in leading nati onal newspapers about illegal and improper domestic spying activities illegal wi retaps on dissident groups during the vietnam war for instance and even drugtesting on unwitting subjects that aroused the ire of the public the co mbination of these various factors prompted major investigations by the house and sena as well as by the administration under vice president nelson rockefeller these efforts led to the establishment of permanent senate select committee on intelligence in may 1976 and the house permanent select intelligence committee in july 1977 the creation of the two intelligence panels greatly expanded c ongresss ability to exercise continuous oversight of the intelligence community s activities budget and performance new laws were enacted that provided c ongress with the statutory authority both to acquire intelligence information thus expanding its expertise in this policy arena and to be appraised of covert action initiatives in 1974 in response to disclosures of covert acti on programs to topple foreign governments congress adopted the hughesryan amendment nam ed after senator harold hughes and representative leo ryan to the

conducting military or paramilitary operations in angola and deni ed any appropriated funds to finance directly or indirectly any type of military assistance to angola17 this was the first time congress terminated cove rt operation four years later congress enacted the intelligence oversight act which required the president to ensure that the house and senate intelligence committees are kept fully and currently informed of the intelligence activities of the united states including any significant anticipated intelligence activity18 the heads of the intelligence agencies were also directed to respond to inquiries from these two panels these various changes during the 1970s and 1980s required new relationship between the intelligence community and congress longer could the cia deal only with small number of senior lawmakers19 instead the cia now had to provide information and analysis to larger segment of the house and senate membership and to accommodate perman ent intelligence panels that had the authority to exercise legislative and budg et authority over the intelligence community and to investigate the quality of intelligence provided to policymakers informally the intelligence committees and the intelligence community worked out number of other arrangements legislative access to classified materials the sharing and storing of intelligence security clearances for staff and the like importantly the creation of the house and senate intelligence committees brought about an intense educational period in which the committees learned how the intelligence community was organized how it performed its duties and how intelligence people operated20 congresss resurgent role in national security affairs meant that appropriate committees and members expected to receive timely and reliable information and analysis from the intelligence community and the intelligence community did provide large amounts of information to capitol hill via reports briefings or

instances in which committee access to info rmation could not be arranged have been extremely rare23 the closer relationship between congress and the intelligence community did not mean that it was always harmonious sharp conflict erupted in the mid1980s between the intelligence committees and dci william casey the senate committee for example charged that casey had not kept the panel fully and currently informed about its covert activ ities in central america the cia c ountercharged that committee members and staff failed to as k for pertinent information about their secret operations as director casey told the senators if you dont ask the right questions you wont get the right answers24 or as one senator put it explaining that cia briefers did not provide much tail about specific operations only if you ask precisely the right question will they give you precisely the right information and even though were given things like places dates money and the like administration goals are ofte n vague and usually evolve25 if the right questions are asked by lawmakers and intelligence officials find them difficult to answer this may send signals to the cia that they need to rethink their plans on the other hand if the right questi ons are not asked about covert plans then the cia may later claim legi slative support for secret activities that might go awry in 1984 congress adopted the boland ame ndment after representative edward boland who chaired the permanent sel ect intelligence committee to prohibit assistance of any kind to support the contras in nicaragua several agencies including the cia were specifically barre d from providing assistance to the contras the legislativeexecutive strife engendered by the covert war in central america led to joint hearings by the two intelligence committees into what was called the iran affair this inquiry focused on the secret sale of arms to iran with profits from the sales used illegally to fund the us backed rebels in nicaragua the episode embarrassed the administration and pointed to the difficulties of controlling covert operations yet the irancontra affa ir also underscored that congress did hold certain public

accurate assessments of the milita ry intentions of the iraqi armed forces prior to the 1991 persian gulf war in 1994 the discovery of spy aldrich ames in the cia triggered investigations by the congressional intelligence committees the ames episode tarnished the public reputation of the agency most recently the intelligence agency has been criticized for number of failures such as its judgment prior to the iraq war that saddam hussein posse ssed weapons of mass destruction notwithstanding these controversies the congressintelligence community relationship generally has been character ized more by cooperation trust and accommodation than by conflict or recrimin ation even more important is that congress since the mid1970s shifted from be ing minor to significant player in intelligence oversight constraints on the conduct of intelligence oversight congress has number of important tool s through which it can scrutinize the intelligence community among the most important are budget reviews conducted by the two intelligence panels the relevant appropriations subcommittees and the armed services panels studies and reports by the congressional intelligence panels on the timeliness and quality of intelligence collection and analysis and pertinent laws requiring the dci to provide intellig ence support to the house and senate and its committees for example along with the cia inspector general reports of course the fact that congress has the authority and obligation to hold the intelligence community accountable doe s not necessarily mean that it is required to do so in sustained systematic or bipartisan manner the 911 commission suggested that the intelligence panels require strengthening and it proposed number of recommendations that might achieve this objective such as consolidating the intelligence appropriation and authorization functions in the existing intelligence authorization committees the commission also stated that the select intelligence panels could be transformed into standing committees with additional powers although the 108th congress did not approve these two specific recommendations severa l of the commissions reform proposals were agreed to as noted earlier such as eliminating term limits for members who serve on the senate select intelligence committee and creating in the senate panel subcommittee on oversight26 despite

communitys culture of limited or compartmentalized need to know shapes congresss oversight of intelligence agencies the veil of secrecy that usually shrouds intelligence activity means that congress often finds itself in catch 22 situation cia officials for example may provide timely notice to appropriate congressional committees and party leaders of planned c overt actions but lawmakers who possess this information are subject to numerous internal rules and ot her restrictions that inhibit the disclosure of sensitive material even to their colleagues let alone the media or others27 it is somewhat paradoxical though understandabl that the most open of our three national branches of government must c onduct most of its intelligence oversight in secret the closed door oversight of intelligen ce raises numerous dilemmas that are not easy to resolve two questions seem pecially prominent first can congress function as an effective surrogate for the public in holding the intelligence community accountable for its actions nd decisions when these agencies must function in highly secret environment absent any constitutional right to know on the publics part people may either accept the reasons for secrecy and the limitations that it imposes on public accountability or they may doubt the executive branchs willingness to be forthcoming with congress or congresss readiness to air disquieting information28 second the safety and security of the nation may depend on collecting and analyzing intelligence gathered through overt and covert means and disseminating it to appropriate decisionmakers in dangerous world challenge for congresss intelligence committees is balancing their obligation to hold intelligence agencies accountable for their performance without hindering or harming these agencies ability to carry out their national security responsibilities stated differently how is congress to conduct oversight in policy area deemed of great importance by both the executive and legislative branches but characterized by legitimate needs for secrecy and security that exist in few other policy areas29 to be sure the issue of secrecy raises host of other concerns such as storing and securing classified information providing access to confidential studies preventing leaks of materials establishing guidelines for the use of classified studies and hiring competent staff who can acquire appropriate security clearances from the executive branch30 the secrecy of the work also limits public recognitionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32617crs12 30continued

so on takes years of study and analysis on the other hand limitations of tenure on the intelligence panels permit wider number of lawmakers to understand intelligence issues and to speak about them knowledgeably tenure limits also reduce the chances that the committ ees will be coopted by the inte lligence community although this contention has b een the subject of increasing debate dearth of outside assistance unless certain events or crises precipitate their involvement relativ ely few members of congress focus intensively or extensively on the intelligence community members and staff of the two intelligence panels are the principal consumers of information and analysis generated by the many components of the intelligence community they are responsible to their colleagues for evaluating its credibility and accuracy this is workload assignment of significant proportions the two committees r eceive little help from interest groups constituents or the media in mon itoring and evaluating intelligence agencies simply because security concerns restrict the access of other participants even lawmakers who are not members of the intelligence panels confront various restrictions

oversight structure when the 109th congress convenes the recommendations have their advantag and disadvantages consolidating oversight authority in single co mmittee pinpoints responsibility and accountability and limits the problem of leaks on the other hand unlike the current arrangement which permits multiple committees to review intelligence issues each from their unique vantage point

values of the american people anticipate longrange trends and meet the challenges of changed world president harry truman underscored the importance of intelligence in making right decisions for the nation in comments that apply equally well to the legi slative branch i think it is fairly obvious that by and large presidents or congresss performan ce is as effective as the information he has and
