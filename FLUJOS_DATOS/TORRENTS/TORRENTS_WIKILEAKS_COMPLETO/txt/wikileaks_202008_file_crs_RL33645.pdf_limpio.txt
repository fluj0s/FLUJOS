resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33645terrorist watchlist checks and air passenger prescreening summary considerable controversy continues to surround us air passenger prescreening and terrorist watchlist checks in the pa st such controversy centered around diverted international flights and misidentified passengers while screening agencies have taken some steps to ameliorate those probl ems other related issues have arisen underscoring that screening passengers for more intensive searches of their person or baggage or to prevent them from boarding an aircraft in the event of terrorist watchlist hit is likely to be difficult pr oposition for the federal agencies tasked with aviation and border security principally the department of homeland security dhs transportation security adminis tration tsa and customs and border protection cbp recent developments underscore the difficulties encountered by frontlinescreening agencies for example in late 2006 the dhs pr ivacy office reported that tsa had not accurately described its use of personal data while testing new air passenger prescreening system known as secure flig ht in notifications required under the privacy act the privacy office and the department also reported on cbps automated targeting system which assign s risk assessments to both cargo and passengers and has been opera tional for several years while those reports were made in the spirit of greater government transparency they generated additional public scrutiny and criticism also in august 2006 foiled conspiracy to bomb airliners bound for the united states from the united kingdom uk raised questions about the adequacy of existing processes to prescreen air passengers against terrorist watchlists in response to that plot dhs re portedly issued temporary order requiring that greater amounts of passenger name records pnr s be provided preflight to cbp for transatlantic flights originating in the uk as opposed to 15 minutes after the flights departure as required previously us authorities maintain that these measures are necessary to provide greater aviation and border security in july 2006 however the european court of justice ruled that th existing agreement between the european commission and cbp to exchange pnrs was illegal the court ordered the cessation of this data exchange on sept ember 30 2006 while new agreement was reached in october 2006 this impasse could have significantly affected travel from european union countries to the unite d states moreover the agreement is temporary and is set to expire on july 31 2007 in the 110th congress meanwhile the house passed bill hr 1 to implement further the recommendations of the 911 commission on january 9 2007 this bill includes two provisions that would require the dhs secretary to 1 establish timely and fair appeals process for persons delayed or prevented from boarding commercial aircraft by any homeland security agency and 2 formulate strategic plan to test and implement an advanced passenger prescreening system and the senate is currently consider ing similar provisions in s 509 as an amendment to s 4 the senate alternative to hr

these lists imply prospective pa ssengers found to be on the fly list are denied boarding and referred to law enforcement whereas those on the automatic selectee list are lected for secondary secur

the tsa distributes these watchlists to us air carriers in turn the air carriers screen passengers against these watchlists before boarding in general these lists are downloaded into handful of computer reservations system s used by most us air carriers however few smaller carriers still manually compare passenger data against these lists as intelligence and law enforcement officials were concerned about the security of the fly list only handful of name s were listed prior to the 911 attacks fewer than 2022 since then the lists have been expanded almost daily23 within tsa the office of

members of c ongress eg senator edward kennedy and representa tives john lewis and don young26 it is notable that because not all know n and suspected terrorists are considered threats to civil aviation there could be legal and investigativ policy considerations that would bear upon placing all such pers ons who are included in the tsdb on the fly list and possibly the automatic selectee list the tsc moreover may be reluctant to release the full list of know n and suspected terrorists to the airlines because of data security concerns alt hough data security remains concern much larger terrorist watchlist is provided by the tsc to cbp this watchlist however remains under government control cbp air passenger prescreening air passengers on inbound and outbound intern ational flights are also screened by cbp with border security systems that include much larger subset of the tsdb generated terrorist lookout records than thos included in the fly or automatic selectee lists even before the 911 attacks limited amounts of passenger name record pnr data were transferred to cbp predecessor agencies the us customs service and the immigration and naturalization service for incoming

cbp sought greater amounts of pnr data from european airlines ne gotiations over acquiring such data were highly publicized and us authorities threatened to fine the european airlines for not providing such data in may 2004 an interim agreement was negotiated with the european commission under which cbp has been provided with 34 specific categories of pnr data for travelers on in ternational flights from european union eu countries in june 2004 however th european parliament challenged this agreement with an action of annulment in the european court of justice30 in may 2006 the european court of justice ruled that the existing agreement between the european commission and cbp was illegal on the basis that the pnr agreement was not within the competency of the commission consequently the court ordered the cessation of pnr data exchange on september 30 2006 if new agreement was not reached that addressed the courts objections with the existing agreement31 it is notable that the court s decision reportedly was not founded upon any infringement of fundamental eu data protection rights32 nonetheless members of the european parliament expressed concern about possible infringements under the agreement when they called for the action of annulment despite continuing eu concerns about data protection an interim pnr agreemen t was tentatively reached between the eu

individuals and their baggage who are perceived to pose an elevated or unknown risk to comme rcial aviation while reducing the number of passengers screened and wait times at passenger screening checkpoints according to tsa secure flight consisted of four elements streamlined rule for more intensive screening scaledback identity authentication process passenger name check against the terrorist screening database and an appeals process for passengers who may have been misidentified in addition to the appeals process the secure flight program is an amalgam of features taken from existing screening systems capps ii and the 911 commissions recommendations that passenger s be screened against the wider set of terrorist watchlists maintained by the us government within tsa the office of national risk assessment had responsibility for establishing policy for the secure flight program domestic and international screening to reduce redundant or overlapping passenger processi ng systems it appeared that secure flight would be used only for prescreening passengers on domestic flights dhss cbp would be responsible for checking passenger identitie s against watchlists and prescreening passengers on inbound and outbound international flights it is unclear however whether responsibility for screening domestic and international f lights can be clearly divided between tsa and cbp because ma ny international flights have domestic legs and internati onal passengers sometime s make connections to domestic flights it is also unclear moreover whether the development of secure flight will impair entirely tsas responsibility for scr eening international air passengers who may be threats to civil aviation at issu is tsas authority and responsibility over all aspects of aviation security versus cbps authority and re sponsibility for border management and security presently the fly and automatic selectee lists are used by air carriers to screen passengers on international and domestic flights it remains an open policy question whether this prescreening mechanism will be replaced by cbp predeparture screen ing of air passengers on all inbound international flights in the case of international air travel the distinction between aviation and border secur ity functions has become increasingly blurred related provisions in the intelligence reform act congress meanwhile included several air passenger prescreening related provisions in the intelligence reform and terrorist prev ention act pl 108458 among other things this law requires 1 tsa to assume the airline passenger prescreening function from us air carriers after it estab lishes an advanced passenger prescreening system for domestic flights that uses the consolidated tsdb described

further the recommendations of the 911 commission the house bill includes two provisions related to air passenger prescreening the senate committee on commerce science and transpor tation and the house appropriations subcommittee on homeland security held hearings on aviation security on january 17 and february 13 2007 respectively in add ition the sena committee on commerce science and transportation reported with amendments the aviation security improvement act s 509 on fe bruary 13 2007 without written report the senate bill includes similar provisions to those in hr 1 and is being considered by the senate as an amendment to s 4 the senate alternative to hr 1 senate oversight heari ng on aviation security at the senate hearing the head of tsa assistant secretary hawley conceded that the redress processes at tsa had been too cumbersome and expens ive prompting the agency to introduce new streamlined process and automated redress management system122 hawley also testified that dhs secretary cher toff had developed program envisioned by secretary of state c ondoleezza rice that is designed to provide travelers with single simple process for addressing watchlistrelated complaints123 hawley also testified that the advance air passenger prescreening program known as secure flight would reduce misidentifications the largest source of complaints124 he reported that tsa had processed more than 20000 redress requests in 2006 and the average processing times of those requests had been reduced from two months to 10 days125 in addition hawley informed the committee that tsa and the fbiadministered tsc were in the process of reviewing the fly list in an effort to reduce the number of individuals on that list by as much as 50126 strategic plan for

such system and that it explain how this system would be integrated with the prescreening system for passengers on international flights as described above the head of tsa ssistant secretary ki p hawley testified before the senate committee on commerce science and transportation that the agencys advanced air passenger prescr eening program secure flight reportedly would not be running until at least 2008127 section 13 of the s 509 includes similar provision to that in hr 1 but the effective date in the senate provision would be within 180 days of enactment appeals and redress requirements section 407 of hr 1 includes provision that would require th dhs secretary to establish an office of appeals and redress at the departmental level under which timely and fair process would be established to allow individuals who beli eve they have been wrongly delayed or prohibited from boarding commercial aircraft by either the tsa or cbp to appeal those actions and seek redress the house provision would also require the dhs secretary to establish offices for those pur poses at each airport where the department has significant presence section 12 of s 509 includes similar provision except that it would not require the department to establish offices at each airport where the department has significant pr esence for the purposes of redress and remedy for passengers wrong ly delayed or prohibite d from boarding flight possible issues for congress four issues loom large in terms of the us governments capabilities to identify screen and track terrorists and their suppor ters for example how reliable is the intelligence that is the basis for lookout reco rds how accurate and complete is the consolidated terrorist screening database itself when will the tsa and cbp be able to prescreen effectively air passengers prior to departure will the tsc in cooperation with screening agencies be ab to establish viab redress and remedy processes for persons misidentified as rrorists or their supporters given certain limitations placed on those agencies in regard to the public divulgence of national security and law enforcement sensitive information reliability of inte lligence underlying lookout records because the terrorist identities database tide maintained by the national counterterrorism center nctc is th principal source of lookout records on international terrorists placed in the tscs consolidated terrorist screening database key oversight issue for congress is whether the intelligence community is sharing the appropriate information necessary to identify terrori sts and their supporters with the nctc is the tsc receiving timely rrorist identities data updates that reflecthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33645crs26 the best and most reliable intelligence available to intelligence and law enforcement agencies accuracy and completeness of the terrorist screening database according to the doj oig the tsc struggled to develop consolidated terrorist screening database as illustrated by the several versions of this database referenced in the oig audit and numerous problems associated with the database among other things the problems included data inaccuracies omitted and unactivated fields and duplicate records in two early versions of this database although the tsc did manage to upload rrorist lookout records into the national crime information centers system so that it would be available to state local and tribal police for the first time another issue may be whether there was degradation in the quality of lookout records provided to other mainline screening agencies such as the department of states bureau of consular affairs and dhss customs and border protection consequently an i ssue for congress may be whether the tsc was able to maintain th same quality of lookout r ecords that were provided previously by the state departments bureau of intelligence and research as there may be outstanding issues related to the accuracy nd completeness of the lookout records in the consolidated terrorist screening database preflight passenger scr eening by tsa and cbp while largely related to implementation number of unresolved questions remain with regard to prescreening air passengers prior to departure wheels up how quickly can tsa develop and deploy an advanced air passenger prescreening system that among other things will assume the daytoday administration of the fly and automatic selectee watchlis ts from the airlines will dhs and cbp be able to negotiate permanent agreemen t with the eu for greater amount of pnr data that would be provided preflight if such an agreement cannot be reached what will the implications be if dhs and cbp require such data through new regulations administratively and subse quently refuse noncompliant air carriers entry into the united states or fine them for not providing such data preflight viable processes of redress and remedy for misidentifications concerning misidentifications under hspd 6 the tsc director is responsible for developing policies and pr ocedures related to the criteria for inclusion into the consolidated tsdb and for taking measur to address misiden tifications erroneous entries outdated data and privacy concerns an issue for congress may be the extent to which the tsc is working with screening agencies to develop appropriate and effective redress and re medy processes for persons misidentified as terrorists or their supporters given certain limitations placed on the tsc and screening agencies with regard to releasing national security and law enforcement sensitive information will sufficient information channels be available and remedial processes established to provide for accurate and expeditious terminations in misidentification cases
