national cyber security divisionunited states computer emergency readiness team and the office of the national counterintelligence executive u key findings ufouo foreign governments routinely ta rget the computers and other electronic devices and media carried by us cor porate and government personnel traveling abroad to gather economic military and politic information theft of sensitive information can occur in foreign country at any point between travelers arrival and departure and can continue after return ing home without the victim being aware ufouo use of cell phones laptops and personal digital assistants pdas in foreign countries exposes these devices to unauthorized access and theft of data by criminal and foreign government elements travelers should assume that they cannot protect electronically stored data and should not transmit sensitive government personal or proprietary info rmation on the internet or through telecommunications equipment ufouo personal electronic equipment carri ed abroad is vulnerabl to installation of malicious software that can steal or mani pulate data well after the traveler returns home devices carried overseas should be screened thoroughly upon return for the presence of malicious software ufouo risks associated with use of electronic media overse as can be reduced through proper handling techniques the simple st of these is to leave such devices at home barring that protective measures sh ould include using designated travel computers singleuse cell phones and temporary email addresses as well as refraining from communicating with home organizations information technology systems unclassifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only page 2 of 3 u information theft ufouo any us citizen traveling abroad is potential foreign intelligence collection target but corporate and government leaders are mo st at risk because of the potentially useful information th at they carry foreign intelli gence services target the full range of us economic industrial military and political interests and emphasize private sector state and local and us government officials as potential sources of information many foreign governments control in frastructure to facilitate their intelligence collection efforts foreign governmentowned telecommu nications companies are particularly well postured to collect information from foreign tr avelers communicating within the country ufouo intelligence colle ction activities and inform ation theft likely will be conducted in nonthreatening and unobtrusi ve manner victims may not realize they have been targeted until after their information is compromised u the us department of state cautions that in certain countries us citizens should have reasonable expectation of privacy in private or public locations u hotel rooms internet cafes offices and public places may be subject to onsite or remote technical monitoring u travelers should assume that all info rmation processed and transmitted on fax machines foreign computers or tele phones is subject to interception this vulnerability extends to personal cell phone s laptops and pdas brought from the united states that transmit over foreign countrys networks u spy software which intercepts and transmits information without users knowledge can be implanted in both wired and wireless internet portals in cafes hotels transportation depot s and elsewhere u universal serial bus usb memory sticks and similar storage devices may become infected with malicious software if used on devices in foreign country or loaded with malicious software when they are not in the owners possession such storage devices given out as advert ising tokens at conf erences already may be loaded with malicious software u customs officials in foreign countr ies regularly inspect laptops and luggageʊoften without the owners being present ʊto copy sensitive information u vulnerabilities after returning home ufouo malicious software surreptitiously installed abroad can become continuing threat after the traveler returns home and connects an unwittingly compromised electronic device to corporate government or personal information systems hackers can gain access to sensitive data networks more directly by attacking personal devices than through attacks mounted over the internet they can use malicious software to unclassifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only page 3 of 3 hijack and control thousands of personal computers at time through robot networks botnets custommade viruses can atta ck corporate and government databases to corrupt or steal data u protective measures ufouo the best strategy to protect electronic devices when traveling is to leave them at home if this is impossible lternatives include buying singleuse cell phone locally using designated travel laptop th at contains minimal sensitive information and using temporary internet email account s not associated with corporate or government entity even with these strategies however travelers should assume that all communications are monitored ufouo when it is necessary to carry and us electronic devices and media abroad travelers should screen them for viruses before communicating w ith home networks and conduct comprehensive scan after returning home ufouo when in transit or separated from computer or pda travelers should keep sensitive and proprietary information on re movable storage media such as cdroms floppy disks removable hard drives and us b memory sticks continuously in their possession even so travelers should check these devices for malicious software upon returning home and before c onnecting to corporate governme nt or personal networks ufouo travelers should use
