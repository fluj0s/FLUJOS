contracts are available to contracting officers and contractors and contracting fficers have many factors to consider when selecting which type of contract to use for particular proc urement factors include type and complexity of the agencys requirement urgency of the requirement performance period and the extent and nature of proposed subcontracting11 the following contracts have different pricing arrangements fixedprice contracts provide for firm price or in appropriate cases an adjustable price fixedpr ice contract with economic price adjustment provides for upward or downward revision of the stated contract price upon the occurrence of specified contingencies12 costreimbursement contracts pr ovide for payment of allowable incurred costs to the extent prescribed in the contract13 timeandmaterials contr acts provide for acquiring supplies or services on the basis of 1 direct labor hours at specified fixed hourly rates that include wages overhead genera l and administrative expenses and profit and 2 materials at cost including if appropriate material handling costs as part of material costs14 laborhour contracts are variation of the timeandmaterials contract differing only in that materials are not supplied by the contractor15 fixed price or costreimbursement contract that includes an incentive may be referred to as an incentive contract incentive contracts are ppropriate when the required supplies or services can be acquired at lower costs and in certain instances with improved delivery or technical performance by relating the amount of profit or fee payable under the contract to the contractors performance16 another variation is called the indefinitedelivery contract which is u sed to acquire supplies andor services when the exact times andor exact quantities of fu ture deliveries are not known at the time of contract award and which is sometimes referred to as an indefinitedeliveryindefinite quantity idiq

numbers sequentially to public laws assign numbers sequentia lly to contracting actions agencies may add other information such as fiscal year to their piids the federal procurement data center is required to mainta in registry of agencies coding schemes and validate their use in all transactions18 competition full and open competition which means that all responsible s ources are permitted to compete is the policy of the federal government19 however exceptions are permitted one category of exceptions provides for full and open competition after exclusion of sources procurements that are set aside for certain types of small businesses belong to this category because larg businesses are excluded from competition20 other than full and open competition which is popularly referred to as bid or sole source contracting is permitted unde r seven circumstances only one responsible source exists and other s upplies or services will satisfy agency requirements an unusual and compelling urgency fo r supplies or services exists the government needs to achieve industrial mobilization tablish or maintain an esse ntial engineering or research and development capability or obtain expert services an international agreement or treaty precludes full and open competition statut authorizes or requires that supplies or services be procured through another agency or from specified source disclosure of an agencys needs could compromise national security and it is in the public interest not to conduct full and open competition21 two columns on the fpds spreadsheets extent competed and reason not competed provide competition informati on about each procurement while some spreadsheet entries include the phrase other than full and open competition or full and open after exclusion of sources for the form er column and the appropriate reason why there was or limited competition other entr ies refer to other types of limitations on procurements for example an agency might indicate that particular procurement was not available for competiti on and then as the reason cite the javitswagneroday jwod act which mandates that organizati ons that employ individuals who are blind or severely disabled are required source of supplies and services for federal agencies22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22314crs6 23 access to gsas schedules is available at

systemnext generation fpdsng data element dictionary pp 115140the fpds data dictionary provides descriptions for the different entries permitted in these two columns interagency contracting the term interagency contracting has several meanings perhaps the best known example is when agen cies purchase goods and services from federal supply schedule that has been established and is maintained by another federal agency such as the general services administration gsa23 another type of interagenc contracting occurs when agency purchases goods or services on behalf of agency b which funds the purchase an examination of the fpds spreadsheets indicate that num erous purchases were made using this method the purchasing department and agency or office if applicable are listed in columns and b respectively the funding agen cy code is located in column m24 apparently if there is entry in column m for particular proc urement the department identified in column funded the procurement conversely there are many procurements for which the entry in column m does not match the department and agency identified in columns and b for example gsa purchased goods and services that were paid for by the air force the army dhs fema the navy and an office with in the department of health and human services type of business or organization useful feature of fpds is that it allows agencies to identify contractor by type of organization or business such as trib government small disadvantaged business educational institution woma nowned business veteran owned business and nonprofit organization25 the three hurricanerelated spreadsheets available at fpds use this information to show what type of orga nization was involved in each procurement conclusion the data provided through the fpds we bsite and the other websites listed above provide degree of transparency in what is often murky process and can be used to analyze hurricanerelated recovery procurements
