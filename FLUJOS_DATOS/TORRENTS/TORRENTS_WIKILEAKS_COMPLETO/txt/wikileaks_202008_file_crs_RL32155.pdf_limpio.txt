to help middleincome families pay for the escalating cost of higher education the congress has passed and enhanced variety of tax benefits since 1990 these federal income tax benefits may be categorized in two ways 1 those intended to encourage taxpayers to save for future postsecondary education expenses and 2 those meant to help taxpayers meet current higher education expenses the first group on which this report focuses is composed of education savings bonds section 529 prepaid tuition and college savings programs and coverdell education savings accounts formerly education iras the second group eg the hope scholarship credit lifetime learning credit and the higher education deduction and its relationship to eligibility for traditional federal student aid is the subject of crs report rl31129 higher education tax credits and deduction an overview of the benefits and their relationship to traditional student aid an education savings bond is series ee bond issued after december 31 1989 or series i bond owned by an individual who was at least 24 years old on the date the bond was issued the bond must be registered in the name of the taxpayer andor spouse who claim the student as dependent on their tax return taxpayers depending on their income at the time of school enrollment may be able to exclude from income the interest earned on bonds redeemed to pay tuition and required fees the bonds are little utilized for educational purposes the very popular section 529 programs are sponsored principally by states and enable virtually anyone to make contributions toward the future higher education expenses of designated beneficiaries section 529 prepaid tuition plans which operate as hedge against tuition inflation typically cover tuition and fees section 529 college savings plans which function much like mutual funds cover the cost of attendance each 529 prepaid tuition and college savings plan is controlled by its account owners who may change beneficiaries and have the account balances refunded to them if they desire coverdell education savings account is trust or custodial account that similarly allows money to be saved for beneficiarys cost of attendance unlike 529 programs however the responsible individual who manages coverdell account cannot have the contributions to and taxexempt earnings accumulated in coverdell accounts refunded to himher typically the balances in coverdell accounts must be given to the beneficiaries shortly after they reach 30 years of age these tax benefits may affect students eligibility for traditional federal financial aid for most aid applicants this impact is felt to the extent that the net worth of these savings vehicles and income from them are expected to be contributed toward postsecondary education expenses under the traditional system greater expected family contribution efc can lead to reduced financial need and decreased eligibility for needbased aid the treatment of each of these tax benefits in the determination of the efc can differ sharply further applicants for federal financial aid often do not receive clear guidance from the department of education as to whose assets or income these are and how they are to be reported on their applications congress has addressed some aspects of the relationship between traditional student aid and education savings benefits in the college cost reduction and access act of 2007 this report will be updated as warranted httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32155g22g138g161g556g8g138

education is becoming less affordable for middleincome families because the rise in tuition has outpaced the increase in average household income for the past two decades1 as reflection of the desire among members of congress to keep postsecondary education broadly available to the us population the congress has passed and enhanced variety of tax benefits toward that end since 1990 this report examines three taxfavored savings incentives for higher education namely coverdell education savings accounts section 529 or qualified tuition programs and education savings bonds it omits discussion of some other forms of taxadvantaged savings that were created primarily for other purposes eg individual retirement accounts2 and for which higher education is just one of many possible us eg uniform

financial aid consisting of grants loans or workstudy income g11g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561 the federal income tax measures specifically intended to assist individuals meet higher education costs may be categorized in two ways 1 those provisions intended to encourage taxpayers to save for future postsecondary education expenses and 2 those provisions meant to help taxpayers meet current postsecondary education expenses the first group is composed of education savings bonds section 529 or qualif ied tuition programs and coverdell education savings accounts formerly known as education iras to take advantage of these incentives taxpayers must be financially able to set aside money from current income for educational costs they or others eg their children may incur in years to come the second group includes the hope scholarship credit the lifetime learni ng credit and the higher education deduction 4 all education tax benefits share two characteristics first individuals must have federal income tax liability for the measures to be of value to them second these provisions like others in the internal revenue code irc are paid for through revenue losses to the government rather than through appropriations by the government the irc sets forth how the tax incentives dedicated to assisting individuals finance postsecondary education are coordinated with one another they interact not only with each other but also with the traditional student aid system that is to say the use of these tax provisions may affect the governments calculation of student eligibility for needbased federal financial 1 for more information see crs report rl34224 college costs and prices issues for reauthorization of the higher education act by rebecca r skinner and blake alan naughton 2 funds withdrawn from an individual retirement account ira to pay for qualified higher education expenses are exempt from the 10 tax penalty on distributions taken before age 59½ the earnings portion of withdrawals remains subject to taxation the iras owner must be the student their spouse or either of their children or grandchildren 3 these accounts are irrevocable gifts to minors parents typically act as custodians of the accounts the custodians control the accounts until minors reach age 18 or 21 depending upon the state the beneficiaries then can use the f unds for any purpose custodial accounts which are subject to taxation annually allow families to minimize their tax bills 4 for information on these measures see crs report rl31129 higher education tax credits

income tax system and the traditional federal student aid system for which congress appropriates funds generally is determined by how certain items reported on tax returns eg unearned income including interest and dividends are treated on the free application for federal student aid fafsa the fafsa is administered by the us department of education ed although the committee on ways and means in the house and the committee on finance in the senate have jurisdiction over tax matters the education and labor committee in the house and the health education labor and pensions committee in the senate have jurisdiction over education issues the 110th congress continues to work on the reauthorization of the higher education act hea pl 89329 as amended by pl 105244 during the first session of the 110th congress two major hea reauthorization proposals were introduced higher education amendments of 2007 s 1642 and the college opportunity and affordability act of 2007 hr 4137 neither of the two proposals contain provisions that would affect college savings plans this is in part because reauthorization of the hea is heavily intertwined with the budget reconciliation process the passage of the co llege cost reduction and access act ccraa of 2007 pl 11084 on september 27 2007 made significant changes to the student loan programs the pell grant program and the federal need analysis formula notably the ccraa included provisions that will change how disb ursements from the education savings plans are treated in the need analysis formula and clarified the issue of ownership of these accounts specifically for dependent students these changes have been viewed as important particularly in an era of heightened concern about the ability of families to afford postsecondary education in the face of rising college prices g22g138g161g556g3g141g159g138g151g157g138g144g142g141g561g10g146g144g145g142g155g561g7g141g158g140g138g157g146g152g151g561g21g138g159g146g151g144g156g561

education savings bond esb the program became effective in 1990 pursuant to section 6009 of the technical and miscellaneous revenue act of 1988 pl 100647 which created new section 135 in the irc it applies to otherwise eligible owners of series ee bonds issued after december 31 1989 and series i bonds bond owners are not required to indicate at the time the bond is purchased that the proceeds will be used for educational purposes taxpayers who apply the principal and interest of the bonds toward qualified higher education expenses qhees in the same year in which the bonds are redeemed may be eligible to exclude all or part of the interest earned from their income for federal tax purposes ordinarily the interest would be subject to federal income tax at the app licable marginal tax rate for individuals with tax liabilities not fully offset by their personaldependency exemptions deductions and credits for example families with income tax liabilities who are in the 15 tax bracket would pay 75 in taxes on interest of 500 015 x 500 when the bond is redeemed while family in the 25 tax httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32155g22g138g161g556

taxpayers marginal tax rate the more valuable an exclusion from income in order for the interest of bond used to pay qhees to be excluded from gross income it must have been registered in the taxpayers name andor the spouses name not in the dependent childs name alone or as coowner6 bond owners also must have reached age 24 before the issue date of the bonds7 which limits the utility of the program to students under 29 years old who file tax returns separately from their parents8 consequently the program may be more useful to persons who expect to take courses during their working lives further grandparents can only obtain federal tax savings from series ee or i bonds used to pay their grandchildrens qhees if the students are dependents on the grandparents income tax return taxpayers with students for whom they take exemptions eg themselves their spouses and their children must meet income requirements in the year in which bond proceeds are used toward qhees to claim the tax benefit persons whose modified adjusted gross income magi is 80600 or more 128400 or more for filers of joint returns in tax year 2007 may not take the exclusion9 the amount that can be subtracted from income is gradually reduced for taxpayers whose magi is above 65600 98400 for married couples filing jointly10 these income levels are adjusted annually for inflation if family at the time of bond purchase underestimates their future income they may be unable to take the income exclusion and also may have to pay more tax on the interest than if the bond had been purchased in the childs name 11 but if the bonds are in the students name it could be more disadvantageous to the students eligibility for traditional federal aid than if the bonds were in the parents name the effect on aid eligibility of who is considered an assets owner wi ll be examined later in the report 5 us savings bonds confer tax benefit whether or not they are applied toward qhees they like other us government obligations are exempt from state and local income taxes 6 otherwise eligible bonds that were bought to qualify for the esb program but were registered in the childs name may be reissued in the taxpayers andor their spouses name provided the bonds were not purchased with money belonging to the child the purchaser must complete form have their signature guaranteed or certified and submit the form along with the bonds to the appropriate regional federal reserve bank 7 before enactment of the esb benefit taxpayers could claim the dependency exemption for children of any age attending postsecondary school fulltime the revenue cost of the benefit was paid for by allowing taxpayers to claim as dependents only those children enrolled in postsecondary school fulltime who are under age 24 8 independent students who purchase bonds at age 24 would not be able to redeem them for five years if they want earnings to accumulate at the variable market rate b onds held less than five years earn lower fixed rate so the tax savings these students could obtain by redeeming the bonds in that period to pay qhees might not outweigh the lower return 9 magi usually is the same as adjusted gross income agi in the case of esbs magi is agi before taking into account the bond interest exclusion the higher education deduction and the student loan interest deduction the exclusion for adoption benefits received under an employers adoption assistance program the foreign income exclusion and the exclusion for income from sources in us territories and puerto rico and after applying the partial exclusion of social security and tier 1 railroad retirement benefits amounts deducted for contributions to individual retirement arrangements and adjustments for limitations on passive activity losses and credits 10 married couples who own bonds must file joint returns to take the exclusion 11 taxpayers who own series ee and i bonds can choose to fer recognition of interest until the bond is redeemed or they can pay tax on the interest annually as it accrues if bond is purchased in childs name and interest is recognized annually it can be offset by the childs standard deduction other taxpayers with children whose income exceeds the childs standard deduction might be better off deferring recognition of unearned income eg bond interest until the children attain age 14

savings accounts esbs may be used to pay the qhees of eligible students taking courses at the undergraduate and graduate degree level similarly to be eligible for the three tax benefits student must be enrolled in or attend college university vocational school or other postsecondary institution that participates in an edadministered student aid program table 1 provides sidebyside comparison of the major features of esbs 529 programs and coverdell accounts qualified expenses are defined as tuition and related fees contributions of esb proceeds to 529 programs and coverdell accounts also are considered qhees ie interest may be excluded from income if the bonds redeemed value is contributed to the other education savings programs taxpayers may wish to contribute esbs to the other savings vehicles if their magi were to exceed the threshold for taxfree treatment of bond interest when their dependents attend postsecondary school the bonds redeemed value is applied against adjusted qualified expenses that is qhees must be reduced by any taxfree educational assistance eg pell grants scholarships veterans educational assistance and employerprovided educational benefits if the proceeds from bond are more than the students adjusted qhees the taxpayer can exclude from income only pro rata share of the interest for example assume that 1 dependent child attends college charging the 20072008 average tuition and fees of 6185 at fouryear public institutions 12 and receives pell grant of 2400 as well as taxfree scholarship of 1100 and that 2 an esb with total value of 4000 including 2000 in interest is redeemed under these circumstances the taxpayer could exclude 67 of the bonds interest or 1340 from income 2685 in adjusted qhees6185 less 3500 in taxfree educational assistancedivided by the bonds total value whether family has tax savings from the esb program will thus depend upon whether the student receives traditional aid the composition of any aid received eg

section 529 or qualified tuition programs before their federal tax treatment was clarified by the small business job protecti on act of 1996 pl 104188 in section 529 of the irc13 the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 more recently promoted interest in 529 programs by making earnings taxexempt when withdrawn to pay qhees through december 31 2010 subsequently the pension protection act of 2006 pl 109280 made egtrras changes to section 529 plans permanent due in part to the program enhancements every state and the district of columbia is the sponsor of at least one of the two types of 529 programs and new enrollments have driven much of the growth in their value 14 as of december 31 2006 there were 93 million accounts15 their total asset value was 1057 billion16 if projections of assets totaling in the hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the decade prove correct17 the 529 program could become quite costly to the government in terms of revenue forgone ie tax expenditures and considerable source of federal support for higher education beyond appropriated funds although the value excluded from income due to the section 529 program is not available from the irs the jct estimates that the income exclusion could produce tax expenditures that double between fy2007 and fy2011 from 600 million to 12 billion18 the two types of 529 programs are the following prepaid tuition plans operate as hedge against tuition inflation contributors eg parents grandparents and nonrelatives purchase tuition credits or certificates on behalf of beneficiaries for future qhees in statesponsored programs or programs sponsored by eligible institutions of higher education including private institutions contributions to prepaid tuition plans are pooled and then invested by or on behalf of the state or institutional sponsor with the aim of at least matching the anticipated increase in tuition similar to esbs the balances in prepaid tuition plans typically can be used for tuition and required fees college savings plans in contrast function much like mutual fund by offering account owners choice among variety of investments that financial services firms typically manage for the state sponsors the value of each beneficiarys account is based upon the performance of the selected investment option which 13 it had previously appeared that earnings might be subject to taxation while they were building up inside the program the legislation clarified that the earnings would grow on taxdeferred basis 14 peter schmidt prepaidtuition plans

similar to coverdell accounts the balances in college savings plans can be used to cover the cost of attendance ie tuition fees books supplies and equipment required for enrollment or attendance room and board expenses for students enrolled on at least halftime basis and expenses for special needs beneficiaries the majority of 529 program assets were in prepaid tuition plans through 200020 the value of investments in college savings plans has increased greatly to the point that today they account for the vast majority of 529 program assets there is annual limit on contributions to beneficiarys 529 plans21 although contributions are not deductible from income for federal tax purposes many states offer deduction for state tax purposes22 there also are incomerelated restrictions for 529 program savers unlike the case with those who save through esbs and coverdells which likely makes the program particularly attractive to more affluent families federal income tax on earnings that accumulate in the plans is deferred until withdrawn in addition the earnings that have built up inside the program are exempt from tax if they are withdrawn to pay qhees both th deferral and exemption confer greater tax savings on more affluent families because of their higher marginal income tax rates if plan distributions are not used to pay the be neficiarys qhees or distributions exceed qhees the earnings are taxable income to the distributee account owner or beneficiary in addition 10 tax penalty on the earnings portion of nonqualified distributions is assessed the distributee unless the beneficiary dies becomes disabled or receives taxfree scholarship or educational allowance the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 clared that donations to 529 programs are completed gifts from contributors to beneficiaries even though account owners maintain control of the accounts eg they can change the beneficiary or have the money refunded to them contributors can give up to 12000 in 2007 as taxfree gift per beneficiary with the amount adjusted annually for inflation taxpayers with substantial resources who want to assist students can gain from special gifting provision that allows them to donate up to 60000 per beneficiary in single year or 120000 in the case of two grandparents for example by treating the payment as if it were made over five years 19 account owners are restricted to the specific investment options offered by the college savings programs they have selected however account owners are able to transfer funds between the investment options of states program without tax consequences and without changing beneficiaries once every 12 months similarly they may make nontaxable transfers of funds between programs investment options if

vocational schools or other postsecondary institutions that participate in an edadministered student aid program that is to say qhees must be reduced by any taxfree educational assistance eg pell

enables money to be saved toward the qhees of designated beneficiary who takes undergraduate or graduate courses at any college university vocational school or other postsecondary institution eligible to participate in an ed administered student aid program the trustee or custodian must be bank or another irs approved entity parent or guardian typicall is the responsible individual authorized person or manager named when the account is opened because the beneficiary is minor at that time the trustee or custodian generally has policies concerning the nature of the responsible individuals decisionmaking authority for example unlike 529 program account owner the responsible individual cannot have coverdell accounts balance refunded to them however trust or custodial agreement may allow the manager of coverdell account to change the beneficiary 23 among other things the document establishing and governing coverdell account must specify that the trustee or custodian can only accept contributions in cash like 529 program that contributions be made before the beneficiary attains age 18 except for special needs beneficiaries and that contributions to the account will not cause total contributions per beneficiary for the year to exceed the legal limit further the accounts funds cannot be invested in life insurance contracts and cannot be combined with other property except in common trust fund or common investment fund other than these restrictions contributions can be invested in any options available through the trustee such as stocks bonds mutual funds and certificates of deposit the agreement also must state that any balance in the account will be distributed to the 23 the new beneficiary must be one of the following family members of the original

other than special needs beneficiary or dies whichever is earlier earnings in coverdell accounts generally grow on taxdeferred basis which as previously noted provides greater tax savings to more affluent families because their income is subject to higher marginal tax rates in addition withdrawals from the accounts that are applied toward qualified expenses at the elementary secondary and postsecondary levels are exempt from federal income tax 24 because information on qualified withdrawals from coverdell accounts does not have to be reported on federal income tax returns the value excluded from income is not available from the irs as previously noted this also is true for the 529 program the jct estimates that the earnings exclusion of coverdell accounts could produce tax expenditures of 100 million annually during fy2007fy2011 25 of the three education savings provisions then the 529 program appears to be the most costly to the treasury ie provide the greatest benefit to taxpayers and the esb program the least costly ie provide the smallest benefit any individual taxpayer whose income is below specified levels may make aftertax contributions to coverdell accounts of up to 2000 annually per beneficiary through december 31 2010 the annual perbeneficiary contribution limitwhich was quadrupled in pl 10716 is not adjusted for inflation and will revert to 500 in 2011 absent congressional action taxfree rollovers of funds from one coverdell account to another of the same beneficiary or to certain family members of beneficiary do not count against the annual limit 26 contributions receive favorable gift and estate tax treatment although not the 5in1year provision allowed 529 program contributors as noted above also unlike the 529 program the beneficiary must pay 6 tax on excess contributions the magi of individual taxpayers who contribute to coverdell accounts in tax year 2007 must be below 110000 220000 for joint return filers27 the annual limit on contributions is gradually reduced for individual taxpayers with incomes of more than 95000 but less than 110000 more than 190000 but less than 220000 for joint return filers however parents whose incomes are above the thresholds could give taxfree gift of up to 2000 to their child who could deposit the entire amount in hisher account the income ceilings are not adjusted for inflation and will under the sunset provis ions of pl 10716 revert to 95000 and 150000 respectively after december 31 2010 contributions from corporations and taxexempt organizations eg foundation charity or union are not contingent upon income they thus may donate the maximum annual contribution to accounts of children in families with incomes in the phaseout ranges like 529 college savings plans qualified withdrawals from coverdells may pay for tuition fees books supplies and equipment required for enrollment or attendance room and board expenses 24 effective after december 31 2001 and through december

of higher education savings benefits can impact the need analysis calculation by affecting the amount determined to be available from income and assetsalso known as the expected fa mily contribution efcto contribute toward postsecondary education expenses28 to the extent that the balances in these savings vehicles assets and the withdrawals from them income are expected to be contributed toward postsecondary expenses an aid recipient would be determined to have higher efc and less financial need for federal student aid although the relationship between higher education savings benefits and federal student aid is interrelated over the years the treatment of the various types of plans in the federal need analysis calculation has differed or lacked clarity both the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 and the college cost reduction and access act of 2007 ccraa pl 11084 attempted to clarify some of the confusion surrounding the treatment of the different education savings benefits specifically the dra enacted the following changes qualified education benefit is defined as qualified tuition plan under section 529 of the irc or other prepaid tuition plan offered by state and coverdell accounts qualified education benefit shall not be considered an asset of the dependent student for the purposes of determining need for federal financial aid and the value of qualified education benefit shall be the refund value of any tuition credits or certificates purchased for prepaid tuition plans and the current balance of the account for college savings plans additionally the following provisions enacted by the ccraa will become effective july 1 2009 individuals who were in foster care at age 13 or older will be considered independent students for the purpose of applying for and receiving federal student aid 29 distributions from the education savings benefits will not be considered as income in the need analysis formula and 28 for additional information regarding the calculation of the efc see crs report rl33266 federal student aid need analysis system background description and legislative action by charmaine mercer 29 there are three separate dependency

calculating the efc consideration is given to available income combination of taxable and untaxed income and benefits and for some families available assets in addition living expenses retirement needs and federal and state tax liabilities are considered the income contribution is calculated by determining the total income of student and his or her family where applicable and determining available income by subtracting series of allowances from total income percentage of that available income is considered as an income contribution toward po stsecondary education costs contribution from assets is similarly calculated the combination of the available income contribution and asset contribution divided by the number of individuals in the family enrolled in college constitutes the

income and assets such as the net worth or the distribution from an education savings benefit the efc is further impacted by the reported ownership of the education savings benefit the need analysis calculation assesses parental income and assets at lower rate than the income and assets of dependent students discussed below parents income is afforded more generous income protection allowance ipa than is dependent students income for example for the 20072008 award year the lowest parental ipa is 12430 this amount varies by family size and the number of students in college whereas the ipa for dependent students is fixed 3000 further parental available income total income minus various allowances including the income protection allowance is taxed within the efc process on progressive schedule with an assessment rate ranging from 22 to 47 in contrast dependent students available income is assessed at fixed 50 parental assets are reduced by an education savings and asset protection allowance ie the amount of assets that is shielded from the expected family contribution that varies depending upon the age of the older parent in contrast portion of dependent students own assets is similarly sheltered from consideration more critically the discretionary net worth of parental assets net worth minus the education savings and asset protection allowance is taxed within the efc calculation at much lower rate than are the assets of dependent studentnot more than 564 for parental assets 31 and fixed 20 for dependent students assets as result of these assessments for nearly all dependent students it is more advantageous for the net worth of savings and income derived from those savings to be considered those of their parents in the efc calculation32 to illustrate consider the different amounts hypothetical dependent student will be expected to contribute toward postsecondary expenses if 10000 in savings is treated as parental asset or as hisher own based on the 20072008 rules for determining the efc for dependent student from family of four including two parents the oldest parent being 45 years of age and younger sibling with total parental income 33 of 31 the efc rules provide that the discretionary net worth of pare ntal assets is first taxed at 12 rate this determines the socalled contribution from assets that asset contribution is added to parental available income yielding adjusted available income adjusted available income is then taxed under progressive contribution table with 47 being the highest tax rate in this table as result the maximum possible contribution from the discretionary net worth of parental assets is equal to 47 of 12 or 564 32 there are two conditions under which the process described above is greatly modified particularly rendering differences in the treatment of assets inconsequential under the simplified needs test assets are considered in calculating the efc for dependent student if his or her parents agi is less than 50000 and the student and parents meet certain conditions applied to their federal income tax re turns further there is an automatic zero efc applicable when the parents of dependent student have agi that is not greater than 20000 the threshold for 20072008 award year and meet the same conditions regarding federal tax returns as apply for the simplified needs test 33 total income includes the adjusted gross income taxab income from all sources amount that is calculated for federal tax filing purposes income earned from work and untaxed income and benefits claimed for federal income tax httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32155g22g138g161g556g8g138 g159g152g155g142g141g561g10g146g144g145g142g155g561g7 g141g158g140g138g157g146g152 g151g561g21g138g159g146

5000034 that includes the 10000 education savings benefit the estimated efc is approximately 300035 if in contrast the additional 10000 in savings is treated as the students asset the efc rises to an estimated 5000 depending upon the students postsecondary expenses this difference may have substantial negative effect on hisher eligibility for federal needbased aid

and students financial need crs considered the following questions for each what does the hea specify as the efc treatment of the benefit what is eds intended policy regarding the reporting on the fafsa of the benefit and its efc treatment what guidance do fafsa filers generally have regarding how to report the benefit on the fafsa it is this last question that is perhaps the most telling regardless of what the hea requires and ed intends it is fafsa filers understanding of what they are to do on the fafsa that will determine for many students the impact these tax benefits have on

identified specifically in fact there is guidance as to whose asset the bonds should be considered if filers understand bonds to include esbs their inclusion among assets may increase the efc filers

income which they have reported on line 8b of their 1040 or 1040a federal income tax return line 8b is used to report any tax exempt interest received untaxed esb income is not explicitly identified for inclusion by the instructions for the federal income tax return in addition worksheet b has an openended request that filers provide the amount of other untaxed income not reported elsewhere on worksheets and b all of the instructions list number of examples of untaxed income and benefits such as workers compensation benefits without mentioning esbs for this question all instructions also direct the filer not to include student aid thus it is unclear whether most fafsa filers with untaxed esb income would report it on their aid application it would appear to depend in part on whether they report esb interest on line 8b of either the 1040 or 1040a federal income tax return 41 as to whom the income should be credited none of the instructions offer guidance although similar to the esb asset treatment it is likely filers would assume this is the parents income

the hea as amended by the dra delineates how section 529 prepaid tuition plans are to be treated in determining students eligibility for fe deral student aid previously the asset value of prepaid tuition plans did not have an impact on the calculation of the efc and was not reported on the fafsa rather payment of qualified expenses from prepaid tuition plan reduced students cost of attendance on dollarfordollar basis as consequence students financial need for federal needbased aid was decreased by the amount of any qualified withdrawal made from prepaid tuition planeffectively applying 100 tax rate to the distribution when determining financial need the dra amended this provision so that prepaid tuition plans are considered assets in calculating the efc furthermore the hea specifies that the value of these plans is to be determined by ascertaining the refund value of any tuition credits of certificates purchased hea section 480f3 states qualified education benefit shall not be considered an asset of student for purposes of section 475 efc calcul ation for dependent students in addition the fafsaaccompanying instructions released in january 2007 state that prepaid tuition plans should be reported as an asset of the parent if the account is owned by the parent eds april and june 2006 dear colleague letters state that the plans value shall be included in the efc calculation only if the account is owned by the parent the handbook further maintains that if the account is owned by the dependent student the value of the account is to be excluded from both the students and parents assets

as has been described withdrawals from section 52 9 plans both prepaid tuition plans and states college savings plans to pay qhees are excluded from income for federal tax purposes the hea does not explicitly address the treatment of income from these plans though section 480b14 describes the untaxed income to be c onsidered in determining the efc as including any other untaxed income and benefits 41 tax filers calculate the exclusion of interest from esbs on irs form 8815 and report the excludable interest on schedule b instructions for these forms do not direct the ta x filer to also include this interest income on line 8b

are silent with regard to the treatment of qualified withdrawals from section 529 prepaid tuition plans as noted fafsa worksheet b does ask for information on other untaxed income and benefits although the second sentence in the instructions for this openended question dont include student aid may suggest that they not report withdrawn earnings effective july 1 2009 withdrawals from prepaid ition plans to pay qhees will longer be considered income for the purposes of determining need for federal student aid42

section 480f of the hea defines assets for purposes of the efc calculation as including such savings vehicles as stocks mutual funds and qualified education benefits the handbook not only states that college savings plans are to be included as assets but also that the value of the account is considered an asset of the owner of the account unless the owner is dependent student both section 529 college savings plans and prepaid tuition plans are according to eds guidance to be treated as parental assets only if the parents are the owners because there are several instances whereby dependent student can be an owner of college savings plan or prepaid tuition plan the plans assets in those cases would not be reflected in the efc calculation 43 both sets of fafsa instructions similarly state that the college savings plans are to be treated as assets of the parents when the parent owns the account the ccraa subsequently clarified that the value of the account shall be treated as an asset of the parent when calculating the efc for dependents students matter who the account owner however this provision will not become effective until july 1 2009

the hea does not address the treatment of untaxed income from college savings plans though as noted previously it has broad requirement that other untaxed income is to be included in total income the handbook categorically states that the distribution from the account should not be treated as estimated financial assistance similarly the 2004 dear colleague letter declares that untaxed 529 distributions are not counted as parent or student income all sets of fafsa instructions are silent regarding this treatment as was described for the section 529 prepaid tuition plans see above filers could include this income among any other untaxed income and benefits called for by worksheet b or may be dissuaded by the caution in the worksheet b instructions that this unta xed income is not to include student aid44 42 provision enacted by the college cost reduction and access act of 2007 pl 11084 43 according to the college savings plan network several states allow minors to be owners of prepaid tuition and college savings plans but depending upon the age of the minor state may require that an individual be named to manage the account on the minors behalf in addition if uniform gift to minors act and uniform transfer to minors act accounts are liquidated and reinvested in section 529 plans their assets continue to belong to the student 44 the changes enacted by the ccraa regarding the treatment of withdrawals to pay qhees for prepaid tuition plans will also apply to college savings plans similarly the provision will not be effective until july 1 2009

prior to the enactment of the dra the hea did not address coverdell accounts directly coverdell education savings accounts are now defi ned as qualified education benefit for the purposes of title iv thus as in the case of 529 prepaid and college savings plans the hea now specifies that they are not considered an asset of the dependent student when calculating the efc all three dear colleague letters declare that coverdells shall be included as parental assets in the efc calculation if the parent is the account owner in the handbook ed also states that these assets are to be included and further that their value should be reported on the fafsa as an asset of the account owner unless the owner of the accounts is dependent student

the hea does not address the treatment of untaxed coverdell withdrawals beyond the language already described suggesting broad reach to the definition of untaxed income and benefits the 2004 dear colleague letter states that such income is not to be included as parental or student income in calculating the efc fafsa filers do not receive this message about what ed appears to intend because the fafsa accompanying instructions and the online instructions are silent as to the treatment of the untaxed income filers may report withdrawals from the accounts in response to worksheet bs open ended question regarding other untaxed income and benefits or consider them to be student aid excluded from that question g5g152g151g140g149g158g141g146g151g144g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 although the dra clarified the different treatment accorded prepaid tuition plans and college savings plans in the need analysis formula and the ccraa addressed the issue of account ownership and treatment of withdr awals as income in the need analysis formula one thing that remains clear is that fafsa filers do not receive clear or timely guidance either through the fafsaaccompanying instructions or the online instructions about whether and how the asset value of these taxfavored savings or the untaxed income derived from them are to be reported consequently families with similar financial and other characteristics can be treated in very different ways depending upon how they interpret the instructions they do receive or how they act in the absence of guidance
