program overview and issues overview of predisaster mitigation program purposes the purpose of the predisaster haza rd mitigation pilot program known as project impact as well as the successor predisaster mitigation pdm program is to implement hazard reduction measures prior to disaster event those measures are similar to those actions taken followi ng disaster under the authority of the section 404 hazard mitigati on grant program hmgp1 the range of eligible projects might include retr ofitting public buildings against hurricaneforce winds or seismic damage acquiring nd relocating properties out of the flood plain elevating structures in the flood plain floodproofin g public buildings vegetation management to mitigate against wildfires or constructin g or converting public spaces into safe rooms in tornadoprone areas while there would appear to be general agreement among analysts and practitioners on successful mitiga tion measures there is also continuing debate on where the line is drawn between preparedne ss for response to the next disaster and mitigation measures to lessen its impact common distinction frequently drawn is between structural and nonstructural mitiga tion structural mitigation is the building of levees to protect communities from flooding such as those constructed by the us army corps of engineers nonstructur mitigation project would be to remove structures from the flood plai n that have repeatedly experienced flood damage the essential difference is that the structural projects tend to constr uct barriers to protect communities while nonstructural projects ttempt to remove structures and their citizens from harms way the removal of homes from flood plain is an example of the type of project elig ible under hmgp and pdm context and trends when congress first appropriated f unds in fy1997 for mitigation activities before disasters occur fema established the pilot program and called it project impact the communities participating in the initial pilot program were selected by fema based on factors such as their expe rience with natural disasters the ongoing risk the community faced and the degree of collaboration among local county and state officials project impact placed most of its emphasis on community efforts to mitigate those hazards that made the community vulnerable to future damage

of gilbert fowler white boulder johnson books 2006 p 181this emphasis on communitybased efforts included the required commitment of the local governments nongovernm ental organizations the local business community as well as the development of an educational component for community awareness this approach grew out of experience which demonstrated the necessity of community buyin and active i nvolvement with mitig ation activities the study of elite attitudes and opinions with respect to disaster mitigation policies demonstrates the relatively w priority placed on natural hazards as political issues in local communities and ev at the state level it further demonstrates the relative unpopularity of nonstructural mitigation measures as compared to structural solutions to disa ster problems or to traditional relief and rehabilitation policies2 while noting the reported reticence toward nonstructural mitigation some in the field were also turning cr itical eye toward structural mitigation as panacea for the risks posed by natural hazards one obser ver spoke to the gaps in the policy area as follows structural mitigations for example encourage people to move into hazardous areas postdisaster relief tends to socialize risks lets people be insensitive to hazard risk when they build structures and so forth the current emphasis on nonstructural or land use approaches reflects concern that previous policy emphases may well have increased rather than decreased the level of population at risk from hazards3 the concept of disaster mitigation had been favorably discussed for several decades among some in the emergency management field but absent serious disaster damage during most of the 1980s it was difficult to advance the concept as one observer explained with the comparative absence of major disasters during the reagan years priorities shifted and commitment to proactive measures requiring time and money waned but in the early 1990s that attitude dramatically changed massive losses between 1989 and 1993 from five major hurricanes earthquakes and river floods resulted in mitigation making more sense to more people than at any time previously4 as noted above the good fortune of th disastersomnolent reagan years were followed by years with disasters of great scale in both human costs and financial damages the disasters included hurri cane hugo 1989 hurricane andrew 1992 the 1993 midwest floods the northridge california earthquake 1994 and hurricanes fran and floyd 1996 and 1999 ong the eastern coast of the nation the confluence of these events helped to support those in favor of proactive work to lessen the impact of disasters but little organized research had been done up to thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34537crs3 5 pl 106390

appropriations legislation the pe rtinent report language follows the conferees agree to up to 2000000 for femas participation in appropriate predisaster mitigation efforts the conf erees agree with femas director that mitigation activ ities can ultimately save significant sums from postdisaster cleanup and response actions and that the agency should be taking an increasingly active role in developing and participating in predisaster mitigation programs such programs range in scope from the development andor funding of mitigation plans for communities to pa rticipation with industries insurers building code officials government agen cies engineers researchers and others in developing systems and facilities to test structures in disasterlike circumstances the conferees understand that these activities will require an infusion of considerable upfront fina ncial support as well as the possible movement over time of disaster relief f unds to predisaster programs and the agency is expected to use up to the 2000000 provided herein in an appropriate manner to begin the process of movement toward meaningful predisaster mitigation program expenditure of these funds may not however be made until submission to the committees on appr opriations appropriate predisaster mitigation spending plan6 subsequent appropriations measures for fiscal years 1998 1999 2000 and 2001 provided 30

postdisaster mitigation help but did devote more resources to the pre disaster program in order to shift the resource balance between postdisaster mitigation and predisaster mitigation congress reduced the hmgp amount in the stafford act for postdisaster work fro m 15 of the total amount spent on the disaster less administr ative costs to 7510 while the postdisaster mitigation pot would shrink the pdm program would grow however this shifting of resources would be short lived over its dozen year history the funding levels for pdm ve risen and fallen and risen again during this time the program also was given its own separate line item account within the dhsfema budget the changes in the funding levels represented differing approaches not only to pdm but to the mitigation concept

allbaughtestimony051601shtmwhile the initial funding amounts were re latively small for national program project impact was generally considered success one author observed for example that the money was said to have worked wonders12 however some observers maintained that if funding were provided through competitive process the criteria could recognize areas with the greatest risk and where mitigation measures could produce the most beneficial results rather than areas that may have experienced random disasters but did not necessarily face as grave an ongoing threat these differences resulted in project impact being eliminated from the fy2002 budget on the same day that the mayor of seattle was praising the program for preventing further damage in coincidence of timing the nisqually earthquake struck seattle and the northwest region on the same day the bush administration removed project impact from the federal budget13 when the pdm authorizing legisl ation dma2k was passed congress addressed some of the same themes used in project impact but placed the responsibility on the governor of each state to suggest up to five communities to be considered for predisaster mitigation assistance14 while the governor nominated potential grantees fema made the final lections in addition under the statute fema had the discretion under extraordinar circumstances to award grant to local government that had not been recommended by governor15 in 2002 fema decided to rebrand project impact the predisaster mitigation pdm program while this title conformed to the legislative language it also was intended to send nother message as then fema director joe m allbaugh explained i want to take the concept of project impact and fold it in to the program of mitigation project impact is not mitigation it is an initiative to get consumer buyin in many communities it became the catchphrase to get local leaders together to look at ways to do mitigation16 for fy2003 and

congress and made pdm competitive grant program thereafter18 while the authorization of pdm in fy 2000 had recognized at minimum the potential benefit of mitigation prior to disaster ev ents the substantial funding increase beginning in fy2003 was one com ponent of different overall approach this new approach was targeted not only to predisaster mitigation but to mitigation in general it represented shift in thinking regarding the most appropriate time to devote resources to mitigation in disasterprone communities some had suggested that the hazard mitigation grant program hmgp in the stafford act section 404 which provides funding to state following major disaster to mitigate future disaster damage was taking the wrong approach or more precisely was in the wrong sequence since the funds arrive after the disaster event and are only available to states that have suffered the impact of disaster they cannot be targeted at areas that might have greater risk of more costly disaster that has not yet occurred predisaster mitigation th ey argued would be more effective however others contended that only co mmunities that have had recent disaster experience have the immediate incentive in the form of community commitment borne of experience to take the steps necessa ry to reduce the risk of future disasters as one writer in the field has noted it is imperative to garner community support around specific action this is especially true when those mitigation measures involve cranking up the machinery of government which some contend is especially prone to inertia mitigation measures are also most effective when they have the broad support from the greatest number of people across broad section of the community19 postkatrina mitigation funding and the mitigation studies following hurricane katrina congress chose to reinstate the hmgp to its previous level of 15 for the majority of disasters and estab lished new graduated scale for larger events20

direct fema costs but corollary and indirect savings from mitigation at the local level and within the business sector with an impact or ripple effect on the surrounding communities the study we ighed damages that were not always previously considered when calculating savings such as business interruption and environmental costs the study releas ed in 2005 before the hurricane season provided foundation for mitigation that was previously based on anecdote and conjecture the mhmc study listed areas of savings within communities from mitigation and also moved to macro level and focused on the longterm beneficial effects mitigation activities w ould have on the federal tr easury on an annual basis23 building on the mhmc study in 2007 the congressional budget office issued its report on predisaster mitigation cost savings while using slightly different assumptions and cognizant of federal spending time lines that report also noted proportional savings derive d from the pdm program24

competitive and formula grants during fy2007 congress increased pdm funding to 100 million and for fy2008 raised that amount to 114 million in recognition of the larger appropriated levels congress directed fema to implement the state minimum of 500000 specified in the stafford act25 for eligible submitted projects26 this formula in effect made pdm both competitive and formuladriven program the implementation of the state minimum also served to retain interest in mitigation for states that may not have been competitiv nor experienced recent disasters but the overall change in formula created new kind of hybrid program in which grants would continue to be awarded through competitive process and also through guaranteed formula amounts for each state 500000 with eligible projects or plans for example from total program amount of 100 million up to 25 million is in the formula pool and the remaining 75 million is available for the competitive grants the congressionally directed spendi ng for fy2008 pdm grants the first earmarks for the pdm program accounts fo r over 50 million or 44 of the funding after factoring in state minimums the av ailable amount for open competitive grants could be reduced from three quarters to just over third of the total funds fema has several other prog ram rules that govern the size of respective grants states and territories that submitted less than 500000 in applications received the amount requested provided those applications are determined to be eligible the maximum pdm award for any one state shall not exceed 17 million there is 1 million cap on federal share available for plans and single federal share cap of 3 million for projects27 the administration has requested 75 million for fy2009 the congressional budget justification submitted to congress for the fy2009 budget notes the 39 million reduction from the fy2008 level but does not offer any comment or explanation for the change some have suggested that the seeming carryover amount between fy2007 and fy2008 of more than 65 million may have contributed to the conclusion that additional f unding was not needed fema has noted that since pdm funds are noyear funds with great amount of state and local participation in the process the lag time on the expenditure of funds is practical part of program administration fema has also emphasized that funds being carried

mitigation debate that as the program purposes and funding criteria section of this report explains has been with the pdm program since its inception issues for congressional consideration as congress

noted that fema allocated just over 131 million of the pdm funds for project grants from that total approximately 98 million or about 75 was awarded at the time of the report in response to the gao findings fema explained that the remaining unoblig ated balance of funds was due to about 40 of the projects submitted not being eligible according to program guidelines fema also contended that relatively shor t application period helped to account for the lack of eligible applications33 mitigation projects can be complicated to put together since their impact may be spread across various sectors of communities and can also require local consensus and contribution of resources the state and local cost share is 2534 fema staff also suggest that pdm f unds much like femas disaster relief funds drf are available until expe nded since under the pdm programs guidance the funds can be used for up to th ree years from the date of the award there is less urgency to get funds out immedi ately and more time for communities to develop effective projects and plans and more time for fema through peer review process to carefully review the submitted projects and plans the perception of

should be av ailable to mitigate the effects of terrorist events the res ponse of some pdm advocates is one that applies not only to purpose but particularly to the overall balance of resources in mitigation and preparedness programs some participants in this debate have noted that while some projects may arguably be considered preparedness or mitigation there is little similarity be tween funding amounts availa ble for those two purposes nor for the programs addressing terrorism while funding for the pdm program now exceeds 100 million the amounts for preparedness efforts for allhazard

state and local governments interested in participating in the program are expected to identify natural disaster hazards in areas under their jurisdiction for mitigation work42 projects and plans as noted earlier the pdm grants for protecting public buildings or private residences are the awards most closely associated with pdm projects tend to be costly and relatively large in scale when committed to relocating neighborhoods or building large safe rooms or similar work however another significant category of eligible work under the pdm program is the creation or improvement of hazard mitigation plans for community or state with the passage of pl 106390 the disaster mitigation act of 2000 dma2k planning took on much greater significance in addition to authorizing pdm dma2k also authorized the requirement for mitigation planning and authorized increasing the share of hmgp grants from 15 to 20 of total disaster spending for states with an enhanced mitigation plan43 the complementary nature of the stafford act hazard mitigation authorities is arguably evident when stat use pdm funds to develop the enhanced plans that when approved result in higher levels of hmgp

fema received initial requests totaling 134 million in fy2007 fema had 100 million available for grants and received requests for 292 million47 given the limit of five applications per state it is reasonable to suggest that the amount s requested could have been even higher absent that limitation funding criteria the authorizing legislation for pdm sets fo rth an array of funding criteria the criteria focus on elements such as the nature of the hazard the degree of commitment of and coordination by the state and local governments includi ng consistency with appropriate mitigation plan and the extent to which prioritized costeffective mitigation activities can produce clear results48 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34537crs16 49 interview with mike grimm deputy director risk reduction division

and project activities fema staff noted that they have derived much of the suggested changes to the eligibility listings from the peer review panels composed of local practitioners in the mitigationemergency management field that review applications each year it is the intent of the program staff to provide more clarity for pplicants by providing such list49 the ineligible activities list for fiscal year 2008 contains 8 items related to pdm planning and 23 ineligible activities for the pdm project grants for the latter category this is an increase for fy 2007 the number of ineligible activities was 1650 the list broadly supports compliance with practices such as environmental and historic preservation and the coastal ba rrier resources act cbra but other excluded items such as the construction of levees or flood mapping are arguably seeking to ensure that pdm planning or project funds do not dup licate similar efforts funded by other programs however some observers argue that the fema interpretation of eligible pdm projects has grown overly restri ctive particularly with regard to equipment purchases to address different hazards for example some observers believe that the purchase of warning or alert notifications systems s hould be an eligible expense for pdm it should be noted that warning systems and other gray areas can be funded through the hmgp programs 5 initiative that was put in place dozen years ago this was established to allow some flexibility for actions that may or may not meet cost effectiveness criteria51 others suggest that the purchase of generators under the pdm program should be elig ible beyond the standards for such purpose in the program guidance52 the arguments over indivi dual categories and projects are symbolic of the overarching effort to diffe rentiate the concepts of preparedness and mitigation length of authorization the pdm program has been reauthorized previously in four different pieces of legislation initially for three years then two oneyear reauthorizations through appropriations bills and th another three year authorization from 2005 to 200853 the current authorization expires at the end of the current fiscal year september 30 2008 the original sunset date in pl 106390 december 31 2003 was intended to provide time for more information to be gathered on the efficacy of predisasterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34537crs17 mitigation some of that has been evidenced in both the multi hazard mitigation council report as well as the report by the congressional budget office the recurrent sunset date howev er has set the pdm program apart from the rest of the stafford act which is freestanding noyear authorization congress might be inclined to put the pdm program on equal footing with the rest of the stafford act and have an ongoing noyear authorization on the other hand it can be argued that some of the stafford act provisions are so vital to emergency situations eg bris removal tempor ary sheltering and lodging that not having to seek reauthor ization on regular basis is practical and effective approach to the legislation conversely since the pdm program is voluntary grant program some might cont end having three to four year re authorization cycle provides incentives to all participants to refine and improve the program in anticipation of c ongressional oversight methods of awarding pdm funds when the pilot program project imp act was initiated in 1997 an emphasis was placed on the communities selected by fema that selection was based on the communities disaster history the invol vement of communitybased organizations in mitigation work the participation of the local business community and the commitment of the state and local governments there was some concern at the time on the part of state emergency management officials that they were not sufficiently involved during the project selection proce ss the switch to competitive process also reflected some of those factors that project impact employed but also placed greater emphasis in light of statutory nguage on costbenefit ratios also since funding for planning was made elig ible the program opened up to many communities that desired an improved mitigation plan for the overall awards process congress generally has come to direct the pdm program in annual appropriations law rather than through congressional hearings specifically on the pdm program and resulting authorizing legislation state emergency managers have stated their position that competitive process may tend to limit smaller states ability to access program like pdm echoing the tenets of federalism they would like funds made availabl to each state and decisions made at the state and local level concerning the hazards that pose the most significant threats and the areas that could benef it most from pdm funding as one state emergency management director speakin g on behalf of the national emergency management associati on nema testified attempting to prioritize limited predisas ter mitigation funding on the national level is counterproductive to the estab lishment of state and local planning therefore nema supports the distribution of predisaster mitigation funds by base plus population formula rather than by competitive grants the competitive system as it is presently funded creates mo re losers than winners in an enterprise that seeks to encourage communities to engage to protect themselves it seemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34537crs18 54 testimony of james mullen mitigation chair

pit good programs against g ood programs when the objective is that predisaster mitigation programs be undertaken54 since 2007 in addition to the competitiv process the pdm program has also implemented 500000 minimum per state for elig ible projects or plans given the amount of appropriations this minimum am ount means that close to 25 of funds may now be awarded outside of the competitive process congress may consider examining if they wish the pdm program to return to its initial form of selection by governors and the president or have strictly competitive grant process third option is the present configuration of hybrid program that is predominantly competitive but with some flexibility for awards for every state congress can also consider if it wishes to continue with congressionallydirected spending that was initiated in fy2008 and if so at what level since it accounted for nearly half of all spending congress may also wish to re view the suggested amounts and percentages that are now part of the administrative formula employed by fema and make those designated amounts part of the legislation an entirely different approach would be to make structural change in program delivery under this proposal the pd m program and the hmgp program would move from fema to newly created federal mitigation and recovery authority in the aftermath of katrina there has been criticism of femas uncertain role in longterm recovery as opposed to its initia l role in delivering emergency response programs such as temporary housing the latter also drew criticism but femas authority and responsibility was not in ques tion some have suggested separate authorityorganization with expertise in the rebuilding cycle could be partnered with mitigation programs in this way two important phases building back safer while also making communities more res ilient could recei ve separate but complementary attenti on pdm requires planning and communitywide participation as does recovery the roles fema is expected to assume are diverse and require very different skills some experts have noted the differing roles may not be complementary however it is not clear to us that ins titutional arrangements that are appropriate for implementing emergency measures after disaster has occurred crisis response are also the appropriate institutional arrangements for longterm forward planning of mitigation measures before disaster has occurred given the three levels of government with jurisdictional mandates in this context which in turn may not be appropriate for planning

submit their application through their local government this process assures knowledge and approval by local authorities such an approach can also combine the perspective of the nonprofit w ith the interest of the community as whole the current system appears to be reasonable construct for communication and cooperation at the local vel however it also means that the local government must move promptly and make submission adhering to program rules for project without their own direct ownership or administrative interest when in particular circumstances this could be burden on local government with limited resources the plans or projects could also be submitted through state government as well in order to improve the efficiency of the competitive process it may be possible to permit ngos to submit their project dir ectly to fema however this should be done with the requirement that the appli cation has been at minimum shared with the local government at the same time so that they may be not only aware of the project but in agreement that the projects comports with local mitigation planning this approach was suggested recently in tes timony by an official of an association of local government emergency managers56 this type of approach would also give the local or state offici als the opportunity to comment on the project proposal others have suggested that an ngo app lication for pdm grant must be part of the state or local hazard mitigation plan current fema guidance already states that requirement57 since fema has placed priority on the plans the instructions for ngos that currently are part of the program guidance could be added to legislative language the legislative cr iteria for pdm only require that projects submitted by state or local government be consistent with the mitigation plan58 project eligibility there are number of project activitie s that are ineligible under femas program guidance for the pdm program some of the

crux of this debate are warning systems many communities have sought to use pdm funds to purchase warning systems such as sirens to protect their citizens against sudde n disasters fema considers such alert notification systems as eligible under disa ster preparedness grants but not under the pdm program similarly fema has previously determined that the purchase of standalone generators is preparedness effort to address the likely results of disaster rather than mitigating its effect one exception is the purchase of generators that will power mitigation effort for example generator providing power to activate hurricane storm shutters would be eligible generators that provide power for critical public facilities may also be eligible for fy2008 some of the congressionally earmarked projects for pdm include some of the activities listed as ineligible in femas program guidance such as fire suppression activities and the purchase or enhancement of emergency alert and notification systems such designations do not involve differences over the location of grants but their purposes congress ma wish to express its disagreement with femas guidance or it may direct fema

norton queried panelists on evaluating the status and quality of local codes and zoning as part of the assessmen t of pdm grant proposals it could be argued that appropriate codes would best reflect the degree of commitment by state or local government that the stafford act lists as consideration60 while representative norton did not endorse that approach she was interested in hearing from panelists representing state and local officials panelist jim mullen of washington state noted the difficult and leng thy process in changing code other experts have pointed out the opposition th at such proposed changes can generate within community developers builders and other economic interests including individual property owners often oppose the adoption of stri ct landuse regulations and building standards and too often successfully prevent their adoptions they argue that such regulations will increase the cost of building reduce the value of property limit the prerogatives of property owners in terms of what they can and cannot do with their property and make it more difficult to sell the property to othershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34537crs21 61 william l waugh jr living

1999 p 102in large measure their arguments are valid the question however is whether those concerns outweigh the potential costs of not mitigating disasters61 local codes and zoning can arguably be considered the strongest commitment to mitigation that can be made by governmental entity that approach the insistence on strong local codes has been part of the national flood insurance program nfip since its inception nfip regu lations stipulate that as criterion for participation in the flood insurance program community must demonstrate the adequacy of communitys flood plai n management regulations these local regulations must be legally enforceable applied uniformly throug hout the community to all privately and publicly owned land w ithin floodprone mudslide ie mud flow or floodrelated erosion areas and the commun ity must provide that regulations take precedence over any less restrictive conflicting local laws ordinances or codes62 shifting more of the pdm program to code or zoning threshold could challenge communities to greater commitment than current program criteria as one observer has noted dominant federal role may appear logical in the context of overall disaster spending nd in its purpose to save lives and protect property however the perceived federal leadership and funding also may come at price beyond the budgetary the perception of federal benevolence discourages responsible hazard mitigation among nonfederal interests thus contri buting to the potential for greater losses in future disasters shirking respons ibility for hazard mitigation among states and local governments may take two forms 1 unwillingness to expend their own funds for disaster planning and haza rd mitigation and 2 avoidance of the political and fiscal burdens of regulating land use in areas subject to natural hazards63 while strong and effective codes may reduce the impact of hazards local officials it may be argued are weighing other considerations regarding economic growth for the community which in turn contributes to the support of many other local governmental obligations add itionally the pdm program is voluntary communities participating in the program are taking the initiative to protect their citizens and their property in most cas these communities are also paying the 25 cost share for the project or plan nother consideration is that for program that has been criticized for its pace of ex penditures linking such spending to the development of codes or changes in z oning laws would likely create far more

appropriations to the drf 66 us department of homeland security federal emergency management agency mitigation directorate grant applications guidancemultiple mitigation programs final issue for congress is to once again consider the pdm program within the context of federal hazard mitigation policy as whole however that whole is divided among varying approaches involving timing targeted funding for particular hazards notably flooding and sepa rate funding accounts within fema earlier in this report the relationship was noted between the pdm program and the postdisaster hmgp program in ddition to those two programs fema also administers the flood mitigation assistan ce program fma which is part of the flood insurance program the repetitive fl ood claims program rfc and the severe repetitive loss program srl these five mitigation grant programs have some differences but generally fund similar projects the history behind the programs indicates congressional intent to ddress specific problems and also provide discretion to state and local government s in the manner they choose to address specific hazards in discussing the overall impact of its programs femas mitigation directorate has reported that the existing mitigation grant programs awarded more than 4442 million to 1050 projects and plans nationwide in 200764 the majority of that funding came from the hmgp program wh ich receives its funding on formula basis from the disaster relief fund drf65 the other programs such as pdm fma and the repetitive loss programs ar individual accounts funded through the annual appropria tions process the mitigation directorate at fema has taken steps to if not totally blend the programs make sure that the programs ar complementary good example of this approach is that the guidance provided for grant applications stresses early on that it does seek to integrate programs by allowing applications to be considered by other mitigation programs66 an issue for congressional considerati on is whether the programs should be combined for greater and more consistent impact subject for consideration is that the damage reductions accomplished by these mitigation programs are reflected in smaller payments from the drf for future disaster events given that fact an argument can be made that funding fo r combined mitigation program could come from the drf through an annual allocation rather than for separate events and separate accounts combined program could addr ess all hazards as is the case with the pdm and hmgp programs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34537crs23 67 matthew m johnson subcommittee approves homeland security spending congressional quarterly june 11 2008 at httphomelandcqcomhsdisplaydodocid 2894910sourcetype6an additional argument can be made that eventual savings from mitigation activities would accrue to not only the na tional flood insurance program nfip but also the private insurance industry as losse s are reduced for that reason it might be argued payments for at least one program the fma should continue to come from the nfip this view of mitigation may also be an argument for the federal government and states to consider encouraging mitigation approaches through private insurers by insisting on the adoption and implementation of mitigation measures similar to the process the nfip employs concluding observations over the last decade the predisaster mitigation program has developed and grown as mitigation itself has become accepted federal policy adoption and expansion of mitigation as beneficial approach for government has been bolstered by studies that demonstrated cost reduc tions following disasters due to earlier mitigation investments appraisal of the pdm program is ope n to different interpretations and conclusions while program staff at fema point to program with flexibility and an appreciation of the regulatory challenges faced by commun ities carrying out mitigation projects other observers see what appears to be the contrary citing unspent funds and perceived rigidity in program guidance that hinders the flexibility of local governments in accessi ng the pdm funding and in using it in manner they choose the majority of the program funds is spent on mitigation projects but substantial portion of the funding is spent on the development and improvement of state and cal mitigation plans the remainder of funds are spent for technical and administrative assistance or held back for reconsideration for some awards in fy2008 congress directed the funding of some pdm projects for the first time the earmarks were broadly distribut ed as previous pdm funding has been the congressional earmarks represented 44 of funds available for the competitive and setaside pdm grants the congressi onally directed grants also funded some projects that do not appear to be in accord with femas program guidance as the fy2009 appropriations are considered it ppears from early actions in the house that the pdm program may again receive significant number of earmarks67 the 110th congress is considering the rea uthorization of the pdm program the legislation under consideration extends the program and also would codify in law previous program practices with some adjustments in addition there are broader considerations the congress may wish to take up regarding federal mitigation policy in the future
