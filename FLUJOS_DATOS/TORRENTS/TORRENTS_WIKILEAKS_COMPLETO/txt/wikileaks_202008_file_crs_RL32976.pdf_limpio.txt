extension to fy2007 like s 1197 however pl 109162 clarifies that funds provided for casa may be used to initiate sustain and expand casa programs prior law generally limited the purpose of these f unds to initiating or expanding casa programs also like s 1197 the final gislation authorizes state and local casa programs to request criminal background checks for prospective volunteers from the federal bureau of investigation fbi and stipulates that programs that make such request are required to pay for reasonabl costs associated with the fbi check6 finally pl 109162 includes two provisions
