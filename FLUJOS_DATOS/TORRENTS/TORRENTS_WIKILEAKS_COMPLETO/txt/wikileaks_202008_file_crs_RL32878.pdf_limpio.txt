it would be erroneous however to assume that cases in which cloture is sought are the same as those in which filibuster occurs cloture may be sought when filibuster is taking place and filibusters may occur without cloture being sought until 1949 cloture could not be invoked on nominations and before 1980 this action was attempted only twice from the 96th congress 19791980 through the 102nd 19911992 cloture was never sought on more than three nominations in single congress but since then this level has been exceeded three times from 1949 through 2004 cloture was s ought on 49 nominations and invoked on 21 except in the 103rd congress 19931994 most of the nominations involved have been judicial fourteen of the 49 nominees were not c onfirmed all of whom were among the 18 on whom the

occupy more than one hour in debatecloture attempts on nominations cloture filibusters and how they differ senate rules place genera l limits on how long consideration of nomination or most other matters may last owing to this lack of general time limits opponents of nomination may be able to use extended debate or other delaying actions to prevent final vote from occurring although voting majority of senators may be prepared to vote for nominee the nomination cannot be confirmed as long as other senators presumably voting minority are able to prevent the vote from occurring the use of debate nd procedural actions for the purpose of preventing or delaying vote is filibuster the motion for cloture is the only pro cedure by which the senate can vote to place time limits on its considerati on of matter it is th erefore the senates most usual means of attempting to overcome filibuster when the senate adopts cloture motion on matter known as invoking cloture further consideration of the matter is limited to 30 hours1 by invoking cloture the nate may be able to ensure that question will ultimately co to vote and can be decided by voting majority the cloture rule permits senators to m ove for cloture repeatedly if necessary the senate however can impose the constr aints of cloture only by supermajority vote for most matters including nominati ons threefifths of the full senate or 60 votes is required to invoke cloture as result even if majority of senators support nomination opponents may still be able to prevent vote on it by defeating any attempt to invoke cloture alt hough the nomination itself can always be approved by simple majority of senators present and vo ting the support of super majority may be required to limit consideration and enable the senate to reach vote while cloture affords the senate means of overcoming filibuster it is erroneous to assume that cases in which cloture is sought are always the same as those in which filibuster occurs cloture may be sought when filibuster is taking place and filibusters may occur without cl oture being sought the reason is that cloture is sought by supporters of matte r while filibusters are conducted by its opponents leaders of the majority party or other supporters may move for cloture even when opponents do not assert that they are attempting filibuster or when nohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32878crs2 2 these questions of method are discussed in more detail in richard s beth what we dont know about filibusters paper presented at the annual meeting of the western

congress 99th cong 1st sess washington gpo 1985 pp 17 21 3839 105112extended debate or delaying actions have actually occurred they may do so in response to threat or perceive d threat of filibuster or simply in an effort to speed action it is also possible for opponents of matter to engage in filibuster without supporters deciding to move for cloture supporters may refrain either because they think they lack the votes to obtain cloture because they believe they can overcome any delaying actions and reach vote without cloture or because they hope to resolve the matter in dispute by so negotiated accommodation th is situation may be less common today but does seem to have occu rred in relation to nominations in earlier times if cloture is not an automatic indicator of filibuster neither is any other specific procedural action filibuster is matter of inte nt any course of action by opponents of matter may be filibuster if it is undertaken with the purpose of blocking or delaying vote yet any of th procedural actions that might be used to delay or block vote might also be used for other purposes as result filibusters cannot simply be identified by explicit or uniform criteria and there is commonly accepted set of criteria for doing so in stead determining wh ether filibuster is occurring in any specific case typically re quires degree of subjective judgment for these reasons it would be misuse of the following data identifying nominations on which cloture was sought to treat them as identifying nominations subjected to filibuster it would equally be misinterpretation to assume that all nominations on which cloture was not sought were not filibuste red especially for periods before cloture could be moved on nominations as described in the next section this report pr ovides data only on nominations on which cloture motions were offered it is not to be taken as providing systematic da ta on nominations that were or were not fili bustered it would not be feasib to develop list of measures filibustered unless commonly accepted single standard for identifying what constitutes filibustering could first be established2 at most the data presented here may be regarded as identifying some potentially likely cases in which filibuster by some appropriate definition may have occurred frequency of cloture attempts on nominations the senate first adopted cloture ru in 1 917 until 1949 cloture could be moved only on legislative measures and nominations could not be subjected to cloture attempts3 from 1949 through 2004 81st108th congresses

delegation to the conference on s ecurity and cooperation in europe csce in 1994 and dr henry foster to be surgeon general of the united states in 1995 historical development of cloture attempts on nominations even after senate rules began to permit cloture on nominations in 1949 cloture was sought on none until 1968 when motion to proceed to consider the nomination of supreme court associate

request in 1969 and 1970 the nominations of clement f haynsworth and g harrold carswell to the supreme court were defeated after lengthy debate but clotur motion was filed on either when the senate considered the nomination to the supreme court of william h rehnquist late in the 1971 session however cl oture was quickly sought though the senate did not invoke clotur 5242 the nomination wa s subsequently confirmed in 1975 the majority required for invoki ng cloture on most matters including nominations was changed from twothirds of senators present and voting to three fifths of the full membership of the senate normally 605 this change in the rules generally meant that the threshold for invoking cloture was lowered if all 100 senators participated in the vote the prev ious rule required the votes of 67 to invoke cloture the new rule required 60 vot regardless of how many senators participated cloture was sought on other nomina tion until 1980 that occurrence was the first in which cloture was sought on nomination to an executive branch position that of william g lubbers to be genera l counsel of the na tional labor relations board cloture was invoked and the nomination was confirmed table 2 frequency and success of cloture attempts on nominations by time period 19492004 congresses and yearsnominations on which cloture was moved invoked number average per

nominations has increased in recent years development that reflects the trend in the overall frequency of cloture motions before the 103rd congress cloture was sought on as many as three nominations only in the 96th congress 19791980 and the 99th congress 19851986 since then however this level has been exceeded three times cloture was sought on 12 nominations in the 103rd congress 19931994 five in the 107th 2001 2002 and 14 in the 108th 20032004 these three congresses were also the only ones since 1981 in which the presidency senate and house were all controlled by the same political party6 in addition the 103rd andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32878crs5 107th congresses were each the first of new presidency so that the number of nominations to be considered was presumably especially large table 2 also indicates that as the frequenc of cloture attempts on nominations has increased the frequency of their success has tended to decrease this relationship appears to suggest that clotur is now being sought more often in cases when it is unlikely to be invoked this shift was evident especially in the 103rd congress when cloture was successfully invoked on only four of the 12 nominations where attempted and in the 108th congress when it was invoked on none of the 14 nominations on which it was attempted in other congresses the proportion of cloture attempts that succeeded has generally been much higher in the 108th congress 20032004 the pattern of senate acti on on nominations on which cloture was sought displayed seve ral distinctive features first the maximum number of cloture motions offered on each nomination was higher than ever before in earlier congresses as many as three cloture moti ons had been offered on single nomination only on three occasions two in 1980 and one in 1994 in the 108th congress by contrast one nomination was subjected to seven cloture motions and another to four second when the senate sought cloture on nomination but was unable to confirm it the senate in the 108th congress retained the nomination on its calendar until final adjournment in earlier congresses nominations that were not confirmed after cloture attempts were typically either withdrawn or returned to the president both these shifts may represent indications of an increased intensity with which supporters of these nominations were attempting to secure senate votes on them table 3 cloture action on judicial and executive nominations by time period 19672004 congresses and yearsjudicial executive cloture invokedcloture not invokedcloture

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32878crs6 positions in relation to which cloture was sought most of the nominations on which clot ure has been attempted have been to clearly secondary or subordinate positions only three have been to the supreme court and two to offices at the level of the presidents cabinet in general most nominations on which cloture has been soug ht have been to positions on the federal bench this circumstance perhaps reflects the senates traditional inclination to permit the president generally wide latitude in selecting officials to serve under him in executive branch positions only in the 103rd congress was cloture sought chiefly on nominations to positions in the executive branch of the 12 nominations on which cloture action occurred during the 103rd congress 10 were for executive branch positions except in that congress most nominations on which cloture has been soug ht have been to the federal courts table 3 summarizes the outcomes of cloture acti on on
