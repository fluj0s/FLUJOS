ukraine iraq and lebanon where freedom is on the march1 the administration states that the united states must help kyrgyzstan to combat corruption to reform its constitution and otherwise to become model to other countries of reforming market democracy that is at peace with its neighbors and is integrated into the world economy us aid also seeks to enhance kyrgyzstans sovereignty and territorial integrity to prevent weapons proliferation and to combat transnational terrorism and criminal activities including trafficking in persons and narcotics state department congressional budget justification for foreign operations for fy2007 constitutional reform to reduce overweening presidential power was major rallying cry during kyrgyzstans tulip revolution spurring these calls were memories of frequent constitutional changes orchestrated over the years by former president askar akayev to increase his power at the expense of the legislature postindependence constitution had been drawn up in 1993 with input from international jurors that created strong presidency but that also provided for some countervailing legislative powers and for extensive human rights protections akayev complained in 1994 however that this 1 weekly compilation of presidential documents commencement address at the united states naval academy in annapolis maryland may 27 2005 pp 891896 crs2 constitution was too idealistic since the kyrgyz people are not prepared for democracy and said that transitional period was needed he decreed referendums in 1994 1996 1998 and 2003 that whittled away legislative power despite these successive restrictions the legislature at times asserted itself in lawmaking and oversight many people both inside and outside kyrgyzstan were hopeful that legislative election scheduled for february 2005 might mark progress in democratization observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce who monitored the race concluded however that serious irregularities had taken place after the vote protests began in southern kyrgyzstan and spread throughout the country in march in the wake of what many citizens regarded as fraudulent second round of voting in districts where the earlier vote was inconclusive and president akayev fled the country kurmanbek bakiyev party leader active in the protests was named acting president and won presidential election in july 2005 that the osce praised as generally respecting fundamental civil and political rights virtually all of the legislators elected in februarymarch retained their seats purportedly because bakiyev feared that new elections might exacerbate political instability httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22546 deliberations over new constitution proved highly contentious with bakiyev seeking to protect numerous presidential powers that many legislators and others wanted to curtail facing rising criticism against this stance bakiyev in march 2006 appointed one of the critical legislators azimbek beknazarov to head up working group to draft three alternative constitutions one with strong presidential powers one with strong legislative powers and one with mixed system in september 2006 these drafts were released for public discussion frustrated by what they viewed as dilatory tactics by bakiyev many parties and nongovernmental organizations ngos formed for reforms bloc in january 2006 to press for constitutional and other reforms it sponsored large rallies in april and may to demand that bakiyev agree by september 2006 on new constitution limiting his powers after this deadline passed for reforms announced that new protests would be held recent developments thousands of supporters of for reforms and others launched daily rallies outside the kyrgyz legislature and presidential buildings on november 2 2006 demands included that president bakiyev and prime minister feliks kulov resign if they did not quickly accede to constitutional reforms to create more balanced separation of powers on november 6 bakiyev submitted draft constitution to the legislature that retained substantial presidential authority but the for reforms members of the legislature vowed to enact their own version bakiyev and kulov publically denounced this as coup attempt later on november 7 demonstrators outside the legislature supporting bakiyev violently clashed with critics of bakiyev resulting in some injuries this violence was denounced by both bakiyev and the for reforms legislators and they formed small team to quickly work out compromise draft late on november 8 the legislature approved this draft and it was signed by bakiyev the next day among the innovations the november 2006 constitution established mixed voting system for new legislature to be elected in 2010 with onehalf of the members elected by party lists and onehalf in singlemember constituencies the legislature would be increased from 75 to 90 seats and the body would have more influence over budget crs3 legislation the main party winning seats in the legislature would nominate the prime minister and cabinet the president would appoint the head of the central bank the central election commission and the prosecutorgeneral only after parliaments approval the national security service nss would be placed under the purview of the prime minister rather than as is presently the case under the personal control of the president some critics warned that the agreement by the two sides that the sitting legislature and government would be retained until 2010 created great uncertainty about how constitutional laws would apply in the interim period new strife between the two sides was assured these critics argued2 appearing to bear out this prediction battle developed in december 2006 when bakiyev and kulov accused the legislature of being tardy in approving 2007 budget and passing laws on privatization political parties and the election code according to some reports bakiyev and kulov decided that if the ministerial government resigned legal uncertainties surrounding how new government would be formed might convince the legislature to disband and hold elections kulov announced the governments resignation on december 19 but most legislators balked at dissolution following veiled threat by bakiyev on december 30 2006 that he would httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22546 dissolve the legislature it agreed to his ultimatum to enact another constitution that restores his power to appoint the prime minister ministers and regional governors and to directly oversee the nss during the transition period up to 2010 in return bakiyev dropped or postponed his demand for new legislative elections this december 2006 constitution which bakiyev states he soon will sign reportedly retains most of the innovations of the november version except for the provisions on executive power implications for kyrgyzstan according to some observers the contention over political powersharing between the legislature and the executive branch may well continue despite the enactment of the december 2006 constitution they argue that more careful drafting of constitutional provisions and implementing laws might have eased some of this wrangling including by competing regional and clan interests perhaps troubling the maneuvering that resulted in kulov stepping down as prime minister could exacerbate regional and clan tensions if bakiyev does not reappoint kulov or make other concessions to the northern interests that support kulov the balance between these interests and southern interests that support bakiyev may be broken3 while for reforms and other bakiyev opponents appeared to gain influence with the enactment of the november 2006 constitution they appeared to lose influence when they boycotted the december 30 legislative session that restored some of bakiyevs powers if the legislature becomes more cooperative it might support kyrgyzstans participation in debt relief offered by the international monetary fund and world bank the heavily indebted poor countries initiative as advocated by bakiyev and kulov for reforms supporters and others have raised concerns about bakiyevs commitment to democratization such as his praise for russianstyle vertical of power from the 2 daniel sershen conflict over constitution

in the executive branch4 other observers suggest that despite the enactment of the december 2006 constitution that ostensibly restores the akayev system of strong presidential power bakiyev will find it difficult to reverse pluralist trends that are defended by civil society likewise the legislatures capitulation on the constitutional change may not avert calls for its dissolution5 these calls may well increase since the popularity gained by the legislature in 2006 while it challenged presidential power seemed reduced in early 2007 by its capitulation to presidential power the process by which the new constitutions were enacted also has raised concerns in kyrgyzstan some observers warn that the successful public protests encourage citizens and parties to take to the streets as the main form of political advocacy rather than to work within political institutions indicative of possible future instability for reforms has announced that it will launch new mass protests against the december 2006 constitution in spring 2007 other kyrgyz commentators praise the government and opposition leaders for eventually reaching compromises on progressive constitutional provisions these include that citizens may be detained only after court warrant rather than on the order of the prosecutors office as was previously the case another provision httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22546 for national council on justice to provide nongovernmental input into selecting judges and evaluating their conduct may contribute to the independence of the judiciary from political influence according to these analysts6 the international crisis group icg ngo has argued that even if there is progress in kyrgyzstan in restructuring political institutions other major problems of northsouth regional tensions corruption and organized crime must be tackled otherwise icg warns kyrgyzstan could still become failed state major key to solving these problems could be progress in reforming law enforcement and the judiciary it suggests which would improve public confidence in the government according to analyst erica marat president bakiyev reputedly associated just after the tulip revolution with criminal elements in order to reestablish civil order in some regions of kyrgyzstan she asserts however that in recent months the top level of the government has combated organized crime although corruption remains rampant and many politicians are involved in criminal activities she argues that these anticrime efforts are strongly supported by civil society and that the bakiyev government should encourage and rely on this support7 implications for us interests the us administration has appeared to take cautious view toward recent developments in kyrgyzstan balancing its support for constitutional reforms

including the respect shown by kyrgyz authorities for the rights of peaceful assembly it stressed that balanced system of representation and accountability is democratic necessity and urged kyrgyzstanis to continue peaceful efforts to implement such reforms some observers argue that further instability in coming months is not ruled out including if bakiyev dissolves the sitting legislature and new elections are held eventually however the election of postakayev legislature may contribute to greater popular legitimacy of the political system the administrations 2006 national

jeopardize kyrgyzstans independence integration with the west and support for the global war on terrorism during his april 2006 visit to kyrgyzstan assistant secretary boucher cautioned that the apparent continued presence of convicted criminals within the legislature raised questions about the rule of law11 just after this visit there was an unsolved assassination attempt against for reforms cofounder edil baysalov who reportedly had warned boucher that democratization in kyrgyzstan was faltering such events contributed to concerns expressed by the us ambassador days later that crime and corruption increasingly threatened kyrgyzstans stability the european union too in may 2006 urged the kyrgyz government to combat what seemed to be circles connected with organized crime that are attempting to gain influence over political life and state institutions 8 assistant secretary of state richard boucher stated during an april 2006 visit that i think everyone agrees that kyrgyzstan

international airport us facilities there were named after the late new york city fire chief peter ganci could continue12 in april 2006 the status of the ganci airbase again appeared jeopardized when bakiyev threatened to close it if rent and other us payments were not substantially increased in midjuly 2006 the united states agreed to provide 150 million to kyrgyzstan over the next year subject to congressional approval that would include foreign and military assistance as well as payments for use of the airbase kyrgyzstans midjuly 2006 ouster of two us diplomats on charges that they had inappropriate contacts with local democracy and human rights ngos appeared to indicate troubling collusion between kyrgyz and russian intelligence agencies according to some observers ties appeared further strained by the shooting death of civilian by httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22546 us serviceman on december 6 2006 but us ambassador marie yovanovitch urged kyrgyz citizens to reflect on the positive benefits of uskyrgyz security cooperation13 some kyrgyz analysts caution that these ties could face more stress if bakiyevs political power is further challenged in coming months and he appeals for support from russia14 congressional concerns about democratization in kyrgyzstan since the tulip revolution and about uskyrgyz relations have been reflected in hearings statements and
