from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to tim osborn tosbornueaacuk subject fwd re science review date wed feb 20 162546 2002 date fri 30 nov 2001 134813 0000 to jesse smith hjsmithaaasorg from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject re science review dear jesse i am sorry for messing you about with this but i really am leading complicated life at the moment i am attaching my comments on the esper et manuscript you will see that i think the work is genuinely interesting and potentially of wide significance the bottom line is that you should publish this but the way the authors have chosen to present their results smacks of lack of clarity of thought and lot of fudging i believe that they are more concerned with trying to temper their ideas so as not to offend mann et they choose to present their work as generalised demonstration of how to process treering data set merely to argue against an unjustified remark made by broecker about treering reconstructions in general this simply devalues the significance of their work as this refutation is out their in the literature already if only broecker bothered to check by trying to skate around the real questions that broecker was implying ie is the methodology removing the true lowfrequency variance in the mann et curve and is the magnitude of the medieval warmth understated esper et are obscuring the real message of their results namely that mann et do most likely loose the low frequency variance in their reconstruction and they may very well be underestimating the medieval warmth to get at this the authors need to be honest about what their data represent probably summer and certainly not hemispheric wide coverage and is this really that different from what mann et actually represent even though they believe theirs is mean annual hemispheric record i think the authors present toosimplistic discussion of their curve and then gloss over these difficult but important issues so i really think they should be published but they should think again about the interpretation and message at 0925 am 112701 0500 you wrote dear keith it is not too late so please send your review thanks million sincerely jesse dr jesse smith associate editor science 1200 new york avenue nw washington dc 20005 usa 202 3266556 202 4081256 fax hjsmithaaasorg keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk 112701 0917am is it too late for this or should i send review by tomorrow keith professor keith briffa climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk phone 441603593909 fax 441603507784 1httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa professor keith briffa climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk phone 441603593909 fax 441603507784 2httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa3 references 1 httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa 2 httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa 3 httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa
