2008 melinda gish and gail mccallion specialists in social policy domestic social policy division early childhood care and education programs in the 110th congress background and funding summary federal support for child care and education comes in many forms ranging from grant programs to tax provisions some programs serve as specifically dedicated funding sources for child care services eg the child care and development block grant or ccdbg or education programs eg elementary and secondary education act title i part early reading first even start the 21st century community learning centers program the early childhood educator professional development program and the individuals with disabilities education act preschool grants program and infants and toddlers program while for others eg temporary assistance for needy families or tanf child care is just one of many purposes for which funds may be used in many cases federal programs target low income families in need of child care but in the case of certain tax provisions the benefits reach middle and upperincome families as well this report provides an overview of federal child care early education and related programs and their funding status funding for many child care early education and related programs is provided each year as part of the annual appropriations process for the departments of health and human services hhs and education ed fiscal year fy 2007 appropriations bills for those departments did not receive floor action in the house or senate during the 109th congress despite the 2007 fiscal year beginning on october 1 2006 after three continuing resolutions crs provided temporary funding for government operations fourth cr providing funding through the end of fy2007 was ultimately signed into law pl 1105 on february 15 2007 shortly after the presidents budget request for fy2008 was released for several but not all of the programs covered by this report the fy2007 funding levels mirrored those included in the fy2006 appropriations pl 109149 funding for head start was increased as was that for early reading first even start funding was cut but not eliminated as had been proposed by the president the fy2008 appropriations process which included series of continuing resolutions that provided temporary funding at fy2007 levels and vetoed conference agreement hrept 110424 ultimately culminated in the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 hr 2764 being signed into law pl 110161 by the president on december 26 2007 the legislation includes an acrosstheboard cut 1747 to the program funding level amounts contained in the acts language the levels included in this report reflect the acrosstheboard reduction on february 4 2008 the president released his budget request for fy2009 the 110th congress has not addressed all of the expired or soon expiring reauthorizations in the area of early childhood education and care the ccdbg expired with fy2002 remains funded without

programs support child care education or related services primarily for lowincome working families in addition the tax code includes provisions specifically targeted to assist families with child care expenses descriptions of those programs and tax provisions follow as does table 1 which shows funding or obligations or tax expenditures where applicable and available for the programs and tax provisions for the past five years in many cases other congressional research service crs reports are referenced as sources for more detailed information about individual programs early childhood care and education programs still due to be reauthorized in the 110th congress include the child care and development block grant and programs under the child left behind act nclba legislation to reauthorize head start hr 1429 program whose authorization expired with fy2003 was signed into law pl 110134 by the president on december 12 2007 all of these programs have continued to receive funding the nclba programs include elementary and secondary education act esea title i part early reading first even start and the early childhood educator professional development program programs for young children contained in the individuals with disabilities education act idea such as the preschool grants program and the infants and toddlers program are not up for reauthorization in the 110th congress readers should be aware that this report does not attempt to cover all issues connected with each of those reauthorizations child care and development block grant ccdbg1 the primary federal grant program funding child care is the ccdbg which was created in 1990 and reauthorized through fy2002 and substantially expanded in 1996 as part of welfare reform the ccdbg is overdue for reauthorization and the 110th congress has inherited this unfinished task although the 109th congress completed legislation to provide the mandatory funding portion for the ccdbg through fy2010 the ccdbg act itself which outlines the rules of program and includes the authorization level for discretionary funding awaits reauthorization in 1 for more information see crs report rl30785 the child care and development block grant background and funding by melinda gish crs2 the meantime discretionary funding has been provided via the appropriations process the ccdbg is administered by the department of health and human services hhs and provides formula block grants to states which use the grants to subsidize the child care expenses of families with children under age 13 if the parents are working or in school and family income is less than 85 of the state median in practice many states establish income eligibility levels that are lower than this federal threshold child care services are provided on sliding fee scale basis and parents may choose to receive assistance through vouchers or certificates which can be used with provider of the parents choice including religious providers and relatives states receiving ccdbg funds must establish child care licensing standards although federal law does not dictate what these standards should be or what types of providers must be covered in addition states must have health and safety requirements applicable to all providers receiving ccdbg subsidies that address prevention and control of infectious diseases building and physical premises safety and health and safety training for care givers however federal law does not dictate the specific contents of these requirements the ccdbg is funded through both discretionary and capped entitlement mandatory grants referred to in combination as the child care and development fund ccdf and state maintenanceofeffort moe and matching requirements apply to part of the entitlement funds2 states must use at least 4 of their total funds to improve the quality and availability of child care and according to statute must target 70 of entitlement funds on welfare recipients working toward self sufficiency or families at risk of welfare dependency however because all families falling below the 85 of state median income requirement can be categorized as at risk the 70 targeting of the welfare or atrisk population does not necessarily mean welfare families must be served in theory all funds may be used for low income nonwelfare working families however state plans indicate that many states guarantee child care to welfare families more than 5 of state allotments may be used for state administrative costs the fy2006 appropriations act for the departments of labor hhs and education pl 109149 included roughly 21 billion in discretionary funding for the ccdbg an acrosstheboard rescission of 1 brought the precise total to 2062 billion the fourth and final cr pl 1105 covering fy2007 maintained discretionary funding at the 21 billion level mandatory or entitlement ccdbg funding beginning in fy2003 through fy2005 was provided at the fy2002 rate 2717 billion for the year under series of funding extensions ultimately as alluded to earlier funding for longer fiveyear period fy2006fy2010 was included in the deficit reduction act of 2005 budget spending

grants by melinda gish crs3 s 1932 which was signed into law pl 109171 on february 8 2006 this law provides 2917 billion annually for each of fy20062010 temporary assistance for needy families tanf tanf created in the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 provides fixed block grants for statedesigned programs of timelimited and workconditioned aid to needy families with children the original legislation provided 165 billion annually through fy2002 and after series of twelve temporary extensions congress included several welfare provisions and mandatory child care funding in its spending budget reconciliation bill s 1932 which was signed into law pl 109171 on february 8 2006 the law maintains the tanf block grant at 165 billion for fy20062010 child care is one of many services for which states may use tanf funding in fy2006 the most recent year for which data are available hhs reports that states spent 124 billion in federal tanf funds for child care within the tanf program and 223 billion in state tanf and separate state program ssp moe funds 3 in addition states may transfer up to 30 of their tanf allotments to ccdf to be spent according to the rules of the child care program as opposed to tanf rules the transfer from the fy2006 tanf allotment to the ccdbg totaled 19 billion representing 12 of the fy2006 tanf allotment child and adult care food program cacfp the cacfp provides federal funds in some cases commodities for meals and snacks served in licensed child care centers family and group day care homes and head start centers child care providers that are exempt from state licensing requirements must comply with alternative state or federal standards children under 12 migrant children under 15 and children with disabilities of any age may participate although most are preschoolers eligible providers are usually public and private nonprofit organizations the cacfp is an openended entitlement administered by the department of agriculture for fy2008 obligations are estimated to be 2289 billion and 2172 in fy20074 social services block grant ssbg title xx of the social security act authorizes social services block grants which may be used for social services at the states discretion there are federal income eligibility requirements targeting provisions service mandates or matching requirements the most recently published hhs analysis of state expenditures indicates over 9 of total ssbg expenditures made in fy2005 241 million were for child care in that year decrease from those made for child care in fy2004 254 million title xx is capped entitlement and state allocations are based on relative 3 for more information on states use of tanf funds see crs report rl32748 the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant primer on financing and requirements for state programs by gene falk 4 see crs report rl33307 child nutrition and wic programs background and recent funding by joe richardson crs4 population size it should be noted that although the ssbg has an entitlement ceiling appropriations may not always abide by it for example the ceiling in fy2001 was 17 billion however congress appropriated 1725 billion for that year despite the ceiling funding for the ssbg has been held steady at 17 billion for the past seven years most recently for fy2008 with states retaining authority to transfer up to 10 of their tanf block grants to the ssbg however as part of the fy2006 appropriations in addition to the regular ssbg funding an additional 550 million was provided in the defense appropriations act pl 109148 targeted for needs arising from the gulf coast hurricanes of 2005 pl 11028 signed into law on may 25 2007 extends the availability of these funds for expenditure through fy2008 as good portion

development services to lowincome preschool children on part or fullday basis6 after unsuccessful attempts in the 109th congress to reauthorize the head start program whose authorization had expired with fy2003 legislation reauthorizing the program through fy2012 was passed by the current congress in november 2007 and that bill hr 1429hrept 110439 was signed into law pl 110134 by the president on december 12 20077 despite the long period of overdue reauthorization funding continued to be provided through the appropriations process under current law head start funds are provided directly by hhs to local grantees which must comply with detailed federal performance standards the available data show funded enrollment for head start in fy2006 to have totaled 909201 children 10 of whom were under

affected by the storms those funds were not be allocated according to the standard head start formula due to the targeted purpose of the funding as discussed below the head start continued crs5 the

training and homebased instruction the even start program first authorized in 1989 grew rapidly in its first years but it has been subject to increasing criticism in recent years and has seen its funding decline in each year from fy2003 through fy2008 the education departments fy2007 cr operating plan provided 82 million in funding for the program cut of 17million from the fy2006 funding level of 99 million as in the fy2007 budget request the administration requested funding for the program for fy2008 however the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 pl 110161 provides 66 million for even start in advocating for the programs elimination the administration contends that the program has not demonstrated it has been effective in improving child and adult learning outcomes through the integration of the four core services of adult education parenting education parentchild activities and early childhood education the administration argues that these conclusions are supported by data from three national evaluations of even start advocates of continuing the even start program argue that the goal of providing integrated family literacy services to an extremely disadvantaged population is so important that the program should not be eliminated furthermore they argue that thorough study of the impact of legislatively mandated quality improvements to even start is needed as well as concerted effort to improve the program through implementation of model programs and technical assistance early childhood educator professional development the department of education has provided competitive grants to partnerships to improve the knowledge and skills of early childhood educators who work in communities that have high concentrations of children living in poverty fy2006
