raised concerns with the bill because it could subject them to injunctions in numerous jurisdicti ons that require different or even conflicting remedies to prevent the payment of internet bets or wagers the result will be hodgepodge of inconsistent court orders rather than cohesive enforcement scheme 14 judiciary hearings at 89 statement of rep goodlatte at 48 prepared statement of asst attorney general michael chertoff 15 financial services hearings at 11 testimony of sen kylinternet gambling operations12 critics have argued that this could expose credit card companies and others to series of in consistent and conf licting court orders13 although it endorsed the appro aches taken in the goodla tte leach and mccain bills in the 107th congress the justice department has consistently urged that internet gambling be treated the same as gambling accomplished through use of the telephone and prefers amendments to the wire act in order to expand or clarify the acts coverage of internet gambling14 opening the wire act for amendment however potentially unleashes number of other issues unrelated to internet gambling15 the bills of the 108th congress although
