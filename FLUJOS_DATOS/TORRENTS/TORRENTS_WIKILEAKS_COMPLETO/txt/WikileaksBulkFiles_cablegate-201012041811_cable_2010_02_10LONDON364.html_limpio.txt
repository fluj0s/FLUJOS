subject bank of england governor concern about recovery conservatives readiness and the uk in the eu classified by ambassador louis b susman for reasons 14 b and d 1 cnf summary reining in the uks debt will be the greatest challenge facing the party that wins the expected may 6 general election bank of england governor mervyn king told the ambassador in february 16 meeting while neither party has adequately detailed plans to reduce the deficit king expressed great concern about conservative leaders lack of experience and opined that party leader david cameron and shadow chancellor george osborne have not fully grasped the pressures they will face from different groups when attempting to cut spending king also raised concerns about the global economic recovery arguing that global growth in 2010 would be anemic and doubledip recession remained possibility greeces profound economic troubles will trigger further consolidation in power within the eurozone with germany and france likely to impose the right to scrutinize if not exercise some control over greek government accounts in return for an implicit or explicit guarantee he predicted the uk has been on the sidelines in the debate over greece and could have less influence in the eu as germany and france will seek greater political cohesion in the eurozone in the aftermath of the greek crisis he stated end summary bleak uk and global economic picture 2 cnf for the next ten months the uk faces the challenge of adopting deficitreduction measures controlling inflation and addressing rising unemployment the deficit is expected to reach 126 percent of gdp in 2010 inflation for the twelvemonth period december 2009 to december 2010 reached 35 percent primarily result of the return of the vat rate to 175 percent and higher energy prices king predicted that inflation would drop to two percent this year since energy prices are expected to stabilize with oil price per barrel remaining at or near usd 70 the uk also likely faces rising unemployment businesses will cut jobs faster this year and eliminate many parttime positions as employers realize that economic recovery will be long drawnout process said king the us already has gone through this pain of rising unemployment and saw in the last quarter of 2009 rise in productivity the uk and europe in general has not gone through this restructuring and productivity fell throughout 2009 3 cnf the global picture was also worrisome commented king at the february 6 g7 meeting in iqualit canada the german and japanese finance ministers raised concerns about weak domestic consumption and the slow recovery of export trade king stated while chinas domestic spending primarily on its large infrastructure projects helped ameliorate the worst of the global economic crisis there has been noticeable change in domestic consumption chinas consumers will not lead economic growth he said given these factors as well as the high us unemployment and europes expected rising unemployment it was hard to be optimistic about recovery in 2010 king argued and noted doubledip recession was still possibility conservatives not prepared 4 cnf conservative leaders david cameron and george osborne do not fully grasp the pressures they will face when attempting to cut back on spending when hundreds of government officials will make pleas of why their budgets should not be reduced stated king in recent meetings with them he has pressed for details about how they plan to tackle the debt but received only generalities in return both cameron and osborne have tendency to think about issues only in terms of politics and how they might affect tory electorability king also raised concerns that osbornes dual roles as shadow chancellor of the exchequer but also as the partys general election coordinator could create potential problems in the approach on economic issues 5 cnf king also expressed concern about the tory partys lack of depth cameron and osborne have only few advisors and seemed resistant to reaching out beyond their small inner circle the cameronosborne partnership was not unlike the tony blairgordon brown team of new labours early years when both worked well together when part of the opposition party but fissures developed for many reasons once labour was in power similar tensions could arise if cameron and osborne disagreed on how to handle the deficit and the lack of depth in their inner circle would aggravate the situation london 00000364 002 of 002 greeces problems will redefine eurozone 6 cnf germany and france will ultimately have choice but to offer explicit guarantees of greek debt argued king the eurozone could not risk greek default and euro devaluation would not be an acceptable political option for germany or france germany and france will likely as condition of any guarantee require the ability to scrutinize if not exercise some control over the greek budget longerterm the drive for greater political cohesion will accelerate the eus one single success was the monetary union and now that success has been undermined leaders in germany and france have recognized that allowing monetary union to happen without corresponding political cohesion was mistake and one that needed to be rectified king opined 7 cnf the eurozones move to greater political cohesion could poise some disadvantages for the uk king speculated during the february 16 ecofin meeting eurozone governments politely listened to chancellor darling when he commented on the situation in greece but he was not invited to attend internal discussions since the uk is not part of the eurozone it would be incumbent for the uk to demonstrate that it has something meaningful to say and to be constructively engaged in the eu should this greater political cohesion among the eurozone governments occur commented king visit londons classified website httpwwwintelinksgovgovwikiportalunit
