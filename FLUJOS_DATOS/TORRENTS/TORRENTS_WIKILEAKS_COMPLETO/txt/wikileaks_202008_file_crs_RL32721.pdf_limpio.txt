on greenhouse gas emissions and related data this report examines two issues the first issue is the separate treatment of developed and developing nations under the united natio ns framework convention on climate change unfccc and the kyoto protocol this distinction has been pivotal issue affecting us climate change policy the second issue is the difficulty of addressing climate change through limiting greenhouse gas emissions to specified percentage of baseline emissions typically 1990 the data permit examination of alternative approaches such as focusing on per capita emissions or the greenhouse gas emission intensity measured as emissions per unit of economic activity key findings include few countries account for most greenhouse gas emissions in 2005 china led by emitting 19 of the world total followed closely by the united states with 18 other country reached 6 the top seven emitters accounted for 52 of the 185 nations emissions landuse effects eg deforestation on emissions are negligible for most nations but they cause emissions to rise sharply for certain developing nations most notably brazil and indonesia while oil and gasproducing gulf states have the highest per capita greenhouse gas emissions in general developed nations rank high in per capita emissions in 2005 australia the united states and canada ranked 5 7 and 8 respectively in the world while developing nations tend to rank low china brazil and indonesia and india ranked 71 73 100 and 119 respectively the greenhouse intensity of the economythe metric by which the george w bush administration addressed climate changevaries substantially among developed countries in 2005 not accounting for land use ukraine emitted 503 tonsmillion international gdp while france emitted 81 tonsmillion gdp with the united states at 153 tonsmillion gdp developing nations range from the 140s mexico and south korea to 369 china the time frame adopted for defining the climate change issue and for taking actions to address greenhouse gas emissions has differential impacts on individual nations as result of indi vidual resource endowments eg coal versus natural gas and hydropower and stage of economic development eg conversion of forest land to agriculture occurring before or after the baseline differentiating responsibilities between developed and developing nationsas the unfccc doeshas failed to engage some of the largest emitters effectively moreover many developed countries have not achieved stabilization of th eir emissions despite the unfccc given the wide range of situations illustrated by the data flexible strategy that allows each country to play to its strengths may be necessary if diverse countries like the united states and china are ever to reach agreement httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32721g9g155g142g142g151g145g152g158g156g142g561g9g138g156g561g7g150g146g156g156g146g152g151g156g561 g561

global issue1 however greenhouse gas emissions data on global basis are incomplete some developing countries have institutions for monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and have never reported such emission s to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc2 in similar vein data on individual greenhouse gases sources and landuse patterns vary greatly in quality despite shortcomings in the data the emerging picture of emissions has implications for considering alternative policies for controlling emissions first the picture outlines the estimated contributions of individual countries second evaluating those emissions in terms of socioeconomic characteristics eg population and economic activity provides insights on the potentially divergent interests of differing groups of nationsespecially concerning developed nations versus developing ones 3 the world resources institute wri has compiled greenhouse gas emissions and related data from variety of sources into database that is available for analysis4 covering 185 nations plus separate entry combining the members of the european union5 the database includes total emissions per capita emissions and greenhouse gas or carbon intensity6 selected socio economic indicators and other measures emissions data for all six greenhouse gases7 identified by the unfccc are available for 1990 1995 2000 and 2005 for both developed and nonannex i nations data for carbon dioxide co 2 are available back to 1850 and up to 2005 for both developed and nonannex i nations data on the effects of land use change and forestry on co 2 emissions are only available from 1975 to 2000 this report uses the data compiled by wri to examine pivotal and longrunning issue surrounding us climate change policy the appropriate roles of developed and developing countries in addressing climate change the unfccc states as its first principle in article 3 the parties should protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but 1 for background see crs report rl34513 climate change current issues and policy tools by jane leggett 2 for the most recent developments on submissions to the unfccc by nonannex 1 countries see httpunf cccint national_reportsnonannex_i_natcomsubmitted_natcomitems653php 3 the unfccc divides nations into two groups nations listed in annex i which under the kyoto protocol would have specified reduction targets encompassing developed nations including eastern europe and the former soviet union and nonannex i nations which do not have specified reduction targets including the rest of the world 4 called the climate analysis indicators tool cait the database uses variety of data sources to provide information on greenhouse gas emissions sinks and other relevant indicators full documentation along with caveats is provided on the wri website at httpcaitwriorg 5 both the individual countries of the european union and the european community as an entity are parties to the kyoto protocol within the eu the differing situations of each constituent nation have resulted in differing emissions targets and policies for each country while this analysis focuses on the implications of individual nations situations fifteen member states of the eu are authorized to meet their goals collectively 6 carbon intensity is the ratio of countrys emissions to its gross domestic product gdp measured in international dollars purchasing power parity 7 carbon dioxide nitrous oxide methane perfluorocarbons hydrofluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32721g9g155g142g142g151g145g152g158g156g142g561g9g138g156g561g7g150g146g156g156g146g152g151g156g561 g561

the developed country parties should take the lead in combating cl imate change and the adverse effects thereof8 the united states has struggled with the common but differentiated responsibilities of developing countries and with the pledge for the developed countries to take the lead in combating climate change the resulting debate concerns what actions to address greenhouse emissions should be common responsibilities ie undertaken by all nations and what actions should be differentiated ie undertaken only by developed ones under the unfccc and the subsequent kyoto protocol common actions include the responsibility to monitor and report emissions differentiated actions include the commitment to reduce emissions to 1990 baseline for designated developed nations listed on annex i to the unfccc and hence known as annex i nations thus the unfccc the kyoto protocol and much of the current debate about actions to control greenhouse gas emissions focus on individual nations amounts of emissions as result primary attention falls on current greenhouse gas emissions past greenhouse gas emissions and projected greenhouse gas emissions in this context addressing global climate change has in effect meant reducing greenhouse gas emissionsfor annex i countries complicating factor is that land use activities can affect net emissions and the kyoto protocol provides methods for taking land use effects into account for the unfccc the differentiated control action was for annex i countries to take voluntary actions to ensure that their greenhouse gas emissions in 2000 did not exceed 1990 levels 9 for the kyoto protocol the differentiated control action was for annex i countries to control emissions to individually specified percentages of baseline emissions averaged over the period 20082012 10 under both the unfccc and the kyoto protocol non annex i nations would be exempt from these specified control requirementsalthough they could voluntarily join in this split in responsibilitieswith the consequent lack of greenhouse gas control requirements for major emitting nonannex i countriesplayed key role in the united states refusal to agree to the kyoto protocol justifications for the differential treatment of the developed annex i nations compared to the developing nations are both environmentally and economically based environmentally the developed annex i nations have dominated emissions cumulatively from 1850 to 2005 annex i nations had emitted 734 of energyrelated co 2 while nonannex i nations had contributed 23411 in 1990 when the unfccc was being conceived annex i nations accounted for 586 of emissions of all six greenhouse gases while the nonannex i nations accounted for 381 by 2005 however that ratio had shifted nonannex i nations accounted for 474 while annex i nations accounted for 469 thus while annex i nations still dominate cumulative emissions the rising share contributed by nonannex i nations confounds the assignment of future obligations 8 united nations framework convention on climate change article 31 9 the united states and many other countries failed to meet th is voluntary goal it was this general failure that gave impetus to the kyoto protocol to mandate reductions 10 generally the baseline was 1990 the individual annex i commitments were negotiated with the u s commitment if the united states had agreed to the kyoto protocolbeing 7 reduction 11 analysis indicators tool cait version 60 washington dc world resources institute 2008

pursued by the nonannex i nations depends importantly on expanded use of energy including fossil fuels which are the main source of carbon dioxide the dominant greenhouse gas from this perspective logic for the differing treatment of the two groups is that the developed annex i countries can afford to control emissions because they have achieved relatively high standard of living while the developing nations have the right and should have the opportunity to expand energy use as necessary for their economic development this distinguishing of the responsibilities of the annex i and nonannex i nations generates crucial and interrelated tensions first this approach means that annex i nations pay an economic price for addressing global climate change second nonannex i nations retain the opportunity to develop their economies using leastcost energy regardless of greenhouse gas emissions this in turn means that from the perspective of the annex i nations developing nations which may be competing in certain economic sectorsappear to be getting free ride and third despite investments in cont rols and resulting tensions between competing economies actual global emissions will continue to rise if the increase in emissions from nonannex i nations exceeds any decrease in emissions achieved by annex i ones the intensity of these tensions that arise from focusing on emissions levels is clear when one examines emissions data see appendix appendix b and appendix c to frame this discussion crs focuses on the 20 individual nations that emitted the most greenhouse gases in 2005 12 the top 20 represent about 73 of global greenhouse gas emissionsan identical proportion for 1990 and for 2005 latest available data from cait for all six greenhouse gases in addition data for the 27member13 european union are included as the kyoto protocol allows the eu to address its greenhouse gas emission obligations collectively in 2005 the 27nation eu was the thirdlargest

followed by the united states 1901 mmtce at 18015 other country reached 6 of total emissions although the collective 27member eu accounted for 13 overall only seven countries emitted 2 or more these top seven emitters accounted for 55 of global emissions and the next 13 top emitters accounted for another 18 of emissions thus one implication of these data is that greenhouse gas control in the short term depends mainly on the actions of relatively few nations if the top 20 emitters16 or even the top 10 all acted effectively the actions of the remaining 160plus nations would be of relatively little import at least for years second compelling fact about those top emitters is that they represent very different types and situations17 the top 20 nations include developed annex i nations whose emissions grew between 1990 and 2005 the united states japan canada italy france australia spain and turkey ranked 2 5 8 13 14 16 18 and 20 respectively these eight nations accounted for 298 of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2005 developed annex i nations whose emissions declined between 1990 and 2005 largely as result of the collapse of the eastern european and ussr socialist economies during the 1990s russian federation germany 18 and ukraine ranked 3 7 and 17 respectively these three nations accounted for 88 of global greenhouse gas emissions in 200519 developed annex i nations with freemarket economies whose emissions declined between 1990 and 2005 largely because of combination of low population growth modest economic grow th and the displacement of high emitting fuels coal with alternatives the united kingdom ranked 9 is the only member of this category20 it accounted for 16 of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2005 developing nonannex i nations all of whose emissions rose during the period china india brazil mexico indonesia iran south korea and south africa ranked 1 4 6 10 11 12 15 and 19 respectively these nine nations accounted for 332 of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2000 14 the unfccc provides methodology for calculating the greenhouse gas contributions of nations and converting them to equivalent unitsmillion metric tons of carbon equivalents mmtce 15 however for co 2 only the united states remained the leading emitter in 2005 16 of the top 20 in1990 18 are still in the top 20 15 years ter albeit with some shifting in order most notably china edging ahead of the united states in total greenhouse gas emissions kazakhstan dropped out of the top 20 early in the 1990s and was replaced by iran between 2000 and 2005 the only change in the top 20 was turkey slipping ahead of poland for the 20 th spot 17 for discussion of these situations see crs report rl33970 greenhouse gas emission drivers population economic d evelopment and growth and energy use by john blodgett and larry parker 18 germany falls into this category as result of its incorporation of east germany the premerger west germany was of course not centrally planned economy 19 kazakhstan and poland which were in the top 20 in 1990 also fall into the annex i nations with declining emissions with the decline of their coal based economies they have dropped out of the top 20 ranking 32 and 21 in 2005 together they accounted for about 15 of 2005 emissions 20 frances emissions declined between 1990 and 2000

countries including 6 of the top 10 emitters in 2005 the top 20 annex i countries accounted for about 55 of the top 20 groups greenhouse emissions compared with 45 for the developing nonannex i countries in 1990 the relative shares were 69 and 31 respectively so the developing countries have been proportionately increasing their share highlighting the tension between annex i and nonannex i perspectives the numberone emitters of each group were the top two emitters overall at the top were the leading developing non annex i country china and the leading developed freemarket economy the united states combined these two countries alone accounted for 366 of total global emissions

believed to be cumulative over decades and even centuries thus longerterm examination of data provides an important perspective and is one reason for the differing treatments of the annex i and nonannex i nations available data give emissions estimates of energyrelated co 2 emissions back from1850 to 2005 with land use changes and forestry from 1950 to 2000 see appendix and appendix c this longerterm view of emissions undersco res the contribution of the annex i nations for all nations excluding land use changes and forestry practices annex i countries share of energyrelated co 2 emissions over the period 18502005 is 73 nonannex i countries share is 23 the ratio is similar for 19502000 71 to 26 see also table 1 the relative rankings of several developing countries including brazil south korea indonesia and iran drop substantially using longer historical baseline for emissions from the 2005 rank to the 18502005 cumulative rank for co 2 from 6th to 21st 15th to 20th 11th to 25th and 12th to 23rd respectively greenhouse gas emissions particularly energyrelated emissions are closely tied to industrialization as developed is considered by many to be synonymous with industrialized it is not surprising that the developed countries dominate cumulative emissions while developing ones are increasing their current annual share

afforestation decreases them certain agricultural practices can increase emissions of methane or nitrous oxide however data on the effects on emissions of land use changes and forestry practices and their conversion into equivalent units of greenhouse gas emissions are both less available and less robust than data on emissions therefore this discussion see appendix and appendix c is at best

countries notably brazil and indonesia are having the effect of substantially upping their relative emissions ranks counting land use brazils emissions in 2000 rise from 257 mmtce to 632 mmtce 146 and indonesias rise from 137 to 837 511 this ups their rankings of total emissions in 2000 from 8th to 4th and 16th to 3rd respectively compared to brazil and indonesia the impact of accounting for land use on other top 20 emitters is much less the next biggest adjustment is for mexico whose emissions rise 17 when land use is accounted for for the united states net emissions drop by 110 mmtce nearly

increases the nonannex i nations share of global emissions between 1950 and 2000 excluding land use cumulative emissions were 71 for annex i nations and 26 for nonannex i nations accounting for land use and forestry the proportions are 51 to 46 what the land use changes and forestry practices data reflect are the relatively stable land use patterns of countries where most landclearing and agricultural development occurred before 1950 the western developed nations and china and india for example have longestablished agricultural practices in contrast brazil and indonesia have over the past few decades been clearing large regions of forest and jungle for timber andor conversion to agriculture releasing greenhouse gases or removing sinks in terms of the unfccc and the kyoto protocol

global climate change differentiating responsibilities between annex i and nonannex i nations as the unfccc has does not focu s efforts on all of the largest emitters as table 1 shows the emissions dominance of annex i nations that existed in 1990 has ended in 2005 global greenhouse gas emissions are closely split between annex i and nonannex i nationsin fact nonannex i emissions now surpass those of annex i nations moreover contradictory issues of fairness arise for annex i countries the present scheme of controlling greenhouse gases requires them to bear essentially all the direct economic costs for nonannex i countries to the extent that development is linked to increasing greenhouse gas emissions imposing controls on them could slow their development and hold down their standards of living visavis the developed nations finally the focus on emissions levels at specific times eg baseline of 1990 has differential and arbitrary impacts on individual nations

fuel use is necessary ingredient of economic development as acknowledged by the unfccc the emergence of the global climate change issue at this time effectively determines the distinction between the developed annex i nations and the developing nonannex i nations for annex i nations that energy exploitation has been incorporated into their economies and is part of their baseline for considering any controls on greenhouse gases for developing nonannex i nations however economic development will require expanded energy use of which fossil fuels can be the least costly thus imposing limits on fossil energy use at this time could result in developing countries being relegated to lower standard of living than those nations that developed earlier similarly certain landuse activities such as clearing land for agriculture and exploiting timber affect net greenhouse gas emissions nations that are currently exploiting their resource endowments such as brazil and indonesia could find themselves singled out as targets for controls yet developed nations like the united states and most european countries which exploited such resources in the past have those greenhouse gas implications embedded in their baselines also the focus on 1990 as baseline means that the eastern european and former soviet union nations have the advantage of reductions in emissions from their subsequent economic contractions which will allow them room for growth likewise the discovery and exploitati on of north sea gas has allowed great britain to back out coal and thereby reduce emissions since the baseline in all these cases the time frame adopted for defining the climate change issue and for taking actions to address greenhouse gas emissions has differential impacts on individual nations as result of their individual resource endowments 22 and stage of economic development the differential impacts give rise to perceived inequities thus the effort to find metric for addressing greenhouse gas emissions baselines and targets that will be perceived as equitable is challenging t able 1 shares of global emissions by the industrialized annex i veloping nonannex i and t op 20

based emissions levels are available alternative metrics for taking into account greenhouse gas emissions and economic development include per capita emissions and economic intensity of emissions23 g18g142g155g561g5g138g153g146g157g138g561g7g150g146g156g156g146g152g151g156g561 the socioeconomic differences between the developed annex i nations and the developing nations lead to considerations about emissions other than simply their absolute amounts one alternative is to consider per capita emissions all else equal populous nations would emit more greenhouse gases than less populated ones on this basis the difference between developed annex i countries and nonannex i ones is apparent appendix and appendix b show that of the top 20 emitters in 2005 the highest ranked by per capita greenhouse gas emissions 24 are developed countries australia united states and canada ranked 5 7 and 8 respectively their per capita emissions 73 64 and 62 tons per person respectively are double the emissions of the high estranked developing country in the top 20 south korea at 31 and over four times that of china 15 the rankings for the nonannex i countries in the top 20 emitters range from 31 south korea to 119 india with china ranked 71 in contrast annex i countries range from 5 australia to 46 france with the united states at 7 reasons the united states australia and canada are so high on this measure include their dependence on energyintensive transport to move people and goods around countries of large size and relatively low population density the use of coal for power generation and the energy requirements for resource extraction industries thus if one were considering how to control greenhouse gas emissions one way of trying to bridge the different interests of the developed annex i nations and the developing ones would be to focus on per capita emissions as way of giving each nation an equitable share of energy use for the united states compared to the developing world this metric could imply constraints 23 for other analyses bearing on this question see crs report rl32762 greenhouse gases and economic development an empirical approach to defining goals by john blodgett and larry parker and crs report rl33970 greenhouse gas emission drivers population economic development and growth and energy use by john blodgett and larry parker 24 the top four by this measure are oil and gasproducing gulf states httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32721g9g155g142g142g151g145g152g158g156g142g561g9g138g156g561g7g150g146g156g156g146g152g151g156g561 g561

advancements likewise this approach could permit most lessdeveloped countries to increase their emissions to accommodate expanding economies

greenhouse gas emissions is to consider how efficiently that nation uses energy and conducts other greenhouse gasemitting activities in producing goods and services this concept is captured by greenhouse gas intensityor carbon intensity 25measured as the amount of greenhouse gases emitted per million dollars of gross domestic product measured in international dollars parity purchasing power see appendix appendix b and appendix c carbon intensity as greenhouse gas indicator has received considerable attention since president bush decided to use it as benchmark for his voluntary climate change program also the world resources institute has advocated its use as an appropriate index for developing nonannex i nations 26 nations greenhouse gas intensity reflects both its resource endowment and the energy intensiveness of its economy in terms of energy resources countries with rich resources in coal would tend to be higher emitters while countries with rich resources in hydropower or natural gas would tend to be lower emitters in terms of economic activity countries with major heavy industry major extractive industries and extensive transportation systems tend to be higher emitters while countries without these andor dominated by service industries would tend to be lower emitters as noted in terms of emissions taking into account land use sharply increases the greenhouse gas intensity of brazil and indonesia these variables do not differentiate nations simply overall the top 20 emitters in 2005 see appendix appendix b and appendix c range widely in greenhouse gas intensity from 503 tons per million international gdp ukraine which relies heavily on coal to 81 tonsmillion international gdp france which relies heavily on nuclear power for generating electricity these are both annex i nations nonannex i na tions have narrower range from the 146 tonsmillion international gdp mexico and south korea to 290 tonsmillion international gdp south africa taking into account land use however would dramatically raise the intensity of brazil and indonesia in 2000 it jumped brazil by 145 to 507 tonsmillion international gdp and indonesia by 510 to 1397 tonsmillion international gdp the next largest increase from land use change was mexico at 17 as metric for considering how to control greenhouse gas emissions intensity focuses attention on the efficient use of energy and on the use of alternatives to fossil fuels thus greenhouse gas intensity metric would reward the use of renewables hydropower and nuclear power in place of fossil fuels and among fossil fuels it would reward natural gas use and penalize coal use with oil use falling in between 25 while the term greenhouse gas intensity encompasses all six greenhouse gases the term carbon intensity is sometimes used identically and implicitly means car bon equivalents intensity and other times is used more narrowly to refer only to carbon emissions the discussion in this analysis focuses on greenhouse gas intensity unless otherwise noted eg in the discussion of cumulative emissions 26 see kevin baumert ruchi bhandari and nancy kete what might developing country

number 72 in the world making this more favorable metric than absolute emissions the united states ranked number 2 in the world and per capita emissions the united states ranked number 7 the larger the intensity ranking number the less ghgs emitted per dollar of gdp of the indicators examined here the united states gets the most favorable results from this one nevertheless in absolute terms the united states is relatively inefficient with respect to intensity compared with western european countries the eu27 would have ranked 109 and japan ranked 118 in addition the united states is less efficient than nonannex i emitters south korea and mexico but it is more efficient than china india brazil south africa indonesia and iran g6g146g156g140g158g156g156g146g152g151g561 as stated above the data on greenhouse gas emissions highlight issues of both effectiveness and fairness with respect to current efforts to address global climate change differentiating responsibilities between annex i and nonannex i countries fails to focus efforts on all the largest emitters in addition contradictory issues of fairness arise as annex i countries bear essentially all the direct economic costs of reducing emissions and nonannex i countries are granted the right to increase emissions to meet developmental needs finally the focus on historical emissions as baseline for regulation has differential and arbitrary impacts on individual nations the result of the unfccc and kyoto protocols setting emissions targets for only developed nations and focusing on returning their emissions to specific baseline is twofold 1 the current regime has had little effect on global emissions and will have little effect in the near future and 2 the largest emitters the united states and china have not found it in their interests to join in the international effort to significant degree indeed the united states has pulled completely out of the kyoto process proponents of the kyoto protoc ol assert that although it is only first step it is one that must be taken this history of the unfccc and the kyoto protocol raises serious questions about how to develop greenhouse gas targets time frames and implementation strategies with respect to targets the unfccc recognized the right of developing countries to develop and the responsibility of all countries to protect the global climate these goals of the unfccc suggest that if there is to be any permanent response to climate change that involves controlling greenhouse gases then regime that combines some measure reflecting the right of developing countries to develop such as per capita emissions and some measure reflecting the need to be efficient such as carbon intensity may be necessary to move the world toward workable and effective climate change framework as shown above global target focused on per capita emissions generally rewards developing nations 27 providing them room for economic growth the targets balance between limiting emissions and permitting growth determines the individual winners and losers for example based on appendix b target of 3 tons carbon per person would allow all the developing nations in the top 20 emitters except south korea growth room south korea is at 31 tons per capita while five developed nations united states russian federation germany canada and australia would have to make cuts in contrast target focused on greenhouse gas intensity would have more diverse implications for develo ping nations several major developing nations 27 an exception is several gulf states that are high emitters due to exploitation of their oil reserves httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32721g9g155g142g142g151g145g152g158g156g142g561g9g138g156g561g7g150g146g156g156g146g152g151g156g561 g561

dollars of gdp than some developed nations for example in 2005 chinas carbon intensity was over 38 times that of japans and italys 369 tonsmillion international gdp versus 95 thus greenhouse gas intensity goal could be counterforce to the economic development process for some countries meaning that the winners and losers of regime combining per capita and carbon intensity measures could be highly dynamic and contenti ous adding landuse implications would further complicate the regime and selectively affect certain nations especially those just now at the point of exploiting forests notably indonesia and brazil for the united states regime containing some mix of per capita and greenhouse gas intensity measures28 would likely imply need to constrain emissions over some time frame the us greenhouse gas intensity is declining as is the case with most nations but the decrease currently does not completely offset increased emissions resulting from the growth of population and of the economy the extent to which targets could translate into economic costs would depend on the other two features of the regulatory scheme 1 time frame specifically whether it would accommodate technological advances in lesscarbonintensive technology or accelerated commercialization of existing lowcarbon technologies such as nuclear power 2 implementation strategy specifically whether it encourages leastcost solutions and development of advanced technologies with respect to time frame the data indicate two things 1 most countries that achieved significant reduction during the 1990s did so as result of either an economic downturn or substantial realignment in energy policy 2 many countries have not been able to stabilize their emissions despite the unfcccs voluntary goal much less reduce them that failure was the impetus for the kyoto agreements prescribed reductions using economic contraction as an emission reduction strategy can scarcely be considered an option instead the substantial development andor deployment of lesscarbonintensive technology improved landmanagement strategies and other actions would be necessary to achieve stabilized emissions as noted above greenhouse gas emissions are closely tied to industrializationa synonym for developed with few exceptions improvement in efficiency has been gradual permanent transformation of the global economy necessary to ensure longterm stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions may involve multistage longterm time frame the difficulty in implementing the unfccc suggests implementation and compliance are still an open issue the united states submitted climate action plans during the 1990s indicating it would achieve the unfccc goal of returning emissions to 1990 levels it did not there were sanctions likewise some kyoto signatories may not achieve their reduction targets in 2008 2012 the sanctions are unclear given the wide range of situations illustrated by the data flexible strategy that permits each country to play to its strengths may make it easier for diverse countries like the united states and china to reach some acceptable agreement the extent of flexibility would depend on the balance between emission reductions and economic cost designed into the targets time frame and implementation strategy marketbased mechanisms to reduce emissions focus on specifying either the acceptable emissions level quantity or compliance costs price and allowing the marketplace to determine the economically efficient solution for the other variable for example tradeable permit program 28 see crs report rl33970 greenhouse gas emission drivers population economic development and growth and energy use by john blodgett and larry parker

number of permits available caps allowable emissions while permitting the marketplace to determine what each permit will be worth conversely carbon tax sets the maximum unit per ton of co2 cost that one should pay for reducing emissions while the marketplace determines how much actually gets reduced hence major implementation question is whether one is more concerned about the possible economic cost of the program and therefore willing to accept some uncertainty about the amount of reduction received ie carbon taxes or one is more concerned about achieving specific emission reduction level with costs handled effici ently but not capped ie tradeable permits of course combinations of these approaches are possible depending on the flexibility desired 29 the data presented here portray very wide range of situations and conditions among the 20 top countries that represent over 70 of total emissions significant flexibility may not only be desirable but necessary for them to reach any significant agreement 29 see crs report rl33799 climate change design approaches for greenhouse gas reduction program by larry parker crs report rl30024 us global climate change policy evolving views
