term the question of taiwans identity and sovereignty as separate from the prc remains unsettled moreover the peoples liberation army pla has continued to build up its forces that threaten taiwan raising the issue of whether the military balance already has shifted to favor the prc the results of march 22 sapped the prc s alarmist warnings about the election and referendums although it might still warn about instability until the inauguration on may 20 while chen is still president nevertheless crossstrait tension is greatly reduced chen is effectively weakened and concentrating on the transition ma is less provocative towards beijing than chen ma gives prous assurances there is future uncertainty however as th kmt could choose to accommodate beijing challenge beijing or seek bipartisan consensus on national security in one view there is an opportunity to turn us attention from managing the crossstrait situation to more urgent pr iorities that require the prcs improved cooperation such as dealing with nuclear pr oliferation in north korea and iran the crisis in darfur in sudan repression in burma the crackdown in tibet etc alternatively window of opportunity is pr

december 2005 the dpp suffered major setbacks in the local county and citylevel elections giving up seats in the north to the km t and retreating to its base in the south in november 2006 president chen and his wife were accused of embezzling public funds while chen received immunity while serving as president the kmts ma yingjeou also was accused of corruption in use of public f unds as mayor of taipei in december 2006 the kmts candidate for mayor of taipei u lungbin beat the dpps candidate frank hsieh by 13 percent even in the southern city of kaohsiung the dpps candidate won by only 01 percent in its primary to select legislative candidates in may 2007 dpp extremists attacked moderate dpp legislators as bandits and prochina including incumbent legislators favorable to the ustaiwan relationship then in the crucial legislative elections in january 2008 the dpp again ffered humiliating defeat winning 27 out of 113 seats 24 percent while the kmt won 81 seats 72 percentmature democracy but declining dpp the nearterm outlook for taiwans futu re is positive for stability and progress in policymaking including policies on defense that previously faced partisan bickering in taiwans polarized political environment the march 2008 presidential election was taiwans fourth direct democratic presid ential election held without disastrous problems since such electi ons began in 1996 mature democracy taiwan is experiencing its second demo cratic turnover in power from the kmt to the dpp in 2000 and from dpp to the kmt in 2008 at meeting with visiting former senator frank murkowski two days before the election on march 22 president chen reversed his remarks that threw doubt on smooth transfer of power and promised to support peaceful and c onstitutional transition the election results were not close nor contested as some in taiwan thought with the large margin of mas victory the dpp was resigned to its defeat in the presidential election and major protests or rioting occurred in th streets hsieh promptly offered his concession and dpp leaders talk ed of reflection and reform with ma as president the kmt will solidly dominate both the ly and ey cabinet with power to push through policies in contrast to the gridlock of the past eight years of divided government in which the kmt controlled the ly and dpp controlled the ey ma is seen as unifying leader in contrast to the divisive politics of chen the prospects for the dpp as viable opposition to check kmt power in policymaking is uncertain although the dpp remains potentially powerful the dpps dramatic defeat in this presidential election was the latest in declining trend in its political power over at least the last three years5 moreover the dpp that previously presented politicians younger than the traditional kmt politicians old guard has found it challenge to pass on l eadership to new generation ironically the dpps current leadership who rose in power in the 1980s lost to ma who represents the next generation of leadersh ip in the kmt and attracts younger voters the dpp has failed to adjust to regain greater support among centrist voters who cared about effective governance particular ly in the north of the island and among younger voters despite electoral losses president chens unpopularity and the demise of the taiwan solidarity union tsu the dpps hardline ally in the pan green coalition dpp official who also was one of the moderate incumbent legislators attacked as prochina ba ndit in the dpps own primary for the legislative elections in january 2008 warn ed on

council macpurge of moderates inside the dpp nonetheless if inst ead of remaining divided and weak the dpp is able to regroup and rej uvenate to attract more support then stronger opposition would be conducive to stable twoparty democracy in taiwan despite its troubles the dpp still comma nds at least 40 percent of votes in any case checks and balances plus the politics of moderation have been institutionalized in taiwan favoring us interests in stability and security both the dpp and kmt presidential ca ndidates moved towards cen trist positions concerning taiwans policies and identity both ma and hsieh presented moderate positions of their respective parties including the comm on objectives of stronger defense closer economic ties with the prc and repairing the relationship with the united states taiwans voters demonstrated once agai n that they support moderate policies without veering to extreme directions such as declaring independence or surrendering taiwans status based on polling data over the years majority of taiwans people consistently prefer the status quo taiwans current facto status without unification or independence6 separate identity and military imbalance however in the longer term for ta iwan for both the dpp and kmt the question of taiwans identity and sovereignty as separate from that of the prc remains unresolved some ques tion whether there is any status quo this situation will continue to challenge us management of peace and stab ility in the taiwan strait even though the current situation is stable and tensions are reduced with beijing less alarmist about taiw an the prcs insecurity about the taiwan question is unlikely to disappear taiwans democratic model poses threat to the prcs communist regime taipeis government whether under the kmt or dpp claims sovereign status us policy states that taiwans status is unsettled the pla has continued to build up its forces that threat taiwan raising the question of whether the military balance already has shifted to favor the prc although the election is over the potential remains for instability in the longer term moreover while taiwans people have shown that they w ill not undertake extrem acts to upset peace and prosperity the prc does not have the moderating fact or of democratic system to restrain its decisions finally ther remain concerns bout prc misperceptions and changing dynamics in the relationshi ps among the united states prc and taiwan aside from the pla buildup the prc also has become the largest economic partner of taiwan rpassing the past us role looking across the strait taiwan faces both military threat and economic dependence or coercion kmts policies on national security the kmt has fostered skepticism about its commitment to taiwans strong selfdefense including concerns about anti american attacks on us arms sales as kmt chairman ma yingjeou was nonco mmittal on taiwans defense policy and us arms sales in 2005 and 2006 as shown in disappointing visit to washington dc in march 2006 that also avoided meetings with members of congress for years the kmt frustrated us efforts to have taiwans ly pass higher

will foster peace and stability supporters say that the issue is not whether to increase economic ties with the prc which are already substantial but whether to normalize them to remove unilateral restrictions faced only by taiwans businesses in competitive global economy for example taiwans companies are prevented from investing more than 40 percent of net worth in the prc and their efforts

exports to mainland china includi ng hong kong about 12 million of taiwans citizens live there taiwan s invested as much as 300 billion in the prc11 this dependence on the prcs ec onomy has stoked fears that the kmt would capitulate to beijing appease the communist regime or negotiate even unification of china bringing instability to the regional balance of power the kmt includes elements that seek much closer and accommodating ties with the prc and continues to see taiwan as part of china albeit called the republic of china despite the prcs adopti on in march 2005 of the belligerent anti

security ties to the dpp and signal that the kmt might not want or be able to withstand prc pressures to forgo f16cd fighters under ma since the bu sh administration has refused since 2006 to accept formal letter of request from taiwan for new f16 fighters the new kmt government could stop efforts to submit request altogether that advisor had said in september 2007 that if ma won the election the kmt might submit new list of arms requests to the united states the kmt could continue to complicate us arms acquisitions as it had done for ears before the runup to the presidential election including refusing to approve or freezing the release of defense funds for us weapons acquisition programs for example on missile defense the opposition kmt and peoples first party pfp objected to acquiring us pac3 missiles for three years arguing that referendum in 2004 vetoed the proposal referendum on buying more missile defense systems failed to become valid with lower than 50 percent participati on rate in december 2007 the kmtcontrolled ly decided to fund four sets of pac 3 missiles but to freeze the funds for two more on the question of whether to continue to develop and deploy taiwans hf2e longrange landattack cruise missiles program that brought quiet opposition and then public criticism by the bush administration year ago the kmt might restrict this program at the militarys research and development chungshan institute for science and technology defense policy dvisor to ma said that he would restrict the range of the missile for counterstrik against only

cancel the hf2e program and stop deployme nt if the kmt negotiates with the prc on its withdrawal of missiles targeting taiwan taiwans military deployments and missile prog rams could be subject to prc demands the kmts decision could affect the issu of what us actions to take in response to taiwans missile program some view that counterattack capability as destabilizing and others see tactical utility the kmt could distance itself from the united states as well as japan there have been concerns that the kmt would sh ift its strategic orientation to pursue ties with beijing and washington with equal distance or even secure closer relationship with the prc than that with the united states and japan the kmt has legacy of fighting japan in the 1930s and 1940s whereas dpp leaders and president chens administration forged close ties with japan some are concerned that the kmt would be less projapan than the dpp th kmt has tended to ssert its sovereignty over islands with disputed claims am ong japan taiwan nd the prc called senkakus by japan tiaoyutai by taiwan and diaoyudao by the prc japan has historical security and econo mic interests in taiwan due to its status as japanese colony from 1895 to 1945 and geographical proximity challenge the prcs demands nonetheless upon winning the election ma and the kmt signaled that they will st and up to beijing when asked about his priorities probable candidate to be mas national security advisor said that he would first repair the relationship with th united states and s econdarily improve ties with the prc placing washington before beijing ma immediately announced his wish to visit the united states as well as japan before his inauguration significantly not the prc kmt interlocutor said that senior kmt officials recently met quietly with retired japanese admirals known as st rong supporters of taiwan kmt officials also said that they support taiwans military in trying to submit request to the united states for new f16cd fighters to replace aging f5 and idf fighters after stalling for years kmt politicians also said that they are now committed to us arms sales including submarines and patriot missile defense however kmt politician ex pressed concerns about the po sheng command and control program reasons for the credibility of the kmts current prous assurances include 1 the kmt would longer fear giving credit to president chen for progress in policies or encouraging his proindependence steps 2 the second party in the kmt led panblue coalition the prochina pfp has been eviscerated with its leader james soong longer challenge to ma 3 the kmt would now take over the governing responsibility for the country and 4 the kmt understands that the premise for taipei to engage in dialogue and other ties with beijing has been strong negotiating position that includes selfdefen and security links with washington forge national consensus in any case whether the kmt accommodates or stands up to the prc ta iwans institutionalized democracy and established separate identity that the kmt does not deny and taiwans people broadly uphold will challenge the prcs communist authoritarian rule in pursuing alternative approaches the kmt also has the option of forging new consensus withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34441crs10 the dpp on national identity and security that have been lacking under chen moreover the kmt could stop the politicization of the debate over defense issues problem the defense departme nt has lamented for years such steps would result in more resilient taiwan to counter coercion or conflict inflicted by beijing alternatively new consensus could help the kmt to negotiate ties with the prc with closer economic and political integra tion us policy has declared support for resolution of the taiwan question w ith the assent of taiwans people upon discussions in the days follow ing the election kmt interlocutors highlighted mas goal of reconciliation after the long political fight however there was little discussion of forging new national consensus on national security with the dpp some seemed receptive to th possibility but one kmt leading lawmaker on defense policy dismissed the dpp as t hat defeated party options for the majority kmt include working meaningfully with dpp lawmakers in the ly particularly in the foreign affairs and defense committee the newly reorganized committee has 11 kmt legislators 3 dpp legislators and 1 independent legislator another option would be to appoint dpp mbers in major ministries including the ministry of national defense sensitive option for ma would be to grant presidential pardon of chen who will lose immunity when he steps down as president fighting corruption in defens programs and decisionmaking could be another step to take implications for us security interests the results of march 22 sapped the prc s alarmist warnings about the election and referendums although it might still warn about instability until the inauguration on may 20 while chen shuibian is still president nevertheless crossstrait tension is greatly reduced chen is effectively weakened and concentrating on the transition presidentelect ma and kmt interlocutors gi ve prous assurances as president ma is expected to be less provocative towards beijing than chen in one view there is opportunity to turn us attention from managing the cross strait situation to urgent problems that require the prcs imp roved cooperation such as dealing with nuclear proliferation in north korea and iran the crisis in darfur in sudan repression in burma the crackdown in tibet etc alternatively window of opportunity is presented for the first time in years to advance us security interests in taiwans selfdefense mocracy economy as the united states 9th largest trading partner and role as responsible global citizen for example in weapons nonproliferation objectives for us interests given the results of the election nd referendum and outlook for taiwan as discussed above there are number of us objectives that might be pursued with renewed vigor to further us interests us policymakers in the congress and the administration might strengthen engagement with the kmt as well as the dpp to shape the outcome of certain clear goals that are consistent with us interests in taiwans sustained stability and security these goals might includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34441crs11 reverse delays of past years in upgrading taiwans selfdefense bolster taiwans will to fight in face of prc

ustaiwan economic ties eg with an fta to balance links with the prc considerations for policy consideration of us policy options in the relationship with taiwan would depend on the timing of certain events the inauguration of ma yingjeou as the new president on may 20 president bushs atte ndance at the olympic games in beijing opening on august 8 and the end of bushs term on january 20 2009 kmt officials said that beijing is unlikely to make negative actions against ma at the start of his term and has an interest in mas ability to show voters that he can gain results for taiwan in order to sustain kmt rule new engagement with taiwan after mas inauguration could remove the distaste in the administration for dealing with current president chen shuibian president bushs attendance at the olympic games could offer leverage and diplomatic damper for any us initiatives toward taiwan sensitive steps taken near the end of bushs term could allow the current administration to bear the brunt of beijings ire and to preclude difficult start to the next us presidents term in the usp rc relationship lastly decisions could be delayed until the next us administration the bush administrations criticism of taiwans referendum on membership in the in addition to the refusal since 2006 of acceptance of formal request from taiwan for new f16cd fighters have raised concerns that the administration has given beijing the perception of comanagement in handling taiwan as well as rising expectations that washington woul d continue to accede to beijings demands for example to forgo sale of f16s thus one significant consideration for us policymakers is whether to take steps to dispel notions of comanagement as administration officials have firmly denied and to counter any rising expectations from beijinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34441crs12 window of opportunity policy options ma yingjeous election presents window of opportunity in the crossstrait and ustaiwan relationships the issue is what options might be pursued by us policymakers in congress and the bush administration to advance us interests crs takes position on the options discussed here continue the existing approach one approach in continued management of peace and stability in the taiwan strait is for the administration to run out the clock through the end of president bushs term rather than pursue initiatives with taiwan that might meet beijings ire in this approach the lessene d crossstrait tension presents an opportunity to focus on other us priorities requiring more robust prc cooperation an alternative would be for the united states to continue its existing policy of resisting policy initiatives through th presidential inauguration on may 20 2008 until current president chen shuibian leaves office new initiatives with taiwan might be pursued after ma takes office the united states could wait until the kmt resolves internal debates and clarifies its national security policy including decisions on military programs organiza tion pers onnel leadership and spending those decisions could provide greater certainty about whether the kmt has changed its attitude toward acquisitions of us arms given its record in the past few years engage with presidentelect ma second approach would respond to pres identelect ma with these options allow ma yingjeou to visit wash ington dc or another us city before his inauguration ma expre ssed desire to visit the united states before becoming president when us policy would deny him visa and allow only transits congress could invite and host ma another option is video conference with ma in august 2005 cochairs of the house taiwan caucus had written to ma as the new kmt chairman in part to invite him to visit in 2007 the house passed hconres 136 to support vi sits by taiwans officials work with mas transition team in ensuring smooth power transition as was done for chens transition team in 2000 discuss the substance

2004httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34441crs13 strengthen ties with taiwan third approach to take either before or after mas inauguration with comprehensive or certain options would strengthen ustaiwan relations in military political or economic s ecurity however careful consideration could include the question of whether such steps would seriously risk other us priorities that require prc cooperation polic options include set positive objectives to achieve in the relationship with taiwan while us officials list many goals to pursue with beijing they are often at loss when asked to identify objectives in the relationship with taipei chens departure could change this us stance accept taiwans formal letter of request for us consideration of whether to sell new f16cd fighters the removal of chen as factor in negative ustaiwan nd prctaiwan relations presents fresh situation for acceptance of the letter in october 2007 the house passed hres 676 to urge th president to consider

approach concerns the us ro in renewed cross strait dialogue for decades an issue for us policy has been what role the united states should play to ensure peaceful dialogue across the taiwan st rait as part of us policy president reagan issued his six assurances of 1982 including one of mediation between taipei and beijing short of whether th at policy should change there are various possible us roles in one view the ited states should seize this first window of opportunity presented in decade to effec tively ensure crossstrait dialogue for sustainable peace and stability that would be worthwhile to help prevent war between two nuclear powers the united states could also shape the crossstrait dialogue to focus on functional coope ration rather than premature political integration national unifi cation or concessions on taiwans security in another view the united states shoul d continue to stay out of any prc taiwan negotiations beyond spectators enc ouragement of dialogue indeed in his congratulatory message to ma president bush stated that it falls to taiwan and beijing to build the essentia l foundations for peace and stability by pursuing dialogue through all available means and refraining from unilateral steps that would alter the crossstrait situation president bush so called prc ruler hu jintao on march 26 to stress that the election provides fresh

congress to require strategic review of policy there has been major policy review since 1994 one conducted by the clinton administration some say that coherent strategy is needed to sustain us interests in taiwan including peace and stability others say that the last year of presidency leaves little time or energy to undertake such review february 2008 report by the taiwan policy working
