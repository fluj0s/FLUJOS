industry provides servi ce directed toward consumers who do not have the cash to purchase high cost house hold products and who may be unable to get traditional credit credit cards or store acc ounts the renttoown industry can trace its origins to the 1960s and has grown rapidly the association of progressive rental organizations apro estimated that in 2005 there were 8300 renttoown stores in the united states serving 27 million households the industrys annual revenue was approximately 66 billion1 the rentalpurchase business was initially characterized by small regional chains and independent retailers that were facing increased competition from large electronic dealers and discount stores ther has been significant consolidation in the industry most recently in august 2006 the nations largest operator rentacenter inc announced merger with another national chain rentway inc in 2001 and 2002 rentacenter was on fortune magazines list of the 100 fastest growing companies renttoown arrangement provides cons umer with an alternative to buying merchandise rentalpurchase items are typically highc ost household products such as furniture large appliances levisions vcrs stereos and computers rentalpurchase transactions are shortterm weekly or mont hly selfrenewing leas the consumer is not obligated to extend the lease beyond the current monthly or weekly period if the agreement is not renewed the item may simply be returned in addition the consumer is provided with the option of purchasing the merc handise by either c ontinuing to pay rent for specified period of time usually 12 to 24 months or by early payment of specified portion of the remaining lease payments renttoown is popular with lower inco cashstrapped consumers these consumers may not qualify for credit or store s layaway plan the benefits of rentto own are immediate perhaps otherwise unatta inable access to needed or desired product the transaction typically does not require down payment or credit check the weekly or monthly installment payments are relatively low when compared to the cost of the item in addition these arrang ements provide flexibility that may also be appealing to consumers wanting to test pr oduct before purchase or those with transient employment renttoown agreements usually include delivery tup pickup and repair service the costs of these free services are reflected in the renttoown prices the largest drawback to these arrangements is the final purchase price of an item bought through renttoown the total of the installment payments can be two to three times sometimes more th retail price of the item c onsumer advocates state one way to clearly see the high final cost of rental purchase item is by calculating what the effective annual percentage rate apr for the transaction would be the difference between the cash price of an item and the sum of all payments included in rental purchase agreement would represent the fina nce charge testimony at recent

other potential problems in renttoown arrangements they indicate that consumers n eed to make sure they know if the renttoown item is new used or previously rented in addition th ey recommend that the consumer inquire if there is grace period for missed payment and if penalty is charged they call for discussion of other fees such as insurance and home pickup as well as any taxes from their perspective the agre ement should address what ppens if the merchandise is broken lost or stolen consum er advocates also argue reinst atement rights should be part of renttoown agreement this protecti on would allow customers that miss payment to be reinstated in the agreement with cr edit for past payments if overdue amounts are paid in timely fashion ftc survey the federal trade commission ftc conducte d nationwide survey of renttoown customers in the late 1990s to provide an independent body of information on the typical renttoown customer and thei r experience with the industry the ftc published report on the surveys findings to help inform th ongoing debate over proposals for national regulation the report gives an overview of the industry presents the results of the survey and provides discu ssion of public policy issues3 three primary goals of the survey were identified 1 to examine who uses renttoown transactions and how they differ from consumers who do not 2 to termine whether renttoown transactions typically result in the purchase of the rented merchandise and 3 to determine whether abusive collection practices ar widespread in the industry the major findings of the survey include the following in general renttoown customers compared to consumers who had not made renttoown tran sactions have lower incomes have less ducation rent their residence nd live in nonsuburban areas the survey found that 70 of renttoown mercha ndise was purchased by the customer the average rental period for items purchased was 14 months items returned to the store were rented for an average of five months the reason given for over half of the returns was that the item was longer needed bout 24 of the returns were for financial reasons the great majority 75 were satis fied with their rentalpurchase experience the survey found that over onethird of re nttoown customers d rented merchandise on more than one occasion in the last five years the most cited reason for an unsatisfactory experience was the high price of rentalpurchase almost 50 of the rent toown customers surveyed had been late with payment twothirds of the late customers indicated that they received good or very good treatment from the store when they were late with payment poor trea tment was reported by 15 of these customershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21467crs4 4 pl

port provides an overview of some of the major policy issues addressed by various st ates and proposed in federal gislation the report focuses on five areas of concern disclosure of total cost and other purchase terms apr disclosure price restrictions regulation of payment collec tion practices and regulation of reinstatement rights this section of the report includes discussion of policy options and issues related to these areas of concern the report strongly supports clear and accurate disclosure of cost and other purchase terms at the point of sale in advertising and in agreements the survey found most rent toown merchandise was purchased and theref ore consumers need information on the total cost of an item to compare rental purchas to any alternatives the report recommended that the total cost numbers include the sum of all weekly or monthly rental payments and all other mandatory fees and charges the report recommended disclosure of this information at the store on product labels or ta gs on all displayed merchandise other basic terms of purchase such as the amount of the periodi c payment and whether the item was new or used were also recommended for inclusion on the label it was urged that total cost and other basic terms of purchase also be disclosed in advertising and that agreement documents disclose all of the terms and conditions of the renttoown transaction the report suggests that potential costs nd benefits should be thoroughly examined before regulatory polic ies addressing the other four areas of concern are adopted and that regulation of the renttoow n industry s hould ttempt to balance two priorities 1 ensuring that renttoown consumers have th information and protections needed to make informed decisions and 2 avoiding prohib itive industry costs that could substantially reduce the availability of rentalpurchase transactions the report acknowledges that rentalpurchase transactions can be an expensive method of purchasing merchandise and concludes that consumers shoul d be made aware of the cost s of purchasing through rent toown transactions at the same time the survey found relatively high level of customer satisfaction with rentalpurchase tr ansactions suggesting that the renttoown industry does provide service that meet s the needs of certain consumers regulation and legislation currently federal consumer protection laws do not specifi cally regulate renttoown transactions the disclosure requireme nts of the truthinlendingact tila4 and the consumer leasing act cla5 do not apply to the renttoown industry tila is disclosure law implemented by federal rese rve regulation z tila requires consumer creditors to disclose an apr and other loan terms renttoown transactions are not covered because regulation z ex cludes leases that are termin able without penalty by the consumer cla requires disclo sures concerning the terms of personal property leaseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21467crs5

cong 1st sess july 12 2001cla is implemented by federal reserve regu lation m to be covered lease must be in excess of four months since rentto own agreements are shortterm monthly or weekly selfrenewing leases they are not covered by regulation m renttoown transactions ar addressed by state law by the summer of 2001 47 states had laws governing rentalpurchase tran sactions the laws vary from state to state but generally treat renttoow n transactions as leases variety of disclosures are required by the state laws but only 18 states provide for co st disclosures on merchandise tags or labels6 consumer groups have worked to strengthen state laws criticizing most of the laws for providing inadequate protection ge nerally consumer advo cates support federal legislation that would subject these transactions to existing federal credit laws and address policy issues discussed in the ftc report these groups also argue against proposals that would preempt more protective state law the renttoown industry has generally s upported federal legisl ation as means of creating uniform regulatory framework ho wever industry repres entatives have fought proposals that would define these transactions as credit sales ge nerally the industry has supported the various state acti ons because the state laws vi ewed renttoown transactions as leases and provided for disclosure s the industry considered reasonable legislation has been introduced in each congress during the last decade dealing with the rentalpurchase industry the proposals have not been uniform some defined rent toown transactions as leases and others would have subjected the industry to federal credit laws and state usury laws variet of disclosures have been proposed in addition legislation s addressed abusive payment coll ection practices and the issue of reinstatement rights currently one bill hr 1767 has been introduced in the 110th congress the bill would provide for uniform disclosure require ments including total costs the amount and timing of the payments and the consumers right to terminate the agreement in addition the bill would require consumer protections governing account statements renegotiations and extensions disclosures at the point of sale and advertising di sclosures hr 1767 would also define renttoow n transactions as lease agreements and it would prevent states from characterizing rentalpurchase agreements as credit transactions the legislation was introduced on march 29 2007 and referred to the committee on financial services
