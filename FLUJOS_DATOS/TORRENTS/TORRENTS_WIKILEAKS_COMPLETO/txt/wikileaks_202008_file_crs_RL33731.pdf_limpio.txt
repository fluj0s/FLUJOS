relatively highpoverty leas and of lowering the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs to 40 or more of pupils from lowincome families should title ia grants be funded at the maximum authorized level at what level should authorizati ons be set for years beyond fy2008 and should substantial proportion of leas be required to meet increasing title ia requirements while experiencing flat or declining grant levels outcome accountability requirements pupil assessment8 the current generation of pupil assessm ent requirements under esea title ia began with the improving americas schools act iasa of 1994 pl 103382 that required participating st ates to develop or adopt curriculum content standards pupil performance standards and assessments linked to these at least in the subjects of mathematics and readingenglish language arts9 and for at least one grade in each of three grade ranges grades 35 69 and 1012 in general these standards and assessments were to be appli cable to title ia participan ts as well as all other pupils in the state these requireme nts were adopted in part to raise expectations that title ia participants would be required to m eet challenging academic standards and to link the program to standardsbased reforms taking place in most states10 under the iasa the deadline for adop ting content and performance standards was the 19971998 program year and for assessments was the 20002001 program year states were given several years to meet these requirements because many of them were at an early stage of standard sbased reform in 1994 the us department of education ed reviewed evidence that state standards and assessments met the requirements of the title ia statute eg that assessments are linked to state content and pupil performance standards or that disabled and limited english proficienthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs5 11 participating states must continue to m eet these 1994 requirements in addition to additional assessment requirements under nclb 12 states were required to develop content nd academic achievement standards at 3 grade levels in science by the end of the 20052006 school year 13 under regulations published in the federal register on july 5 2002 pp 4503845047 state assessments meeting the esea title ia requirements may include either criterion referenced tests crts tests that measure the extent to which pupils have mastered specified content content standard to pr edetermined degree achievement standard or normreferenced tests nrts tests in which pupil performance is measured against that of other pupils rather than against some fixed standard of performance although any nrts used must be augmented to incorporate the states content standards and have results expressed in terms of the states achievement st andards for further discussion of this and related issues see crs report rl31407 educational testing implementation of esea title ia requirements under the child left behind act by wayne c riddlelep pupils are assessed with appropriate accommodations or adaptations but did not consider the substance of state standards and assessments11 pl 107 110 substantially expanded these previous title ia assessment provisions in addition to the requirement for assessments at three grade levels in reading and mathematics all participating states were required to implement assessments linked to state content and academic achievement standards for all public school pupils in each of grades 38 in reading and mathematics by the end of the 20052006 school year par ticipating states are also required to develop and implement assessments at three grade leve ls in science by the end of the 20072008 school year12 pl 107110 requires assessments to be of adequate technical quality for each purpose required under this act13 assessment results must be provided to leas schools and teachers before the beginning of the subsequent school year so that they might be available in timely manner to make adequate yearly progress determinations for schools and leas the primary rationale for requiring nnual administration of standardsbased tests in each of grades 38 is that the provision of timely information on the performance of pupils schools and leas th roughout most of the elementary and middle school grades is of value for both diagnostic and accountability purposes arguably such assessment results will improve the quality of the ayp determinations that are based primarily on the assessments and help determine whether title ia is meeting its primary goals such as reducing achievement gaps between disadvantaged and other pupils at the same time the expanded title ia assessment requirements might lead to vari ety of educational costs or unintended consequences one such cost would be expanded federal influence on state and local education policies such as assessment requirements attached to an aid program focused on disadvantaged pupils ar broadly influencin g policies regarding standards assessments and accountability affecting all pupils in participating states in the majority of states that did not previously administer standardsbased assessments in each of grades 38 their decision not to administer annual assessments may have resulted primarily from cost or time constraints or the states may have determined th at annual testing of this sort is not educationa lly appropriate or at least that its benefits are not equal to the relevant costs these costs mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs6 14 leas may continue to administer assessmen ts to pupils in nonenglish languages for up to five years if on casebycase basis they determine that this would likely yield more accurate information on what the students know and can do 15 for further information on this and related topics see crs report rl32913 the individuals with disabilities education act id ea interactions with selected provisions of the child left behind act nclba by richard n apling and nancy lee jones 16 several statutory constraints have been pl aced on the authority of the us secretary of education to enforce these standard and asse ssment requirements first the esea states that nothing in title i shall be construed to authorize any federal official or agency to mandate direct or control state loca l educational agency or schools specific instructional content academic achievement standards and assessments curriculum or program of instruction sections 1905 9526 and 9527 second states may not be required to submit their standards to the secr etary section 1111b1a or to have their content or achievement standards approved or certified by the federal government section 9527c in order to receive funds under the esea other than the limited review necessary in order to determine whether the state meets the title ia technical requirements finally state plan may be disapproved by ed on the basis of specific content or achievement standards or assessment items or instruments section 1111e1finclude an increased risk of overemphasi s on preparation for the tests especially if the tests do not adequa tely assess the full range of knowledge and skills that schools are expected to impart to the extent practicable limited english proficient lep pupils are to be assessed in the language and form most likely to yield accurate and reliable information on what they know and can do in academic content areas in subjects other than english itself however pup ils who have attended schools in the united states excluding puerto rico for three or more consecutive school years are to be assessed in english14 in addition states are to pr ovide that their leas will annually assess the english language proficiency of their lep pup ils including pupils oral reading and writing skills in administering all required assessments reasonable adaptations and accommodations are to be provided for student s with disabilities consistent with the provisions of the individuals with disabilities education act idea15 achievement standards associated with the required assessments must establish at least three performance levels for all pupils advanced proficient and partially proficient usually referred to as basic if agency or entity in state has authority to establish statewide standa rds or assessments as is the case for iowa and possibly nebraska then the state may adopt either statewide standards and assessments applicable only to title ia pupils and pr ograms or b policy providing that each lea receiving title ia grants will adopt standards and assessments that meet the requirements of title ia and are applicable to all pupils served by each such lea state educational agencies seas must provide evidence from test publisher or other relevant source that their assessments are of adequate technical quality for the purposes required under title ia16 ongoing peer reviews of state assessment programs are being conducted to determine if they meet nclb requirements to test pupils in each of grades 38 in reading nd mathematics and to adopt content and achievement standards in science letter sent to ch ief state school

case of the two not approved stat 10 or 15 in the case of approval pending states plus the additional sanctions of limitations on approval of flexibility requests and heightened oversight by ed according to ed funds withheld from the sea would be distributed to leas in the state in addition states that persistently and thoroughly fail to meet the standard nd assessment requireme nts over an

pupil takes an entire naep test since individual pupil takes an entire naep test it is impossible for naep as currently signed to report i ndividual pupil scores in addition while individual pupils may not be required to take naep tests there are conflicting statutory and regulatory provi sions regarding the voluntary nature of participation in naep sts by leas and schools18 although naep cannot currently provide assessment results for individual pupils the levels at which scores c ould be provided depend on the size and specificity of the sample group of pupils tested naep has ways provided scores for the nation as whole and four multis tate regions beginning in 1990 naep has conducted statelevel assessments in 4th and 8th grade mathematics reading and beginning in 1996 science under state naep the sample of pupils tested is increased in order to provide reliable timates of achievement scores for pupils in each participating state before enactment of nclb participation in naep was voluntary for states the additional cost associated with state naep administration was borne by the states and after participating in any st ate naep test states could separately decide whether to allow the release of naep results for their state the costs of testing expanded pupil samp in the states under naep are paid by the federal government an implicit purpose of this requirement is to confirm trends in pupil achievement as measured by stateselected assessments19 although such confirmation is highly limited and indirect usually limited to comparisons by noned analysts of the percentage of pup ils at various achieve ment levels on naep and state tests agents of the federa l government are prohibited from using naep assessments to influence state or lea inst ructional

reauthorization issues regarding assessments issues regarding the expanded esea title i pupil assessment requirements include should requirements for standards based assessments in states participating in esea title ia be expanded for senior high school students as discussed above the cu rrent assessment requirements are focused primarily although not solely on the elementary and middle school grades in the administrations high school initiative and elsewhere proposals have b een offered to expand required assessments for pupils in grades 1012 in part to strengthen the process of determining adequate yearly progress for senior high schools this would include requi red state participation in 12th grade naep assessment however the substantial variation in senior high school instructional programs raises many issues including the following might the required assessments include high school exit or graduation sts given the relatively high degree of curriculum differentiation at the senior high school level eg career and technical educa tion programs advanced placement courses and so forth might st ates be allowed to meet these requirements by adopting different types of tests for pupils in different types of academic programs might advanced placement or international baccalaureate tests be used to meet the new assessment requirements for pupils participating in those programs has the emphasis on standardsbased assessments of reading and mathematics achievement in the title ia assessment and adequate yearly progress requirements see be low begun to crowd out the level of time and attention devoted to other subject areas such as writing science history civics or foreign languages or skills in any subject area that are not typi cally covered by state assessments concern has been expressed by some and there is evidence20 that the emphasis placed on reading nd mathematics through the title ia assessment and adequate early progress requirements has reduced time and energy devoted to other subject areas for many students others have argued that emphasis on the skills and knowledge typically covered by st andardsbased st ate mathematics and reading assessments has resulted in more narrowly prescriptive instruction overall reducing instructional time devoted to the development of higher level anal ytical skills pupil creativity or research projects these concerns may lead to proposals to either deemphasize the current requireme nts or to expand the assessment requirements to include more subj ects in more grades

assessment development grants would cover all estimated state costs only if states used only multipl choice questions that can be machine scored otherwise if states used mix of multiple choice and openended questions gao timated that the assessment development grants would cover 51 69 of state test development costs excluding possible costs of developing alternate assessments for pupils with disabilities or english proficiency tests for lep pupils21 studies by nongovernment organizations of the costs of meeting nclb assessment requirement s and of whether those costs exceed the aggregate level of assessment development funds provided under nclb have reach ed contradictory results adequate yearly progress ayp requirements22 since the 1988 reauthorization of th esea pl 100297 the accountability provisions of title ia have been increasingly focused on achievement and other outcomes for participatin g pupils and schools since the subsequent esea reauthorization in 1994 iasa pl 103 382 and especially under nclb pl 107 110 key concept embodied in these out come accountability requirements is that of ayp for schools leas and with much less emphasis states overall the primary purpose of ayp require ments is to serve as the basis for identifying schools and leas where performance is inadequate so that these inadequacies may be addressed first through pr ovision of increased support and opportunities for families to exercise choice to transfer to anothe r school or obtain suppl emental services from thirdparty provider and ultimately through series of more substantial consequences described in later sections of this report these actions are to be taken with respect to schools or leas th at fail to meet ayp for two consecutive years or more action need be taken with respect to school or lea that fails to meet ayp standards for only one yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs12 23 as noted earlier nclb requires states partic ipating in title ia to administer standards based assessments in science at 3 grade levels by the end of the 200708 school year while statutory provisions are somewhat ambiguous on this point it does not appear that states will be required under current ed policy to incorporate results from these science assessments into their ayp determinations 24 the graduation rate or other additional acad emic indicators need not be disaggregatedthrough nclb the title ia requirements for statedeveloped standards of ayp became both more broad in scope and substantially more detailed nclb provisions regarding ayp were adopted larg ely in reaction to perceived weaknesses with the ayp requirements of the 1994 iasa the latter were frequently criticized as being vague lacking required sp ecific focus on disadvantaged pupil groups failing to require c ontinuous improvement toward an ultimate goal and being applicable only to schools and leas participating in title ia not to states overall or to all public schools before the enactment of nclb there was tremendous variation among the states in the impact of their ayp standards namely the number and percentage of title ia school s and leas identified as failing to meet ayp standards somewhat ironically as is discussed later in this report there continues to be great deal of variation am ong states in this respect in spite of the extensive nclbbased efforts to make ayp policies more consistent through the interaction of ed regulati ons and other forms of policy guidance as well as innovation in the states nclb s policies on ayp ve evolved over the years in several respects becoming more flexible as well as more complex and varied the discussion below will refer to current ayp policies as established through combination of the authorizin g statute regulations and ed policy guidance for discussion of how current policies evolved over time see crs report rl32495 adequate yearly progress ayp implementation of the child left behind act by wayne c riddle under nclb ayp is defined primarily on the basis of multiple aggregations of pupil scores on required state assessments of academic achievement in mathematics and reading generally with specific focus on the percentage of pupils scoring at proficient or higher level of achieveme nt on the basis of state determined standard s of proficiency23 state ayp standards must also include at least one additional academic indicator in th case of high schools this additional indicator must be the graduation rate for elementary and middle schools the attendance rate is often selected by stat to be the additional indicator the additional indicators may not be employed in way that would reduce the number of schools or leas identified as failing to meet ayp standards disaggregation ayp calculations ba sed on assessment scores24 must be disaggregated that is they must be determined separately and specifically for not only all pupils but also for several demogr aphic groups of pupils within each school lea and state the specified demographi c groups often referred to as subgroups in addition to the all pupils group are economically disadvantaged pupils lep pupilshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs13 25 in september 29 2005 letter to all cssos see http wwwedgov policyelsecguid secletter050929html the secretary of educa tion stated that leas and schools affected by the 2005 gulf coast hurricanes could establis h separate subgroup for displaced students in ayp determinations based on assessments administered during the 20052006 school year pupils would appear only in the evacuee subgroup not in other demographic subgroups eg economically disadvantaged or lep waivers could be requested in 2006 to allow schools or leas to meet ayp requireme nts if only the test scores of the evacuee subgroup would prevent them from making ayp in any case all such students must still be assessed and the assessment results reported to the public 26 states frequently establish lower minimum group size thresholds for reporting purposes as opposed to ayp determinations 27 small number of states have specific minimum group size policy rather they rely solely on confidence intervals as discussed late r in this report to address statistical and privacy concerns 28 on august 7 2006 ed published in the fe deral register pages 4486644871 proposed guidance on maintaining collecting and reporting data on race and ethnicity to the us department of education while this gu idance would standardize racial and ethnic categories for variety of purposes related to ed programs and activities it provides that states will continue to have discretion in determining which racial and ethnic groups will be used for accountability and reporting purposes under the esea p 44867pupils with disabilities and pupils in major racial and ethnic groups25 however there are three major constrai nts on the consideration of these pupil groups in ayp calculations first pupil groups need not be considered in cases where their number is so relatively small that achievement results would not be statistically significant or the identity of individual pupils might be divulged the selection of the minimum number n of pupils in group for the group to be considered in ayp determinations26 has been left largely to state discretion and state policies regarding n have varied widely the minimum size for pupil groups to be separately considered beyond the all pup ils group in ayp determinations for schools or leas may be as low as 5 pupils or in some circumstances as many as 20027 in addition the minimum group size po licies of several states take into account not only the number of pupils in each group but also their size as percentage of all pupils since minimum group size policies ar applied to schools and to leas overall groups that are too small to be separate ly considered for individual schools are often c onsidered at the lea level further some states have establis hed different higher minimum group sizes for lep pupils or pupils with disabilitie s than for other pupil groups however under regulations published on april 9 2007 st ates would longer be allowed to use varying minimum group sizes for differe nt demographic groups of pupils this will prohibit the setting of higher n size s for pupils with disabilities or lep pupils than for other pupil groups in the future second it has been left to the states to define the major racial and ethnic groups on the basis of which ayp must be calculated28 some states have identified relatively few different m ajor ethnic and racial groups eg black white andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs14 29 this is defined in state accountability plans and is typically from some point in october until the administration of state assessments 30 there is limit for individual schools as may request from the us secretary of education an exception allowing them to ex ceed the 10 cap statewide and seas may grant such exceptions to leas w ithin their state in the absence of waiver the number of pupils scoring at the proficient level or hi gher on alternate assessments on the basis of alternate achievement standards in excess of the 10 limit is to be added to those scoring below proficient in lea or st ate level ayp determinationshispanic pupils while others have identif ied several more parate groups eg native american filipino pacific islander other asian pupils in many cases there is an interaction between the numbe r of ethnic and racial groups separately identified and minimum group size policies the larger the number of separate groups the less likely that minimum gr oup size thresholds will be met and third pupils who have not atte nded the same school for full year29 need not be considered in determining ayp at the school level although they are still to be included in lea and state ayp determin ations if they ttended schools in the same lea or state for the full academic year number of special rules which have evolved over time apply to two of the disaggregated pupil groups lep pupils and pupils with disabilities lep pupils who have attended schools in the ited states other than puerto rico for less than 12 months must participate in english language proficiency and mathematics tests plus science assessments beginning in 20072008 but the partic ipation of such pupils in reading tests in english as well as the inclusion of any of these pupils test scores in reading or mathematics in ayp calculations is optional further in ayp determinations school s and leas may continue to include pupils in the lep demographic category for up to two years after they have attained proficiency in english however these formerly lep pupils need not be included when determining whether school or leas count of lep pupils meets the states minimum size threshold for separate inclus ion of the group in ayp calculations and scores of formerly lep pupils may not be included as part of the lep pupil group in state lea or school report cards an especially high degree of attenti on has been devoted to assessment and ayp policies regarding pupils with disabilities while few general provisions apply to all pupils with disabilities primarily that accommodations be provided where appropriate in the administration of assessm ents to these pupils series of special provisions apply specifically to two partic ular groups of pupils with disabilities the first set of special provisions applies to pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities for limited number of such pupils maximum of 10 of all tested pupils or approximately 9 of ll pupils with disabilities at the state and lea level30 states and leas may adopt lternate assessments on the basis of alternate achievement standards sepa rate ed policy is focused on pupils with persistent academic disabilities whose ab ility to perform academically is assumed to be greater than that of the pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities but below that of other pupils with disab ilities in eds terminology these pupilshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs15 31 on april 9 2007 ed published final regulations embodying the longerterm policy for this group of pupils with disabilities also under these regulations as with lep pupils states and leas could include the test scores of former pupils with disabilities in the disability subgroup for up to two years after such pupils have exited special education in such cases the former pupils with disabilities w ould not have to be counted in determining whether the minimum group size was met for the disability subgroupmay be assessed using altern ate assessments on the basis of modified achievement standards under shortterm policy applicable to states that are still developing modified academic achievement standards and alternate assessments based on these schools and leas that would otherwise fa il to meet ayp standards due solely to their pupils with disabilities group may add to their proficient pupil count number of pupils with disabilities qual to 20 of all pupils as sessed alternatively in eligible states that have adopted modifi ed achievement standa rds schools and leas may include in their ayp calculations the proficient scores for pupils with disabilities on these assessments subject to 20 of all assessed pupils cap at the lea and state levels31 as with the 10 cap for pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities this 20 cap does not apply to individual schools ultimate goal state ayp standards must incorporate concrete movement toward meeting an ultimate goal of ll pupils reaching proficient or higher advanced level of achievement within 12 years which is by the end of the 2013 2014 school year the steps or required leve ls of achievement toward meeting this goal annual measurable objectives or am must increase in equal increments over time the first increase in the thresholds must occur after more than two years and remaining increases at least on ce every three years several states have accommodated this requirement in ways that require much more rapid progress in the later years of the period leading up to 20132014 than in the earlier period ie the increments are equal but occur annually at the end of this period but only once every two or three years at the beginning participation rate nclb ayp provisions include an assessment participation rate requirement in order for school to meet ayp sta ndards at least 95 of all pupils as well as at least 95 of each of the demographic groups of pupils considered for ayp determinations for th school or lea must participate in each of the assessments that serve as the primary basis for ayp determinations participation rate s may be averaged over two or threeyear period and pupils who fail to participate in assessments due to significant medical emergency may be excluded from the participation rate calculations states may allow pupils who miss primary assessment date to take makeup tests under regulations published in the federal register on april 9 2007 when pupils take state assessments multiple times it is longer required that only the first test administration be used in ayp determinations states and as could use the highest score for pupils who take tests more than once the participation rate requirements were adopted in part to emphasize the intent that the assessmen t systems and ayp determinations should involve all pupils and to minimize opportunitie s for schools or leas to raise their test scores by discouraging pupils from participating in the testshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs16 32 there is variant of the group status model sometimes called an index model under which partial credit would be attributed to performance improvements below the proficient level eg from below basic to basic 33 for discussion of the mode ls of ayp see crs report rl33032 adequate yearly progress ayp growth models under the child left behind act by wayne riddlemodels of ayp the basic structure of most ayp models falls into one of three general categories the three basi c structural forms for ayp of schools or leas are the group status successive group improvement and individualcohort growth models in the context of these term s group or subgroup in the case of detailed demographic categories refers to collection of pupils that is identified by their grade level and usually other demographic characteristics eg race ethnicity or economic disadvantage as of point in time the actual pupils in group may change substantially or even completely fro m one year to the next in contrast cohort refers to collection of pupils in which the same pupils are followed from year to year the key characteristic of the group status model is require d threshold level of achievement that is the same for all pup il groups schools and leas statewide in given subject and grade level under this model performance at point in time is compared to benchmark at that time with direct consideration of changes over previous period status models em phasize the importance of meeting certain minimum levels of achievement for ll pupil groups schools and leas and arguably apply consistent expectations to all the key characteristic of the successive group improvement model is focus on the rate of change in achievement in subject area from one year to the next among groups of pupils in grade level at sc hool or lea eg the percentage of this years 5th grade pupils in school who are at proficient or higher level in mathematics compared to the percentage of last years 5th grade pupils who were at proficient or higher level of achievement finally the key characteristic of the i ndividualcohort growth model is focus on the rate of change over time in the vel of achievement among cohorts of the same pupils growth models are longit udinal based upon the tracking of the same pupils as they progress through their k12 education careers although the progress of pupils is tracked individually results are typically aggregated when used for accountability purposes in general growth models would give credit for meeting steps along the way to profic iency in ways that stat us model typically does not32 the primary basic structure for ayp under nclb is speci fied in the authorizing statute as group status model33 uniform bar approach is employed states are to set threshold percentage of pupils at proficient or advanced levels each year that is applicable to all pupil subgroups of sufficient size to be considered in ayp determinations the threshold levels of achievement are to be set separately for reading and math and may be set separate ly for each level or grade span of k12 education elementary middl and high schools the minimum starting point for the uniform bar in the initial pe riod 20022003 and in most states 20032004 was to be the greater of the percentage of pupils at the proficient or advanced levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs17 34 for example assume the percentage of schools pupils in designated subgroup meeting minimum group size criteria scoring at proficient or higher level on state mathematics assessments is 40 in one year and 47 in the following year while the amo for the second year is 49 this group would not meet the standard ayp threshold for year two 47 is below 49 but would meet the safe harbor criterion 10 of the previous year gap between the groups performan ce and 100 is 6 percentage points so score of 46 or above would satis fy the safe harbor provision 35 one other state massachusetts incorporates partial growth element into its safe harbor provision in that state sc hool or lea that fails to meet the standard ayp requirements still makes ayp if the number of pupils in relevant groups and subjects scoring below the proficient level declines by 10 or more from the previous year or declines sufficiently to put them on track toward proficiency by the end of the 20132014 school yearof achievement for the lowestachievi ng pupil group in the base year 200102 or b the school at the 20th percentile from the bottom in the state in determining whether scores for group of pupils are at the required level the averaging of scores over two or three year s is allowed in addition nclb statute includes safe harbor pr ovision under which school that does not meet the standard ayp requirements may still be deemed to meet ayp if it experiences 10 reduction in the gap between 100 and th preceding year for the specific pupil groups that fail to meet the uniform bar34 and those pupil groups also make progress on at least one other academic indicator included in the states ayp standards this alternative provision adds successive group improvement as secondary ayp model under nclb the third basic type of ayp model th individualcohort growth model is not explicitly mentioned in nclb statute however in november 2005 after officials in several states requested authority to use such model to meet the ayp requirements of nclb the u s secretary of education announced pilot program under which up to 10 states would be allo wed to use growth models to make ayp determinations for the 20052006 and succeed ing school years in december 2007 the secretary lifted the cap on the number of states that could participate in the growth model pilot in addition to variety of criteria applicable to all state ayp policies under the proposed models ach ievement gaps among pupil groups must decline in order for schools or leas to meet ayp standard s annual achievement goals for pupils must not be set on the basis of pupil backgr ound or school characteristics annual achie vement goals must be ba sed on performance standards not past or typical perfo rmance growth rates the ssessment system must produce comparable results from grade to grade and year to year and the progress of individual students must be tracked within state data system in addition applicant states must have their nnual assessments for each of grades 38 approved by ed and these assessments must have been in place for at least one year previous to the first year of implementati on of the growth model according to ed 20 states have submitted applications to be allowed to use growth models to make ayp determinations beginning with either the 20052006 or 20062007 school years35 two states north carolina and tennessee were approved to use proposed growth models in making ayp determinations on the basis of assessments administered in the 20052006 sc hool year nine additional states httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs18 36 delawares proposal included use of confid ence intervals at an unspecified level in implementing the growth model however ed approved use of the model without confidence intervalsarkansas delaware florida iowa ohi alaska arizona missouri and michigan have been approved to pa rticipate in the pilot program subsequently contingent in the case of ohio and missouri on doption of minimum group sizes for all pupil groups the north carolina policy adds projection component to the current group status model if the achievement level of non proficient pupil is on trajectory toward proficiency within four years then the pupil is added to the proficient group the trajectory calculations will be made for pupils in the 3rd through 8th grades under the tennessee policy sc hools and leas will have two options for meeting ayp meetin g either the ayp standards under the group status or successive gr oup improvement models of current law or meeting ayp standards according to projection model under the projection model pupils ar deemed to be at proficient or higher level of achie vement if their test scores are projected to be at proficient or higher level three years into the future on the basis of past achievement levels for individual pupils tennessees projection model will not be applied to high schools under the delaware growth model ayp will be calculated each year on the basis of both the statutory provisions and using the states growth model and school will meet ayp standards if it qualifies using either method individual pupil performance will be tracked from one year to the next specified numbers of points will be awarded on the basis of change s if any in pupils performance level points will be awarded for partial movement toward proficiency but not fo r movement beyond proficiency the average growth scores for schools and leas to meet ayp

models floridas growth model will be essentially the same as the current status model except that proficient pupils will include both those currently scoring at proficient or high er level and those who are on an individual path toward proficiency within three years the model will be applied to ayp determinations for grades 310 with some modifications for pupils in grade 3 under the iowa model pupil test s score ranges below proficient have been divided into three categor ies hi marginal marginal and weak student who rises from one of these levels to higher level and has not previously attained the higher level will be deemed to have met adequate yearly growth ayg for schools and leas that have not t ayp though application of the standard status and safe harbor models students making ayg will be added to those scoring profic ient or above and this combined total will be used in determining whether th school or lea makes ayp for the year students beginning at the weak level must reach proficiency within three years those beginning at marginal must become proficient within tw years and those beginning at hi marginal must reach proficienc within one year by 2014 the growth model would longer be used and all pupils will be expected to achieve at pr oficient or higher level ohio has adopted variation of the projection or on track to proficiency approach that is common to the north carolina tennessee arkansas and florida m odels after application of the standard status and safe harbor models if any pupil group fails to meet ayp then determination will be made if sufficient proportion of pupils in the group is on track toward meeting the required proficiency threshold as of target grade in the case of elementary and middle schools the target grade will be either the grade level following the highest grade offered by the school ie for k5 school the 6th grade or four grades beyond the pupils current grade whichever comes firs t in the case of high school

the scores of individual students are within two standard errors of measurement in effect 95 confidence interval of the test score cut point for proficiency37 such students are considered to be provisionally proficient the gr owth model adds third category of students on trajectory toward proficiency to determine whether students are on trajectory toward proficiency each of the proficiency levels is divided into three sublevels similar but slightly different procedures are applied to michigans alternate assessment for students with mild cognitive impairment the growth model does not cover high school students or students with disabilities taking alternate assessments who have moderate or severe cognitive impairment if students performance improves over the previous year by number of sublevels such that if the improvement continued at the same rate in the future they would reach proficiency within three year s they are counted as being on trajectory toward proficiency confidence intervals will not be applied to the growth model determinationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs21 38 almost all states using confidence intervals apply them to group average percentage scoring proficient or above however at least one state michigan applies confidence interval instead to the scores of individual pupils 39 alternatively the confidence interval window may be applie d to average test scores for each relevant pupil group that would be compared to fixed threshold score level to determine whether ayp has been metoverall most of the growth models approved by ed thus far are based upon supplementing the number of pupils scoring at proficient or higher level with those who are projected to be at proficient level within limited number of years nine of the eleven approved models follow this general approach among these states distinction may be made be tween seven states north carolina arkansas florida alaska arizona missouri and michigan that combine currently proficient pupils with those not proficient who are on tr ack toward proficiency and two states tennessee and ohio that consider only pr ojected proficiency levels for all pupils ie currently proficient pup ils who are not on track to re main proficient are counted as not proficient in cont rast the models used by two other states delaware and iowa focus on awarding credit for movement of pupils among achievement categories up to proficiency confidence intervals many states have used the statistical technique of confidence intervals in an attempt to improve the validity and reliability of ayp determinations use of this technique also tends to have an effect whether intentional or not of substa ntially reducing the number of schools or leas identified as failing to meet ayp standards use of this statistical technique is not explicitly authorized by nclb but its inclusion in the accountability plans of large majority of the states has been approved by ed this concept is based on the assumption that any test administration represents sample survey of pupils educational achievement level as with all sample surveys there is degree of uncertainty regarding how well the sample results average test scores for the pupil group38 reflect pupils actual level of achievement in practice confidence intervals may be seen as windows surrounding threshold test sc ore level ie the percentage of pupils at the proficient or higher level required under the states ayp standards39 the size of the window varies with respect to the number of pupils in the relevant group who are tested and with the desired degree of probability that the groups average score represents their true level of achievement this is anal ogous to the margin of error commonly reported along with public opinion polls like opinion poll results test results are not based on small sample of the relevant populati on as the tests are to be administered to the full universe of pupils however the results from any particular test adminis tration are considered to be onl estimates of pup ils true level of achievement or timates of the schools or leas true level of effectiveness in educating pupils in specified groups and thus the margin of error or confidence interval concepts are deemed by many to be relevant to these test scores the probability or level of confidence that pupil gr oups actual level of performance is within the designated range of scores is most often set at 95 but in some cases may be as low at 90 or as high as 99 if all other relevant factors are equal the higher the desired degree of probability the larger is the window surrounding thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs22 40 the text above describes the way in which confidence intervals have been used by states for ayp determinations the concept could be applied in different way requiring scores to be at or above the highest score in the window in order to demonstrate that pupil group had meet ayp standards to statistically significant degree this would reflect confidence at the designated level of probability that sc hool or lea had met ayp standards whereas the current usage reflects confidence that the school or lea had failed to meet ayp standards 41 states are encouraged to apply these c onsequences to all public schools but are not required to do so state pr actices vary on this pointthreshold percentage especially if the si ze of the pupil group in question is small school would fail to make ayp with re spect to pupil group only if the average score for the group is below the lowest score in the window40 the use of confidence intervals to termine whether group test scores fall below required thresholds to statistically significant degree improves the validity of ayp determinations and ddresses the fact that test scores for any group of pupils will vary from one test administration to another and these variations may be especially large for relatively small gr oup of pupils at the same time the use of confidence intervals reduces the likelihood that schools or to lesser extent leas will be identified as failin g to make ayp also for small pupil groups and high levels of desired accuracy especially 99 probability the size of confidence intervals may be quite large other ayp provisions ayp standards under nclb must be applied to all public sc hools leas nd to states overall if state chooses to r eceive title ia grants however consequences for failing to meet ayp standards as discussed later in this report need only be applied to schools and leas partic ipating in title ia41 and there are sanctions for states ove rall beyond identification and the provision of technical assistance schools or leas meet ayp standards only if they meet the required threshold levels of performance on assessments other academic indicators and test participation with respect to all of the designated pupil groups that meet the minimum group size criterion schools and as face series of consequences namely they are identified as being in need of improvement if they fail to meet ayp standards for two consecutive years or more states may limit identification for improvement to schools that fail to meet ayp in the same subject area for two consecutive years or more but not to sc hools that fail to meet ayp for the same pupil group and subject area finally states may limit identification of leas for improvement to those that failed to meet ayp in the same subject area and across all three grade spans elementary middle and high for two consecutive years or more data on schools identified as failing to meet ayp substantial amount of data has become available on the number of schools and leas that have failed to meet the ayp standards of the nclb on the basis of assessments administered during the 20022003 throug h 20052006 school years and several states are currently releasing preliminar data on the basis of 20062007 school year assessment results basic

failing to meet ayp sta ndards for two consecutive years and any additional years ed in its national assessment of title i final report published in october 2007 repor ted that 11648 public schools including 9808 title ia schools were identifie d for improvement during the 20052006 school year on the basis of assessment results through the 20042005 school year these constituted 12 of all public schools or 18 of all title ia schools schools most likely to be identified were those in large urban leas schools with high pupil poverty rates nd schools with large minority enrollment the percentage of both all and of title ia schools identified varied widely among the states from less than 1 of all1 of title ia schools in ne braska to more than 40 of all schools in hawaii new mexico and puer to rico or more than 50 of all title ia schools in florida new mexico and puerto rico theme reflected in these results is high degree of state variation in the percentage of schools identif ied as failing to meet ayp standards or as needing improvement these variati ons appear to be based at least in part not only on underlying differences in achie vement levels but also on differences in the degree of rigor or challenge in state pupil performan ce standards and on variations in state determined standards for the minimum size of pupil demographic groups in order for them to be considered in ayp determinations of schools or leas in general larger minimum sizes for pupil demographic groups reduce the likelihood that many disadvantaged groups such as lep pup ils or pupils with disabilities w ill be considered in determining whet her school or lea meets ayp such large state variations are somewhat ironic given that one of the purposes of including more detailed and specific st atutory provisions for ayp in nclb was to establish greater consistency among stat in the number of schools identified as result of such variations and particularly the relativel large percentage of schools identified in several states some have expr essed concern that large percentages of all public schools are being iden tified as failing and subjected to variety of corrective actions described below with consequent strain on financial and otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs26 44 see thomas j kane and douglas staiger racial subgroup rules in school accountability systems

necessary to provide techni cal assistance public school choice and supplemental services options and other co rrective actions in addition some have expressed concern that schools might be more likely to fail to meet ayp simply because they have diverse enrollments nd therefore more groups of pupils to be separately considered in determining whether the school meets ayp standards44 in response to these concerns ed officials have emphasize d the importance of taking action to identify and move to impr ove underperforming schools matter how numerous they have also emphasized the possibilities for flexibility and variation in taking corrective actions see below with respect to schools that fail to meet ayp depending on the extent to which th ey fail to meet those standards leas failing to meet ayp standards although most attention in both the statute and implementation activities thus far has been focused on application of the ayp concept to schools limited amount of information is becoming available about leas that fail to meet ayp requireme nts and the consequences for them as shown in table 1 according to the consolidated state performance reports referred to above approximately 30 of all leas failed to m eet ayp standards on the basis of assessment results for the 20052006 school year45 among the states there was even greater variation for leas than for schools two states alabama and wisconsin reported that 1 or less of their leas failed to make adequate yearly progress while 100 of the leas in flor ida and south carolina plus the single statewide lea in hawaii failed to meet ayp standards finally in its national assessment of title i fina l report ed has reported that 1578 leas representing approximately 10 of all leas were identified for improvement for the 20052006 school year bush administration r eauthorization proposals t h b u s h administrations reauthoriza tion blueprint contains three proposals regarding the esea title ia ayp provisions first all participating states would be allowed to use growth models to make ayp determin ations subject to conditions comparable to those applicable to the current pilot pr ogram in addition by the end of the 2011 2012 school year graduation rates used as the additional academic indicator in ayp determinations for high schools would have to be disaggregated according to the same demographic groups as ach ievement levels further states would be required to use standard measure in calculating graduation rates known as the averaged freshman graduation rate afg r finally the administra tion proposes that science test results be included in ayp dete rminations beginning in 20082009 although with delayed goal for proficiency 20192020 in contrast to the 20132014 goal for reading and math possible reauthorization issues regarding ayp it is likely that number of reauthorization issues will be debated with respect to ayp these issues may be divided into two general categories according to whether the current requirements are viewed as being too stringent or too lenienthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs27 are the current ayp requi rements too stringent is the ultimate goal embodied in nclbs ayp provisions all pupils at proficient or higher level of achievement within 12 years of enactment both desirable and achievable without substantial weakening by states of pupil achievement standards the required incorporation of this ultimate goal is one of the most significant differences between the ayp provi sions of nclb and those under the previous iasa without an ultimate goal of having all pupils reach the proficient or advanced level of achievement by specific date states might simply establish relative goals that provide little or real movement toward or incentives for significant improvement especially among disadvantaged pupil groups proponents of such demanding u ltimate goal argue that schools and leas frequently meet the goals established for them even rather challenging goals if the goals are very clearly identified defined and established and are attainable demanding goal might maximize efforts toward imp rovement by state public school systems even if the goal is not met ne vertheless goal of having all pupils at proficient or higher level of achievement within any specified period of time may be criticized as being unrealistic if one assumes that proficiency has been established at challenging level as at least some states appear to have done it is likely that many states schools and leas will not meet nclbs ultimate ayp goal unless state standards of proficient performance are significantly lowered or states are allowed by ed to aggressively pursue the use of statistical techniques such as setting high minimum group sizes and confidence intervals to substantially reduce the range of pupil groups actually c onsidered in ayp determinations and effectively lower required achievement leve l thresholds does the requirement for disaggregation of pupil groups in ayp determinations make it too difficult for schools or leas with diverse pupil populations to meet ayp standards all other relevant factors especially minimum group size bein g equal the more diverse its pupil population the more thresholds school or lea must meet in order to make ayp while this was an intended result of legislation designed to focus on specific di sadvantaged pupil groups the impact of making it more difficult for schools and leas serving diverse populations to meet ayp standards may also be seen as an unintended consequence of nclb number of studies have concluded that when compar ing public schools with similar aggregate pupil achievement levels or aggregate percentages of pupils from lowincome families schools with wider variety of nclbrelevant demographic groups are substantially less likely to meet ayp standards according to the national assessment of title i final report publishe d by ed in october 2007 among schools with relatively low poverty ra tes the percentage of schools failing to make ayp ranged from 3 for those with only 1 subgroup to 25 for those with 3 subgroups and 32 for those with 4 or 5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs28 subgroups however without specific requirements for achievement gains by each of the major pupil groups it is possible that insufficient attention would be paid to the performance of the disadvantaged pupil groups among whom improvements are most needed and for whose benefit the title ia program was established this is because many schools and leas could demonstrate improvements in achievement by their pupils overall while the achievement of their disadva ntaged pupils does not improve significantly is the 95 assessment partici pation requirement too high according to the recent ed report national assessm ent of title i final report 3 of the sc hools that failed to meet ayp requirements for the 20042005 school year did so solely on the basis of participation rates while many others failed to meet the participation rate requirement in addition to other ayp thresholds while few argue against having an participation rate requirement it may be questioned whether it need s to be as high as 95 the average percentage of enrolled pupils in attendance at public k12 schools in recent years 935 is below this level and such attendance rates are generally assumed to be substantially lower than this national average in schools with high proportions of disadvantaged pupils even thoug h schools are explicitly allowed to administer assessments on makeup days following the primary date of test administr ation and it is probable that more schools and leas will meet this requirement as they become more fully aware of its significance it is likely to continue to be very difficult for some schools and leas to meet 95 test participation requirement are too many schools and leas failing to meet ayp standards as is discussed above relatively large percen tages of public schools and leas overall have fa iled to meet state ayp standards future increases in performance thresholds as the ultimate goal of having all pupils at the proficient or higher level of achievement is approached as well as the implementation of tests in additional grades in many states may result in higher percentages of schools failing to make ayp ed officials have emphasized the importance of taking action to identify nd improve underperforming schools matter how numerous they have also emphasized the possibilities for flexibility in taking corrective actions with respect to schools that fail to meet ayp depending on the extent to which they fail to meet those standards further some analysts argue that set of ayp standards that relatively high percentage of public schools fails to meet may accurately reflect pervasive weaknesses in public school systems especially with respect to disadvantaged pupil groups others have consisten tly expressed c oncern bout the accuracy efficacy and complexity of an accountability system under which such relatively high per centage of schools is identified as failing to make adequate progress with consequent strain onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs29 financial and other resources necessary to provide technical assistance public school choice nd supplemental services options as well as other corrective actions should states be allowed greater fl exibility in the models of ayp they implement to meet the nclb requirements in particular should all states be allowed to adopt models that are largely or primarily based on pup il achievement growt h as discussed above with respect to the current pilot program the conditions for participation in the pilot are somewhat restrictive and four of the five growth models approved thus far are relatively limited essentially adding projected achievement level option to the standard ayp model of nclb should ayp determinations retain their current passfail structure or should states be allowed to use more varied graduated rating scale under current law and policy schools leas and states simply do or do not meet ayp standards and there is generally distinction between those that fail to meet only one or two required performance or pa rticipation thresholds to marginal degree versus those that fail to meet numerous thresholds to substantial extent several analysts have suggested that more nuanced grading scale be allowed eg grades ranging from to f as is used in several state accountability systems major complication is determining at what point on such scale the current automatic consequences eg school choice or supplemental services discussed below are invoked are the current ayp requirements too lenient are such statistical techniques as confidence intervals and data averaging being appropriately app lied in state ayp policies the averaging of test score results for various pupil groups over two or threeyear periods is explicitly authorized under nclb the use of confidence intervals is not explicitly authorized by the statute but has been approved by ed and very widely adopted by states the use of confidence intervals to termine whether group test scores fall below required thresholds to statistically significant degree addresses the fact that test scor for any group of pupils will vary from one test administration to another and these variations may be especially large for relatively small group of pupils at the same time the use of confidence inte rvals reduces the likelihood that schools or leas will be identifie d as failing to make ayp and effectively lowers required thresholds of achievement ultimately the use of this technique may mean that the average achievement levels of pupil groups in ma ny schools will be below 100 proficiency by 20132014 yet th schools would still meet ayp standards because the groups scores are within relevant confidence intervalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs30 are some states setting minimum group size levels so high that large proportion of some disadvantaged pupil groups is not being considered in schoollevel ayp determinations another important technical factor in state ayp standards is the establishment of the minimum size n for pupil groups to be considered in ayp calculations nclb recognizes th at in the disaggregation of pupil data for schools and leas there might be pupil groups that are so small that average test scores would not be statistically reliable or the dissemination of average scores for the group might risk violation of pupils privacy rights the selection of this minimum number has been left to state di scretion and the range of selected values for n is rather large the higher the minimum group size the less likely that many pupil groups will be separa tely considered in ayp determinations especially at the school level this gives schools and leas fewer threshol ds to meet and reduces the likelihood that they will be f ound to have failed to meet ayp standards as result relatively high levels for n weaken nclbs specific focus on variety of pupil groups many of them disadvantaged at the same time pupils of all groups are considered as part of the all student gr oup in every public school and lea and the ultimate goal of 100 proficiency by 20132014 implies that every pupil group matter how sma ll must be evaluated with respect to this goal by that time if not immediately are nclbs ayp provisions being undermined by wide variations in state standards for pupil achievement and should there be more explicit role for national standards through naep assessments or otherwise in nclb outcome accountability process t h percentage of public school s and leas failing to meet ayp standards varies widely among the states while the basic structure of ayp definitions is now substan tially more consistent across states than before enactment of nclb significant variations remain with respect to technical factors such as minimum group size and confidence intervals and substantial differences in the degree of challenge embodied in state sta ndards and assess ments remain curriculum content and pupil performance standards are determined at the discretion of the states an implicit purpose of the state naep participation requi rement is to confirm trends in pupil achievement as measured by stateselected assessments by comparing them with trends in naep results on the basis of nationally consistent content and performance standards nevertheless the conn ection between naep results and state test score trends is currently am biguous and indirect and nclb prohibits the use of naep assessmen ts by agents of the federal government to influence state or lea instructional programs or assessments some have called for more explicit role for national standards either as embodied in naep or in some other fashion in nclb outcome accountability proce ss to more directly address national concerns about educational quality and establish greaterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs31 46 for example see to dream the impossible dream four approaches to national

accountability policies across the nation46 others believe that in our federa l government system where state and local governments pay large ma jority of educational costs and have more explicit constitutional authority to set educational standards such basic matters of education policy should continue to be left to state discretion other possible reauthorizat ion issues regarding ayp two other potential ayprelated reauthorization issues do not fall into either of the general categories above have eds reviews of state ayp policies been appropriately rigorous transparent flexible and consistent as ed staff and designated peer reviewers have examined initial and revised state ayp policies several obs ervers have expresse d concerns about lack of transparency in the review procedures and criteria inconsistencies especially over time in the types of changes that ed officials have approved whethe r the net effect of the changes is to make the accountab ility requirements more reasonable or to undesirably weaken them whether the changes may make an already complicated accountability system ev more complex and whether decisions on proposed changes are being made in timely manner by ed should results from required scie nce assessments be included in ayp determinations when these assessments are implemented as noted above states participatin g in title ia are required to administer assessments in science at three grade levels by the end of the 2007 2008 school year current statutory provisions are ambiguous and somewhat contradict ory regarding whether results of these science assessments must be incorporated into ayp determinations when the assessm ents are implemented although current regulations and policy guidance from ed indicate that incorporation of science assessment results will not be required at the least it would be helpful for reauthorization legislation to clarify congressional intent on this questionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs32 47 for more information on this topic see section 4 outcome accountability under esea title ia by david p smole of crs report rl33371 k12 education

unitary accountability systems affecting all public schools the title ia statute requires them only to take corrective actions regarding schools and leas that receive title ia f unds not all schools

p smole 55 limited number of states and leas have been allowed by ed to reverse the order for introducing public school choice and supplemental services that is to offer supplemental services after two years of failing to meet ayp standards and school choice after three years 56 more specifically leas are to use an amount qual to 5 of their title ia grant unless less is needed for public school choice transpor tation costs 5 unless less is needed for supplemental services and up to an additional 10 for either to the extent needed these funds may be taken from the leas title ia gr ant or from other federal state or local sources under program regulations costs of administering school choice and supplemental services programs are not to be count ed in the application of these amountsschools that have not been designated as needing improvement or as being unsafe52 public school choice must be offered to such pupils by the next school year unless prohibited by state law leas are ge nerally required only to offer public school choice options within the same lea how ever if all public schools in the lea to which child might transfer have been identified as needing improvement then leas shall to the extent practicable establish cooperative agreements with other leas to offer expanded public school choice options53 transportation must be provided to pupils utilizing public school choice options children who transfer to other public schools under this authority are to be allowed to remain in the school to which they transfer until they complete the highest grade in that school however the lea is longer required to provide transportation services if the origina ting school meets ayp standards for two consecutive years if title ia school fails to meet ayp standards for third year pupils from lowincome families in the school must be offered the opportunity to receive instruction from supplemental rvices provider of their choice54 in addition to continuing to be offered public school choice options55 states are to identify and provide lists of approved pr oviders of such supplementa l instructional services which might include public or private sc hools leas

alternative governance actions reopening as charter school replacing all or most school staff st ate takeover of school operations if permitted under state law or other major restructuring of school governance in september 2005 the education commission of the states ecs published report on actions taken in the 13 states where one or more schools reached the final stage of school improvement year five in 2004200558 in general the authors of the ecs study concluded that 1 seas vary widely in their involvement in the restructuring process 2 in most cases the restructuring options app lied to affected schools have been relatively mild to moderate eg changing curriculum implementing school reform strategy or altering the schools management stru cture rather than strong eg reconstituting or closing the school or converting it to charter school and 3 political difficulties have arisen in cases where stronger forms of restructuring have been applied in veral states some restruct uring options could not be implemented because they are not authoriz ed under state law eg charter schools according to the report national assessment of title i final report published by ed in 2007 pproximately 1 of pupils eligible for public school choice and 19 of those eligible for supplemental services in the 20042005 school year actually participated in these activities it is unclear

implementation issues regulations published in october 2008 regarding title ia assessments and accountability several new final regulations affecting the title ia assessment ayp and accountability policies were pub lished in the federal register on october 29 2008 pages 6443564513 the most substantial proposed regulations deal with high school graduation rates as used in ay p determinations and school choice and supplemental educational services for pup ils in schools identif ied for improvement many of the new regulations clarify previ ous regulations or codify as regulations policies that had been established through less formal mechanisms such as policy guidance or peer reviewer guidance the october 2008 regulations are briefly described below graduation rates numerous changes have been made to previous policies regarding graduation rates used as the additional indicator in ayp determinations for high schools previously states were allowed substantial degree of flexibility in their method for calculating graduation ra tes and were not requi red to disaggregate the rates by pupil group except for reportin g purposes also although states were required to determine leve l of or rate of improveme nt in graduation rates that would be adequate for ayp purposes they were not required to set an ultimate goal toward which these rate s should be progressing under the october 2008 regulations stat must adopt uniform method for calculating graduation rates this method must be used for school lea and state report cards showing results of asse ssments administered during the 20102011 school year and for purposes of deter mining ayp on the basis of assessments administered during the 20112012 school year states unable to meet these deadlines may request an extension this thod has been endorsed by the national governors association the graduation rate is defined as the number of students who graduate from high school in four years61 divided by the number of students in the cohort for the students class adju sted for student transfers among schools states may also propose us ing supplementary extende dyear graduation rate in addition to the fouryear rate in order to accommodate selected groups of students such as certain students with disabilities who may need more than four years to graduate these gradua tion rates must be disaggregated by subgrouphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs41 states must set an ultimate goal for graduation rates that they expect all high schools to meet federal standard is established but the state goal as well as annual targets toward meeting that goal mu st be approved by ed as part of the states accountability policy choice and supplemental educational services the october 2008 regulations make numerous changes to pr evious policy regarding school choice and supplemental educational services ses for pupils in schools identified for improvement corrective action or restructuring all of these changes are intended to increase the relatively low rate of pupil participation in these options leas are required to notify parents of their childs eligibility for school choice at least 14 days before the beginning of the school year notices of eligibility for ses must be clearly distinguishable from other informa tion sent to parents and must highlight the benefits of ses also large number of specific outreach and reporting activities must be undertaken by seas and as with respect to choice and ses and up to 02 of lea title ia grants could be used for parental outreach activities required monitoring by seas of the services of ses providers and their effectiveness must be substantially expa nded and number of factors that must be considered by seas in determining whether to initially approve and renew ses provider contracts are specified in addition the nclb requires as to spend an amount equal to up to 20 of their title ia grants for school choi ce and ses if necessary depending on the number of pupils eligible for and participating in these options if less than the full 20 is required remaining f unds may be reallocated to other title ia purposes under the october 2008 regulations before an lea reallocates any of the 20 of its annual title ia grant to other title i purposes it must undertake series of outreach activities intended to increase pa rticipation in these options these activities include working with communitybased organizations to the extent practicable to provide info rmation on ses options to pa rents and students allowing eligible students to register for ses during at least two enrollment periods each school year disseminating information on pproved ses providers that identifies those able to serve students with disabilities and lep students and providing equitable access to school fac ilities for ses providers leas must also inform their sea of any funds from the 20 reservation that are reallocated to other title ia purposes and

time it is emphasized that states and leas may not limit identification to schools failin g to make ayp for two consecutive years or more in the same subject and pupil group regulations regarding school restruct uring the final stage of the school improvement process are an effort to address evidence that existing restructuring actions have been inadequate in many cas by somewhat sharpening the language in regulations to increase the possibility that restructuring actions will be substantialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs42 under the regulations actions taken under restructuring must be significantly more rigorous and comprehensive than those taken under corrective action unless the school adopts one of the restructuring opti ons as corrective action although sea and lea flexibility might be reduced to degree the modified language is broad and ultimately subject to interpretation by leas and seas in particular it is noted that although restructuring may include replacem ent of the schools principal it may not be limited to this action ie it must be more comprehensive group sizerelated provisi ons in state ayp policies states must provide more extensive rationale than previously required for their selection of minimum group sizes use of confidence inte rvals and related aspects of their ayp policies although specific limits are placed on these parameters states must explain in their accountability workbooks how their policies pr ovide statistically reliable information while minimizing the exclusion of designated pupil groups in ayp determinations especially at the school level states must also report on the number of pupils in designated groups that are excluded from sepa rate consideration in ayp determinations due to minimum group size policies in addition the regulations codify provisions for the nati onal technical advisory council that was established in august 2008 to advise the s ecretary on variety of technical aspects of state standards assessments ayp nd accountability policies each state is required to submit its accountability workbook modified in accordance with the proposed regulations to ed for new round of technical assistan ce and peer review workbooks must be submitted in time to implement any needed changes before making ayp determinations on the basis of assessment results for the 20092010

inclusion of variety of indicators other than standardsba sed assessments in reading mathematics and science also states are required to include results from the most recent national assessment of

has been relatively little guidance from ed or clarity in the statute on state versus lea roles in the ar ea of paraprofessi onal qualification requirements has the result been constructive form of flexibility or dysfunctional ambiguity services to private school pupils staff and parents since the original enactment of the esea in 1965 states and leas participating in title ia have been required to provide for the equitable participation of eligible pupils who attend private schools the share of an leas title ia grant that is used to serve private school pupils is to be equal to the proportion of pupils from low income families living in title ia public school attendan ce areas who attend private schools both before and af ter enactment of nclb the percentage of pupils served under title ia who attend private school s has been significantly below the percentage of all k12 pupils who are enrolle d in private schools according to the latest available data fo r the 20022003 school year only 11 of all pupils served under title ia attend private schools wh ile approximately 116 of all k12 pupils attended private schools in fall 2005 potential explanations for the low rate of private school pupil participati on range from program structure70 to possibly lower rates of economic and edu cational disadvantage among private school pupils to possible reluctance of public sc hool officials to use title ia funds to serve private school pupils or reluctance of some private school officials to get involved in federal education programs nclb made number of relatively modest changes to the title ia provisions for services to pupils attending private school s first it provided that such services should be provided not only to eligible pup ils but also to their families and school staff as well consistent with the general title ia provisions for parental involvement and professi onal development activities second it required that services be provided to private school pupils in timely manner third requirements for consultation between pub lic and private school officials were expanded to include such topics as the da ta to be used to determine the share of pupils from lowincome familie s who attend private school s see next paragraphhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs47 71 for example assume that data are available on the number of public school pupils in an lea who receive free school lunches and medica id but are only available for private school pupils who receive medicaid that the lea uses the number of pupils who receive free school lunches to allocate title ia funds among eligible schools and that the ratio among public school pupils in the lea of free school l unch recipients to medicaid recipients is 2 to 1 the lea could then multiply the numbe r of relevant private school pupils receiving medicaid by two to obtain an equivalent estim ate of the number of such pupils who would be eligible to receive free school lunchesand who would provide the services including consideration of the possibility of providing services via thirdparty contractor title ia includes specific provisions re garding authorized methods for leas to determine the share of pupils from wincome families who live in title ia public school attendance area and who attend private schools this is the basis for determining the share of title ia grants th at is to be devoted to serving eligible private school pupils leas may 1 us the same measure of low income and source of data as used to count such children attending public schools 2 conduct survey which may be based on repres entative sample of pupils using the same measure of low income as used to count children attending public schools 3 apply the percentage of children from lowin come families determin ed for public school pupils to private school pupils residing in the same school attendance area or 4 use different measure of low income than used for counting children attending public schools adjusting these data by an appropr iate proportion so that the measures may be equated71 these provisions are similar to those of policy guidance disseminated by ed under the previous authorizing statute the iasa of 1994 possible reauthorization issues re garding title ia private school participation requirements possible reauthorization issues regarding the title ia requirements for equitable participati on by private school pupils and staff include the following how shoul d private school pupils be served under title ia the targeted assistance mode of servin g private school pupils is used in steadily declining share of public school programs it may be questioned whether other modes of serving eligible private school pupils such as the supplementary educational services model might be more consistent w ith trends in title i public school programs might alternative modes of serv ing private school pupils increase participation by reducing administrative burdens is the share of participating pup ils who attend private schools too low as noted above the proportion of pupils served by title ia who attend private school s has always been low this may simply reflect relatively low rates of eligibility namely low rates of economic or educationa l disadvantage or it might be result of barriers to fully equitable par ticipation should ed pay greater attention to enforcement of th private school participation requirements in its oversight and monitoring activitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs48 72 if all of an leas schools participate in title ia then services funded from state and local revenues must be substantially comparable in each school of the lea 73 see for example strengthening title i to help highpoverty schools by marguerite roza et published on august

the programs focus has shifte d to outcome accountability in recent decades title ia has always included ries of fiscal acc ountability requirements these are intended to provide that title ia grants represent net increase in the level of financial re sources available to serve educationally disadvantaged pupils and that they do not ultimately replace funds th at states or leas would provide in the absence of federal aid there are three title ia fiscal accountabi lity requirement s the first two of these are common to federal assistance programs while the third is unique to title ia to meet the first requirement maintenance of effort recipient leas must provide from state and local sources vel of funding either aggr egate or per pupil in the preceding year that is at least 90 as high as in the second preceding year second fiscal accountability requirement provides that title ia funds must be used so as to supplement and not supplant state and local funds that would otherwise be available for the education of disadvantaged pupils in title ia par ticipating schools the third distinctive fiscal requirement under title ia is comparability services provided with state and local funds in schools participa ting in title ia must be comparable to those in nont itle ia schools of the same lea72 an lea may meet the requirement by providing written assurance that it has implemented an leawide staff salary sche dule and policies to assure equivalence among schools in teachers and other staff plus curriculum ma terials and supplies in calculating staff salaries differentials associated with seniority years of employment need not be considered unpredictable changes in rollment or personnel assignments may be excluded and expenditures for programs for lep pupils or pupils with disabilities or state programs similar to title i need not be taken into account concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of the current title ia comparability requirement and whether many leas are in effect using title ia funds to subsidize their general operations in addition to increasing the level of services and resources availa ble to disadvantaged pupils73 specific argument begins with the nearuniversal practice of allowing the most experienced and qualified teachers to choose the schools in which they will teach and tendency for such teachers to prefer teaching in school s with comparatively low percentages of pupils from lowincome families this is combined with the exclusion of seniority based staff salary differentials in the current comparability requirement as well as in the budgeting systems for state and local funds in many leas and the fact that leas generally comply with th is requirement without co mpiling or repor ting detailed schoollevel financial data ie they typically provide assurances of policies as described above the resu lt is that the major portion of state and local fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs49 74 if for example teachers with lowerthanavera ge seniority and salaries tend to be assigned to title ia schools especially those with the highest concentrations of pupils from low income families but the lea accounts for those teachers using leawide salary averages then surplus difference between the act ual and lea average teacher salaries would arise that might implicitly subsidize the leas general budget rather than be targeted on schools eligible to be served under title iarepresented by teacher salaries are often not distributed equitably among high versus low poverty schools even the title ia funds may often be distributed in way that favors participating schools with relatively lower pe rcentages of pupils in low income families if the lea follows the frequent practice of using lea average rather than actual teacher salaries to account for their use of title ia funds74 an underlying difficulty is the lack of comprehensive schoollevel budgeting and accounting systems in much of the nation until such systems are common it will remain difficult to assure that the title ia comparability requirement can be meaningfully implemented possible reauthorizat ion issues regarding fiscal accountability possible reauthorization issues regarding fiscal accountability particularly the title ia comparability requirement include the following should leas longer be allowed to meet the comparability requirement by simply providing assurances of equitable policies but rather be required to co mpile and report schoollevel budgeting data and meet quantitative equity standard this would be comprehensive and direct approach to assuring comparability it might be combined with the pr ovision of financial support for development of schoolbased budget systems in the many states and leas that currently lack them at the same time it would substantially expand administrative burdens for many leas and states more modest approach would be to require the collection and reporting of schoollevel fina ncial data only with respect to teacher salaries the largest and potentially most varied expenditures by leas should the current exclusion of seni oritybased sala ry differentials be deleted this would eliminate major source of variation in school level f unding with in leas at the same time it might be seen as conflicting with common lea personnel practices and with teacher union contracts in many leas should the practice of using lea averages in acc ounting for the salaries of teachers paid with title ia funds be prohibited while this would conflict with current pr actices in many leas it

however once th funds reach leas they are longer treated separately they are combined nd used without distinction for the same program purposes primary ra tionale for using four diffe rent formulas to allocate share of the funds for single program is that the formulas have distinct allocation patterns providing varying sh ares of allocated funds to different types of localities in addition some of the formulas contain ements that are deemed to have important incentive effects or to be significant symbolically such as the equity and effort factors in the efig formula in addition to their impact on allocation patterns there is also historical explanation the targeted and efig formulas in particular were initially proposed as replacements fo r the basic plus concentration grant formulas that is each of the targeted and efig formulas was originally intended to be the title ia formula but in subsequent deliberations these formulas were ultimately established to supplement but not replace the basic and concentration grant formulas and to complement each other the discussion below describes the characteristics of the title ia allocation formulas as these have been amende d by nclb these

the census bureaus small area income and population estimates saipe which provides estimates of poor nd total children aged 517 for leas counties and states these estimates are updated every year as of this writing the latest saipe data are for income year 2003 these estimates were initially published in november 2005 were revised in october 2006 and were used to calculate fy2006 title ia allocations 76 given its extremely small size this factor is ssentially of symbolic significance it is the remainder of longterm policy of including in the title ia formulas the estimated number of schoolage children from poor families pl us the number of children in families with income above the poverty level due to receipt of welfare payments initially payments under aid to families with dependent children or afdc and more recently tanf currently there are very few families with in come from tanf above the poverty level for family of four based on fy2007 program data tanf children

grants subject to state minimu m lea hold harmless and other provisions 78 before enactment of nclb for puerto rico only the minimum expenditure factor for each of the four allocation formulas was furt her multiplied by the ratio of the puerto rico average expenditure per pupil divided by the west average for any state for fy2001 the continuedgeneral characteristics of the title ia allocation formulas there are several common elements of the four title ia allocation formulas described below 1 each of them has population factor which is the same in each of the four formulas this factor comp rises children aged 517 in poor families according to the test available data from the census bureau that are satisfactor to the secretary of edu cation and based on the census bureaus standard poverty income thres holds these constitu approximately 96 of all formula children for fy200775 b in certain institutions for neglected or delinquent children and youth or in certain foster homes these constitute approximate ly 39 of all formula children for fy2007 and c in families receiving tempor ary assistance for needy fam ilies tanf payments above the poverty in come level for family of four these constitute less than 01 of all formula children for fy200776 2 under each of these formulas this population factor is multiplied by an expenditure factor which is based on state aver age expenditures per pupil aepp for public k12 education subject to minimum and maximum levels77 special expenditure factor provisions have been app lied in calculating grants to puerto rico but these are scheduled to fully expire as early as fy200878 due to the expenditurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs54 78 continued last prenclb year this ratio was approxi mately 750 as result the fy2001 grant to puerto rico was approximately onethird less than the amount it would have received if it were treated fully in the same manner as the 50 states and the district of columbia nclb placed floor on this ratio which rises in steps from 775 for fy2002 to 1000 that is the same minimum expenditure factor as fo r state for fy2007 and beyond the scheduled increases in the puerto rico expenditure factor are not to be implemented if doing so would result in decrease in the grant to any stat through fy2006 the scheduled increases took place each year although the scheduled increase for fy2006 took effect only after revised poverty estimates were incorporated in the grant calculations in october 2006 however the final step in this process was not impl emented in fy2007 it is not yet known whether it will be implemented in fy2008 or later 79 the holdharmless rate under each formula is now 8595 of the previous year grant depending on the leas schoolage child poverty rate children counted for title ia grants as percentage of total schoolage population if the lea poverty rate is 30 or above the holdharmless rate is 95 if the poverty rate is 1530 the holdharmless rate is 90 and if the poverty rate is less than 15 the holdharmless rate is 85 with partial exception for certain leas under the concentration grant formula holdharmless rates are applicable only to leas meeting the eligibility thresholds for each formula for fy2006 under pl 109148 special hold harmless rate of 100 was applied to leas affected by the 2005 gulf coast hurricanes 80 more specifically the minimum is up to 025 for basic and concentration grants at funding levels up to the fy2001 appropriation fo r those formulas and up to 035 for basic and concentration grants above the fy2001 level plus all funds allocated under the targeted and efig formulas in addition these state minimums are capped in all cases under the basic targeted and efig formulas state may not as result of the state minimum provision receive more than the average of 1 025 of the total fy2001 amount for state grants plus 035 of the am ount above this and 2 150 of the national average grant per formula child multiplied by the number of formula children in the state under the concentration grant formula stat may not as result of the state minimum provision receive more than the average of 1 025 of the total fy2001 amount for state grants plus 035 of the amount above this and 2 the greater of i 150 of the national continuedfactor leas in highspending states receive up to 50 more per child counted in the title ia formulas than leas in lowspending states the rationale for this factor is that it reflects differences in the cost of providing public edu cation and provides an incentive to increase state and local spending however it is spending index that reflects ability and willingness to spe nd on public education as well as cost differences it is not precisely targeted affecting all leas in state equally and the incentive it provides to increase state and local spending for public education is relatively small 3 each of the formulas has hold harmless provision minimum annual grant level for leas that is calculated as per centage of the previous years grant under each formula79 4 the four title ia formulas include state minimum grant level as well in general state is to receive less than approximately 025 of allocated funds up to the fy2001 appropriation vel and approximately 035 of funds above that level80httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs55 80 continued average grant per formula child multiplied by the number of formula children in the state or ii 340000 81 throughout this report this term refers to the number of poor and other children counted in the title ia allocation formulas expressed as percentage of the total schoolage population for the lea 82 for concentration grants only an lea conti nues to be eligible fo r steadily declining hold harmless amount for up to four years afte r it longer meets the formulas eligibility criteria 83 this cap was intended to provide that the sh are of targeted grants allocated to puerto rico would be approximately equal to its shar of grants under the basic and concentration grant formulas for fy2001 this cap reduces grants below the level that would obtain if there were cap at all ie if puerto rico were treated in the same manner as the 50 states continued5 finally each formula has minimum eligibility threshold for leas which is minimum number of poor and other formul children or minimum schoolage child poverty rate81 in order to be eligible for grants even holdharmless amounts in most cases the lea minimum eligibility threshold varies by formula it is 10 formula children and schoolage child poverty rate of 2 for basic grants or 5 schoolage child poverty rate for the targeted and efig formulas for concentration grants the lea eligibility threshold is 6500 formula children or 15 schoolage child poverty rate with the partia l exception of concentration grants82 if an lea does not meet the eligibility threshold the holdharmless provision does not apply as result number of leas have experienced complete elimination of their grants under some of these formulas from one year to the next as their schoolage child poverty rate declines from marginally above to marginally below 50 in addition to these common elements two of the title ia formulas have the following unique features 1 for the targeted gran t formula as well as the intrastate allocation of funds under the efig formula the poor and other children counted in the formula are assigned weights on the basis of each leas schoolage child poverty rate and number of poor schoolage children as result an lea would receive higher grants per child counted in the formula the higher its poverty rate or number under the ta rgeted grant formula the weighting factors are applied in th same manner nationwide poor and other formula children in leas with the highest poverty rates have weight of up to four and those in leas with the high est numbers of such children have weight of up to three compared to weight of one for formula children in leas with the lowest poverty rate and number of such children in contrast under the efig formula the degree of targeting in terms of the ratio of the highest to the lowest we ight varies depending on the value of each states equity factor described below under both formulas the higher of its two weighted child counts on the basis of numbers and percentages is used in calculating gr ants for each lea for puerto rico only cap of 182 is placed on the net aggregate weight applied to the population factor under the targeted grant formula83httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs56 83 continued and the district of columbia since puerto ricos high number and percentage of poor schoolage children would translate into si gnificantly higher weighting factor if not capped 84 in the cv calculations for this formula an extra weight 14 vs 10 is applied to estimated counts of children from poor families limited purpose leas such as those providing only vocational education are exclude d from the calculations as are small leas with enrollment below 200 pupils there are sp ecial provisions for states meeting the expenditure disparity standard established in regulations for the impact aid program esea title viii as well as the singlelea areas of hawaii puerto rico and the district of columbia2 the efig formula has two unique factors an equity factor and an effort factor in addition to the popula tion and expenditure factors the equity factor is based upon measure of the average disparity in expenditures per pupil among the leas of state called the coefficient of variation cv which is expressed as percentage of the state average expenditure per pupil84 in calculating grants the equity factor is subtracted from 130 as result the lower states expenditure disparities among its leas the lower is its cv and equity factor and the higher is its multiplier conversely the greater states expenditure disparities among its leas the higher is its cv and equity factor and the lower is its multiplier the effort factor is based on compar ison of state expenditures per pupil for public elementary and secondary educati on with state personal income per capita this ratio for each state is further compared to the national average ratio resulting in an index number that is greater than 10 for states where the ratio of expenditures per pupil for public elementary and secondary education to personal income per capita is greater than average for the nation as whole and below 10 for states where the ratio is less than average for the nation as whole narrow bounds of 095 and 105 are placed on the resulting mu ltiplier so that its effect on state grants is limited under the basic concentration and ta rgeted grant formulas maximum grants are calculated by multiplying the population f actor by the expenditure factor for all leas meeting the minimum eligibility thresholds under all four formulas maximum amounts are reduced proportionally to the aggregate level of available funds subject to lea holdharmless and state minimum grant provisions the efig formula differs from the others both in terms of its use of unique formula factors and in being twostage formula first state total grants are calculated by multiplying the state total popul ation factor by the expenditure factor by 13 minus the equity factor and by the ffort factor then these state total grants are allocated to leas on the basis of variation of the targeted grant formula with the degree of targeting the ratio of the weight applied to formula children in the highest poverty ranges compared to the weig ht for such children in the lowest poverty ranges varying in three stages the stage or degree of targeting used for substate allocation varies depending on each states equ ity factor the higher the equity factorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs57 85 according to program data for fy2008 approximately 80 of the leas receiving title ia grants have an estimated total number of schoolage children of fewer than 100 86 for the lealevel analyses in this report poverty rates are based on estimated school age children in poor families divided by total schoolage population 87 it should be noted that this analysis is based on lea grants as calculated by the us department of education it does not take into consideration the adjustments that seas may make to these grants reservations for state administration and program improvement reallocation of funds among small leas in lected states and adjustments for charter schools and lea boundary changes in the aggr egate the impact of this limitation should be quite smalland therefore the greater the disparities in expenditures per pupil among states leas the greater will be the degree of targeting on highpoverty leas in the intrastate allocati on of efig funds targeting on highpoverty leas under the four title ia formulas for the last several years primary issue regarding the title ia allocation formulas has been the extent to which funds are targeted on highpoverty leas over 90 of the nations leas receive gr ants under esea title ia largely because the eligibility thresholds for three of the f our allocation formulas as described above are relatively low in general all leas receive title ia grants except those that have extraordinarily low schoolage povert rates or have extremely few pupils85 few leas including certain charter schools that are treated as separate leas under state law are eligible for relatively sm all title ia grants but do not choose to participate in the program at least in part because the responsibilities accompanying participation are perceived to exceed the value of the prospective grants table 3 below presents the distribution of title ia grants among leas grouped by poverty rate quintile86 each quintile contains leas with onefifth of the nations total estimated numbe r of schoolage children in poor families on the basis of the census bureau population estimates used in calculating fy2008 grants those for income year 2005 table 3 lists the percentage share of the national total of title ia grants that are allocated to as in each poverty quintile these data are provided separately for each of the four t itle ia allocation formulas as well as for total grants for fy200887 as illustrated in table 3 and figure 1 below the share of title ia funds allocated to leas in various poverty rate ranges varies significantly among the four allocation formulas for basic grants the share is similar for each quintile of leas varying only within the narrow range of 192211 for concentration grants the share of funds allocated to leas in each poverty rate range is again similar with the exception of the lowest poverty quin tile which r eceives much lower share 40 of total grants vs 231252 for the other four quintiles this reflects the eligibility threshold for concentration grants formula child rate of at least 15 or 6500 formula children overall the primary pattern for both basic and concentration grants is rela tively constant shares of f unds for all quintiles of leashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs58 88 with the exception of puerto rico leas with the largest numbers of schoolage children in poor families tend to have high but not among the highest schoolage child poverty rates 89 leas with the highest schoolage child poverty rates are frequently cated in states with relatively low expenditure factors 90 as mentioned in previous footnote cap is placed on the aggregate formula child weighting factor for puerto rico reducing th share of targeted grant funds allocated to this lea with very high poverty rate the highest poverty quintilemeeting minimum eligibility thresholds in other words grants per poor and other child counted in the title ia allocation fo rmulas are approximately the same for all leas meeting the initial eligibility criteria for basic and concentration grants whether those leas have high average or somewhat below average schoolage child poverty rates the pattern of distribution of grants under the targeted and efig formulas is somewhat different under each of these fo rmulas the share of total grants increases steadily from the lowest to the second highest poverty rate quintile then is approximately constant for the 4th and 5th quintiles while this partly reflects the slightly higher eligibility threshold for these formulas in comparison to basic grants 5 vs 2 formula child rate it primarily results from the structure of these formulas under both the targeted and ef ig withinstate formulas the grant per formula child continuously increases as either the leas sc hoolage ch ild poverty rate or its total number of children counted in the title ia formulas increases the share of funds going to leas in the 5th quintile highest pove rty rates under each of these formulas is not substantially higher than the share going to leas with the second highest poverty rates 4th quintile primarily because of the strong influence of high numbers of formula ch ildren on the allocation of funds88 the influence of the expenditure factor89 and the cap placed on target ed grant formula population weights for

level for title ia whether or not specific amounts have been specified in the au thorizing statute for any year many program advocates have argued that the full funding concept for title ia has always been based on maximum payment calculations under the basic grant allocation formula only as was described above the part basic grant formula establishes maximum payment on the basis of poor and other

d occur are not yet available possible reauthorization issues regarding title ia allocation formulas possible reauthorization issues regarding the title ia allocation formulas include the following should there be some consolidation of the four different allocation formulas although there are differences among the four title ia allocation formulas and each of them has somewhat distinctive distributional pattern it may be questioned whether each formula serves sufficiently distinct role and purpose as to justify its continued use in particular shoul d there be three different formulas that attempt to target greater funds on highpoverty leas should basic grants with their lack of targeting on high poverty areas be continued are the distinctive f eatures of the efig formula likely to provide sufficient incentive or reward effects to influence state policy on k12 education spending should targeted and efig grants be combined into single formula for example by application of the effort and equity factors to the targeted grant formula now that formula popul ation estimates are updated annually should there be some effort in addition to current hold harmless provisions to mitigate the impact of annual population shifts on grants especially for leas that are near eligibility thresholds in recent years as funds have been increasingly allocated through the targeted and efig formulas some leas have experienced dramatic shifts in funding from one year to the next as their schoolage child poverty rate varies by small am ounts around the eligibility threshold of 50 large swings in funding make it exceptionally difficult to use title ia funds efficiently the fouryear phaseout of hold harmless provisions now applied only to concentration grants might be extended to targeted and efig grants more broadly the stability of grant levels as well as the reliability of lea populationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs64 92 the income thresholds used to determine whether family is poor vary by family size but not by state or locality 93 currently this factor is based on the average expenditure per pupil in the state divided by personal income per capita in the state relativ to national averages this formulation tends to favor states where the school age population is comparatively small alternatively the effort factor could be based on total expenditures for public k12 education divided by total personal income in the state relative to national averages this would favor states with relatively high levels of aggregate k12 education spending resulting from high levels of expenditures per pupil relatively large schoolage populations or both 94 see for example the measurement of equity in school finance conceptual methodological and empi rical dimensions by robert berne and leanna stiefel johns hopkins university press 1984estimates could be increased by averaging formula population data for the most recent 23 years rather than simply using the latest data as is done currently should the expenditure factors continue to play major role in the title ia formulas the state expenditure factors while little noticed have major impact on the distribution of title ia grants as discussed above they are the same statewide with consideration of local variations they likely provide little incentive to increase state spending on k12 education and they reflect differences in ability to raise revenues at least as much as differences in costs perhaps the best argument for continuing them is that they partially roughly and indirectly compensate for the lack of geographical cost adjustment for the poverty population factor income thresholds92 should the effort factor in the efig formula be modified as noted above the efig formulas effort f actor is constrained within the very narrow bounds of 095 105 as re sult it serves largely symbolic purpose the bounds applied to this formula might be expanded consideration might also be given to the calculation of this factor on the basis of aggregate k12 education expenditures and personal income in each state rather than individual figures93 should the equity fact or in the efig formula be modified the measure of school finance equity us ed in the efig formula is one of several commonlyused measures of variation among leas in state94 although there is degree of consistency in the ratings of states on different equity measures several states will appear to be more equalized on the basis of so measures than others the 110th congress might consider not onl alternative equity measures but also technical changes such as the addition of special weights for lep pupils or pupils with disabilities in addition to the current added weight for children in poor families finally consideration might be given to combining or otherwise simplifying the three different degrees of population we ighting used for the intrastate allocation of efig formula fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33731crs65 should the population weighting factors of the targeted and efig formulas be modified to provide mo re funds to smalltomedium size leas with very high schoolage child poverty rates currently in spite of superficial appearan ce to the contrary ie higher maximum weights on the poverty rate s than numbers the weighting schemes used in these formulas tend to favor the nations largest in formula population leas the weig hting scales might be adjusted to increase grants to smaller leas with very high schoolage child poverty rates should the prohibition against reducing lea grants compared to the previous year in order to apply the 4 reservation of funds for program improvement be eliminated this would allow seas to reserve the full 4 and avoid re serving more than 4 from some leas in order to reach the 4 leve l statewide at the same time it would reduce grants for many leas to level below what they would otherwise receive should the last remaining special constraint on grants to puerto rico the cap on aggregate population weights in the targeted grant formula be removed as with the phaseout scheduled to be completed in fy2007 of the expe nditure factor limitation fo r puerto rico consideration might be given to eliminating the cap on targeted grant formula child weights however if aggregate title ia funding levels continue to be constrained this would likely reduce grants remaining for the 50 states plus the district of columbia should the tanf formula factor be eliminated as noted earlier the tanf population factor is now extremely small less than 01 of all formula children its significance is essentially historic and symbolic if it were eliminated the impact on grant levels would be very limited overall should the authorization level for title ia continue to be specified after fy2008 and if so at what l evels in nclb title ia appropriations authoriz ation levels were specified for each of fy2002fy2007 under the automatic extension provisions of the general education provisions act the fy2007 authorization applies to fy2008 as well the fy2007 amount was set at level approximately equal to the level of maximum basic grants traditional concept of full fundi ng for title ia as of fy2001 the year preceding enactment of nclb in practice over the fy2002fy2007 period the appropria tion for title ia has been below the authorized amount each year with the gap between authorization and ppropriation increasing each year for fy2008 the appropriation is 57 of the authorized amount thus the impact of specifying authorization amounts for each year may be questioned at the same time specified authorizations do provide goal for those seeking increased funding and express the judgement of those involved in the

implementation of certain title ia requirements to the provision of authorized or some other specified levels of appropriations or even to appr opriate the authorized amounts in reauthorization
