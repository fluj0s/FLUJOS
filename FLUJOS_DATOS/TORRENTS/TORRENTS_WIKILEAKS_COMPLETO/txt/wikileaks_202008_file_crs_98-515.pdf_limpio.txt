deducted may be combined with other medical expenses and the amount above 75 of adjusted gross income may be claimed as an itemized deduction certain rules govern the use of the deduction first selfemployed individuals are not allowed to deduct their health insurance expenditures in computing their selfemployment taxes second the deduction cannot exceed selfemployed individuals earned income from the trade or business for which the insurance plan was established less the deductions for 50 of the selfemployment tax and contributions to certain pension plans third the deduction cannot be claimed for any month in which selfemployed individual is covered by subsidized health insurance policy provided by current or former employer or spouses employer under provision of the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa pl104191 selfemployed individuals like all other taxpayers may include longterm care insurance premiums in their health insurance expenditures eligible for the deduction however there are indexed annual limits on the amount of premiums that can be deduct ed and the limits depend on the age of the insured individual in 2000 these limits ranged from 210 for those 40 years and under to 2660 for those over 70 the selfemployed along with employees of firms with 50 or fewer employees also have the option of opening medical savings accounts msas instead of buying conventional health insurance this option stems from pilot program established by hipaa and begun in 1997 that is scheduled to last through 2002 and is limited to total of 750000 participants msa resembles an individual retirement account in that it is taxexempt trust or custodial account established to pay unreimbursed medical expenses as part of highdeductible health care plan individual contributions to msas are deductible from gross income up to an annual limit equal to 65 of the deductible set at 1550 to 2350 in 2000 for insurance policie s covering one person and 75 of the deductible set at 3100 to 4650 in 2000 for policies covering two or more persons about 125 million workers were selfemployed in 1998 up from 120 million in 1995 according to the latest estimates by the employee benefit research institute2 of the 1998 selfemployed population 90 million had private health insurance 06 million had public insurance mainly medicaid and 31 million were uninsured about 73 of the selfemployed with private health insurance or 66 million were covered through current or former employer or spouses employer the remaining 24 million self employed with private health insurance purchased it themselves according to the us internal revenue service 32 million claims for the deduction were filed in 1998 and the total amount claimed was 45 billion the

of the potential effects of various fundamental tax reform proposals on employer provided health insurance economists jonathan gruber and james poterba estimated that the after tax price of 100 of

of the tax subsidy for employment related health insurance national tax journal vol 53 4 december 2000 p 880tax treatment of employmentbased health insurance in analyzing the economic effects of the tax deduction for health insurance expenditures by the selfempl oyed useful frame of reference is the tax treatment of employmentbased health insurance the majority of americans under age 65 are covered by group health insurance policies provided by employers or labor unions in 1998 an estimated 1548 million americans or 65 of the nonelderly population were covered by such policies in general employmentbased group health insurance carries substantially lower premiums than comparable individual or nongroup health insurance largely because large employers can pool the health risks among their workers and efficiently process the information required to calculate and collect premiums and submit claims under current law workers who obtain health insurance through their employers as fringe benefit pay federal or state income and federal payroll taxes on their employers contributions for the insurance for employers the contributions are considered deductible business expense like wages and salaries there is limit on the amount of employer contributions per employee that can be excluded from taxation if an employers contribution is less than the full premium then covered empl oyees typically pay for the difference out of their aftertax incomes the exclusion for employmentbased health insurance represents significant and costly subsidy for the purchase of this insurance in effect it reduces the aftertax cost of health insurance to employees by factor equal to their combined marginal income and employment tax rates this means for an employee covered by employmentbased health insurance that the tax exclusion reduces the price of that insurance in afterta x dollars relative to the prices of other goods and services he or she may consume3 as result it gives employees robust incentive to prefer compensation in the form of health insurance rather than wages and salaries wages are subject to income and payroll taxes unlike fringe benefits such as employmentbased health insurance moreover because the tax exclusion is not capped emplo yees have an added incentive to prefer comprehensive health insurance with little or cost sharing with over 60 million workers taking advantage of the tax exclusion it has sizable impact on the federal budget4 the jct estimates that the exclusion lowered federal income tax revenue by 613 billion in fy 2000httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98515crs4 legislative history of the health insurance deduction for the self employed the tax deduction for health insurance expenditures by the selfemployed was first enacted as temporary provision of the tax reform act of 1986 tra pl 99514 it was equal to 25 of health insurance premiums and scheduled to expire at the end of 1989 although the tra specified that congress was to assess the effectiveness of the deduction before it expired such study was completed nonetheless with strong bipartisan support the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989 pl 101239 extended the deduction through september 30 1990 the deduction was further extended by the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 pl 101508 through december 31 1991 the tax extension act of 1991 pl 102227 through june 30 1992 and the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 through december 31 1993 measure renewing the deduction was enacted in 1994 under legislation enacted in april 1995 pl 1047 the deduction was reinstated retroactive ly for 1994 made permanent and increased to 30 of eligible premiums starting in 1995 the 104th congress further modified the deduction by passing the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 pl1041 91 which included gradual rise in the deduction from 30 in 1996 to 80 in 2006 with the urging of small business owners the 105th congress twice liberalized the deduction the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 accelerated the scheduled increase in the deduction and made health insurance expenditures by the selfemployed fully deductible in 2007 and the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act for fy 1999 pl 105277 made health insurance expenditures by the selfemployed fully deductible beginning in 2003 selected economic effects of the tax deduction for the self employed economists tend to evaluate subsidies like the tax deduction for health insurance expenditures by the selfemployed largely on the basis of their effects on economic equity and efficiency in general depending on their design tax subsidies can transfer resources from taxpayers as whole to the intended beneficiaries altering the distribution of income tax subsidies can also increase the expected benefits from engaging in the targeted activities altering the allocation of economic resources equity effects the fairness of the health insurance tax deduction for the self employed can be assessed from two different but complementary perspectives one is the federal tax treatment of health insurance as whole and the other is the deductions impact on different income groups among the selfemployed before the enactment of the deduction in 1986 the federal tax code subsidized the purchase of health insurance through the exclusion for employer contributions for employmentbased health insurance and the deductibility of medical expenses including health insurance premiums beyond certain level of taxable income for individuals who itemized including the selfemployed on the eve of the enactment the tax subsidy perhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98515crs5 5 jonathan gruber and james poterba tax incentives and the decision to purchase health insurance evidence from the selfemployed the quarterly journal of economics vol 109 3 august 1994 pp724725dollar of health insura nce expenditure was much greater for individuals with employer provided health insurance than for selfemployed individuals who purchased their own health insurance and the gap was greatest for individuals in the highest tax brackets thus it can be argued that the deduction for the selfemployed has made the tax treatment of health insurance more equitable by reducing the disparity between the tax subsidy for employmentbased health insurance and that for health insurance bought by the self employed the equity effects of the tax deduction take on different appearance when the frame of analysis shifts to its impact across income groups as the tax subsidy for health insurance expenditures by the selfemploy ed is deduction its value depends on self employed individuals marginal tax rate the higher the rate the larger the subsidy per dollar of health insurance since highincome households are more likely to be covered by health insurance than lowincome ones the deduction is likely to amplify this difference in coverages rates 1994 study by economists jonathan gruber and james poterba supports this view they found that between 198586 and 198889 health insurance coverage rose much more among selfemployed househo lds with over 50000 1985 dollars in income than among selfemployed households with less than 20000 1985 dollars in income5 efficiency effects in essence the tax deduction for health insurance expenditures by the selfemployed affects economic efficiency in two ways one is through its impact on the decision by selfemployed individuals to purchase health insurance the second avenue is through the deductions impact on the amount of health care consumed by individuals who become insured in respo nse to the price effects of the deduction it is unclear from available evidence what the net efficiency effect of the deduction has been nevertheless its magnitude is likely to be small the selfemp loyed with private health insurance accounted for only about 5 of privately insured nonelderly americans in 1998 on the one hand consumers generally are better off when they have the opportunity to protect themselves against the risk of catastrophic financial losses caused by unexpected events like severe illness or injury this principle implies that the presence of market for health insurance enhances economic efficiency yet this market and the related market for health care are subject to certain problems that may elevate the price of heath insurance to the point where too few consumers have it prices might reach such levels partly because share of health insurance premiums is used to pay for some of the cost of providing uncompensated health care to the uninsured putting additional upward pressure on premiums is the presence of adverse selection in the private health insurance market adverse selection arises when individuals with relatively high risks of developing costly health problems who know more about their health status than insurers subscribe to insurance plans composed mostly of lowerrisk individuals once highrisk individuals become insured insurers have choice but to raise premiums on all plan subscribers in the next period to cover higherthanexpected claims as premiums rise more and more lowerrisk individuals leave the plans for less costly oneshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98515crs6 6 ibid p 720or drop out of insurance risk pools altogether and selfinsure over time adverse selection if unchec ked by policy measures such as mandatory community rating could result in too few individuals covered by health insurance in addition because health insurance lowers the price of health care paid by individuals it can encourage the consumption of inefficient amounts of health care further driving up health insurance premiums these market failures imply that the level of health insurance coverage may be less than socially optimal in the absence of government intervention for these reasons it can be argued that the deduction for the selfemployed improves economic efficiency to the extent that it increases health insurance coverage among the selfemployed indeed it appears that the deduction has increased the health insurance coverage rate among the selfemployed by reducing the aftertax cost of this insurance gruber and poterba have estimated that because of the decline in the aftertax price of health insurance induced by the deduction for 25 of health insurance expenditures that took effect in 1987 the coverage rate for the selfemployed went up by 68 between 198586 and 1988896 on the other hand health insurance may reduce economic efficiency through its encouragement of the consumption of inefficient amounts of health care health insurance substantially lowers the outofpocket cost of covered health services to insured individuals and this price reduction increases utilization of health care the magnitude of the increase depends on the price sensitivity of the demand for health care such an outcome is likely to entail efficiency losses because it violates another prere quisite of economic efficiency namely that the marginal benefits of consuming good or service should equal its marginal costs in other words health insurance leads insured individuals to consume additional health care whose actual marginal benefits may be less than its actual marginal costs the deduction for the selfemployed also does not remedy the problem of adverse selection in the health insurance market although it may offset some of the price effects of this problem one significant advantage of employmentbased health insurance is that it reduces the scope for adverse selection by fostering the growth of group health insurance policie s priced on the basis of the average risk of large pool of workers typically with varying health problems and risk preferences under such riskpooling arrangement it is likely that the insurer s assessment of the average risk for the group would come close to the groups actual average risk by contrast the deduction for the selfemployed encourages the purchase of individual or nongroup policies priced on the basis of what information an insurer can obtain about the health status and history of the persons to be covered by them the scope for adverse selection is greatest when the purchase of health insurance is voluntary and health insurance is priced on the basis of narrow rather than wide risk pools
