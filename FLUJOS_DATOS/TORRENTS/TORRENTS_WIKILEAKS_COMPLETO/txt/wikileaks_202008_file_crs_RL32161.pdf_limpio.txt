members of congress have monitored the course of north koreajapan relations because japan plays potentially critical role in addressing the military threat posed by north korea par ticularly its nuclear weapons program 1 most important japan has told north kor ea it is prepared to offer largescale economic aid package on the order of 5 billion 10 billion to compensate for the japanese occupation of the ko rean peninsula from 19101945 during the august 2003 sixparty talks in beijing among north korea the united states south korea china japan and russia the ja panese delegation re portedly reiterated its position that significant aid would be forthcoming if north korea abandoned its nuclear program and c ooperated on the issue of japanese citizens kidnapped by north korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s japan also is important to the north korean situation because it is significant source of north koreas foreign exchange not only is japan north koreas third largest trading partner but the japanese market also is major destination for the north korean governments suspected drugrunning operations and of remittances from korean permanent residents in japan congress also has an interest in japannorth korea relations because japans bilateral issues with north korea influence us policy the united states has long cited pyongyangs harboring of japanese red army terrorists who face charges in japan of hijacking plane in 1970 as reason for north koreas inclusion on the us terrorism list which by law prohibits north korea from receiving many forms of us economic assistance and some trading rights2 at japans urging the united states reportedly also has linked delisting to rth koreas cooperation with japan on the abduction issue finally japan arguably has been the str ongest supporter in east asia of the bush administrations policy of pr essuring north korea to abandon its nuclear program although japan shares the objections of othe r regional states to the use of preemptive military force it is more willing than china south korea and russia to employ coercive diplomatic measures against py ongyang japans position thus is

program multilaterally rather than bilaterally usnorth korea exclusivel as north korea had insisted indeed since the late 1990s the rising perception of the north korean threat has prompted and enabled japanese leaders to broaden substantially the countrys security posture3 the pyongyang declaration the koizumikim summit on september 17 2002 japane prime minister juni chiro koizumi and north korean leader kim jongil held oneday summit in pyongyang that momentarily restarted normalization talks between the two countries which had been stalled since november 2000 koizumi and kim signed short document called the pyongyang declaration kim pledge d conditionally to unilate rally extend his countrys moratorium on missile testing beyond 2003 when it was to expire admitted that north korean agents had kidnapped 13 ja panese in the 1970s and 1980s and issued vague promise to comply with international agreements related to nuclear issues koizumi in turn apologized for japans colonization of the korean peninsula and offered to provide north korea with larg escale economic aid package much as it gave south korea economic assistance wh tokyo and seoul normalized relations in 1965 at the time koizumis trip to pyongyang was significant departure from tokyos increasingly hardline stance toward north korea and had the potential to put japan at odds with the bush administra tions policy for most of the late 1990s japanese policymakers sought to move slowly and deliberately on normalizing relations with north korea due to th launch of longrange taepodong missile over the japanese islands in august 1998 pyongyangs development and deployment of mediumrange nodong missiles capable of reaching japan ne w revelations about the abductions of japanese c itizens by north korean agents and incursions by north korean espionage and drugrunning ships into japanese waters this cautious approach often created tension between tokyo and the clinton administration which along with south koreas kim dae jung pursued policy of engaging north korea in the late 1990s during this time japanese policymakers often appeared torn between desire to avoid becoming isol ated from

normalization talks and parallel security talks stalled due to two developments shortly after the koizumikim summit north koreas october 2002 admission to us officials that it has secret nuclear weapons program based on the process of uranium enrichment nd popular outrage in japan at kim jongils admission that north korea had kidnapped 13 japanese eight of whom the north koreans said had died since their abductions prime minister koizumi has said nor malization talks will not continue unless pyongyang cooperates on the abduction issue and begins dismantling its nuclear program also in october the five known surviving kidnapees traveled to japan for onetotwo week visit but were not permitted to brin g their children some of whom do not know their parents are japanese or s pouses with them the ensuing public outcry that these relatives were being held as hostages led koizumi to refuse to send the five back to north korea and to demand that family members be allowed to come to japan7 one complicating factor is that the hus band of one of the five is an american military deserter living in north korea the five continue to live in japan and reportedly have taken steps such as finding jobs and buying property to reintegrate into japanese society on october 29 2002 japan and the dprk held normalization talks in kuala lumpur malaysia the japa nese delegation re portedly told

abide by all relevant international agreements in order to comprehensively resolve the nuclear issue on the korean peninsula koizumi reportedly had insisted on including this in the declaration after

the 1992 northsouth korean denuclearization d eclaration which prohibits the possession of uranium enrichment facilities the 1992 nuclear safeguards agreement with the international atomic energy agency iaea and the 1994 usdprk agreed framework which committed north korea to freezing its plutonium nuclear program8 since the revelations about north kor eas uranium nuclear program were made

2002 japan voted with the united states south ko rea and the european union to suspend shipments of heavy fuel oil to north ko rea the oil was being provided under the 1994 agreed framework ostensibly

controls on the export of potential dualuse items to north korea and has announced new inte rpretation of domestic foreign exchange laws that would make it easier for tokyo to cut off bilateral trade and shut off the flow of remittances from ethnic koreans to their re latives in north korea specifically japan has moved away from its traditiona l position that sanctions against north korea would require united nations secur ity council approval and is now taking the position that japan could impose sanctions in cooperation with the united states even in the absence of specific united nations approval remittances to north korea are estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars annually10 additionally in june 2003 japan ordere d its customs immigration and coast guard to expand safety inspections and searches for illicit contraband on north korean cargo and passenger ships whic h made more than 1300 calls at japanese ports in 200211 according to the japanese govern ment more than

japan worries that an outbreak of military hostilities could lead north korea to launch long or medium range missiles at japan including us bases the prospect of collapse of the kim jongil regime also worries japanese leaders because of the potential creation of massive outflow of refugees in part fo r these reasons some analysts believe that tokyos policy toward pyongyang might soften if the two sides were able to reach an agreement on the abduction issue so japanese leaders favor the idea of delinking the kidnapping issue fro m the other outstanding issues17 north koreas response to japans toughened policy often has appeared contradictory on the one hand it pe riodically has increased the volume and intensity of its rhetorical attacks ag ainst japan for time it opposed japans inclusion in the second round of sixparty talks that are expected to be held in december 2003 and has insisted that the abduc tion issue not be included in the talks agenda on the other hand diplomats from pyongyang and tokyo reportedly held several secret talks in th summer of 2003 in which they focused on resolving the abduction issue both sets of initiatives are likely aimed at diminishing japans influence over the nuclear talks the kidnapping issue for most japanese the most important issue in dealing with north korea is the status of japanese citizen s kidnapped or thought to ve been kidnapped by north korean agents japanese politicians from all parties and media outlets from across the ideological spectrum have warned the koizumi government not to proceed with normalization

north koreans insisted on referring to as missing persons rather than abductees it was only after north korea indicated via backchannel negotiations that it was willing to make concessions on this issue that koizumi agreed in the summer of 2002 to travel to north korea since the late 1990s japanese leaders ve pressed the united states to support the japanese position on the kidnapping issu goal they achieved in late 2000 when thensecretary of state madeleine albright raised the issue during her visit to pyongyang during prime minister ko izumis visit to crawford in may 2003 president bush pledged to continue pressi ng for resolution of the abduction issue in the multilateral talks position reaffirmed by the state department in november 200318 china and south korea key partic ipants in the sixparty talks are believed to oppose discussion of th issue in the sixparty talks at the koizumikim summit kim admitted th at north koreas security service abducted 13 japanese from japan and europe from 1977 1982 kim apologized to koizumi for the kidnappings which he attri buted to overzealous individuals in north koreas security services and pledged verbally and in the two leaders joint declaration that they would not occur again kim disavowed any prior knowledge of the kidnappings and said the responsible individuals had been punished most of the 13 were teenagers or in their early 20s when they were abducted to north korea some were used in training espionage ag ents in japanese language and customs only five of the thirteen are alive according to the north koreans and during the summit kim pledged that they could return to japan if they wished japanese delegation on subsequent factfinding visit to north korea was told that the remains of all but one of the dead were unavailable if kim jongil had hoped his admission and apology would put the kidnapping matter to rest he was mistaken althoug h majority of ja panese supported the reopening of normaliza tion talks the japanese public was shocked that so many of the kidnappees had died and demands for full accounting quickly arose particularly among relatives of the ki dnapped and conservative groups in the ldp each subsequent revelation has only produced more questions outrage and political pressure to obtain more information from north korea on the abductions which koizumi has described as acts of terrorism19 essentially there are three difficulties to resolving the abduction issue first japan has demanded that north korea allow the nine immediate family members of the thirteen confirmed abduc

reportedly the us government has dec lined to give any assurances to japan20 second there are reports that some of the eight japanese declared to be dead by north korea are still alive these suspicions were heightened when japanese forensic specialists determined that the one set of remains given by north korea were not those of the 43yearold kaoru mats uki as pyongyang claimed third many family members and support groups have raised questions about north korean agents involvement in the cases of nearly 100 other missing japanese who disappeared under mysterious circumstances during the august 2003 sixparty talks in beijing the japanese legation reportedly asked nort h korea to account for ten other individuals allegedly kidnapped by dprk agents meanwhile north koreas staterun korean central news agency has warned japanese against making dispropor tionate furor over the abductions21 in october 2003 pak ryong yon deputy chief of the rth korean foreign ministrys asian bureau said that the kidnapping issue has been settled and that the family members would not be allowed to travel to japan any time soon22 some us observers have expressed surprise over japans apparent willingness to allow the fate of relatively small number of its citizens to interfere with achieving major foreign policy goal tw points are noteworthy in that regard first the kidnappings have become an extremely sensitive political issue in japan years of effort by the relatives of japane actually and allege dly kidnapped by north korea have successfully focused the attention of the media on the circumstances of the cases and have won the support of japanese from across the ideological spectrum second japan is not unique in altering its foreign policy due to concerns about the safety of its citizens held in captivity by foreigners in the 1980s for instance reagan administration officials sold arms to iran to secure the release of american hostages going against both law and the ad ministrations broad policy toward iran in 1996 evan hunziker mentally unstable 26yearold american swam into north korea where he was charged with espionage hunzikers plight became major issue in

that the assistance package would consist of grants low interest long term loans humanitarian assistance and financing credit for private firms in their joint statement koizumi expressed deep remorse and heartfelt apology for koreas colonization signifi cantly the agreement stipulates that the economic assistance will begin only after relations are normalized accepting this outline for an ec onomic assistance package was significant shift for north korea previously pyongyang had demanded that the package be labeled as reparations or compensation nd in november 2000 had flatly rejected japans formal offer of economic assistance at the summit north korea also dropped its insistence that japan issue mo re formal legally binding apology from the japanese emperor andor prime minister finally by agreeing to link the aid package to the damage from the colonial er north korea also firmly backed away from its periodic insistence that japan pr ovide compensation for harms allegedly inflicted since 1945 should the larger issues of north kor eas nuclear program and the abductees be resolved the size of japa ns economic package is likely to be the subject of considerable debate

declined significantly since the 1980s primarily due to the vere deterioration of nort h koreas economy that began with the withdrawal of soviet and chin support in the late 1980s and early 1990s by 2000 the real value of north koreas ex ports to japan had fallen to onethird of 1985 levels and japanese expor ts to north korea had plummeted to onesixth the level of 1980 that said the shrinking of

package to south korea on june 22 1965 japan and south korea signed treaty of basic relations normalizing relations between the two c ountries for the first time since japan annexed the korean peninsula in 1910 as part of the final ttlement japan agreed to provide south korea with total sum of 800 million41 which consisted of an outright grant of 300 million to be dist ributed over 10year period b 200 million loan to be distributed over 10y ear period and repaid over 20 years at 35 interest c 300 million in private credits over 10 years from japanese banks and financial institutions prior to the 1965 agreement the normaliz ation negotiations between tokyo and seoul had dragged on for over fourteen year s and had triggered strong emotions in both countries throughout the 1950s s outh korean president syngman rhee adopted confrontational approach toward japan and successive japanese governments showed little enthusiasm for accepting rhees demands that japan apologize and compensate for its col onization of the korean peninsula relations warmed dramatically followi ng military coup in 1961 led by general park chunghee who established rapid i ndustrialization following the japanese model of exportled developm ent as his countrys paramount economic goal to this end park was eager for japanese ec onomic assistance nd adopted conciliatory postures on most outstanding issues the approximate size nd composition of the compensation package was one of the first issues to be resolved following parks coup the south korean side which at one point had asked for as much as 2 billion lowered its demands to 700 million in grant aid before agreeing to the 800 million total package reportedly til late 1962 japan had offered only 70 million in total compensation figure th us state department at the time described as unrealistically low42 furthermore the treat on basic relations did not contain any reference to japanese apology instead japans reparations payment was characterized as economic assistance the terms of the treaty enraged many south koreans charging that the agreement amounted to sellout koreas opposition parties boycotted the ratification process in the national assembly violent antigovernment protests erupted throughout th country nd the park government imposed martial law to suppress antigovernment protests around the country the second time in less than year troops were mobilized to curtail protests against the governments japan policy the agreement also faced str ong but eventually ineffectual opposition in japan where the socialist party

1965 and 1999 the gdp deflator is the ratio of nominal gdp in given year to real gdp in that same year in 1999 the gdp deflator was 10437 1996 100 435 times the 1965 deflator of 2398 thus 800 million

adjustment noland assumes an annual rate of return of 5 noland acknowledges that the japanese side is likely to reject the notion of adjusting for accrued interest on th grounds that north koreas

population was approximately 119 million approximately 40 the size of south koreas population of 287 million in the same year in 1999 north koreas population was estimated to be 214 million around 45 the south korean total of 47 million 46 this method uses the japanese gdp deflat or to adjust for inflation between 1965 and 1999 in 1999 the japanese gdp deflator was approximately 35 times the size of the deflator in 1965 using this figure the 1965 compensation package of 288 billion would be worth roughly 101 trillion today 92 billi on at 110 1 to adjust for population differences multiply 101

korean unification and was prelude to an anti communist alliance in asia43 estimating the present value of the 1965 settlement there are wide range of estimates fo r the present value of the 1965 japan south korea settlement at the low end is method that adjusts for inflation in the us economy yielding value of approximately 34 billion in 1999 dollars44 at the high end is calculation that produces value of 20 billion in todays dollars by adjusting for inflation in the japanese economy appreciation of the yen accrued interest and differences in popul ation in north and south korea45 one methodology that adjusts for japanese inflation since 1965 and for interkorean population differences yields present value of 418 billion 38 billion using an exchange rate of 110 1 if the same disbursement formula used in 1965 were applied today the 418 billion would break out as 157 billion 142 billion in outright grants 104 billion 950 million in concessionary government loans and 157 billion 142 billion in private credits46 the above figures should be interprete d as rough approximations computing the present value of past sum is an inherently inexact task when more than one country is involved the calculation is made even less precise by longterm changes and shortterm fluctuations in exchange rates additionally calculation might also take into account differences between japa ns occupation of north korea and south korea including the extent of the claims for damage by the occupation authorities finally the adjustments are made for th total figure of 800 million even thoughhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32161crs18 the actual value of japans compensati on package was lower over 60 500 million of the settlement was disbursed as government loans and private credits which are less valuable to the recipient than outright grants thus the calculations presented provide only preliminary comparative baseline with many qualifications on the other hand the 1965 settlement
