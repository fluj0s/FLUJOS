purchase requirement of the public utility regulatory policies act purpa when ferc finds that competitive electric market exists automobile and light truck fuel effici ency was the subject of considerable debate in both houses in its version of hr 4 the house included language that calls for reduction of 5 billion gallons in lightduty truck fuel consumption over the period of model years 20042010 the senate version would charge the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa with development of new corporate average fuel economy cafe standards using the administrative procedure that since fy1996 the agency had been enjoined by congress from initiating however the sena bill also would freeze p ickup trucks at the current light truck standard of 207 mpg likely sh ifting the burden for achieving savings to the passenger automobile portion of the fleet both versions of hr 4 include pack age of energy tax cuts primarily tax incentives or subsidies for qualifying ergy producers and consumers in terms of revenue loss the house bill cuts energy taxes by 354 billion over the tenyear period from fy2002 through fy2011 in c ontrast the senate bills tenyear projected revenue loss is about 152 billion the house bill provides greater tax cut for fossil fuel supply about 17 billi on more over ten years than the senate bill several significant provisions are contained

distinct versions of an omnibus energy bill hr 4 the first comprehensive energy legislation in ten years the substantial differences between the two chambers appr oaches to energy policy remain to be resolved in conference which is expected to take place over the summer the house version of hr 4 the securing americas future energy act of 2001 which passed august 2 2001 includes key component of the bush administrations energy strategy opening the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr to oil and gas exploration and development the senate version the energy policy act of 2002 approved on april 25 2002 leaves anwr offlimits to drilling the senatepassed bill would make substantial changes in wholesale electricity regulation while the house bill has electricity provisions other provisions contained only in the senatepassed bill include programs to address global climate change loan and price guaran tees for proposed alaska na tural gas pipeline cutoff of oil imports from iraq and renewable ener gy requirements for ectricity providers both bills include provisions to address motor vehicle fuel ec onomy nuclear accident liability energy taxes and authorizations of energy research and development programs see table 1 this report summarizes the major provisi ons of the house and senatepassed bills provides detailed sidebyside comparison and lists annual funding authorizations major provisions arctic national wildlife refuge hr 4 as passed by the house would allow for oil and gas leasing in anwr it contains provisions that would limit the footprint of development to 2000 acres of the coastal plain the senate bill contains anwr provision essentially the nate defeated anwr development by refusing 4654 to invoke cloture on fili buster of prodevelopment amendment which was subsequently withdrawn the us geological survey and the energy information administration have made estimates of anw rs hydrocarbon potential and the range of expectations for oil production in short recent estimates ar that at 24 per barrel in 1996 dollars or about 2650 in 2002 dollars anwr has 95 probability of holding 20 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31427crs2 recoverable barrels or more and 5 ch ance of holding 94 billion barrels or more the mean value in this range is 524 b illion recoverable barrels under the mean value peak production rates would ra nge between 055 and 0775 million barrels per day mbd were leasing to begin within the next few years initial anwr production might occur around 2010 critics of this provision contend that ev if the mean level of production were achieved it would be only about 275 to 38 of current vels of us petroleum consumption now in the 20 mbd area with oil imports approaching 12 mbd anwr would reduce imports by not much more th an 6 at its highest likely output under the mean recovery estimate opponents contend that such levels of production would be inconsequential compared to the imp act on an important environmental asset those favoring development note that wh ile the amounts of oil supply are small relative to these national aggregates 550000 to 755000 barrels per day is significant amount of oil as an energy policy factor it could have an impact on the world supplydemand balance an example of ten cited is that it is in the range of us oil imports from iraq which the senatepassed bill would halt for policy reasons in 2001 the united states im ported 780000 barrels per day from iraq development supporters also contend that current technology would allow anwr exploration and production with minimal environmental impact electricity regulation the electric utility industr has been in the process of transformation during the past two decades technology improvements changes in the economics for generating electricity and new federal laws and regulations have changed the nature of electric generation and promoted markets for electricity as result widespread competition is occurring on the wholesale level and more than half of the states are moving toward re tail competition the electricity provisions of the senatepassed hr 4 woul d continue to change the regulatory requirements for the wholesale electric market the housepassed hr 4 does not contain electricity provisions in general the senate version would repeal the public utility holding company act puhca and give the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and the state utility commissions access to utility books and records it would also repeal the mandatory purchase requirement of the public utility regulatory policies act purpa when ferc finds that competitive electric market exists in addition the senatepassed hr 4 would give ferc more revi ew authority over certain electric utility mergers and increase the value of asset transfers that would trigger ferc review it would require ferc to apply costofservice rates when market based rates are unjust unreasonable unduly discriminatory or preferential require an electric reliability organization to develop and enforce mandatory reliability standards provide access to the trans mission system for certain intermittent generators create an office of consumer advocacy within the department of justice and give states the authority to prescribe and enforce laws regarding the application of the consumer protection subtitle motor vehicle fuel economy automobile and light truck fuel efficiency was the subject of considerable debate in both houses the 106th congress had asked the national academy of sciences nas to conduct study on whether corporatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31427crs3 average fuel economy cafe levels c ould be adjusted without unacceptable consequences to vehicle safety the indus try and consumer choice this was significant departure from previous c ongressional action which since fy1996 had prohibited the spending of ppropriated funds for any sort of rulemaking that would alter cafe effectively freezing the st andards at 275 miles per gallon mpg for passenger automobiles and 207 mpg for light trucks the nas study released in july 2001 did not recommend specific cafe in creases but did conclude that it was possible to achieve more than 40 improvement in light truck and sport utility vehicle suv fuel econom over 1015 year period at costs that would be recoverable over the lifetime of vehicle ownership in its version of hr 4 the house incl uded language that calls for reduction of 5 billion gallons in lightduty truck fuel consumption over the period of model years 20042010 the department of trans portation would establish fuel economy standards sufficient to achieve the require d reduction an amendment to establish combined passenger car and truck ca fe standard of 275 mpg by my2007 was defeated by 160269 more ambitious proposal in the sena to establish combined fleetwide average of 36 mpg by my2015 never r eached vote on march 13 2002 the senate voted 6238 for an amendment to charge the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa with development of new cafe standards using the administrative procedure that since fy1996 the agency had been forbidden by law from initiating however the senate then approved an amendment 5644 to freeze pickup trucks at the current light truck st andard of 207 mpg likely shifting at least some of the burden for achieving savings to the passenger automobile portion of the fleet tax incentives both versions of hr 4 include package of energy tax cuts primarily tax incentives or subsidies for qualifying energy producers and consumers for purposes of this report tax provision is classified according to whether it is an incentive for 1 fossil fuel suppl including coal output incentives 2 electricity restructuring whi ch is also an energy suppl incentive 3 reduced fossil fuel demand through enhanced energy effi ciency and 4 reduced fossil fuel demand through alternative and renewable fuels output miscellaneous or catchall category at the end of the tax section of this report describes provisions that are not easily categorized according to this schema note that the fossil fuels supply category is further subdivided according to whethe r particular provision affects oilgas exploration and production refi ning and distribution or coal output similarly the energy efficiency and renewable fuels tax incentives are further categorized as closely as possible according to the energy consuming sector that would be primarily affected ie the business including commercial and industr residential or transportation sectors in terms of revenue loss the latest estimates show that the house bill cuts energy taxes by about 232 billion over the fiveyear period from fy2003 through fy2007 and 354 billion over the teny ear period from fy2003 through fy2012 in contrast the senate bill s five and tenyear revenue losses are estimated at abouthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31427crs4 1 the most recent estimates of revenue losses are in us congress joint committee on taxation comparison of division c of hr4 the energy tax policy act of 2001 as passed by the house of representatives and division h of hr 4 the energy tax incentives act of 2002 as amended by the senate prepared by the staff of the joint committee on taxation may 23 2002 jcx4302133 billion and 152 billion respectively1 the incentives targeted toward reducing the demand for fossil energy are in absolute dollar terms about the same in each bill each bill provides about 8 billion of tax incentives the house bill is however somewhat more weighted toward energy efficiency than the senate bill the major difference in the two bills is in the incentives for fossil fuel supply including electricity restructuring provisions the house bill provides greater tax cut for fossil fuel supply about 17 billion more over ten years and has broader mix of provisions including those aime d at drilling production refining and transportation of fossil fuels than the sena bill many of the fossil fuel incentives in the house version of hr 4 include capital investment incentives to stimulate production and distribution of oil and ga s and the production and transmission of electricity provisions that are either not pr esent in the senate version or included at much lower level an underlying theme of the housepassed b ill is that many of the nations recent energy problems have been caused by s upply and capacity shortages resulting from demand stimulated by rapid ec onomic growth and relatively low energy prices thus while the house bill also includes incentives for reduced demand conservation and efficiency primary purpose of that legislation appears to be to stimulate energy supplies this is partic ularly true of the outlying years the period 20072012 when many of the demand disincentives expire in relative terms however ie in relation to the size of the energy industry the supply incentives are modest and even more modest in the senate bill although they would constitute significant expansion over existing energy tax law more so for the house bill alaska natural gas pipeline alaskas prudhoe bay field currently major source of us crude oil holds 26 trillion cubic feet tcf of natural gas that cannot be produced for lack of transpor t system those supplies represent the equivalent of 125 years of current dom estic consumption which amounts to about 22 tcf per year and is expected to grow to 29 tcf in 2010 other nearby fields hold more proven gas reserves and it is likel that were further exploration to be undertaken additional gas would be found on the alaska north slope several proposals have been made to bring north slope gas to market in the years since the trans alaska pipeline system taps was authorized for crude oil transportation pursuant to the alaska natural gas transporta tion act the alaska natural gas transportation system angts was authorized in 1977 this pipeline would follow the taps route the dalton hi ghway to fairbanks ak and then the alaska highway crossing the yukon terr itory and british columbia into alberta this route is focal point of the senate billhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31427crs5 the other pipeline proposal under current consideration by corporate sponsors is the mackenzie delta route which w ould begin at prudhoe bay head east transiting offshore under the beaufort s ea off anwr and come ashore in the mackenzie bay it would then connect with existing infrastructure which now ends at norman wells northwest territories this pipeline would transit part of canada where large gas deposits are thought to ex ist it could be catalyst for their development from one perspective this might be seen as beneficial to north american gas supply on the other nd it could be viewed by producers of potentially more expensive north slope gas as unwelcome competition both the senate and house versions of hr 4 address the route issue precluding the offshore proposal and direc ting us project development toward route that initially follows taps the sena bill provides two financial incentives the first offers up to 10 billion in doe an guarantees for project financing of which the sponsors must put down 20 s econdly tax credit would support alaska north slope gas at an inflationadjusted price of 325 per thousand cubic feet mcf at the point where the gas would enter the currently existing pipeline system in alberta nuclear accident liability an extension of the priceanderson act which addresses liability for dama ges to the general public from nuclear incidents is included in the senatepassed hr 4 but not in the housepassed bill however after leaving priceanderson out of its version of the omnibus energy bill the house passed separate priceande rson extension bill hr 2983 that contains provisions similar to those later dopted in the senate under the priceanderson ac t primarily section 170 of the atomic energy act of 1954 42 usc 2210 the owners of commercial reactors must assume all liability for radiological dama ges awarded to the public by the court system but their total liability is limited to the amount provide d by private insurance and an industry selfinsurance system the priceanderson act also authorizes the department of energy doe to indemnify contract ors who operate hazardous doe nuclear facilities the limit on doe contractor lia bility is the same as for commercial reactors except when the limit for commercia l reactors drops because of decline in the number of covered reactors significant differences between the pr iceanderson provisions in the senate passed hr 4 and housepa ssed hr 2983 involve how long indemnification authority should be extended and the form ula for determining the commercial reactor liability limit in addition the house b ill would raise each reactors maximum annual payment for accident damage s from 10 million to 15 million and impose an inflation adjustment while the senate bill would leave the annual payment level unchanged there are also several house provisions not contained in the senate bill including provision that would author ize the federal government to sue doe contractors to recover at least some of the compensation that the government had paid for any accident caused by intenti onal doe contractor management misconduct such cost recovery would be limited to th amount of the contractors profit under the contract involved and recovery w ould be allowed from nonprofit contractorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31427crs6 global climate change the housepassed version of hr 4 contains only one directly related climate change provision author izing funding for climate change protection programs within the envi ronmental protection agency epa in contrast several titles of hr 4 as passed by the senate contain provisions to address the global climate change issue finding growing evidence that greater greenhouse gas concentrations are contributin g to global climate ch anges the senate passed bill calls for the united states to demonstrate international leadership in addressing the issue title x of the senate version provides for organizational changes within the federal government to focus on climate change issues specifically new office of national climate change policy onccp would velop national response strategy new interagency task force w ould serve as the primary forum through which federal agencies assist the ne w onccp in developing and updating the national strategy and new department of energy doe office of climate change technology would oversee research and deve lopment of new technology and provide analytical support and data further climate change activities are detailed in titles xi and x iii specifically title xi would establish new nati onal greenhouse databa while title x iii would focus the research development monstration and t echnology deployment programs within several federal agencies on global climate change science and mitigation of climate change iraq oil import cutoff the senate bill would ban oil imports from iraq imports could be resumed upon presidential certification that iraq was in compliance with resolutions regarding weapons of mass destruction and the oilforfood program and ceased the practice of s upporting the families of suicide bombers additionally the imports could resume if the president were to find that they were in the interest of national security in 2001 the united states imported 778000 barrels per day of iraqi oil an amount equal to 67 of the nations total imports it is likely that the resulting import deficit here would be made up by supplies fro m other exporting nations to what extent iraq would be unable to find customers for this oil and actually export less as result is hard to determine bu t under this bill it would lose its largest single customer possible outcome is that iraq would sell fewer barrels than it might otherwise export and because of the difficulty in replacing the united states as customer those barrels might be sold at discount relative to similar oil from other exporters renewable portfolio standard rps section 264 of the senate version of hr 4 proposes that retail electricity suppliers utilities except for municipal and cooperative utilities be required to obtain minimum percentage of their power production from portfolio of new rene wable energy resources the minimum energy target or standard would start at 1 in 2005 rise at rate of about 12 every two years and peak at 10 in 2019httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31427crs7 eligible resources include solar wi nd ocean and geothermal energy most forms of biomass landfill gas and in cremental hydropower generation offset from renewables used on site to reduce the measured demand from the grid is also eligible the base for calculating the target production level excludes power from eligible renewables hydropow er and municipal solid waste thus states with large amount of existing biomass hydro or other renewable power generation would have proportionately lower target for new generation tradable credits are created which can be purchased in place of power from other suppliers to help retailers meet the target at the lowest cost the credits would function like the clean air act emission allowance trading system which has lowered compliance costs for air pollution regulations the bills credit trading provision is made flexible by allowing supplier to borrow from expected future credits to fill present shortfall or to carry forward surplus credits to future years cost cap for the credits is set as the lesser of 15 centskwh section 271 or 200 of the average market value of the credits the lower the cost cap the more it may restrict portfolio dive rsity and deter generation fro m solar and other higher cost renewable resources utilities sought cost cap near 1 centkwh while environmental groups sought cap near 4 to 5 centskwh state experience suggests that cost cap is key to compliance cost control and may also allow compliance cost to flow through as business cost some see federal rps as way to substitute more marketoriented mechanism for the purpa sec tion 210 requirement that u tilities purchase power from renewables at an administratively termined avoided cost ten states including texas and few foreign govern ments have an rps that provides base of experience for the federal proposal ethanol and reformulated gasoline there are several key fuels provisions in title vii of the senate version the b ill would ban the use of mtbe methyl tertiary butyl ether in gasoline mtbe is commonly used to meet the oxygen content standard in federal refo rmulated gasoline rfg however the additive has been detected in groundwater in several states in addition to ban on mtbe use the oxygen requirement would also be eliminated however the current rfg oxygen requirement benefits ethanol mtbes chief competitor to protect the existing market for ethanol and promote its expansion the bill would require the use of renewable fuels in gasoline ethanol is the most widely used renewable fuel and w ould be used to meet the majority of the requirement effectively the bill would nearly triple us ethanol consumption by 2012 in addition renewable fuel blenders would be shielded from defective product liability overview of house and senate versions although both versions of hr 4 are omnibus energy bills number of the most significant provisions are included only in one or the other in many

the carry back of any unused tax credit for up to 10 years under the senate bill unused credits cannot be carried back to ears prior to the bills enactmentboth bills limit the credit to 25 bpd or equivalent and to 1095 barrels per year or equivalenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31427 crs175 provision current law senate bill house bill comments alaskan natural gas special tax incentive is provided to natural gas produced from alaskas north slopesec 2503 this section of the bill creates new tax credit for the production of natural gas from alaskas north slope area the credit would be the difference between 325mcf adjusted for inflation and the average monthly price for such gas sold in the alberta canada market in effect the tax provision establishes price floor of 325 for such gas the credit is recaptured in the event that gas prices would rise above 4875mcfno provision enhanced oil recovery 15 tax credit is provided for the costs of recovering oil by one of several selected tertiary recovery techniques the credit is part of the general business credit and is limited by the minimum tax irc43no provision sec 3309 the house bill repeals the minimum tax limitation on the enhanced oil recovery credit thus allowing more of it to be claimed percentage depletion 100 net income limit the percentage depletion allowance is limited to 100 of taxable income from each property but this limitation is suspended through 12 31 2003 for marginal oil and gas irc613ac6h sec 2306 the suspension for marginal oil and gas is extended through december 31 2006sec 3302 the house provision is the same as the senate billthe job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 pl 107 147 enacted on march 9 2002 retroactively extended the suspension for marginal oil and gas which had expired on december 31 2001 through december 31 2003httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31427 crs176 provision current law senate bill house bill comments b 65 taxable income limitthe percentage depletion allowance is also limited to 65 of taxable income from all properties irc 613adno provision sec 3302 the 65 limitation on percentage depletion for oil and gas is suspended through december 31 2006thus the senate bill liberalizes depletion for marginal oil and gas while the house bill liberalizes depletion for all independent producers of oil and gas c independent producer status for purposes of percentage depletionan independent oil producer is one that on any given day does not refine more than 50000 barrels of oil and b does not have retail operation grossing more than 5 million irc613adsec 2305 the 50000 barrel daily limit is raised to 60000 and it applies to the average over an entire taxable year rather than on any day during the taxable yearsec 3206 generally the same as in the senate bill except that the limit is raised to 75000 bpd net operating losses for losses reported in 2001 and 2002 net operation losses may be carried back 5 years after 2002 net operating losses can generally only be carried back 2 years this applies generally to all businesses irc172 provision sec 3305 net operating losses of oil and gas producers are allowed to be carried back for up

unconventional sourcesa 3 tax credit 1979 is available for each barrel or equivalent of fuels produced from unconventional sources or mined from unconventional locations for most fuels the credit ends in 2002 for facilities and mines placed in service by 123192 for biogases the credit ends in 2007 fo r facilities placed in service by 63098 credit is available for facilities placed in service after these cutoff dates which apply to different fuels irc 29sec 2310 the credit is extended by 3 years for new facilities for producing most of the preexisting qualifying fuels and placed in service through 1231 2004 for biofuels from certain wastes the placedinservice date is extended to 12312004 for older facilities that produce coke and other fuels from lignite the placedinservice date is extended by 2 years through 1231 2004 the senate bill also expands the list of qualifying fuels to include refined coal that meets emissions reduction targets heavy oil and gas from coal mine that will be mined for coalsec 3306 the house bill also extends the credit and placedin service dates and broadens the types of qualifying fuels but these differ from the senate bill for new projects producing most types of the preexisting qualifying fuels the credit is extended by 4 years for facilities placed in service through 1231 2006 for existing older facilities lower credit is extended from 2002 to 1231 2005 to build facility instead of 2004 in the senate bill for any production which would qualify for credit as result of the broadening of the provision under this bill the quantity of fuel qualifying for tax credit would be limited to 200000 cubic ftday of gas or equivalent although biogases such as landfill gas have qualified for the credit most of the benefits from this tax credit have accrued to coalbed methane and to other unconventional fossil gases see crs report 97679 also it is important to note the similarities and differences between this tax credit and the 45 tax credit both of which apply in part to certain renewable resources the 29 credit is granted for the production and sale of the fuel while the 45 tax credit is granted for the production of the electricity from the fuel coordination between the two credits prevents double dippinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31427 crs178 provision current law senate bill house bill comments tax benefits to american indianspresent tax law provides accelerated depreciation of business property located on indian reservations and an employment tax credit for wages paid to american indians both of these tax subsidies expire at the end of 2004 irc45a 168jsec 2501 2502 the senate bill extends both subsidies through december 31 2005 sec 3310 this house provision extends both subsidies but only for energyrelated businesses also the extension is through december 31 2006 one year longer than the senate billthe job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 pl 107 147 enacted on march 9 2002 extended the incentives through december 31 2004 refining and distribution provision current law senate bill house bill comments oil and gas pipelines the recovery period for the depreciation of oil and gas pipelines is 15 years for natural gas gathering lines it could be either 7 or 15 years depending upon whether they are classified as exploration or transportation equipment irc168e3 secs 2302 2311 this provision clarifies the recovery periods by assigning natural gas gathering lines 7 year recovery period and natural gas distribution lines 15 year recovery period secs 3201 3202 natural gas gathering lines are assigned 7 year recovery period but natural gas distribution lines are assigned 10 year recovery period petroleum refineries assets used in petroleum refining are depreciated over

credit of 210barrel of low sulfur diesel fuel is also provided for small refiners limited to 25 of the capital costssecs 3204 3205 the house provision is generally the same as the senate bill except that 1 only 75 of the costs can be expensed and 2 small refiner cannot refine more than 150000 barrels per day compared to 205000 barrels in the senate bill the senate bill reduces the fraction of expensable costs for taxpayers refining between 155000 and 205000 barrels per day similar limitation is provided with respect to the per barrel tax credit it would also unlike the house bill allow cooperatives to pass thro ugh the credits to members excise tax on train diesel fueldiesel fuel used in train engines is taxed at 44gal comprising 43 which goes into the general fund and 01 which goes

farms gasoline and diesel used on farms is exempt from the motor fuels excise taxes as are most other offhighway uses of motor fuels the gasoline used in cropspraying aircraft is exempt only to the extent it is used while actually spraying the crops gasoline used from the airport to the farm is not exempt further the farmer must waive the right to claim the exemption in order for the sprayer to claim the exemption irc6420csec 2506 the senate bill repeals the waiver requirement and permits the aerial consumer of the fuel to claim the exemption if it is also the purchaser of the gasoline also the senate bill treats the gasoline consumed from the airport and the farm as onfarm use thus qualifying for the exemption provision commercial power takeoff vehiclesno special tax credit is available to businesses that own refuse collection trucks or cement mixing trucks such equipment is depreciable property fuel excise taxes are not generally imposed on offhighway fuel use such as in construction equipment but there is mechanism for crediting the excise tax paid by businesses on that portion of the fuel used by the trucks to power either the load compactor or the mixer drum sec 2009 through 2004 250 tax credit is provided for each refuse truck with load compactor and each cement truck with mixer drum after 2004 the treasury department will issue regulations that will reduce the excise taxes on the fuel used to power the load compactor or the drum as the case may beno provisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31427 crs181 provision current law senate bill house bill comments

commercial airlines that transport property rather than people are assessed an ad valorem tax known as the cargo waybill tax of 625 of the amount charged for shipping the property or freight irc4261 4271sec 2506 this section of the senate bill expands the list of exempt uses for purposes of the passenger ticket tax and the domestic segment tax to include transportation by fixed wing aircraft used for forestry purposes the definition of rural airport for purposes of the domestic segment tax is also modifiedno provision blend of dieselwater emulsion fueldiesel fuel used in highway vehicles is generally taxed at 244gal comprising the 243 highway trust fund htf rate and the 01 lust trust fund rate irc4081no provision sec 3116 the 243 htf component of the tax on emulsified blends of diesel

selected types of advanced clean coal technologies and 2 production tax credit for electricity generated from either advanced clean coal technologies or existing coal fired steam generators retrofitted with more energy efficient and cleaner coal technologiessecs 3117 3118 this provision is very similar to the senate bill except that the investment tax credit is fixed at 10 whereas in the senate bill it is based on complex formula based on how much of the national limits on aggregate investment in advanced clean coal technologies is allocated to each utility by the treasury

senate bill house bill comments open access and tax exempt bondscurrent federal tax provisions relating to the use of taxexempt bonds effectively preclude public power entities with outstanding bonds from participating in open access restructuring plans because of the tax codes private use restrictions irc103 141147sec 2405 this provision eases somewhat the restrictions in irs temporary regulations with respect to issuers of taxexempt bonds qualifying under the output facilities provisions and participating in open access plans sec 3207 this section modifies and liberalizes the private use provisions of the current tax code by grand fathering the tax exemption of existing bonds in return for the loss of the tax exemption for future new generation facilitiesthe amendments in the house bill which are made to the statute rather than any related regulations are much broader than in the senate bill sale or disposition of transmission assetsunder present tax law the sale of electricity transmission or distribution facilities is generally not considered to be an involuntary conversion thus generally triggering tax which could inhibit procompetitive sales of transmission and distribution lines and facilities to independent companies for example to create regional transmission organizations rtos irc451 1033 1245 1250sec 2404 under this section gain from the sale or disposition of transmission assets is recognized and included evenly over 8 yearssec 3208 under this section the sale or disposition of transmission but not distribution assets to implement industry restructuring mandated by state or the federal energy regulatory commission ferc is treated as taxexempt involuntary conversion thus not triggering income tax in the case of capital gain

amount funds may be transferred taxfree in connection with change in ownership of the nuclear facility to which they relate but the transferee generally has to be regulated utility eligible to maintain such fund in deregulated and restructured industry ambiguity regarding the tax treatment of decommissioning fund transfers may make such transactions taxable irc468asec 2402 the senate bill repeals provisions that limited the deduction to regulated utilities thus liberalizing the deduction in the context of utility restructuring and deregulation it clarifies that transfers of funds do not trigger tax and that the actual decommissioning costs are deductible when paid rather than when the actual decommissioning begins sec 3210 in addition to the amendments made by the senate bill the house provision further liberalizes the tax treatment of nuclear decommissioning costs unlike the senate bill the house provision allows utility to make contributions into the fund in excess of the
