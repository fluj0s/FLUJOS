election1 the work of the fec on voting system standards had been part of its broader portfolio on electi on administration performed by its office of election administration oea formerly called the clearinghouse recurring issue in those earlier discussions was the appropriate level of priority for the fecs election administration ac tivities in light of its other responsibilities as result of that debate and other factors the election administration activities of the fec were significantly constrained voting system standards study in january 1977 an fec advisory panel recommended the development of voluntary standards2 legislative language on study of the matter was first proposed in the 95th congress as floor amendment to s 926 b ill to provide for public financing of senate elections3 it directed the fec to conduct st udy on future development of voluntary engineering and procedural performance standards for votin g systems in cooperation with the national bureau of standards now the national institute of standards and technology nist an impetus for the initiative was conteste d 1974 senate election in new hampshire in which malfunctions of lever machines were

election campaign ac t amendments of 1979 the study was not included in the house version of the bill or discussed in the house administration committee report5 or hearings the committee held between march and july 19796 in fact the house version narrowed the respons ibilities of the clearinghouse from the administration of elections to the administration of the federal election campaign act feca7

earlier bill s 8328 on fec authorization questioned the co mmission placing priority on the funding of studies which do not relate to federal re sponsibilities such as redistricting over funding for its basic statutory responsibilities9 hr 5010 passed the house on september 10 1979 with some concern about the narrowing of scope noted in floor debate10 in july the senate committee on rules and administration had also held hearings on amending feca two draft bills discussed by the committee included language originally proposed by senator ca nnon in 1977 along with some background information although the voting system study itself was apparently not discussed during committee deliberations11 the committee then marked up and reported s 1757 which retained the language on the study12 when the senate cons idered hr 5010 it amended the bill by substituting version that included language from hr 5010 as well as from s 175713 the substitute contained the study language and restored much of the scope of clearinghouse activities but limited the focus to federal elections14 the language on the study included an additional requirement that the fec absorb the costs15 t h

fis cal year 1993 february 26 1992 5051 standards was released in april 1990 but the fe c noted that several states had previously implemented portions of th earlier draft standards25 the fec developed plan to implement the vss through cooperative action by the fec nist set of laboratories called the i ndependent test authorities itas state and local governments and voting system vendors under the plan states would adopt the standards and the itas would test voting systems to determine whether they met the standards nists intended role was in accreditation of the itas however the plan did not materialize as originally conceived instead the national association of state election directors nased which was blished in 1989 appointed voting systems board to choose itas and administer pr ocess for qualifying voting systems under the vss the testing program began in 1994 nased chose the election center professional organization of election officials to serve as the secretariat for voting system qualification updating the standards the fec began project to update the st andards in fy1997 in response to nased assessment that changes in technolog and issues relating to testing required revision of the first version the process received little congressiona l attention until after the november 2000 federal election see below the fec released draft standards for public comment in 2001 and the final vers ion in may 2002 the total cost was approximately 700000 the revisi on took broader approach than the original version focusing on the voting medium paperbased versus electronic rather than specific kinds of voting systems it also included new or expanded covera ge of some functions and requirements they included accessi bility feedback to the voter election management audit trails and broadcasting of unofficial re sults all of which were part of the congressional debate occurring at that time on election reform as well as telecommunications and certain testing issues replacement of the standa rds with th guidelines in the aftermath of the november 2000 fe deral election the process by which the vss were developed and implemented became subject of debate while some observers argued that the existing process worked well others raised criticisms such as the following the standards did not ddress several im portant aspects of election administration the revision addre ssed some but not all of those concerns the approach to developing the st andards did not follow best practices in this area as promulgated and practiced by standards organizationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21156crs6 such as the american national standards institute ansi and the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee the qualification process created bottlenecks in certifying new systems the vss focused too much on engineering rather than performance and impeded the development of new kinds of voting technology the voluntary nature of the standa rds at the federal level led to insufficient and inconsistent applica tion by state and local governments the house science committee held hearin gs on may 22 2001 on the role of voting system standards in improving voting tec hnology and subsequen tly reported hr 2275 the voting technology standards act of 2001 hrept 107263 the bill would have established commission chaired by the dir ector of nist to develop new standards nist would also accredit testing laboratories and perform research and development the house administration committee reported hr 3295 the help america vote act hrept 107329 and the house passed that bill on december 12 it established the eac to replace the oea and provided statut ory basis and process for development of the federal voluntary vss and certification of voting systems with major advisory role for nist including the establishment of technical committee to revise the vss the senatepassed version of h r 3295 did not establish mechanism for development of voluntary standards but did require consulta tion with nist and the architectural and transportation barriers compliance board in any revisions to the vss it also established set of requirements for voting systems invol ving audits accessibility machine error and prevention of voter error the enacted ve rsion of hava contained the requirements from the senate bill and the mechanisms from the house bill for development of voluntary standards now called guide lines and certification of voting systems hava did not however specifically authorize funding for nists involvement and the development of the vvsg was delayed for several m onths in part for that reason work on development of the first version of the vvsg partial revision of the vss began in 2004 with th appointme nt of the technical committee draft was released for public comment in june 2005 mo st of the language was unchanged from the 2002 version of the vss major changes included the following addition of conformance section which describes in general terms those entities expected to conform to the guidelines and what is required of them revised and new standards for accessib ility and usability human factors revised standards for security including wireless communications software distribution and validation and voterverified paper ballots used with dres some changes to testing procedures with respect to machine error and discussion of certain best practices for election officials and of some alternative methods for ba llot verification by voters work has also begun on second version of the vvsg which would be complete revision the eac also has adopted framework for assuming responsibility from nased for certification of voting systems nist has produced draft handbook for laboratories seeking accreditation and established application procedures
