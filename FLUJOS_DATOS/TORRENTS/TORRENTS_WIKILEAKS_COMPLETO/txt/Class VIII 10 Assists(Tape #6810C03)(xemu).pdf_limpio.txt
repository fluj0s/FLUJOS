6810c03 class viii tape 10 assists and you are being well advertised class eights you are being well advertised full spread of the auditor we sent mission we sent mission up to the pubs org in ww and we got ourselves complete spread in this it has double page internal spread of photographs taken by the only photographer in the field and you will notice that the pictures here are actually posed by sea org members they are not in actual fact the first class eight students and thats because you were all so very very busy that day and the aos are represented here the class viii auditors course begins at aos but that is quite an action rather typical sea org action actually we banged it together organized the whole shot shot missionaire up to pubs got it on the presses its rolling it will be out and released in england in something on the order of about two weeks from this date and it will be over in america in three or four weeks and it says here that as you read this why class viiis will be supervising cases in your nearest org so it looks like you guys are very well advertised very very well advertised and i am sure you will make the grade you better had the action here is that you have to get reality on what standard tech will do and what you can do with it and which way it goes and so on all of which is very easy ok whats the lecture number which one ten you mean youve gotten up to ten and you are not class viiis yet lecture number ten lecture number ten and this is the third of october ad 18 and this is lecture that covers exact processes and is very ratatattat the first process i wish to cover is an assist an assist is done on if you will notice your scale of special cases the sick pc now the sick pc can also include one that is in flat out agonizing he doesnt know what is wrong physical condition and the approach to that particular case is included in the head under the heading of assist the most common assist is contact assist you take the person to the place where he was injured and make him do contact of the injured part to the place where and the thing that was actually the cause of the injury and you do that and you will get somatic blow through and that is that that is very common and very easy to do that is called contact assist and you never do touch assist when you can do contact assist if the thing is there its there this comes from the fact that the exact thorn in the rose garden which pricks your finger will turn on that exact somatic when contacted again in other words if the mest is available you can do contact assist and it is very easy thing to do there are hardly any commands involved with it the less you say the better off you are your whole object is simply to get him to go and put hit stubbed shin up against the lawn mower where he has hit it and you make him do that and touch it again and touch it again and touch it again and touch it again i must tell you something about assists when you come up scale as an auditor you can actually see somatic go through now some of you will be looking for painted picture eight feet square it is not that it is simply very faint very faint impression and you can actually see sort of faint impression go noise through the pc you know the somatic has gone through the pc also it is assisted by occasionally he flinches at this moment and so on now i must say something about contact assist the object being to get him to go up and touch his shin against the lawn mower is all very well but if you force him to go up there it is the same at forcing sick pc which is very very bad indeed and the funny part of it is that you can to this on gradient he does not want to come nearer than one hundred feet from that damn lawn mower you can actually find this in child thats the closest he is going to come to it well you make him do contact assist with his shin and his body at point one hundred feet from it and you gradually by gradient narrow the distance to it by gradients that he is willing to approach it eventually he will go up and do contact assist on it that fact probably is not generally known but you must not drag the person up there forcibly because you are going to do an overwhelm now touch assist is the next grade of assist and touch assist is with the command which you dont articulate any more than you have to the pc gets the idea very shortly you touch him with your finger and he is supposed to feel the finger and then signify that he has felt the finger after few commands youll find out that when you touch him he will give you blink or nod or some representation you knock off the verbalization at that particular time and you simply continue to do the touching and he continues to so on now you wait for him to acknowledge its rather hard to do this on person who is only semiconscious then you try to maintain the communication cycle it all depends on what part of the body is injured what you do with this contact assist the most difficult area to do contact assist on is the head and the head and the nerve system of body is pain cushion it is pain absorption cushion and any electric shock caused by pain distributes itself throughout the neurons of the body and you will find out that there was wave of shock which went lets say hit head that went all the way from the head down through the nerve channels and the electrical you can even measure the speed of an electrical impulse through the nerve channels it happens to be ten feet second but it went from there as shock wave straight down through the nerve channels which go through the spine and there is about dozen neurons something like that through the spine and it goes to the extremities of the body so you will find person who has had head injury normally had something wrong with his spine afterwards and that is because the shock wave is locked up in his spine so your touch assist should include going from the head to the extremities of the body now if you are just trying to get him back on his feet or something like that you are not going to go to the soles of his feet and try to do supersuper thorough job of this because later on you are going to run it out as an engram probably but the thing which i am calling to your attention is that it does go to the extremities of the body so your touch assist is not just around his head and you have to approach the injury go away from the injury approach the injury go away from the injury approach the injury closer go away from the injury further approach the injury closer go away from it further approach the injury closer go away from it further approach the injury to point where you are actually touching the injured part go away further and when you are going away and coming up you try to follow the nerve channels of the body which includes the spine and the limbs and there are certain relay points like the elbows and the wrists and the finger tips these are the points you head for the back side of the knee and so on these are all points which the pain can get locked up in the shock wave what you are trying to do is get this communication wave flowing again through the body because the shock of injury stopped it what they know as operational shock accident shock things like this is simply the thing stopped right there see the individuals trying to withdraw from it it is stopped and therefore he cannot get circulatory system going in the area now if you do anything on the right aide of the body you also do it on the left side of the body let us take an injured hand now if you do touch assist on an injured hand you go further away from the body down the hand and closer to the body going across the area of the injury touch at last the injury and then you do exactly the same thing on the opposite side of the body because the brain communication system cross locks and you can find that pain in the left hand runs out when you touch the right hand because the right hand has got it locked up so you do the right and left side of the body has hurt his right shoulder you should also give the touch assist to his left shoulder the principles are simply these near and far near far on try to do it on gradient and then use the other side of the body too and the other operating point is follow the nerve channels now if the fellow is bleeding from an artery and is going to loose all the blood in his body in the next four or five minutes you would be an absolute idiot to do touch assist and then apply tourniquet the proper sequence is to apply tourniquet and then do touch assist now the proper sequence is not to give him shot of morphine and then do touch assist because you are processing an individual under the influence of drugs and it will just slow down and nothing much will happen the object of touch assist in this particular thing supposing man had broken his hip or something like that you give him touch assist you give him touch assist try to get some of the shock off of it try to get some of the shock off of it if it were the left hip you would do touch assist to the left hip you would go up the spine down the spine back of the legs to the area and then you would it on the opposite side of the body and its feel my finger throughout except you dont have to say it once hes got it in the groove and then of course after you have got the edge of it off the guy may still be in agony because the thing is pretty badly smashed up then let somebody shoot him with morphine then let him be packed off let him get the thing set let the medicos have their day plumbing him also let the medico have his day to do what he can try to minimize the amount of conversation around the injured person is one of the main criteria you dont let people talk around this thing even though you have to kick them in the stomach and you dont keep saying shut up and be quiet because that becomes part of the engram you signal them to be quiet and you walk into their chest and you walk them of the scene and then say shut up you know like that and then come back and continue it because you are just putting content into the engram now the medico goes and patches the thing up and hit the structural fact is handled now at some later time few days later day or two later hes out of his shock something like that and he can stand up to auditing now you give him session which runs the engram and you give him just standard engram session there isnt anything peculiar about it it just runs down the chain of injury and all that you understand but that engram running comes under the heading of assist which i cover with you in moment now that is nothing more nor less than contact assist and touch assist and this is how they are done and that is standard tech we have been doing them for yars exaggerated way of saying years and yars and yars and its amazing to to find that there are scientologists around who dont now how to do these two standard actions in standard way alright now what about this engram now this is this special case which is sick pc it could be sick or severely injured pc but its sick pc in other words an acute now condition which is devouring his attention and youre going to fly the needle on arc breaks huh now here is something funny heres something funny if you are auditing him with meter you audit him on exact standard tech it isnt peculiar brand of tech which enters in but it has this exception youre hope of flying the needle before going into the major action is zero because he is sitting in the major action with all devouring concentration do you follow so this is an exception and there arent very many exceptions in standard tech but this is an exception to fly the needle before undertaking major action because the major action is there now this tells you also then if you cant fly the needle before that that the pc is in rather perilous condition and if you try to do forcing technique on the pc if you try to shove the pc into something heavy he isnt sitting in and doesnt want to go into you can easily overwhelm the pc and spin him now just as you cant fly the needle before you run the engram so you must very definitely obey the auditors code and try to do your very smoothest trs and gently gently and thats how you run an engram on very injured person now this approach includes the guy who falls on his head in three because of the restimulation of an engram you are going to find i am very sure somewhere in your career individually because he is not going to be very rare an individual who all of sudden has not run out his incident one or his incident two or something of this sort all of sudden he is going to tell you he is dying hes collapsing the body is ceasing to breath and what do you know it is you understand this thing goes into sudden you see he didnt do good job on three and so on he hasnt been well reviewed something like this and he is liable to go into sudden agony on the thing and it could be very real agony now the funny part of it is he cant identify what it is it is very mysterious something wild suddenly occurs now you could actually have this happen with very malignant body thetan all of sudden hits the guy do you see he just started to run this body thetan and wham wham we have already had one in an ao guy did something to slave girl at some time way to hell and gone back on the track and shes been around ever since when they gave her little bit of auditing and tried to boot her out she left but three days later she came back and man she really knocked that guy flat he was the flattest pc you ever saw there is case history on this what they did was do the usual did the usual actions of three the auditor however on meter and so forth located and isolated what the thetan was handled the thing ran the incident one incident two necessary to resolve the situation and finally and forever why the slave girl blew very remarkable circumstance apparently this body thetan had been around for many many century now this these are interesting phenomena in that the individual is suddenly and inexplicably hurting or very ill and if he were ill from ptomaine poisoning or something of the sort you actually could not distinguish it you look at the pc pale clammy looks like hes sick might even be vomiting see something like that now the individual simply could have been fed bad food and is being is going through bad food spell dysentery something like this well what can you do about it you can let him get well and feed him an antibiotic do you follow if he doesnt recover from that i have got news for you it is because it is held up mentally function is senior to structure thought is senior to function and structure and an individual who is bound and determined to be sick because of the bank or body thetans trying to make him sick or something like that brother brother you could treat him all the antibiotics in the world boy you can operate on him do most anything you want to do and there isnt very much going to happen its very funny this kind of an action has taken place an individual with very severe infection fed antibiotics and other medicines to alleviate the thing and just go right on with it just right like that an auditor comes along in spite of the antibiotics gives him an assist session cleaning up what he had goofed up or what was goofed up on the case and although he stays hes on antibiotics and he stays on antibiotics right after the session the antibiotics suddenly start to work and the fever turns of the temperature goes subnormal it all vanish runs out it cycle very nicely its very remarkable phenomena this individual is coughing and coughing and coughing and he has had cough for long time and they to some sort of an analysis and culture and this and that and they finally find out that he has got galloping whoses invented name and only they call it some latin name and it proved it proved it absolutely conclusively that he has got this do you see hes got it alright only he doesnt respond to treatment in medicine they divide illness into three groups patient reaction into three separate categories which is what causes it what makes it sick you know what makes it come up to an immediate acute condition and what prolongs it now there is data on this in i think dianetics modern science of mental health it talks about that now three phases you see so he can get something which precipitates the illness bong hes sick and now he doesnt respond he gets prolongation and he doesnt respond to the cure he doesnt respond to the cure auditor comes along you just do standard tech and run an engram or secondary is all you do but it is standard tech see its done by all rules of standard tech its done neatly nicely smoothly realizing that you cant reach very deep and his ability to asis is very poor and he is pretty wongobongo and if you get him all over the track with fifteen engrams in restimulation one right after the other boy you might as well have shot him with shot gun to begin with you understand so it has to be gently done and the control of the session has to be very good you have to be very good auditor to do this sort of thing and you hit this chain and you fix it up now oddly enough you dont even get to run it out you hit it you date it you do what you can about it and all of sudden the medicine works all of sudden the individual starts to get well or the individual goes back and runs three the individual returns to solo or he gets his next grade or something like this do you follow he gets back into the standard line of things now its called an assist its called an assist but it is done very very very definitely by very standard tech you check your arc break and handle that arc break you check your ptp you check your missed withhold i dont care the guys woowoawaowoa etc check these things because the funny part of it is it may be such hell of break in reality he was sitting there minding his own business and all of sudden bullet went through his head thats the way it feels and he is in agony see whoa you check your arc break and the arcu and cdei and you go through any of the motions you can now the one exception is if you expect the needle to fly you are fool you wont and if you try to force this needle to fly you are just distracting him now you dont want to audit over an arc break you dont want to audit over ptp and you certainly dont want to audit over missed withhold but they will all be germane relevant to the incident hes sitting in you wont get anything else so you pull the arc break out of the incident so you are not running an engram over the top of an arc break you pull the ptp out of the incident its just the ptp of the incident that he has it you pull that out so that you get some change and the missed withhold concerning it and so on so that he wont natter and blow up in your face because its all on the incident but the needle the chances of the needle flying are very very slim you understand the only variation here then is that you dont expect the needle to fly before youre doing major action because you are already doing the major action not of your own choice you are presented with the major action now the pc has presented you on silver platter with the major action bong i was down in the restaurant i was sitting there various noises dramatization of how the pc would sound hope you don need full transcript here are the words without the ejaculations i was sitting there there it goes again there it goes again i was sitting and i was just sitting there and all of sudden my right arm fell off and to this chin music you get in arc break ptps missed withholds he will answer your questions boy because they are right there ready to spit out and then find out what it is you dont arbitrarily audit something without finding out what it is so this is one of these things where you are doing sort of an assessment it isnt list dont you see youre assessing and you ask him what he thinks it is and he normally will tell you i dont know so you have got to suggest it you know he is very often hes saying pc in agony noises again oh oh god i havent got any idea oh my god see thats the type of music which you are liable to receive many not slightly there have been many pcs like this around aos and out in the field except people immediately take it for granted that they are terribly ill and they dont do anything about them you see thats for the birds so you have to do the list and its this little process which you see on my case supervisor notes assess you know bla bla noises take the one that reads the most and do something with it well actually under an emergency of this particular character you are handling the similar situation that i have often handled in babies i am very good with babies and so on i have had lot of experience in this line and i get along great with babies kids dogs people beings horses horses and i argue little bit but the well we do we dont see eye to eye horses feel put upon they have been replaced by the automobile and they feel supernumerary but the upshot of it is that little baby went baby crying noises and you will see some goddamn nurse girl walking back and forward patting the baby in the butt you know walking back and forth and back and forth there there there hush now hush now hush now i come along and i hear all this catastrophe going on and i say what cooks he has colic and so on noises well she has misdiagnosed it obviously and the baby keeps on crying so i take look at the kid and first they have safety pin shoved quarter of an inch in to his butt but the funny part of it is i sort of have to ask him it isnt any sort of telepathic communication i have to look you know i have to look and look at the reactions you know there isnt much communication with it what what the hell you know what is this because he really doesnt answer up one of the reasons he doesnt answer up is he is so frantic you know it isnt that he cant talk or communicate so is just frantic thats all the nurse girl his mother maybe even doctor around you know christ almighty he is frantic and you finally say what did you give him for supper oh well he just had his regular ration where is it oh its over there i mean its odd that he wont eat he wont eat i squirt some out on the back of my hand and taste it its live pure live somebody has mixed it up with baking acid or something you know how it is you know its completely sour the devil himself would have turned purple if he had ever got it in his gullet you know i go up and i whip up the kid mess of milk or something and i hand him bottle and he takes very suspicious you know well all of sudden oh thank god and you find out he hadnt eaten for two days its idiot stuff like this actually see but this is little sort of an assessment lets see could it be food could it be that he is hungry could it be that vague noise could it be is he wet is he chafed or something you know it is something and thats what they miss entirely but its something it isnt ever nothing now you see you have to learn that about cases if case is having trouble it is something it is never really nothing unless somebody has wished nothingness off on him and when you get the nothingness off you will find out that there was still something so this is the way you have to approach very ill pc and you as an eight class viii are going to have this problem in aos and in orgs and you are going to run into it and you are going to have to tell somebody what to do about it well it is something you should learn well it isnt something that is not going to happen to you it is going to happen to you and you have to do an assessment of all the possible things it could be only they are pretty obvious has he eaten bad food thats one list see list item it is one of these little assessment items bad food body thetan engram you got the idea something in that order is all of sudden going to cause bd you say it to him and even though hes gone noises my god see you get through you dont have to shout at him you get through you just say it and all of sudden you have got blow down well if its body thetan if its body thetan you would simply follow through the routine of three of ot iii but the second you start contacting what it actually is or identifying it starts cooling off and the pc reaction becomes far more reasonable and rational even though its knocking him half flat you see so what you would do is try to get this body thetan find out whats wrong with the body thetan find out what it wrong with him and the body thetan lets just get little itsa on it lets get some data and then lets try to run an incident one off of this body thetan and you sometimes will find the body thetan has been overrun already on incident one you see number of conditions can exist when you are handling body thetan now the but you find out what condition it is and then you do the usual for three now dont always assume that it is cluster but it could be cluster and there is mutual engram so if it is body thetan you would then do milazzo which is say you find the mutual engram the mutual engram and the first action of the mutual engram is to date it to date it date it date it what is its date thats the most available datum you date it and then you find out what it is about and you can do both of those you can first your little assessment is what is it see physical illness you know body thetan engram whatever you might think see you put it down those are the most likely candidates and you put these things down bad food see and you put these things down and if you dont get blowdown on any of those things dont quit you have got something missing from your assessment line the guy might simply be high on pot and in delusions you get it unbeknownst to you why he took himself whole big smoke and he went up in smoke you see well it could be something so your perception enters into what goes on the assessment form to give you canned assessment form of every thing that could be wrong with thetan in this universe would be an adventurous action because operating at different places at different times you will get different items but those are the principle ones now if it is body thetan you got to identify if it is just one or if it is several now the funny part of it is it will answer up as just one body thetans normally do but when you say is it several you will get bigger read now you want to know if it was several what is the date of the incident that brought them together and you are going to date it and you are going to do standard dating drill that doesnt vary one hair tens of years ago hundreds of years ago the only way you can miss on this sometimes is that it happened last year or it happened yesterday then you would have to start out in minutes seconds ago minutes ago hours ago days ago weeks ago months ago years ago tens of years ago you got it thats the safest assessment and you go on up and dont start slowing it down and say well we got to trillions and nothing happened after trillions comes quadrillions i think they go way up boy thetans are very old but someway along that line you are going to get something like hundreds of billions good and that read bit now is it more than five hundred billions or less than five hundred billion it read on more is it more than seven hundred and fifty billion less than seven hundred and fifty billion it read on less than seven hundred and fifty billion is it more than six hundred billion and meanwhile you are listening for the pc to spit out date the pc very often spits out date oh six hundred and seventy two million nine hundred and forty five thousand seven hundred and forty two yes thats right and two minutes you know very good you write all that down it reads like hell bongo bingo bongo thats the incident you run and when you just start to run this incident on cluster you very often very often they go noise fifteen twenty of them leave all at the same time something like hundred of them leave noise thank god know goodbye noise alright now if the pc at that moment where gave an aspect of relief and looked well you would say thats good you understand he had to be an ot iii or this sort of thing would not be happening you know you dont run this on people below that level youd kill them so he says yes oh thats great oh my god what relief noises god and you say alright thats fine thank you very much and let him take it up himself now he is going to go on the basis that they all blew and ive got news for you on cluster they dont always all blow there are fifteen of them left it looked so spectacular to see such mass disintegrate and so many of them leave but there might be some still around now you have to finish running the engram out to that degree and run incident one on each separate one of them and they go thud thump gone gone gone that cleans it up because the funny part of it is let us say he had terrible throat noise couldnt talk see and then you found this incident you dated the thing you got some substance of what it was all about and all of sudden you got this noise gone you know still going to be left with bit of sore throat youre going to say well thats natural it isnt natural thats the ten or fifteen youve left thats the engram the engram is still remaining with those few do you follow now also there is copy now thetans copy what has just been copied thetans copy what has been copied and make copies of the copies you get the idea so you get this kind of thing the thing came off your back see came off gone but the mass is still there all right whose copying the thetan who has just left thats the trick well this one is copying and there goes that mass crosscopying and you run into lot of this crosscopying and so on as you try to run this stuff got it but for the purposes of an assist the noise goodbye joe see you later thats good enough boy you dont push your luck thats good get on with it some day let him recover let him get his breathe and then hit it later but you normally have these characters coming back saying how it didnt all go away well of course it didnt all go away not all the cluster left went away now the engram wasnt erased there is basic on the engram there is whole chain that hasnt been gone down do you follow you didnt finish the job all it was was an assist you got it so what happens when this fellow all of sudden starts spinning and he says there is an opera singer standing right in front of my face and she is going round and round and round and round and round and i dont know understand it and i dont understand it and oh my god my god noise there goes the fever again you know what is all this same procedure you try and get in the ruds do it to the degree you can make little assessment of what this thing might be then you date it cause its going to be some sort of an incident and when you date it if it comes up that the key dates of incident two which is of course seventy four million plus its almost seventy five million almost in pt peculiar to this planet if it came up with about four quadrillion its incident one they are that far apart thats peculiar to all the thetans of the universe they all got that so of course it tends to make them cluster that is why they blow up and go park and everything works out when you hit so called incident one all right it comes under the heading of an assist and you cool it off to point where you can leave it and he can bear it and that is it and then he lives to be audited another day you got it those are all assists now it isnt proper session because you didnt fly the ruds for major action you didnt fly the ruds for contact assist you didnt fly the ruds for touch assist you didnt fly the ruds for this assessment you can by the way make an assessment after the assessment you can make an assessment for what it is and then you can make little assessment and write down asking the pc questions well whats the content of it i dont know i dont know well just tell something is it accident is it shock of some sort is it and then he is liable to volunteer one or two items and you sort of put that it is not one item list you see it will work out sort of like that because it is usually just one thing but you are not trying to list and null this thing you are just asking the question you are writing it down to compare the reads do you follow and if he runs out of it you can furnish couple yourself because hes not so violates like hell putting an item on the pcs list so it isnt really listing and nulling action do you understand it is just trying to find some information so it is an assist it isnt really proper session but you must in all cases carry on an assist with the discipline of the auditor dont force the pc he persuasive he gentle keep your trs in do the actions which you can do within the limits of the session do you understand that you are going to run into this character who starts going round and round and round and they say they say the helicopters going to crash its going to crash and you are looking for helicopter accident what the hell its r6 boy and nothing else i dont know i think it is for about day or two it takes this helicopter to crash in r6 there is helicopter there the guy is frozen in alcohol and glycol sitting in block being given big three d dimension cecil b mills special motion picture now the consistency of this you should understand incident one is simply incident one person can have himself more than incident one more than one incident one person himself can have administered some incident ones there can be an overt incident one it is relatively simple implant but it is quite effective in lousing people up because it interrupted them from creating what they would have been creating and took away what mock ups they did have and it stopped their cycle and it put some thing there that was unwanted so when they tried to create they created it because it fixed their attention by process by protest all right for this planet for this confederacy and the twentyone adjacent stars and its seventy six planets the incident two it is very long involved and complex incident its about thirty six days it starts out normally with capture some kind or another capture and dont think of yourself im trying to run capture of having been airyfairying around in the air and somebody something or other and got you down with net and all that balderdash because people at that particular time and place were walking around in clothes which looked very remarkably like the clothes they wear this very minute and the cars they drove looked exactly the same and the trains they ran looked the same and the boats they had looked the same circa 1950 1960 this civilization has simply copied r6 one hundred percent because they were told to and they walked down streets that looked like these streets and lived in houses that looked like these houses and so on thats what the hell and there was quite bit of huffle fluffle and upset and so on before r6 took place what it was was the loyal officers were the body the elective body and they called them the loyal officers and they were there to protect the populations and so forth and they had elected fellow by the name of xemu to the supreme ruler and they were about to unelect him and he took the last moments he had in office to really goof the floof sound of pencil dropping yes i dont blame you for dropping something and he took these last moments to really upset it he of course had several key birds who were close to him he was suppressive to end all suppressives he got these administrators and so on and heads of planets in various positions and places he picked off all the cowboys in the white hats and he got rid of them first fast and then troops not knowing what the hell they were doing but fed all kinds of false orders were fed in against the population to pick them up one after the other tata tattatatattatatat one of the mechanisms they used was to tell them to come in for an income tax investigation and the united states just copies income tax its just r6 they are bunch of dramatizing psychotics these guys so in they went and the troops started slaughtering them and then the troops of course were ordered out to get hold of certain bodies of renegade troops which were ordered to get certain bodies of bad troops and they shot each other up and implanted each other and wiped it out they were making billiard balls out of these places they were imported they were actually the trick was to shoot somebody disable somebody very often needle into lung and at the same time to hit him with frozen alcohol and glycol which preparation is guaranteed to pick up thetan all they had to do was pick him up and put him into refrigerator and they had him boy because if he tried to exteriorize from the body there he was frozen and they threw him into collection points boxed them up in boxes threw them into space planes which are the exact copies dc8s the dc8 aeroplane is the exact copy of the space plane of that day difference except the dc8 had fans propellers on it and the space plane didnt and they threw them into refrigerated units and so on and in view of the fact that einstein was absolutely right man cant go faster than the speed of sound speed of light which is bunch of balderdash the length of time from the planet coltus to the planet teegeeack which is the name of this planet was nine weeks and youll see that it is many light years coitus is one of the planets and is to this day one of the planets of the north star polaris and people were ferried in here by the billions and the billions and the billions and they were ferried in here with boxes and they were put in boxes and they were stacked around and the people who were on this planet already just caught it in the teeth they werent bothered body bothered to pick them up they just shot their administrators from guns and shot their control points out and they took these people in boxes and so forth and they dumped them and then they set off hydrogen bombs on the top of each primary volcano there is on this particular planet and when they blew up it blew the thetans into the air and after the bomb an electronic ribbon which also was type of standing wave was erected over the area the tremendous winds of the planet blew every thetan there was straight into those particular vacuum zones which had been created these were brought down packed up and put in front of projection machine which with sound and color pictures first gave them the implant which you know as clearing course and then whole track implant which you know as ot ii after this however up about the remainder of the thirty six days which is the bulk of them is taken up with threed super colossal motion picture which has to do with god the devil space opera etcetera they go five pictures to five words and we have the full record of what it is and it goes on for about thirty six days and then these poor bastards were let wander out pardon they were then boxed up again and the boxes were mixed so that there were two assembly areas one was palmas and the other was hawaii and in these two assembly area they took samples from each volcano area put it in little boxes and they had an assembly line and in palmas it runs down the main street of palmas you get more damned accidents on that main street than you can shake stick at one of our captains was feeling rather queasy until i told her well the old assembly line of r6 is just twenty five feet from you as you lie here on the slipway that blew the charge the entirety of roman catholicism the devil all that sort of thing that is all part of r6 practically anything you can think of all modern theaters in actual fact are built with the exact symbols shown for them in r6 they even have the symbol on the boxes on the side of the theater they preserve those to this day its so indelible they are not quite right but they still know that there is supposed to be design on those boxes at the side of the audience to the left and right and so on there is supposed to be certain gold gilt design over there and they still put it there and in the thing there are about four or five assignments of who did it there are about four or five different things that might have done it it is blamed on one of these things that time an another thing that time and so on so at to get people very confused as to what was the true cause of the entire thing after they were packaged up they were blown off into space and let em go to hell these planets averaged one seven eight billion human beings per planet one hundred and seventy eight billion there were two hundred and fifty billion on this planet the name of this planet was teegeeak and this is known as the bomb place and this is the evil place this is the place where they all got smashed you wonder today where you see large areas of where there is alleged volcanic action has been those are r6 explosions the remains of them if you go down through many layers of civilizations archaeologically you come to green glass now to get rid of the whole damn thing it is only necessary to run incident one really in most cases which runs out the whole track because the fellow realizes he is mocking it up and he knocks it off and that is that but incident two has volcanic explosion which follows the actual explosion as its picture and its very tricked very tricked up so that you actually bunch of thetans and they get bombed that is one of the its wild that is one of the explosions that is shown and there are several explosions shown in sequence so actually what happened was that there was the real explosion which was the guy was boxed up in box or he is walking around or some of the loyal officers that were caught here and so on were chained on the top of buildings and so on so when the bomb hit why they would be flicked of into the fantastic hundreds of miles an hour thousands of miles an hour winds of gross complete atomic explosion all over the planet and they were whirled in these terrific winds and so on everybody on the planet was killed and about three days afterwards is actually when the implanters started operating they had it all rigged to operate and then to make long story short you can easily get into one of the false explosions as the fairy queen the fairy palace it is supposed to be fairy palace and dive down to save somebody because there has been an explosion and thats all phony so there is false start after false start after false start to the incident what this is really designed to do is to make the individual cease and desist from creation and to knock out overpopulation this is one of the big ideas they had that they just did all this then they would get rid of all overpopulation the target of it is the second dynamic so it is full of second dynamic suppressions for instance you find people who are totally obsessed with sex with children well that is taught in r6 they were nice guys anyway to make long story short there is even motion picture studio in it the even give the writers and so forth of the thing they had several tricks that they used they can make full figure appear in the room which looks totally solid and totally threed to the person they are just tricks just nothing we know so much more about the mind than the r6er that there is comparison now the net result of all of this was to make seventy five million year vacuum as far as this part of the universe is concerned you wonder why dont if there are saucers around why dont they land on this planet this planet traditionally traditionally over the various zones and areas has an evil reputation mutineers and deserters and that sort of thing are often dumped on this planet they often come here in refuge because they know nobody is going to come after them this planet is the planet of the evil repute this sector of the universe has very evil repute now all the data which you have that was seventy four plus plus plus billion years ago almost seventy five and this catastrophe overcame this confederation and it has made very unsavory part of the universe to say the least about well relatively almost modern times twenty million years ago something like that somebody started up body line on the planet its gradually worked through various areas of barbarism and once more r6 tailor made it to be nothing but cave man civilization but nevertheless they moved up the line and they moved up towards the dramatization of r6 and that is what man calls progress they have managed to make things this way and that way the technology is rather pathetic but they have moved up the line until there is some possibility of establishing communication with regard to the activity the fate of the r6er you will have many pc will say oh my god they are after well noises sure fixed up an area they fixed up an implant that there people are taught carefully that any man who tries to save the world must be killed he must be mobbed and hanged any man who tries to save the world so i of course shifted our valence over to more optimum r6 valence the whole population of the planet responds like clock to r6 symbols they respond to nothing else they do not respond to reason they only respond to r6 symbols so you occupy the wrong symbol and people begin to think of you as person who is going to save the planet then one and all are more or less under orders to slaughter you well they booby trapped it they booby trapped it very badly the roman catholic church somewhere along the line through watching the dramatizations of people picked up some little fragments of r6 and they make it look like its continued forward into present time but the truth of the matter is that the loyal officers were not all killed xemu missed and they were not all killed not by long way although the civilization was battered it still had weapons it still had transport it still had some semblance of organization and the loyal officers who were at remote bases who were airborne at the time who somehow or another on other planets were not effected suddenly turned around right after this great catastrophe and the administrators and renegades which xemu had brought in were not very effective and fire fight ensued which put the finishing touches on the galactic confederation the towns that were left and so on were just battered into ruins were you had the renegades that had been hired and so on and the administrators that had been loyal to xemu were still trying to hold out within year he was in under arrest and within six years the lot had been wiped out the loyal officers were triumphant xemu was put with several of his cohorts in the center of mountain which is still on one of these planets and in wire cage which is charged with an eternal battery he is not likely ever to get out and the loyal officers looked around and there was not anything left and of course nobody could manufacture this or that or the other thing and what people there were left they could not obtain any supplies and they couldnt maintain the civilization and what little was left that wasnt battered to pieces simply went by the boards and vanished from history there is base on this planet and it is so shredded away as to be hardly recognizable whenever then anybody tries to do anything about this he is apt to get flashback so you must not go around talking about being the people who are going to save the planet you are the people the planet obeys you are the people who own the planet you are not the people who are going to save the planet and thereby you will save it now i could give you much of the symbolism and so on which goes along with this but you find it recorded this of course man responds to an exploding volcano ron shows dmsmh book front cover which is an exploding volcano he responds to that he understands that it doesnt restimulate him because hes not up to being restimulated he just knows that thats all right in r6 everybody is shown crucified so is the psychiatrist shown crucified although the psychiatrist is dominant character and thats how he gets away with what he gets away with he electric shocks people the medical doctor is not really represented in r6 it is only the surgeon the surgeon is shown cutting bodies to pieces thats the right thing to do actually he shreds body down to just raw meat down to skeleton and the skeleton is in agony and then it too is chopped up anyway every man is then shown to have been crucified so dont think that its an accident that this crucifixion they found out that this applied somebody somewhere on this planet back about six hundred bc found some piece of r6 and i don t know how they found it either by watching mad men or something but since that time they have used it and it became what is known as christianity the man on the cross there was christ but the man on the cross is shown as every man so of course each person seeing crucified man has an immediate feeling of sympathy for this man therefore you get many pcs who say they are christ now there are two reasons for that one is the roman empire was prone to crucify people so person can have been crucified but in r6 he is shown as crucified there are certain things which make people ill and that is when they get into certain zones and areas or positions which approximate the r6 position such as body lying in the rain with rat below the cross guaranteed to give people colds and so forth so they have colds from rain yet they take baths and get wet and don t get colds when they get cold it restimulates frozen alcohol and glycol as mix and therefore they get into dramatization so the sickness is very closely tied in with r6 quite in addition to that one of the volcanoes japan on its explosion gave certain definite implant that tells people when and how to be sick they are supposed to be sick at five they are supposed to be sick at ten they are supposed to be sick at four up to fifty the change of life that men get and women get and so on it s all dictated in this sickness implant people are supposed to get sick also body was only supposed to live seventy years which is bunch of balderdash hefore r6 and so forth they lived on and on and on and on and on there was such thing as this they taught people death they taught them amnesia these various things they all come from this zone and area now that is peculiar and lonely to this planet and to this confederation there have been other implants of various kinds and sizes but this is probably one of the longest most violent and wildest implants in this sector of the universe now to get an edge in in this particular area and blow this up as mass engram and so forth is quite trick and we are involved in doing just that universe is safe where people are smashed that badly it becomes the business of any thetan because the universe in which he lives as long as it contains cancerous area such as this whole confederation and so on is not universe in which one can really freely move simple so the project is open and shut and as i point out to you once again the truth of the matter it that it is more the business of the inhabitants of this planet than it is mine now where we are making headway we are making headway and we must go right on making headway because we might not ever get another chance the dramatization of exploding bomb is contained in r6 so sooner or later someone is going to smoke this planet into cocked hat that is why i have talked occasionally about having to get there with the most now realize when you are auditing pc for god sakes that you are auditing against this background you are auditing against the background of tailor made sickness auditing against background of this of that of the other thing now the grades take one very smoothly up this line but you are auditing basically sick pc why hes an earth man so what do you do standard tech follow the line go right on up the groove because these are the things which stand in the road of any thetan not just the people of this planet but three happens in other zones and places something blows up and five or six thetans who are in the railroad car together or the space wagon and after that think of themselves as just one thetan and get all smashed together and stay that way for while somebody kills another body in dual and the owner of the second body is so revengeful that he promptly jumps on the first guy and this guy is now duel being who sort of hates himself thetan goes mad at exactly that point in his career when he begins to stop things so you can always find the point where somebody has gone round the bend so therefore the button stop is very important to remember in running incident one and incident two very important because it will be the point where which makes and breaks his sanity you get the button stop in and the incident starts to run well why is stop so important because it stops the incident any incident dont think thats all there is to the track of incident one and incident two but these oddly enough take the puzzle apart there are so certain other things and i forbear actually to tell you too much about these things because you will at once go out and try to find them on pcs if you dont watch it but there is the incident called the obscene dog that is just little bit later than incident one and sometimes actually by running it why you can get the pc into incident one the obscene dog this is sort of brass dog in sitting position and anybody who got around to the front of the dog got caught in some electronic current and passed through the dog to the dogs rear end and spat out thetans didnt like this so there are very often trick incidents of one kind or another and they could vary from being to being but not everybody has an obscene dog and incident one lies ahead of it anyhow but there are these incidents now i have given you the length and breadth of what you are working with with regard to this planet and when i tell you that an individual is liable to have an assist i am talking against what he is liable to be manifesting when he needs one hes most likely to be in two the odds are way in favor of his being two or hes most likely to be the victim of cluster but these are merely most likely you still go through the whole process you dont just immediately just hang this round his head because it might be an odd case that is wrong do you see now if your pc were to suddenly start to spin when he was doing three he has audited an incident one on one thetan and started an incident two on another one who hasnt had his incident one run if you can get to him in time you have the second thetan run back to the incident one and run it in other words the pc makes mistake then pc idea from solo auditing and so on there ideas of running body thetans are some of the damnedest things i have ever heard of pardon ill amend the statement they are some of the goddamnedst statements i have ever heard of they are weird weird how the hell can they dream up these things there was somebody the other day we found who was putting in r factor and he was going through the entirety of model session and so forth i suppose the guy who has trouble running another thetan at that proximity probably not very horsepowered or something of the sort well all i ever did with body thetan was just think got to the noise think noise go through it and get your stop off zzzzooooom hey thats mine he would say im leaving good bye now people very grossly underestimate the number of body thetans there are to run tremendous underestimation many people are too frightened of body thetans they all of sudden say ahhh i will go and attest lets hope nobody finds out they cut their own throats because the later ot sections are booby trapped now the exact way you take person who has skimped on body thetans he is still having lot of trouble and so forth he really didnt finish three just went zoom and cut and ran status happy or something is you take the individual and you do standard action for four he says hes he says hes four all right he says hes finished three all right well do it dont argue with this dont keep sending these people back on three dont keep sending them back on three the hell with it he says hes done his four ok if they found none and so forth its sort of my contempt the guys told already that he is just solid in the head you know there is not such thing on this planet as body thetan i mean person who has body thetans body that doesnt have any body thetans is just like trying to tell that cows exist on the planet who have heads the way you do it give him the four run down which youve reason to go into at this moment its very exact run down it has variables that if the case is very special case that hasnt gotten along to well you run the valence shifter early before you do rehabs and you will get along much better but if he has been running along fairly normally fairly normal ta do the valence shifter after the line up thats all that determines it case had thick review folder run the valence shifter early on the case if hes not had any trouble you run it after you have done all the rehabs i mean its as elementary as that it doesnt matter which place you run it but it does matter that every time you do valence shifter you must ive found out very definitely you must do confront the individual goes into his own valence and he cant tolerate it and if you dont also do confront hes liable to practically spin on you in the next few days valence shifter is very powerful process so any way that follows one two its one of these things were you set away with it here or there and its alright and you then you assume that it can be alright but it turns out that the majority have to have confront also run and so it becomes package valence shifter is always followed by confront now you do your standard four rundown you get it fine the guys feeling good hes doing this and that and so on and now you just find any injury chain and you run it particularly this lifetime and you run it as an engram standard engram running just by the book absolutely take him down to the end deal with that engram or chain matter where it goes it will go earlier similar and earlier similar it will go eventually to similar incident that will run youve run each one you see but it didnt run out and so you got an earlier similar incident youve got your date of it your erasure you know just text book completely textbook done deftly swiftly down the line he goes earlier earlier earlier fn whooee i sure feel good ive never felt better well what the hell have you done you have picked up every area where he had hell of an opportunity to get hit in the teeth by body thetans and where there might be cluster and you have shaken one or more body thetans loose in doing this rundown dont be amazed to have whole bunch of body thetans all of sudden clear out zoom they are liable to go but that isnt inevitable that this happens it is just little bonus now you have got it down and it goes fn now you go find an incident one and you run it and lets try to find another incident one and lets find another one and lets just drain this case of incidents ones you get it lets run as many incident ones as we can well of course each incident one will go fn because its on different being and all of sudden you run out of incident ones starts overrun now here is screamy screwy one you can do overrun on three long fall that reads go and attest oh the auditor who could do something like this or the examiner who accepts something like this it complete idiot it isnt overrun on three it means that one body thetan has been run one too many times or incorrectly run through incident one so you rehab the one body thetan and he blows and the person is not now overrun on three its always the body thetan that is overrun now the pc himself could run himself one too many times through the incident and then having done so he would get an overrun on three it would read but you rehab his running incident one and that does not mean he is all out of body thetans he can find body thetan run incident one on it do you understand so overrun on three is where you can lay an egg you can lay big egg as an auditor because it means overrun on incident one or overrun on incident two by thetan or the pc and that is all it means you cant overrun three now the next action the next action with regard to this sort of thing would naturally be something very complicated and clever and on an examination i just gave you havent yet got the exact mechanism of how an individual squirrels and you better damn well get it the individual has been audited non standardly therefore he appears to be strange beast on whom non standard on whom standard tech doesnt work person whose supposed to know how to audit has audited the person on standard tech and now the person has not resolved so its wide open invitation to invent technique invent something invent something strange this individual is very peculiar indeed he doesnt respond along this line now what i am trying to teach you is is that only happens where that standard tech has been followed is false report it hasnt been followed you go back over the case and you will find out that he had missed withholds or he had ptps and its blown down on auditing reports and every other damn thing list listed lists mile long and so on and then somebody is giving you false report the case has just been audited by standard tech i mean so what standard tech has not been followed that is what i am trying to teach you there is case that standard tech does not solve there are people who say they have but havent applied the standard action and you look through the folder and you will find the evidence right in front of your eyes ive got to teach you that and ive told you about four times and you couldnt answer on an examination so learn it now please that is how squirreling begins do you understand that is how an individual gets an invitation to squirel its the false report oh yes we ran valence shifter and we did this and we did that and we did everything noise case is still going in there going noise anybody told anything like that the look of contempt they would get would be quite withering there might even be beam go with it i would look through the auditing report and look over the pc and i would find out the case had been audited over arc breaks he is one of these seven special cases he hasnt been assessed i mean the guy i mean the guy they did it all bonkers and backwards while telling you they did it all the way that was supposed to be done and then you get an unusual case and the way you solve the case is to do right what has been done wrong that thing youve got to learn because it is your only shield against the invitation to invent something new and strange you understand well alright will you get that down because thats very important point that is how squirreling occurs the case now is strange case well the only thing that is wrong with him is that standard tech has not been done while somebody thinks it has so you have got to find out what standard tech hasnt been done and get it done and he ceases to be strange case right now you follow all right now this is wide open invitation the case im just telling you about thats why im interjecting this im not cross with you there is wide open invitation the barn doors are wide open youve run this engram chain it went fn youve found an incident one you ran it it fned you found you didnt there wasnt any other you didnt going to come up and say well that was it noise finished it all up noise there he sits you know going noise or some other normal mannerisms you see and he looks at that moment like standard tech has just fallen on its head boy hes got an abscessed nose or something of the sort well havent got any body thetans now anybody who invents some technology well scan your body and see if anything reads good he is probably ordering body thetan who cant scan to scan anyhow see scan your body did you scan your body oh yes well nothing read alright you dont have any body thetans booh the guy isnt alright hes got body thetans hes got pictures when he himself is clear plus what he is perfectly unwilling to run anything he hasnt got any more he cant find any more thats it you run the basic track and he cant find any more thats it now one of two things is true he either hasnt run his own incident one or incident two or he hadnt got his own capture straight or he hadnt got something straight with regard to his own track on incident one and incident two nothing else thats him hes got that and remember every body thetan there is answers up to that to the pronoun this is read oh alright yes hes talking to the pc everybody body thetan knows hes known as so either himself has done something kooky hes overrun incident one or he had two incident ones or he didnt run his incident two or he ran capture that belonged to somebody else or he ran an incident two that belonged to somebody else and said that was him or he is actually just when he ran his incident two he was only running copy of some body elses incident you know something goofed up or hes got body thetans one or the other now you can establish this very easily but you dont have to be very bright to establish this you just find an engram chain and you run it by engram by chains and you go find yourself an incident one or an incident two and then you run as many incident ones as you can find to run you got it its the same damn phonograph over and over do the same thing find the severe injury chain run the pc through it get it exactly by the book so forth pongopongo go down the chain that or down the chain you are going to get an fn when you get down to the fn at the bottom of the chain why its fned great thats it thats finished with the chain good find incident one all right so he finds an incident one and he runs it and then you couldnt it wont run out and then something weird happens so you check it for overrun and you are already running the overrun body thetan you have been running the engram chain out of anyhow so you rehab that body thetan and they blow then find another incident one and in this wise the pc all of sudden starts saying i can do this you say good thank you very much bring him up to proper ending point of the session fly his needle on something and let him go do it do you follow it is always the same phonograph record find severe injury chain track down the severe injury chain until it goes fn by the book try to find an incident one find an incident one run it now i didnt even say the severe injury chain had to read on your meter as long as the pc could see it and go through it but we have already run severe injury chain that was so solid and so late and so impacted with body thetans who wouldnt let any other body thetan ever move that if the needle just flicked time or two in trying to run the engrams but they promptly went solid so he found the earlier incident got its duration and so forth ran it and flick thats about all you get an earlier flick and then all of sudden incident one bd long fall long fall long fall bd fall fall fall small fall small fall long fall long fall just running it exactly as an engram and all of sudden where it went fn the pc said now wait minute i ran mine where did the other come from you will find pcs walking around who are clear and who arent mocking up pictures any more who have got automatic pictures and it never seems peculiar to them then they start thinking i must have mocked up machine which makes up some pictures and so forth exclamation bull they got fleas colloquial term derogatory term for body thetan they got fleas thats the routine and that is sort of review assist which gets the guy running who aint got any do you see how its done how that is done exactly by the book you fly the needle you find the engram chain it all goes fn now you have got the gradients of assists and there they are spread out in front of your face there are not many to know how to do there is not very much to knowing how to do there is great deal to knowing when to do what you have to know when to do what well there is not many choices there either so the net result of all of this is that there are assists to assist somebody to run his grades on solo and there are the other types of assists and they run the gamut from making him touch his head to the door he bumped on through to flying the needle finding an engram chain finding an incident one and the individual gets started again on three got it end of tape
