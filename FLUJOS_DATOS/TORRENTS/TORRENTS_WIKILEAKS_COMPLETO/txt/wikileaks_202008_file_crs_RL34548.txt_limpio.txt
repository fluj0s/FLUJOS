specialist in environmental policy resources science and industry division air pollution from ships marpol annex vi and other control options summary this report provides information regarding pollution from ships and port facilities discusses some of the measures being implemented and considered by local state and federal regulatory agencies discusses the efforts to ratify and to strengthen annex vi of the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships marpol and describes legislation congress is considering to control emissions from ships by amending the clean air act caa as pollution from cars trucks and landbased stationary sources has been more tightly controlled over the last 40 years the contribution of ships and port operations to air pollution in port cities has become more important in the same period foreign trade has grown dramatically thus pollution from shipping and port operations would be growing as percentage of total emissions even if the emissions were regulated to the same degree as other sectors in many cities ships are now among the largest sources of air pollution controlling these sources is complicated by the fact that most oceangoing ships are not registered in the united states and may not even purchase the fuel they are using here thus controlling such pollution would seem to lend itself to an international approach to date such efforts have been of little avail in 1997 the united states and most countries signed an international agreement known as marpol annex vi setting extremely modest controls on air pollution from ships the agreement did not enter into force until 2005 and the united states took until july 21 2008 to enact legislation to implement it hr 802 pl 110280 while awaiting congressional action the environmental protection agency epa port cities and states began to act on their own and in congress other legislation has been introduced s 1499 hr 2548 to require epa to dramatically strengthen ship emission standards under the clean air act negotiations to strengthen marpol annex vi are also under way the parties are expected to vote at the next negotiating session october 610

conclusion 9 air pollution from ships marpol annex vi and other control options introduction over the last 40 years air quality in the united states has improved substantially since the passage of the clean air act in 1970 annual emissions of the six most widespread criteria air pollutants have declined 160 million tons 53 despite major increases in population motor vehicle miles traveled and economic activity1 emissions from shipping are major exception to these trends although emission controls have reduced pollution from new cars and trucks by more than 90 most oceangoing ships operate without any pollution controls at all new and remanufactured engines on tug boats ferries and other smaller ships will be subject to emission controls beginning in 2008 and 2009 but most existing engines in vessels of these types remain uncontrolled pollution from ships is also affected by the fuel they use marine vessels other than oceangoing ships have been required to use cleaner fuels but oceangoing ships generally use bunker fuel fuel that contains high level of contaminants the average fuel used by oceangoing ships contains 27000 parts per million ppm sulfur for example almost 2000 times as much as would be allowed in trucks operating on us roads in the angeleslong beach area which is both the nations busiest port2 and the nations most polluted area3 the problem is particularly acute according to the south coast lalong beach air quality management district aqmd 1 see us epa air emissions summary through 2005 at httpwwwepagovair airtrends2006emissions_summary_2005html the six criteria pollutants are ozone particulate matter carbon monoxide sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and lead 2 according to the wall street journal angeles and long beach ranked number 1 and number 2 in the value of cargo handled with combined total exceeding 2485 billion in 20032004 the port of new york and new jersey ranked third with 1324 billion see the busiest us ports march 9 2006 at httpamericanfuturenetp1447 3 the angeles south coast air basin is the only area that epa considers to be severe nonattainment area for ozone the area also has the highest readings in the country for fine particulates pm25 and is among only 8 areas classified as serious nonattainment areas for larger particles pm10 see us epa green book at httpwwwepagovoaroaqpsgreenbkindexhtml crs2 oceangoing vessels are among the largest sources of nitrogen oxides nox in the area emitting more nox than all power plants and refineries in the south coast air basin combined nox reacts with volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere to produce ozonesmog 70 of the areas emissions of sulfur dioxide so2 come from ships these emissions need to be cut by over 90 according to the aqmd if the area is to attain the national air quality standard for particulates by the 2014 deadline particulates from marine vessels also create significant cancer risks more than 700 premature deaths are caused in the angeles area annually by these emissions according to the aqmd4 while the angeleslong beach area may be the most extreme example the problem is not limited to or even to california according to the environmental protection agency epa more than 40 us ports nationwide are located in nonattainment areas5 for ozone fine particulates or both6 in addition according to epa the problem is not limited to port areas alone santa barbara county which has commercial ports estimates that by 2020 67 percent of its nox inventory will come from shipping traffic transiting the california coast7 oceangoing ships are perhaps the largest source of port emissions but they are not the only source ports make use of tug boats to guide ships entering and leaving the harbor ports make connections to landbased transportation networks such as railroads and they generally operate large truck terminals ships at rest in the port need source of power which often comes from running auxiliary engines and in many cases harbor is served by substantial local boat or barge traffic sometimes including ferry service thus addressing the sources of pollution in port may require multifaceted approach 4 see testimony of barry r wallerstein executive officer south coast air quality management district at legislative hearing on the marine vessel emissions reduction act of 2007 s 1499 us senate committee on environment and public works february 14 2008 p 1 5 that is areas where air quality is worse than the healthbased standard for ozone particulates or both 6 testimony of bryan woodthomas us epa office

crs3 marpol annex vi pollution from ships not only air pollution but pollution of all kinds is governed by the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships first negotiated through the international maritime organization imo in 1973 the convention known as marpol for marine pollution 7378 the dates referring to the 1973 convention and its 1978 amendments applies to all ships of the flag states that have ratified it about 150 countries representing over 987 of world shipping tonnage have done so the convention also applies to ships of non signatory states while they are operating in waters under the jurisdiction of parties to marpol six annexes to marpol 7378 cover various sources of pollution from ships oil noxious liquids sewage garbage etc and provide an overarching framework for implementation provisions of annex vi annex vi of the convention which was adopted in 1997 but did not enter into force until 2005 addresses the prevention of air pollution from ships the annex represents small first step toward controlling such pollution particularly if one compares it to pollution controls that the united states and other developed countries impose on landbased sources annex vi limits the sulfur content of the fuel used in oceangoing ships bunker fuel to 45 45000 parts per million ppm by comparison highway diesel fuel in the united states is limited to 15 ppm allows special sulfur oxide sox emission control areas currently the baltic sea the north sea and the english channel where the sulfur content of fuel is limited to 15 15000 ppm or sox emissions are limited limits nox emissions from new engines and engines that have undergone major conversions to range of 98170 grams per kilowatthour gkwh by comparison power plants in the eastern united states are limited to 045073 gkwh allows the regulation of emissions of volatile organic compounds vocs from tankers by parties to annex vi in their ports and terminals prohibits emissions of ozonedepleting substances prohibits the incineration on ships of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs class of toxic chemicals widely used in electrical transformers until the 1970s in the united states pcb production and use were banned in 1976 and disposal has been strictly regulated since then and crs4 prohibits the incineration of garbage containing more than traces of heavy metals and of refined petroleum products containing halogen compounds8 implementing legislation hr 802 the united states is party to marpol 7378 and most of its annexes but did not enact legislation to implement annex vi until the summer of 2008 the senate gave its consent to ratification of annex vi on april 7 20069 but congress needed to enact implementing legislation before the united states could submit the instrument of ratification the house passed hr 802 to implement the annex on march 26 2007 the senate passed the bill with an amendment june 26 2008 and the house agreed to the senate amendment july 8 the president signed the bill july 21 2008 pl 110280 the united states has participated in negotiations to strengthen annex vi more stringent limits on both fuels and emissions were approved by an imo committee april 4 2008 and will be considered for final adoption at the next meeting october 610 2008 the united states supports the strengthening amendments although it will not be able to vote at the meeting because of the delay in enacting legislation to implement annex vi epa believes that the strengthening amendments will be adopted by unanimous consent of the parties thus the inability of the united states to vote may not be of much significance epa has already promulgated regulations under the clean air act that are as stringent as annex vi and shipping companies are already generally meeting the standards these socalled tier 1 standards were promulgated february 28 2003 and went into effect in 200410 in addition in october 1999 epa established voluntary certification program so that engine manufacturers could show that their engines are compliant with annex vi epa believes that all marine diesel engines sold in the us since january 1 2000 to which the annex applies ie those rated above 130 kilowatts meet annex vi requirements the annex vi standards apply to any oceangoing vessel that is registered in the united states ships of any registry in ports shipyards terminals or the internal waters of the united states ships of any registry bound for or departing from the united states while they are located in the navigable waters of the united states or designated emission control areas and ships bearing the flag of any country that has ratified annex vi traveling through us waters or designated emission control areas even if they are not bound for or departing from us destination to the extent consistent with international law the annex also applies to any other ship in the us exclusive economic zone 8 for more detailed description of

legislation in addition to the bill to implement annex vi other legislation on ship emissions has seen committee action in the senate s 1499 reported by the environment and public works committee july 10 2008 srept 110413 would amend the clean air act to require oceangoing vessels entering or leaving us ports and offshore terminals to use fuel that contains more than 1000 parts per million of sulfur 98 reduction from the requirement of annex vi beginning on december 31 2010 the restrictions would apply within 200 miles of the west coast and within such distance of the east or gulf coast or the shoreline of the great lakes or st lawrence seaway as epa determines to be appropriate11 the administrator would be allowed to provide an alternative mechanism of compliance if he determined that vessel employed control technology that reduced emissions of sulfur oxides and particulate matter to at least the same degree as the reduction that would be achieved through compliance with the sulfur content limitation in addition to the fuel standards the bill would require epa to promulgate emission control standards for main and auxiliary engines on oceangoing vessels that enter or leave us ports the standards would require the greatest achievable emission reduction for four pollutants nitrogen oxides particulate matter hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide effective january 1 2012 the standards could take into account the feasibility benefits and costs of specific technologies could distinguish new from inuse engines and could vary depending on the age of the engine similar bill hr 2548 was introduced by representative solis in the house but action has been taken there federal state and local measures beyond annex vi and the pending senate and house bills potentially more stringent actions are being taken at the federal state and local level to address emissions from marine engines epa regulations epa has begun to regulate ship emissions under existing clean air act authority thus far the regulations are relatively weak and it will be at least 2014 before the agencys regulations impose stringent requirements in most cases also when the more stringent requirements do take effect they will apply only to new and remanufactured engines so improvements resulting from the standards will be gradual 11 the administrator may promulgate regulations that permit sulfur content as high as 2000 ppm for specified period if he determines that compliance with the 1000 ppm limit is not technically feasible by december 31 2010 crs6 category 3 engines epa categorizes ship engines in three categories the largest of these engines the main engines on oceangoing ships are diesel engines with percylinder displacement at or above 30 liters these are referred to as category 3 engines as noted the agency has already promulgated regulations equivalent to annex vi for these engines under the clean air act but as the agency states on its website there is an opportunity to gain large additional publichealth benefits from category 3 marine diesel engines through the application of advanced technology emission controls including highefficiency catalytic aftertreatment12 the agency has begun the process of developing more stringent regulations by issuing an advance notice of proposed rulemaking december 7 2007 it plans to finalize new category 3 regulations by december 17 2009 whether or not the agency promulgates more stringent category 3 emission standards they may have little effect on the overall level of pollution from category 3 ships since they will only apply to engines installed on vessels flagged or registered in the united states in 2007 only 67 of the worlds ships and only 12 if measured by carrying capacity were registered in the united states13 category 1 and 2 engines by contrast the category 1 and 2 engines those smaller than 7 liters per cylinder and those from 7 to 30 liters per cylinder respectively are used in boats or ships that operate in us waters tugs ferries great lakes freighters fishing boats and recreational boats for example virtually all of which are registered in the united states and compared to category 3 epa is further along in regulating the emissions of these categories regulations that will reduce emissions of nox from new or remanufactured engines by 24 and emissions of particulates by 12 when fully implemented were promulgated in 1999 and began taking effect between 2004 and 2007 more stringent standards were promulgated may 6 2008 and will take effect between now and 201414 the final 2014 standards will require ultra low sulfur diesel fuel 15 ppm sulfur and high efficiency catalytic emission controls capable of reducing particulate matter emissions by 90 and nox emissions by 80 along with sizeable reductions of hydrocarbon carbon monoxide and air toxic emissions according to epa15 epa has also proposed new annex vi standards covering both fuel and engines at international negotiations under the auspices of imo as noted earlier the more stringent limits were approved by an imo committee april 4 2008 and will be considered for final adoption at meeting october 610 200816

continued crs7 california emission reduction measures california being more adversely affected than most other areas has played leadership role in identifying and implementing emission reduction measures as well the state has focused on port activities in addition to fuel and emission standards californias measures fall into four categories 1 requiring the use of lower sulfur fuel 2 requiring emission controls on harbor vessels and shoreside equipment 3 providing alternative electric power to ships while they are docked at marine terminals and 4 providing grants for the repowering of harbor craft and shorthaul trucks with cleaner engines low sulfur fuels the california air resources board carb at july 24 2008 meeting approved regulations that would require both us and foreign flagged vessels sailing within 24 miles of its coast to use low sulfur fuels in both main and auxiliary engines beginning july 1 2009 compliant fuels are marine diesel oil with 5000 ppm or less sulfur or marine gas oil with 15000 ppm or less sulfur in january 2012 sulfur in both types of fuel would be limited to 1000 ppm the rules replace low sulfur fuel requirements that the state implemented in 2007 but which were overturned by the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit earlier this year17 the original rules would have set 1000 ppm limit two years earlier in 2010 emission controls california has in general led the nation in imposing more stringent requirements on diesel engines in addition the ports of angeles and long beach have developed procedures to require that trucks serving the ports will be replaced by newer lessemitting models according to description of the ports plan all pre1989 trucks will be barred from entering the ports terminals beginning oct 1 2008 effective jan 1 2010 all 19891993 trucks and any 19942003 trucks without certified pollution control equipment will be banned by jan 1 2012 all trucks entering the port must meet the 2007 federal standard for heavyduty diesel trucks 16 continued sulfur content of fuel the committee approved somewhat more stringent limits on nox emissions according to the article the proposed amendments will now be circulated among imo members for comment before final adoption at the next marine environment protection committee meeting in october according to spokeswoman it is extremely unlikely any changes will be made at this point the imo spokeswoman added 17 pacific merchant marine assn v goldstene 517 f3d 1108 9th cir 2008 the court held that the states marine vessel rules were preempted by the federal clean air act because the regulations set emission standards for marine engines without california having received waiver from epa to do so california has since asked epa for waiver to enforce the original rules in addition to developing the rules applying only to fuels see california air board seeks federal waiver to enforce ship auxiliary engine rules daily environment report may 13 2008 p a1 crs8 35 gate fee for each 20foot container unit that passes through the port will generate funds to help underwrite subsidies to upgrade and replace trucks18 in addition carb has adopted regulations for harbor craft including ferries tugboats and tow boats which will require the replacement of unregulated engines beginning in 2009 and will accelerate the adoption of epas category 1 and category 2 marine engine pollution controls these rules are still undergoing public comment prior to final approval19 alternative power in june 2004 the port of angeles opened the worlds first alternative maritime power amp terminal for container ships where cargo ships can plug in to power instead of operating auxiliary engines to generate electricity while at berth the electrification project was the result of lawsuit brought by the natural resources defense council and other groups who sued the city claiming it failed to fully weigh air quality and other environmental impacts of the new container terminal as result of the suit state appeals court halted work on the terminal in october 2002 and angeles subsequently agreed to electrify the terminal to cut diesel emissions while ships are at docks among other measures20 second terminal was outfitted with amp capability in 2005 to encourage shippers to use the amp facilities in december 2004 the angeles board of harbor commissioners passed policy resolution to help each existing port customer underwrite the cost of building or retrofitting their first container or cruise ship to run on electrical power when docked cost estimated at 320000 830000 per vessel21 cruise ship terminals in san francisco and seattle are also implementing amp and carb is in the process of drafting regulations to require the use of amp at six of the states ports22 grants carb the port of angeles and the south coast air quality management district are also providing substantial amounts of financial support for the replacement of

container fee the grants will cover up to 80 of new truck cost conclusion as pollution from cars trucks and landbased stationary sources has been more tightly controlled over the last 40 years the contribution of ships and port operations to air pollution in port cities has become more important simultaneously foreign trade has grown dramatically adding to the burden of pollution from these sources thus pollution from ships and the port operations that serve them is now among the most important sources of sulfur oxides nitrogen oxides particulates and other pollutants in numerous us cities controlling these sources of pollution is complicated by the fact that most oceangoing ships are registered in foreign countries thus initial efforts at control were focused on international negotiations through the imo which established basic structure marpol annex vi that may be the basis of more stringent future controls negotiating ratifying and implementing marpol agreements is time consuming however and thus far has not resulted in more than token levels of regulation thus epa and state and local agencies particularly those in california have begun to address pollution from ships using the clean air act and comparable state authorities not all pollution from marine vessels comes from foreign ships smaller craft such as ferries tugboats and fishing boats do tend to be registered in the united states and are thus more amenable to control even for these smaller craft the technical issues can be complex as the vessels include wide variety of engine sizes and ship configurations safety also poses important considerations as ships must be able to depend on their sources of power in what may be extreme weather conditions and while dealing with variety of navigational hazards because ships and port operations are now such significant sources of air pollution further regulatory and legislative efforts to control their emissions are likely in addition ships are large and growing source of greenhouse gas emissions how and whether to regulate these emissions are the subject of imo discussions and may enter into the larger debate over legislation to address climate change congress has begun efforts to address these problems and enacted legislation to implement marpol annex vi in july 2008 but this is likely to be just the start of congressional attention to air pollution from ships action at the state level in the courts and at us epa will continue to bring the issue to congresss attention with numerous opportunities for oversight and legislation 23 see carb emissions reduction plan for ports and goods movement in california update on implementation staff presentation air resources board meeting oakland ca april 24 2008 at
