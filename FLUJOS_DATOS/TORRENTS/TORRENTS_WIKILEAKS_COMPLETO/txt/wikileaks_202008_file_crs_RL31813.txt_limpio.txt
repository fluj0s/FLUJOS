needle exchange whether to continue needle exchange program funded with federal or district funds is one of several key policy issues that congress will likely consider when reviewing the districts appropriations for fy2004 the controversy surrounding funding needle exchange program touches on issues of home rule public health policy and government sanctioning and facilitating the use of illegal drugs proponents of needle exchange program contend that such programs reduce the spread of hiv among illegal drug users by reducing the incidence of shared needles opponents of these efforts contend that such programs amount to the government sanctioning illegal drugs by supplying drugaddicted persons with the tools to use them in addition they contend that public health concerns raised about the spread of aids and hiv through shared contaminated needles should be addressed through drug treatment and rehabilitation programs another view in the debate focuses on the issue of home rule and the citys ability to use local funds to institute such programs free from congressional actions crs16 the prohibition on the use of federal and district funds for needle exchange program was first approved by congress as section 170 of the district of columbia appropriations act for fy1999 pl 105277 the 1999 act did allow private funding of needle exchange programs the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2001 pl 106522 continued the prohibition on the use of federal and district funds for needle exchange program and it restricted where privately funded needle exchange activities could take place section 150 of the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2001 made it unlawful to distribute any needle or syringe for the hypodermic injection of any illegal drug in any area in the city that is within 1000 feet of public elementary or secondary school including any public charter school the provision was deleted during congressional consideration and passage of the district of columbia appropriations act of fy2002 pl 10796 the act also included provision that allows the use of private funds for needle exchange program but it prohibits the use of both district and federal funds for such activities at present one entity prevention works private nonprofit aids awareness and education program operates privately funded needle exchange program the fy2002 district of columbia appropriations act requires such entities to track and account for the use of public and private funds district officials were seeking to lift the prohibition on the use of district funds for needle exchange programs the house version of hr 2765 however included provision that continued to prohibit the use of both district and federal funds for needle exchange programs the house version of the bill would allow the use of private funds for needle exchange programs and would require private and public entities that receive federal or district funds in support of other activities or programs to account for the needle exchange funds separately the senate version of the bill proposed prohibiting only the use of federal funds for needle exchange program and allowing the use of district funds the conference bill hr 2673 reflects the house position prohibiting the use of both federal and local funding for needle exchange program but allowing the use of private funds medical marijuana the medical marijuana initiative provision in the district of columbia appropriations legislation is another issue that engenders controversy the district of columbia appropriations act for fy1999 pl 105277 included provision that prohibited the city from counting ballots of voterapproved initiative that would have allowed the medical use of marijuana to assist persons suffering debilitating health conditions and diseases including cancer and hiv infection congresss power to prohibit the counting of medical marijuana ballot initiative was challenged in suit filed by the dc chapter of the american civil liberties union aclu on september 17 1999 district court judge richard roberts ruled that congress despite its unique legislative responsibility for the district under article i section 8 of the constitution did not possess the power to stifle or prevent political speech which included the ballot initiative2 this ruling 2 turner v district of columbia board of elections and ethics 982634 civ ddc continued crs17 allowed the city to tally the votes on the november 1998 ballot initiative to prevent the implementation of the initiative congress had 30 days to pass resolution of disapproval from the date the medical marijuana ballot initiative initiative 59 was certified by the board of elections and ethics language prohibiting the implementation of the initiative was included in pl 106113 the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2000 opponents of the provision contend that such congressional actions undercut the concept of home rule the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2002 pl 10796 includes provision that continues to prohibit the district government from implementing the initiative congresss power to block the implementation of the initiative was again challenged in the courts on december 18 2001 two groups the marijuana policy project and medical marijuana initiative committee filed suit in us district court seeking injunctive relief in an effort to put medical marijuana initiative on the november 2002 ballot the districts board of elections and ethics ruled that congressional rider that has been included in the general provisions of each district appropriations act since 1998 prohibits it from using public funds to do preliminary work that would put the initiative on the ballot on march 28 2002 us district court judge ruled that the congressional ban on the use of public funds to put such ballot initiative before the voters was unconstitutional3 the judge stated that the effect of the amendment was to restrict the plaintiffs first amendment rights to engage in political speech the decision was appealed by the justice department and on september 19 2002 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit reversed the ruling of the lower court without comment the appeals court issued its ruling on september 19 2002 which was the deadline for printing ballots of the november 2002 general election the house senate and conference bills include provision that continues the prohibition against the implementation of the medical marijuana ballot initiative abortion provision the public funding of abortion services for district of columbia residents is perennial issue debated by congress during its annual deliberations on district of columbia appropriations district officials cite the prohibition on the use of district funds as another example of congressional intrusion into local matters the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2002 pl 10796 included provision prohibiting the use of federal or district funds for abortion services except in cases where the life of the mother is endangered or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest this prohibition has been in place since 1995 when congress approved the district of columbia appropriations act for fy1996 pl 104134 2 continued sept 17 1999 memorandum opinion 3 marijuana policy project v district of columbia board of elections and ethics 01 2595 civ ddc mar 28 2002 memorandum opinion order and judgement the district courts ruling was reversed on appeal by the united states court of appeals district of columbia circuit the court ruled without comment crs18 since 1979 with the passage of the district of columbia appropriations act of 1980 pl 9693 congress has placed some limitation or prohibition on the use of public funds for abortion services for district residents from 1979 to 1988 congress restricted the use of federal funds for abortion services to cases where the mothers life would be endangered or the pregnancy resulted from rape and incest the district was free to use district funds for abortion services when congress passed the district of columbia appropriations act for fy1989 pl 100462 it restricted the use of district and federal funds for abortion services to cases where the mothers life would be endangered if the pregnancy were taken to term the inclusion of district funds and the elimination of rape or incest as qualifying conditions for public funding of abortion services was endorsed by president reagan who threatened to veto the districts appropriations act if the abortion provision was not modified4 in 1989 president bush twice vetoed the districts fy1990 appropriations act over the abortion issue he signed pl 101168 after insisting that congress include language prohibiting the use of district revenues to pay for abortion services except in cases where the mothers life was endangered5 the district successfully fought for the removal of the provision limiting district funding of abortion services when congress considered and passed the district of columbia appropriations act for fy1994 pl 103127 the fy1994 act also reinstated rape and incest as qualifying circumstances allowing for the public funding of abortion services the districts success was shortlived the district of columbia appropriations act for fy1996 pl 104134 and subsequent district of columbia appropriations acts limited the use of district and federal funds for abortion services to cases where the mothers life is endangered or cases where the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest the house senate and conference bills would continue to restrict the use of district and federal funds for abortion services except in cases of rape or incest or when the life of the mother is endangered this is consistent with provisions included in the house and senate versions of the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2003 pl 1087

transporting students to special education facilities and in the timely evaluation of students who may have special needs delays in the period between students referral and assessment increase the number of students placed in private educational institutions which adds to the cost of special education concern about the cost of these delays prompted congress to include provision in the district

was 60 per hour and case ceiling of 1560 and the fy2001 rate was 125 per hour with case ceiling of 2500 the districts fy2002 appropriations act lifted the ceiling in part in response to the argument
