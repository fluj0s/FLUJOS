their beginnings shortly after world war ii when the united states government responded to the potential spread of communism in postwar europe by providing aid to vulnerable populations and governments for reconstruction and economic development beginning in 1947 when great br itain could longer afford to support governments in greece and turkey the united states stepped in with economic assistance to stabilize those two governments and prevent communism from taking hold soon thereafter the marshall plan from 1948 to 1951 provided total of 133 billion for economic recovery support to 16 western european countries to bolster their governments stem the spread of communism to those european countries and strengthen potential trade capabilities over the years since the marshall plan underlying reasons for us foreign assistance have varied in response to world events after the marshall plan ended us assistance focused on southeast asia to counter soviet and chinese influence under president kennedy with the alliance for progress program in latin america and assistance to newly independent states in africa foreign aid rose to its highest historic amount measured as percentage of national income since the marshall plan aid spending leveled off in the 1970s even with spending for middle east peace initiatives and then rose again in the 1980s to address famine in africa continuing peace efforts in the middle east and the us response to insurgencies in central america the 1990s saw us aid fall to its lowest level averaging approximately 014 of national income partly due to the end of the anticommunism rationale for us foreign assistance with the end of the cold war after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the bush administration elevated the significance of foreign assistance as foreign policy tool president george w bush elevated global development as third pillar of national security with defense and diplomacy as articulated in the us national security strategy of 2002 and reiterated in 2006 in the fy2009 budget request the bush administration reiterated the importance of the department of state and us agency for international development usa id by saying that the fy2009 budget reflects the critical role of the department of state and the us agency for international development in implementing the national security strategy 1 at the same time that foreign aid is being recognized as playing an important role in us foreign policy and national security it also is coming under closer scrutiny by congress largely in response to number

while many today say that the f process was an important first step in coordination of us foreign assistance several criticisms have surfaced some say that the f bureau covers only those aid programs controlled by the department of state and usaid with mention of coordinating the other numerous agencies involved with foreign aid others claim that congress was not involved in shaping the f process many assert that the process does not incorporate leveraging us assistance to multilateral organizations some commentators also criticize the f process for emphasizing washington decisionmaking over relying on expertise in the field beyond the f process in particular many foreign aid experts perceive number of ongoing problems with the overall organization effectiveness and management of us foreign aid that they believe need to be reformed problems most commonly cited include the lack of national foreign assistance strategy failure to elevate the importance and funding of foreign aid to

in general congress has the responsibility to authorize appropriate funds for and oversee us foreign aid programs and related activities most appropriations for foreign aid are located in the provisions of annual foreign operations appropriations acts which often have been combined with appropriations for related expenditures such as department of state diplomatic programs and export financing the department of stat foreign operations and related programs appropriations act 2008 division j of pl 110161 as extended by the continuing appropriations resolution contained in pl 110 329 contains the most recent set of foreign aid appropriations provisions although congress has passed regular legislation appropriating funds for foreign aid it has not passed annual foreign aid authorization legislation since 1985 5 instead of independent authorization legislation congress provides its guidance for us foreign aid activities through earmarks and other directives dictating or limiting uses of funds included in the yearly foreign operations appropriations acts6 congress has nonetheless passed number of acts providing new authorizations for foreign assistance programs since 1985 including the freedom for russia and emerging eurasian democracies and open markets support act of 1992 freedom support act pl 102511 the sup port for east european democracy seed act of 1989 pl 101179 the millennium challenge act of 2003 division d of pl 108199 and recent security assistance acts for 2002 2000 and 1999 division b of pl 107228 pl 106280 title xii of hr 3427 enacted by reference in pl 106113 respectively congress has undertaken reform of foreign assistance at various points since the authorization of the marshall plan through the economic cooperation act in 1948 after the marshall plan ended in 1951 congress passed the mutual security act of 1951 which coordinated military and economic assistance with technical assistance programs the mutual security act of 1954 and its 1957 revisions contained the concepts of security and development assistance and instituted authority central to providing loans to developing countries these acts however did not create longterm structure for us foreign assistance the historic passage of the foreign assistance act of 1961 faa provided the legislative vehicle for the core organization of us foreign assistance that remains in effect to this day the successful reform effort that resulted in passage and implementation of the faa enjoyed both the ardent advocacy 4 much of the information in this section is located

military sales act amendments 1971 pl 91672 prohibit expenditure of funds appropriated for foreign aid without having been duly authorized to fund foreign aid without authorization therefore annual foreign operations appropriations acts contain provision similar to section 653 of the 2008 foreign operations appropriations act which allows funds appropriated under the act to be expended

solid support of congress congress passed the legislation in the first year of the kennedy administration this effort represents the most farreaching and longlasting reform of us foreign aid as the faa originally organized disparate us foreign aid ef forts into coherent whole and authorized the president choose an agency to implement the provisions of faa in november 1961 president kennedy created via executive order the agency for international development which later came to be known as usaid 7 the most recent successful major overhaul of foreign aid and the faa occurred in 1973 when congress passed the foreign assistance act of 1973 pl 93189 this act restructured development aid programs shifting emphasis fr om topdown approach concentrating on aid to governments to develop infrastructure and fund large development projects to basic human needs strategy that directly targeted the poorer segments of the population in developing countries it reorganized foreign assistance into sectors including agriculture education and population and certain development activities such as energy and environment administrations have undertaken numerous other foreign aid reform attempts over the years receiving various degrees of congressional support in 1969 president nixon formed the task force on international development chaired by rudolph peterson the peterson commission which was made up of private individuals examined us foreign assistance as whole and made recommendations in 1970 which were turned into legislation proposed by the administration congress did not support this legislation however and instead focused on passage of the 1973 reforms discussed above in 1977 senator hubert humphrey pushed legislation to elevate the importance of development in us foreign policy and to coordinate the efforts of the multitude of government agencies involved in foreign assistance the proposal did not become law but in 1979 president carter created an overarching agency for foreign assistance coordination called the international development cooperation agency idca base d on humphreys ideas the idca was under resourced from the outset and the reagan administration effectively abandoned the idca providing staff to the organization the idca ultimately failed to effectively coordinate aid authorized under the faa the executive order that created the entity was not rescinded however and the idca remained dormant part of the foreign assistance structure until it was abolished in 1999 8 in his first term president reagan formed the commission on security and economic assistance chaired by deputy secretary of defense frank carl ucci to examine the role of security aid in relation to development assistance the dissatisfaction of both congress and the executive branch with foreign aid programs and the distrust concer ning foreign aid between the two although the carlucci commission issued recommendations in 1983 the effort did not lead to legislation in 1987 the house foreign affairs committee appointed representatives lee hamilton and ben gilman to lead an effort to rewrite foreign as sistance law to reflect new international political realities and to define core objectives of us foreign aid the hamiltongilman task force also sought to simplify foreign aid legislation and remove the maze of congressional restrictions on 7

would improve congressional attitudes toward foreign aid programs and congressionalexecutive relations regarding cooperation on foreign aid the committee endorsed the legislation incorporating the task forces recommendations but representative gilman and other members disagreed with many of the measures suggested and the effort did not result in substantive reforms president clinton appointed deputy secretary of state clifford wharton to head review of foreign aid that would restructure aid after the cold war and reform usaid wharton resigned before his report was released but the clinton administration introduced legislation based on the report in late 1993 the peace prosperity and democracy act hr 3765 103rd congress s 1856 103rd congress however did not move forward after being introduced in the senate and the administration did not resubmit the bill after the republicans took control of congress in 1994 later the clinton administration proposed reorganization of foreign affairs functions that included retaining usaid as an independent agency but placing usaid under the direct authority of the secretary of state congress passed the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of 1998 division g of pl 105277 which contained the provisions extending the secretary of states authority over usaid the secretary of state subsequently delegated authority to the

renewed vigor in the debate on foreign aid policy and structure has surfaced in post 911 years regarding foreign aids role in meeting us foreign policy and national security goals as result several studies have been published since 2001 that have called for reform to improve the foreign aid structure in washington and aid effectiveness in the field to this end these studies have heightened congressional interest in and encouraged reexamination of us foreign assistance policies programs funding and organizational structure the 14 studies assessed in this report are often referred to in aid reform discussions and deal primarily with foreign aid reform issues they include books senate committee reports thinktank studies ngo reports and journal articles most of the studies considered

faa as amended pl 87195 contains multitude of goals and outdated priorities and directives many of which have been appended piecemeal to the original act in addition congress has enacted over 20 other pieces of legislation establishing foreign aid authorities outside the faa adding to the diffusion of aid responsibility and initiatives within us foreign policy overall several of the studies claim that the faa needs to be rewritten in order to streamline and add coherence to piece of legislation that has been amended frequently since its enactment nearly 50 years ago recommendations calling for rewriting the faa include stripping foreign aid legislation of fragmentary earmarks aid restrictions and aid procurement rules refocusing aid on the core mission of poverty reduction and restructuring aid legislation to set development goals based not on outdated cold warera policy but instead on the realities facing the united states in post 911 environment the oxfam study smart development why us foreign aid demands major reform specifically cites the need for effective congressionalexecutive cooperation to accomplish rewriting the faa itself modernizing foreign assistance for the 21 st century an agenda for the next us president the study from the center for global development calls for renewing the congressionalexecutive relationship in foreign aid policy implementation by passing foreign aid legislation that provides substantially greater flexibility to the executive branch for aid delivery and development activities while at the same time beefing up accountability of the executive branch to congress via enhanced realtime oversight mechanisms while these studies acknowledge the need for changes to the faa however they also agree that full rewrite of the act would be very difficult to accomplish

the 2006 us national security strategy endorses raising the importance of international economic development within overall us foreign policy and national security development reinforces diplomacy and defense reducing longterm threats to our national security by helping to build stable prosperous and peaceful societies 10 many commentators have taken up this newly iterated support for development to create the socalled 3d or three pillars approach to national security with development elevated to equal partner status with defense and diplomacy majority of the studies directly recommend the establishment of coequal status for development alongside defense and diplomacy in the us national security framework certain studies emphasize that the government must reorganize the international affairs functions of the government to prioritize development as principal instrument of national security not just as secondary tool to reinforce defense and diplomacy 9 appendix provides more

us foreign assistance policy is not currently based on any unified national strategy document strategy that encompasses all foreign aid activities and guides the decisions of us policy makers would provide much needed coherence to the currently fragmented system of foreign assistance and would help link us foreign assistance with us foreign policy goals several studies argue some of the studies suggest that such national foreign assistance strategy could explain and integrate foreign aid goals to strengthen us national security by mitigating poverty and desperation that often leads to instability and conf lict and to fulfill moral obligation to assist those in need by providing humanitarian aid nd encouraging longterm overseas development the csis study integrating 21 st century development and security assistance recommends an overall crossagency strategy for security assistance in particular to ensure proper distribution of authorities and responsibilities among defense and civilian actors and the oxfam study calls for national development strategy that would balance shortterm political and security goals with longterm development goals some of these studies place importance on national strategies that focus not just on foreign aid coherence but also on utilizing such policy coherence to meet the previously discussed goal of elevating development within overall us foreign policy and national security the cge study smart power building better safer worlda policy framework for presidential candidates for instance links creation of coherent foreig n assistance strategy with the institution of an overall national security strategy that fully integrates development with diplomacy economic policy defense and intelligence

shortfalls in managing foreign aid most of the documents considered in this report call for better integration of government actors involved in providing foreign assistance in her testimony before the subcommittee on state foreign operations and related programs of the house appropriations committee lael brainard of the brookings institution has asserted instead of the current spread of 50 offices managing aid we should have one capable operational agency half of the studies call specifically for new cabinetlevel agency to achieve this integration and ensure the importance of foreign assistance in relation to other foreign policy priorities the joint brookingscsis study security by other means foreign assistance global poverty and american leadership for example argues that new cabinetlevel department of global development is the only organizational reform that will meet the challenges facing the us foreign assistance structure including ensuring coherent policy increasing aid effectiveness and integrating foreign aid actors across the us government cabinetlevel department for foreign assistance could also encourage balance between shortterm political and security goals and longterm development objectives the oxfam study suggests it argues that new department with the requisite stature would not be overrun by state and defense department interests

recommendations concerning the authority of the state department in relation to dod regarding security assistance both committee reports support the state departments primary authority for function 150 and 050 foreign assistance these reports also state that authority for the security assistance budget including security assistance provided under section 1206 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 pl 109163 should remain with the state department with the dod responsible only for implementation of security assistance policy and programs in limited areas

requests to congress for security assistance that are inadequate to meet policy implementation goals 11 the state working group study recommends that it should have the lead authority regarding

of the f process including fear that the f bureau concentrates too much power within the state department and cr eates washingtonfocused nontransparent top down foreign aid structure despite these perceived shortcomings the article claims that the alternatives to the f process are even less attractive among other negative consequences restoring independent status to usaid would simply reinvigorate past usaidstate department clashes over foreign assistance and new cabinetlevel foreign assistance department would weaken foreign assistance overall because it would place foreign assistance in direct policy battles with the state and defense departments both of which would likely remain stronger than the new foreign assistance department the adams article calls for improvement of the f process through increasing the importance of the dfa which it argues should be elevated to second deputy secretary of state position continuing to establish capabilities within usaid and the regional bureaus within the state department to increase f process effectiveness and requiring f to link resource needs to strategic goals in the longterm the three studies generally commend the institution of the f process and call for the process to extend its authority to include all us foreign assistance actors programs and policies not currently covered these changes would promote better

us government and among foreign aid experts that overall capacity to carry out foreign assistance programs is compromised due to underfunded and understaffed civilian aid agencies all of the studies called for an increase in resources for civilian agencies involved in foreign assistance often as means to effecting other reforms some of the studies focus on the steep decline in personnel expertise and capabilities of usaid in recent years and the reliance on outsourcing stabilization and reconstruction program implementation through megacontracts with private contractors they claim that increasing resources in usaid and other civilian agencies to increase expert institutional capability within government to meet foreign assistance challenges certain recommendations call for employment of socalled smart power which would make foreign assistance provided through civilian agencies central to national security strategy requiring greater funding than is currently provided others cite the increasing role and authority of the department of defense in provision of foreign assistance and contend that responsibility for such assistance should be returned to civilian agencies with enhanced capabilities these recommendations focus on increasing capacity and capability in the civilian foreign assistance agencies through funding for personnel increases training and

stabilization and economic sanctions policy to create seamless web of engagement with foreign countries that prevents us government actors from implementing individual foreign assistance programs in

feedback from the field in forming foreign aid policy four of the studies recommend increased input from the field concerning foreign assistance arguing that policy formulation under the f process is centered too much in washington one study calls for creating systematic routinized structure of engagement between washington and foreign assistance actors in the field this structure would be based in th regional bureaus and country desks within the state department which would increase their foreign aid programming and budgeting expertise in order to properly evaluate and set aid priorities

current system of aid funding because it is based on restrictive funding categories that limit longterm development programs for developing countries instead of providing aid based on shortterm political objectives which results in disproportionate percentage of aid being allocated to middleincome countries aid recipient country needs should drive aid allocation majority of studies say many of these recommendations would place greater reliance on the unique circumstances of each country receiving aid assistance they argue should be tailored to fit the individual needs of each country

the george w bush administration through emergency supplemental appropriations four of the studies call for multiyear budgeting for foreign assistance that supports longrange strategic foreign assistance goals longerterm budgeting some argue would bring several benefits it would ensure that an administration would define resource requirements for foreign assistance and align them with strategy and policy it would provide aid predictability to both us foreign assistance agencies and recipient countries and it would balance longterm aid provided to countries in need of development with aid to co untries with immediate humanitarian needs one study suggests that this longrange budgeting process should be mandated by the president and executed by the director of foreign assistance at the state department through the f process in cooperation with the national security council and the office of management and budget another calls for such multiyear budgeting to reside within formal quadrennial foreign assistance review which would encourage improvement of foreign assistance strategy with long range budgeting as key component in general these four studies argue that

assistance have described an overemphasis on shortterm assistance goals that detracts from the ability of the us government to undertake and sustain effective longterm development programs several of

report from the oecd in 2005 development assistance committee peer review of the united states explains that the us official development assistance oda to multilateral organizations had fallen significantly as percentage of total us oda two studies recommend an increase in funding for and participation in multilateral institutions that provide foreign assistance and call for multilateral forms of aid to rise in priority within us foreign assistance strategy these studies claim the united states is missing prime opportunity to shape global foreign assistance activities and strategies as it wields more influence than any other country in multilateral institutions and encourages greater aid contributions from other countries through its participation in such institutions they state that the united states can better leverage the effectiveness of its foreign assistance funds by utilizing existing aid delivery and system capacity possessed by multilateral organizations and by pooling funds with other donor nations one study suggests that increased us participation in multilateral aid organizations would reduce the burden on recipient countries of meeting different aid

foreign policy experts view us foreign assistance as valuable activity that addresses many important policy goals including alleviating poverty and hunger overseas acquiring sense of self worth by the american people attaining favorable image around the world and promoting broader us foreign policy and national security goals while the 14 studies surveyed by crs emphasize different aspects of the importance of us foreign assistance all agree that foreign assistance must be reformed to improve its effectiveness only one of the recommendation categoriesenhancing civilian agency resourceshas the support of all of the studies covered in this report the next two mostoften cited recommendations are 1 raising development to equal status with diplomacy and defense 2 increasing the emphasis of us foreign aid to be more needsbased with recipient governments taking ownership of both identifying needs and taking responsibility for using aid to meet them while these 14 studies do not heavily dwell on dods growing role in us foreign assistance many of them refer to that issue which some see as an undesirable militarization of foreign aid the role of congress in foreign aid should expand according to half of the studies reviewed in addition to holding more foreign aid hearings holding them earlier in the legislative process and conducting greater oversight to encourage more effective coordination of policy and programming some say congress should beco involved early in the budget process negotiating with the executive branch on funding levels before the budget arrives on capitol hill early each year some of the recommendations can be carried out by the executive branch with little or congressional involvement such as establishing national foreign aid strategy building on the f process emphasizing needsbased aid and monitoring aid impact most however would require congressional action for example rewriting faa creating cabinet level department for foreign aid enhancing resources to civilian agencies creating unified budget increasing multilateral aid among other options would all require legislation some of the recommendation costs could become burdensome such as creating cabinetlevel department for foreign assistance others could have minimal costs such as increasing field versus dc input and some recommendations such as creating unified budget and improving agency coordination could result in savings still other recommendations could encourage greater aid effectiveness such as monitoring aid impact balancing longterm versus shortterm aid increasing needsdriven aid and local ownership of aid programs and multiyear funding since these studies were written for the purpose of making recommendations to reform us foreign aid it is not surprising that none of them recommend maintaining the status quo the 111 th congress may consider the wide array of foreign aid reform possibilities and decide which path it thinks us foreign aid should take it should be noted however that given the current economic environment and budget constraints along with the numerous other major concerns such as two wars health care energy policy and global warming some members in the 111th congress may prefer continuation of the existing foreign aid structure with minor modifications and increased or adjusted resources where possible

mr adams distinguished fellow with the henry l stimson center writes that establishing the f bureau is good and should be built upon adams identifies some concerns about the f process including that 1 regional desk officers are concerned that aid funding they hope for would go somewhere else 2 embassies feel left out of the process and demand greater transparency 3 usaid worries that development funds would migrate to different strategic purposes in the department of state 4 everyone feels f bureaus creation was rushed the system is too top down and transparency is inadequate and 5 the relevant committees in congress believe that they were not consulted early on in the creation of the f bureau and have had to figure out how the new structure fit the budget accounts established by legislation he critiques some recommendations of others fo r example he states that reviving and beefing up usaid would just take us back to those days when usaid and state bickered on regular basis one side doesnt understand development the other side doesnt understand strategic purposes he writes in addition cabinetleve l department of development would worsen the problem by elevating disputes about assistance to senior policymakers with state and defense likely to carry more weightthe new agency would further disperse the civilian tools of our overseas engagement as more entities vie to have input on policy direction and control resources and foreign aid programs that have or only partial development component such as economic support funds esf targeted assistance to the former soviet union counternarcotics programs counterterrorism hivaids prevention and treatment and peacekeeping training furthermore development assistance does not have the heft and popularity among constituents and us taxpayers the result of creating separate department could be the exact opposite of the goala dwindling away of development assistance ra ther that its growth according to adams the author asserts that implementing reform could lead us backward and lead instead to enhancing the role of the dod in delivering foreign assistance he says there is need for more integrated longterm strategic vision for our diplomacy and foreign assistance his recommendations follow the state departments best option is to build on f state and usaid need to focus on making the process work better by assigning personnel who think strategically to the office of civil and foreign service and give them training in planning budgeting and program management and evaluation there needs to be structured systematic engagement between washington and the field with regional bureaus and country desks exercising their skills in programming and budgeting to review requests and set priorities

87 6 novemberdecember 2008 pp 123132 this journal article by three former usaid admini strators argues that while us foreign aid has increased from 10 billion in 2000 to 22 billion in 2008 the organizational structure and statutes governing us foreign aid policy have become chaotic and incoherent due to 20 years of neglect the article emphasizes the need to either create cabinetlevel agency for us foreign aid or restore usaids autonomy either measure would afford greater stature to the us foreign assistance structure in order to influence us trade investment and environmental policy and budgetary independence woven throughout the article suggests possibly using the provisions of the millennium challenge act of 2003 as basis for broader aid eligibility provisions and rewriting the foreign assistance act of 1961 as it is cold war artifact that has become obsolete there is value in having development raised to the level of defense and diplomacy which the bush administration did theoretically but not in practice creating cabinetlevel agency for development or recreating such stature in usaid via increased authority and resources giving usaid the authority to devise overall strategy on humanitarian and development assistance and coordinate activities of other agencies increasing field office input rather than centralizing aid programs in washington will improve effectiveness of aid programs

requiring the use of soft power and foreign assistance to meet the security challenges facing the country the foreign assistance structure however lacks effectiveness due to fragmentation and incoherence according to the author despite massive increases in overall foreign assistance funding largely due to the wars and reconstruction in iraq and afghanistan in this last chapter the brookingscsis task force makes several recommendations to create unified framework for us foreign assistance and to organize it for effectiveness it first calls for unified framework that combines two concepts of foreign assistance across pertinent government actors policy and aid delivery 1 so ft power tool to meet diplomatic and strategic ends and 2 development tool allocated according to policy effectiveness and human needs this framework would integrate different types of assistanceincluding aid to deal with security threats development goals humanitarian needs and transnational threats such as the global hivaids epidemicto ensure that they are not implemented in isolation but are provided as coherent whole tailored to the needs and objectives in each recipient country necessary support for repressive regimes in order to combat security threats would be integrated within comprehensive country assistance package that also addresses economic and political issues foreign assistance policy and programs would be carried out through coordinated interagency action with fully funded and operational office of the coordinator for stability and reconstruction and an engaged national security council leading the multiagency effort under the framework congress would integrate its committees that deal with the armed forces and foreign aid through joint hearings and other vehicles to allow for coherent policy and funding it would also extend oversight over foreign assistance programs in exchange for greater flexibility for state dod and usaid to adapt aid to changing conditions in the field the book next provides recommendations for improving effectiveness of us foreign assistance through better governmental organization of foreign assistance agencies and authorities and an effective executive branch relationship with congress the final chapter identifies six central challenges to organizing foreign assistance within the executive branch proliferation of standalone initiatives and foreign aid authority resting with over 50 separate government units requires rationalization of agencies improved coordination and mission clarification restructuring program design must be driven by objectives and needs not restrictive funding categories the united states must speak with one voice on foreign aid government must incentivize interagency cooperation and create seamless web of foreign assistance trade and investment technical assistance debt relief and financial stabilization for coherence across all policies affecting poor countries the united states must invest in core foreign assistance competencies including infrastructure and stabilization and reconstruction rather than relying on megacontracts with private companies that fail to draw on institutional knowledge and experience the united states must truly elevate development alongside defense and diplomacy this chapter lays out four possible options for reorganizing us foreign assistance improving coordination while retaining decentralization positioning usaid as an implementing arm of the

department for global development this chapter recommends creating new department as it is the only solution that can meet all the challenges identified for aid reform the task force argues congress pass annual foreign assistance authorization legislation instead of relying on narrow earmarks and tie detailed transparent appropriations to authorizations or recommendations from authorizing committees increasing flexibility for the use of appropriated funds by abolishing restrictive operating accounts restoring small presidential contingency fund and rationalizing the funds reprogramming process to make it accountable and efficient cgd center for global development modernizing foreign assistance for the 21 st century an agenda for the next us president march 2008 this article by the center for global development thinktank established in 2001 with mission to reduce global poverty and inequality states that the world has undergone significant changes since the postworld war ii era when modern foreign assistance programs first emerged as foreign policy tool it says that while the george w bush administration has taken several steps toward increasing foreign assistance funding and establishing new programs such as the presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar and the millennium challenge account mca these changes are not enough the author recommends that the next president develop national foreign assistance strategy that elevates global development as critical to our national interest and lay out the principal missions and mandates for foreign assistance reform the organizational structure by merging most foreign assistance programs and related development policy instruments into new cabinetlevel department and strengthen the organization by expanding and deepening the professional staff revamping delivery mechanisms and building serious monitoring and evaluation system rewrite the foreign assistance act of 1961 to streamline procurement rules earmarks and restrictions and to reestablish strong partnership between the executive branch and congress that allows greater flexibility to executive aid agencies provided there is greater accountability and responsiveness to congress place higher priority on multilateral channels of assistance and increase the quantity and improve the allocation of assistance because even with recent increases us foreign assistance is not great enough or unencumbered enough to meet our foreign policy goals the article goes on to assert that us foreign assistance can be strengthened by improving the allocation of funding the study says that typically 44 of us foreign assistance goes to just six countries all allies in the war on terror or the war on drugs the other 56 of us foreign aid goes to nearly 100 other countries according to the author one of the most striking patterns is that the united states provides 40 of its assistance to middleincome countries and just 34 to lowincome countries on average other donors do the reverse

better safer worlda policy framework for presidential candidates july 2007 this policy framework intended for presidential candidates asserts that the united states must work to build better safer world because us national security economic growth and moral leadership are directly tied to conditions in developing countries and countries in crisis the united states must employ an integrated smart power approach that would include all the tools of statecraft including diplomacy development economic policy defense and intelligence capabilities cge explains that the united states first must invest in the smart power approach which foremost involves increasing diplomacy and foreign assistance capacity and resources it asserts that current smaller investments in diplomacy and foreign assistance have already yielded important benefits and that with increased resources and capabilities these benefits would grow the smart power framework proposes that the united states use an improved diplomatic capacity to develop more highly integrated relationships with other countries and institutions to effectively meet challenges of development and security while at the same time placing the united states in strong position of leadership on these issues cultural and exchange programs as well as the peace corps should be expanded and cooperation with nongovernmental organizations ngos universities and the private sector should be strengthened cge recommendations that the administration reorganize national foreign policy that currently is not integrated and the pieces of which often either act at cross purposes or duplicate work authorize the president to develop national security strategy that integrates diplomacy development economic policy defense and intelligence capabilities an overall national security budget should reflect this new integration in yearly appropriations requests elevate development to the level of defense and diplomacy in policy priority and create coherent foreign assistance strategy under the control of new cabinetlevel department or other unifying innovation create flexible and agile diplomatic and foreign assistance corps that possess the language technical cultural and managerial skills needed to implement programs and build alliances effectively in the field restructure the foreign service to align and cooperate better with regional military commands increase foreign assistance funding to address stability in latent and postconflict states and other concerns including health education and democracybuilding streamline the foreign assistance bureaucracy to make it flexible and able to meet challenges and crises as they arise amendments to the foreign assistance act should be made to implement this goal align trade and agricultural subsidy policies with foreign assistance strategies to avoid conflicts and inefficiencies and institute quadrennial foreign assistance strategy review to articulate objectives and align them with budgets

defense involvement in the provision of foreign assistance specifically nontraditional security assistance including counterterrorism capacity building postconflict reconstruction and stabilization and humanitarian assistance the task force discusses dods authority to provide foreign assistance and the role of the new united states africa command africom in providing an opportunity for new approach to the militarys role in foreign assistance the report finds primarily that dods involvement in nontraditional security assistance has skyrocketed while the department of states and usaids abilities to provide foreign assistance have eroded the task force recommends an overall strategythat dod continue to provide assistance for shortterm contingency situations but that an overall crossagency strategy for security assistance be led by the state department namely fullyfunded coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization in the office of the secretary of state scrs with the dod role clearly defined and closely integrated into this overall strategy increased fundingas part of the overall strategy state and usaid capabilities would be built up through increased funding to

assistance reform beyond assistance december 7 2007 this bipartisan congressionally mandated commission interviewed many of the worlds foremost experts on foreign assistance not one person appeared before this commission to defend the status quo according to the report the commission states that it is in americas best interest to provide foreign aid but it says the us foreign assistance system is broken along with emphasizing longterm development as valuable objective the help commission recommends congress and the white house should work together to rewrite the foreign assistance act of 1961 reflecting new development goals and programs and aligning it with the post911 world more assistance targeted to private sectors in developing countries because business should be the engine of growth in the developing world new business model to engage new nongovernmental partnersus foreign aid should be conducted in concert with local private or public partners that are committed to development alignment of americas trade and development policies which often conflict for example countries that are eligible for millennium challenge corporation funding often pay more in tariffs than they receive in aid

the united states should improve monitoring and evaluation human resources and procurement and contracting capabilities of agencies involved with foreign aid to improve the effectiveness of taxpayer dollars also while the workload of foreign aid agencies has gone up the staff has been cut which hurts effectiveness of the programs reorganization of all us international affairs functions to elevate

half of their us assistance in the form of security assistance and section 1206 does not address immediate threats to the united states that cannot be included in the normal budget process therefore

the secretary of state explicit authority to ensure that all foreign aid is in the foreign policy interest of the united states the secretary of state working with the usaid administrator should garner the foreign assistance funds necessary to carry out the presidents strategy the secretary of state should provide strategic direction transparency and overall accountability to foreign

us development policy and should be strengthened and given resources to attract the worlds best development experts ambassadors should take responsibility for the implementation of the presidents foreign aid strategy making certain that assistance is balanced and spent effectively in coordination with the host country and other donors the president should continue to request and congress should continue to provide funding for security assistance in the foreign affairs budget with some implementation by dod foreign assistance functions and authorities should not be migrated to dod due
