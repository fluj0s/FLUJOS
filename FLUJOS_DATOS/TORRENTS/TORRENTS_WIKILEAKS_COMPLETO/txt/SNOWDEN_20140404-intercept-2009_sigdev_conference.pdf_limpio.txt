underpins so many other domains changes as rapidly agilely or fluidly or requires the application of diverse skill sets in mr ingliss words the need to understand and lay bare cyberspace is the stuff of sigdev it will underpin our success in this space the need for the offensive sigint and defensive information assurance realms to integrate was flagged as critical with mr inglis suggesting that the future may see the community talk about sigdev as cryptologic development given that increasingly sigdev is the necessary underpinning for the totality of what we do in cyberspace ufouo associate

time in sdc history this years conference included an entire oneday thread focused on the future technology threat the results of which will help us keep up with ever changing technology trends because of this success we will continue to offer narrowfocused threads in the upcoming conferences ssirel in another first for the 2009 conference the communications system analysis thread conducted four handson workshops that brought together analysts from various agencies to work some of the extended enterprises most challenging problems in one of the workshops facilitated session was dedicated to botnets this provided an opportunity to demonstrate some of the agencys most powerful analytic tools and an opportunity for exchange of information among the analysts in attendance the workshop also provided an opportunity to go over all the sigint tools and techniques that are used in the identification and processing of this malicious software generating possible new ways for identification and exploitation the workshops provided an excellent opportunity for our junior analysts to work side by side with some of the leading experts in this field our intentions next year are to push for more of these types of workshops ufouo the fiveeyes sigdev heads received detailed summaries of each threads outcomes and actions during the conference wrapup session postsdc momentum and activity is being maintained by thread leads and analytic tradecraft teams with quarterly updates on sdc efforts and actions to be provided to those fiveeyes sigdev heads this increased effort in postconference engagement is seen as key factor in living up to the sdc 2009 conference theme whereby fiveeyes sigdev elements will work to take sdc 2009 ideas and turn them into sigint outcomes ufouo
