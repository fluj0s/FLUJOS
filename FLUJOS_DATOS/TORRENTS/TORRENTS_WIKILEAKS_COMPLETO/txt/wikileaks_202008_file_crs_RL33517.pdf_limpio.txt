obtaining the support of both houses within 45 days of continuous session if denied congressional approval during this time period either by congress ignoring the presidential rescission request or because one or both houses rejected the proposed rescission the president has to make the f unding available to executive agencies for obligation and expenditure president george w bush had access to the item veto as governor of texas and has called repeatedly for similar authority for the president for example in his state of the union address on january 31 2006 he said we can tackle this problem

president than most other approaches that would m odify the ica framework in 1992 1993 and 1994 the house passed an exped ited rescission bill each year3 i n t h 1 0 2nd congress hr 2164 passed by the

accompanying draft bill for each appropriations subco mmittee having jurisdiction over accounts in given appropriations act from which resc issions were requested further hr 4600 would have authorized

appropriations act 2 rescission of any item in whol or part of direct spending or 3 repeal of targeted tax benefits the contents of the special message were specified including draft bill to approve the presidents request the lliva would grant the president considerable flexibility in the submission and packaging of the special messages there are time constraints and single message may include any number of rescissions further the lliva does not sti pulate that special message be confined to single public law therefore one message may encompass budget authority or items of direct spending fro m several laws any amounts re scinded must be used for deficit reduction within five days of enactment of rescission approval bill the chairmen of the budget committees w ould be required to

substantive revision and with or without recommendation if the reporting deadline were not met the committee would be automatically discharged from consideration of the bill and the bill would be

would allow the president to withhold any budget authority proposed for rescission for up to 180 days following transmittal of the special message likewise the presiden t could suspend the execution of any item of direct spending contained in speci message for 180 days the legislationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33517crs4 5 for further discussion of policy deferrals see crs issue brief ib89148 for further discussion of possible constituti onal issues see crs report rl33365 line item veto constitutional analysis of recent proposals by morton rosenberg would allow but not require the president to release the funds before the expiration of the 180 days the provisions allowing the president to withhold funds proposed for rescission or to suspend the execution of an item of direct spending for 180 days have not been previously seen in expedited rescission b ills supporters of these provisions contend that they would provide for temporar withholding or suspension until congress has chance to consider presidents request and that such mechanism is necessary so that congress would have the opportunity to act on presidents rescission proposal received just before an extended recess or period of adjournment others see these provisions as subject to abuse and unnecessary with the expedited procedures in lliva usually ensuring fi nal vote on the presidents request within month therefore in their view peri od considerably shorter than 180 days would suffice to give congress the opportunity to act on special message they also point out that there is nothing in the bill that would prohibit the president from initiating multiple 180day withholding periods critics of the 180day withholding mechan ism view the provisions as arguably sanctioning the return of po licy deferrals originally provi ded for in the ica subject to onehouse veto but invalidated by the ins v chadha 462 us 919 1983 and city of new haven v united states 809 f2d 900 dc cir 1987 decisions as well as the statutory provisions in pl 1001195 supporters of the 180day provision stress that this is the maximum period that the funding could be deferred and the bill language would allow the president to release the funds earlier if the president determines that continuati on of the deferral would not further the purposes of this act the language however would not requi re early release of funds even if one chamber voted to reject the approval bill language in the lliva states that its provisions are severable for purposes of judicial review this mean s that if court found portion of the measure to be unconstitutional the remainder of its pr ovisions would remain in force the act would become effective upon signing and would apply only to spending or tax provisions contained in bills enacted after its passage other expedited rescission bills in the 109th congress in addition to the administrations pr oposal the lliva hr 4890 s 2381 several other measures with expedited re scission provisions have been introduced in the 109th congress an omnibus budget refo rm measure hr 2290 introduced by representative jeb hensarling and others on may 11 2005 contains provisions for expedited rescission

rescission the pr esident could also propose to reduce the appropriate discreti onary spending limits for new budg et authority and outlays under the balanced budget and emergency defi cit control act of 1985 by an amount not exceeding the proposed rescission provi sions for the special message and accompanying draft approval bill are simila r to those in the lliva however hr 2290 would limit the president to just one message for each appropriations act unless the act included accounts falling with in the jurisdiction of more than one appropriations subcommittee in which case the president would send separate special message and accompanying draft b ill for accounts within the jurisdiction of each subcommittee6 representative mark udall has introduced three expedited rescission measures in the 109th congress7 the most recent of which hr 4699 was introduced on february 1 2006 the stated purpose of the bill the stimulating leadership in cutting expenditures act or slice act of 2006 is to enable the president to require congress to debate and vote on cer tain presidential proposals for reducing spending the provisions for special ssages and expedited procedures in hr 4699 would apply to any budget authority provi ded in an appropriations act or in pl 10959 119 stat 1144 the omnibus transporta tion authorization act as seen in previous measures the president could submit more than one special message and approval bill if the appropr iations act contained account s under the jurisdiction of more than one appropriati ons subcommittee for messa ges proposing rescission of

review act of 2006 on march 6 2006 this bill is simila r in coverage to the line item veto act of 1996 s 2372 would allow the pr esident to suspend and propose for cancellation 1 any dollar amount of discre tionary budget authority 2 any item of new direct spending and 3 any limited tax benefit not later than three calendar days after the date of enactment of the applicable law the president could submit special message proposing such cancellations and draft b ill for each item to be cancelled provisions for identifying limited tax benefits also reflect those in the 1996 law expedited procedures would seek to ensure vote on final passage of an approval bill by the close of the 10th legislative day following its introduction items proposed for cancellation in special ssage would be

budget committee senate reported the table also includes relevant provisions in the line item veto act of 1996 pl 104130 wh ich was overturned by th supreme court in 1998 as indicated in the table there are some noteworthy differences among the versions some features in hr 4890s 2381 as introduced have been modified inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33517crs7 11 although the bill uses the term single benefi ciary it defines the term in such way that it could be broader than single taxpayerthe houseapproved and senate budget committee bills to lessen the presidents flexibility for example the original bills had deadline for submission of special rescission messages and limit on the number of special messages the house passed version of hr 4890 w ould require submission of special messages within 45 calendar days of enactment of the w that contained the amountsprovisions proposed for cancellation s 3521 as orde red to be reporte d would allow the submission of special message up to one year following enactment further the senate budget committee version would limit the president to four special messages per calendar year whereas the housepassed version would set limit of five special messages per act or 10 for omnibus measures with respect to these features the housepassed version would be more permissive in terms of the total number of special messages whereas the senate bill would be more lenient in the timing of their submissions the period for withholding of funds af ter submission of special message is another feature on which the bills differ as introduced the lliva would allow the president to withhold funds for up to 180 calendar days despite any congressional action s 3521 would limit withholding to 45 calendar days as would the house passed version however th housepassed version would allow the president 45 day extension for total withholding period of up to 90 days in addition the lliva as introduced included sunset termination date whereas the house passed version provides that th expedited rescission author ity would expire after six years october 1 2012 and s 3521 as ordered to be reported sti pulates termination after four years december 31 2010 some changes in hr 4890 as passed by the house and in s 3521 as ordered to be reported may generate new concerns both versions appear to narrow the range of possible targeted tax benefits th at may be proposed for cancellation when compared to the administrations propos hr 4890s 2381 as introduced along with provisions in pl 104130 would have covered revenuelosing measures affecting 100 or fewer benefi ciaries the housepassed version of hr 4890 would apply only to revenuelosing provisi on affecting single beneficiary11 whereas s 3521 as ordered to be reported defines targeted tax benefits as affecting particular or limited group of taxpayers thereby pl acing its scope somewhere between the administrations proposal and the housepa ssed version also the senate budget committee version and the 1996 act would require the joint committee on taxation to identify the targeted tax benefits the housepassed version would require the chairmen of the ways and means and finance committees to identify such provisions the president could only propos rescission of such identified tax benefits hr 4890s 2381 as introduced would allow the president to propose any targeted tax benefit that he identified another change in the housepassed version of interest is its relationship to the impoundment control act of 1974 known as ica title x of pl 93344 the version approved by the house would re peal the ica except for section 1013 deferral authority for the president nd section 1016 suits by the comptrollerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33517crs8 12 us congress house committee on

approval there were further substantive changes to hr 4890 as amended during floor consideration managers amendm ent offered by representative paul ryan was adopted as part of the special rule for consideration however in response to apparent concerns raised by the house transportation and infrastructure committee the amendment added clarifying language that any amount can celled that came from trust fund or special fund would be retu rned to the fund from which it originally derived rather than revert to th general fund for deficit reduction12 with this exception all of the changes in hr 4890 as approved by the house occurred during committee markups with respect to s 3521 as ordered to be reported managers amendment offered by senator gregg at markup nd approved by voice vote made changes in title i regarding the legislative line item veto among other things13 in its current form the bill would prohibit the president from resubmitting items of direct spending or targeted tax benefits previously rejected by congress but would allow resubmission of proposed cancellations if congress fails to complete action on them due to adjournment the amendment so proposes to reduce the period during which the president may suspend new direct spending or targeted tax benefits if the cancellation proposal is submitted after th effective date of the provisions otherwise features included in table 1 under s 3521 as ordere d to be reported were unchanged from those in the bill as introduced some concluding thoughts the provisions for expedited consider ation of special messages from the president proposing rescissions of funds ve remained quite similar over the years various versions of expedited rescission bills pending in the 109th congress all seek to ensure vote on final passage of the approval bill within 10 days after its introduction in the chamber in the early 1990s there were bills with provisions to allow for consideration of substitute package of rescissions

of direct spending entitlements and limited or targeted tax benefits were added in the 109th congress hr 4699 would add certain tr ansportation projects to the universe of possible cancellations available to the president the lliva in all three versions considered here would grant the president among the most expansive scopes of coverage seen in an expedited rescission bill by encompassing rescission of any dollar amount of discretionary budget au thority or of any new item of direct spending the line item veto act of 1996 with its enhanced resci ssion framework was considered even by some of its supporters to have possible constitutional flaws and the measure contained provisions for expe dited judicial review in contrast observers tend to view the ex pedited rescission approach at least as applied to items of discretionary spending as passing muster on constitutional grounds the severability provision in the lliva creates further statutory insulation if one provision were to be found unconstitutional the remainde r of the act would not be affected for example if one type of can cellation such as target ed tax benefits were to be overturned the presidents authority to submit special rescission messages for expedited consideration cove ring items of discretionary budget authority or direct spending might conti nue to be available in considering prospects for further action on expedited rescission bills one might wish to keep in mind the continuing involvement of the bush administration in seeking enactment of some version of the lliva in the 109th congress on june 27 2006 after meeting with group of senato rs at the white house to discuss line item veto legislation the president calle d upon the senate to join the house and quickly pass the line item veto
