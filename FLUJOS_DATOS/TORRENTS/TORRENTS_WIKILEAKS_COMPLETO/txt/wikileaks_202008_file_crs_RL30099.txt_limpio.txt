congress appropriated 47 billion for programs of the department of veterans affairs va for fy2001 pl 106377 the administration requested 203 billion in discretionary funds for va medical care and congress approved that request 13 billion increase above the appropriated amount for fy2000 congress appropriated pl 10674 443 billion for fy2000 18 billion above the request for that year 17 billion of the difference was added to the va medical care budget recent legislative developments to facilitate floor action the house and senate veterans affairs committees often combine bills to reduce the number of bills reported three such bills were signed into law hr 4850 pl 106413 which provided for costofliving adjustment cola for 2001 35 and s 1402 pl 106419 which made many relatively small changes to va benefit and health care programs another new law pl 106475 hr 4864 changed the extent to which va personnel are required to assist applicants for benefits as they prepare their claims and compile supporting evidence veterans millennium health care act of 1999 pl 106117 this new law enacted in the 1st session expanded longterm care increases home health care gave higher priority access to longterm care to severely disabled veterans and to those needing care for serviceconnected conditions provided higher priority access to veterans awarded purple hearts and certain military retirees authorized va to increase copayments for pharmacy benefits used for treatment of nonservice connected conditions and authorized emergency care coverage for certain veterans without health insurance the law also refined the management of underutilized va capital assets by conditioning the disposition of va properties other provisions of pl 106117 make eligible for compensation surviving

importance of their service to the nation and the effect that service may have on their subsequent civilian lives the department of veterans affairs va administers directly or in conjunction with other federal agencies programs that provide compensation for disabilities sustained in military service pensions for disabled poor war veterans cash payments for certain categories of dependents andor survivors free medical care for conditions sustained during military service and for other conditions under priority system that results in most care being provided to low income veterans education training rehabilitation and job placement services to assist veterans upon their return to civilian life loan guarantees to help them obtain homes life insurance to enhance financial security for their dependents and burial assistance flags gravesites and headstones when they die the veteran population there were about 244 million veterans as of july 1 1999 of whom 193 million had served during at least one period defined as wartime the number of veterans is declining and their average age increasing the median age of veterans was 577 years 36 were over 65 years of age about 46 were female the va projects decline of about 26 in the number of veterans between 1990 and 2010 down from one of four men in 1994 to one of eight in 2010 half of whom will be over age 62 decline in the size of military forces and the corresponding effect that decline has had on the number of persons entering veterans status means relatively stable numbers of compensated veterans and fewer veterans seeking readjustment for postservice education and training the number of disabled wartime veterans receiving pensions is declining because of the deaths of existing beneficiaries and because veterans who might once have depended on va pensions as social safety net now have other sources of social insurance primarily social security that bring their incomes above the va pension eligibility levels however the increasing average age of veterans means additional demands for medical services from eligible veterans as aging brings on chronic conditions needing more frequent care and lengthier convalescence organization of the department of veterans affairs the va is divided into three administrative structures the veterans benefit administration the veterans health administration and the national cemetery administration va programs are funded through 22 appropriations including six crs2 revolving funds receiving appropriations nine revolving funds not receiving appropriations two intragovernmental funds one special fund and seven trust funds the cash benefit programs ie compensation and pensions and benefits for eligible survivors readjustment benefits education and training special assistance for the disabled home loan guarantees and veterans insurance and indemnities are mandatory entitlement spending although required amounts are annually appropriated veterans entitlement benefits were once increasing rapidly but now are relatively stable federal obligation to declining population of eligible beneficiaries and constitute about 53 of va spending the remaining programs primarily those associated with medical care facility construction and medical research are annual discretionary appropriations as are funds for the costs of administering va programs unlike the ratio of entitlement spending to discretionary spending in the rest of the federal budget the entitlement portion income security mostly for disability compensation pensions and education benefits of va is declining as percent of total va spending in fy1976 entitlements constituted 73 of vas budget with the remaining 27 discretionary appropriations for va health care administration and construction by fy2000 va discretionary spending has risen to 47 of vas total budget for the entire federal budget about onethird of spending is discretionary cash benefit programs under entitlement programs definitions of eligibility and benefit levels are in law during fy2000 about 23 million veterans drew an average of 561 in monthly compensation for serviceconnected disabilities about 303000 of their survivors averaged about 970 in monthly payments pensions for 373000 veterans averaged about 524 monthly 266000 survivors of veterans pensioners averaged about 221 monthly about 266000 veterans were receiving readjustment education benefits averaging 3241 annually medical care va operates the nations largest health care system with 172 hospitals 132 nursing homes 40 domiciliaries 206 readjustment counseling centers vet centers 73 home healthcare programs and over 800 outpatient clinics the fy2000 caseload was projected to reach nearly 38 million unique patients an increase of 185000 veterans served over fy1999 rising to 39 million during fy2001 va health care continues to place increasing emphasis on outpatient care according to va projections accompanying the fy2001 budget the inpatient caseload for fy2000 will be 738000 decline by about 14000 patients in contrast outpatient visits will increase by 26 million to 404 million va budget and appropriations va appropriations fy2001 pl 106377 congress appropriated 47 billion for department of veterans affairs va programs for fy2001 55 million more than the president requested the house recommended 46910 billion hr 4635 for va for fy2001 the senate in amending the house bill adopted its appropriation crs3 committees recommendation of 46966 billion and then subsequently amended the bill to incorporate the version agreed to in preliminary conference between the two houses that version was the final one agreed to by both houses and signed by the president as pl 106377 fy2000 pl 10674 congress provided 443 billion for the department of veterans affairs va for fy2000 included in the bill was 19 billion appropriation for va medical care which was 17 billion increase above fy1999 and 7 billion more than requested by the administration whose initial fy2000 budget request for va entailed freeze to medical care funding congress also provided 225 million for federal construction projects for va and 115 million for extended care facilities and veterans cemeteries operated by the states 50 million more than requested for extended care and 14 million more than for cemeteries in later action pl 106113 congress enacted language requiring 038 cut to most discretionary spending including va medical care for additional information on va appropriations for fy2001 see crs report rl30504 appropriations for fy2001 va hud and independent agencies dennis snook and richard bourdon coordinators va cash benefits while the number of veterans is declining va entitlement spending mostly serviceconnected compensation pensions and montgomery gibill education payments rose by 18 million in fy2000 to 23397 billion and is projected to require 246 billion in fy2001 spending for the va cash benefit programs is mandatory and the amounts requested by the budget are based on projected caseloads definitions of eligibility and benefit levels are in law much of the projected increase results from liberalizations to the montgomery gi bill the primary education program the balanced budget act of 1997 included language that ended the long standing va practice of paying compensation and pension benefits on friday when the 1st day of the month occurred on weekend october 1 2000 the start of fy2001 fell on sunday and the administration proposed that the payments be made the previous friday pl 106246 repealed the 1997 language clearing the way for the payment due in october 2000 to be paid on september 29 this change shifted 1832 billion in mandatory spending from fy2001 to fy2000 veterans housing benefits historically the opportunity for veterans to have home loans guaranteed by the federal government was significant contribution to the national goal of increasing the number of families who owned their own homes because of the guarantees lenders are protected against losses up to the amount of the guarantee thereby permitting veterans to obtain mortgages with little or down payment and with competitive interest rates these guarantees and certain direct loans to specific categories of veterans were obligations of the federal government that constituted mandatory spending administrative expenses are discretionary appropriations transferred from the home loan programs to the general operating expenses account crs4 table 1 shows

the recommendations in the earlier amended version of hr 4635 reported from the senate committee on appropriations crs5 b net after cuts of 80 million 038 required by pl 106113 the medical care account also receives transfers estimated to be 608 million for fy2000 and 639 million for fy2001 from the medical care collections fund mccfof reimbursements from private insurers whose health plans cover certain veterans treated by va for nonserviceconnected conditions and copayments and deductibles from veterans ineligible for free care guaranteed transitional housing loans for homeless veterans program account pl 105368 the veterans programs enhancement act of 1998 established pilot project to expand the supply of transitional housing for homeless veterans the program was authorized to guarantee up to 15 loans with maximum aggregate value of 100 million with more than five loans guaranteed during the first 3 years these housing plans must enforce sobriety standards as well as provide various supportive services such as substance abuse counseling and job readiness skills workshops residents must pay reasonable fee to reside in the project homes pl 10674 included an estimate that 4825 million for program costs for the program would be required during fy2000 based on the loan limitation of 100 million the program does not require additional spending in fy2001 medical care congress approved the presidents recommendation of 203 billion for va medical care for fy2001 an increase of nearly 13 billion over fy2000 congress approved 19 billion for fy2000 after adding 17 billion to the administrations request of 173 billion the appropriation was reduced by 795 million by the acrosstheboard cut of 038 mandated by pl 106113 the administration had initially requested the same amount for fy2000 as had been appropriated for fy1999 freeze in part intended to force efficiencies within the va medical system faced with mounting criticism in congress of the requested levels the administration added 1 billion to its original request in addition the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 gave va authority to retain net receipts of the medical care collections fund mccf allowing the funds to be spent for medical services to veterans rather than be transferred to the treasury as under previous law current estimates are that the change added an estimated 583 million in recycled spending authority in fy1999 608 million in fy2000 and is projected to add 639 million in fy2001 medical research congress appropriated 351 million for va medical research projects for fy2001 the same as the house approved hr 4635 the senate committee version recommended 331 million congress appropriated 321 million for medical research for fy2000 response to hepatitis c hcv evidence suggests that veterans have substantially higher infection rate for this dangerous communicable disease va survey in 1999 found that the veterans it surveyed had prevalence rate of 66 compared to an estimated 18 in the general population leading veterans groups and some health care professionals have advocated an aggressive response by va to combat the threat and the administrations budget estimated that funding for the diagnosis and treatment of infected veterans would rise to 340 million in fy2001 up from 195 million in fy2000 and 46 million in fy1999 the two committee reports accompanying hr 4635 hrept 106674 srept 106410 emphasize the need to focus necessary resources on research diagnosis crs6 and treatment of this disease the conference report to accompany hr 4635 hrept 106988 affirmed this emphasis and instructed va to include the disease in its complex care calculation for purposes of resource distribution among its 22 regional plans va construction the administration requested 62 million for major construction and 162 million for minor construction for fy2001 congress provided 66 million for major construction and 162 million for minor construction major construction projects have an estimated cost over 4 million many of the minor construction projects will continue vas overall strategy of expanding outpatient access pl 10674 included 65 million for major construction and 160 million for minor construction projects with an estimated cost under 4 million for fy2000 program administration pl 106377 included 1050 billion of the requested 1062 billion requested for general operating expenses goe for fy2001 pl 10674 provided 913 million for goe and 60 million for administration of the medical care programs for fy2000 va employment estimates the administration projects overall va employment will average 203352 during fy2001 down from an estimated average of 204115 during fy2000 and 205547 in fy1999 much of the decline will be in medical staff va estimates 179206 medical care slots for fy2001 down 1300 positions from an estimated 180510 in fy2000 and 182661 in fy1999 medical care staff positions will have declined by 12 from its high of 204527 at the end of 1993 if these estimates are matched with experience for further information on fy2000 appropriations for va see crs report rl30204 appropriations for fy2000 va hud and independent agencies veterans issues continuing in the 106 th congress veterans medical services more efficient greater access introduction historical trends and modern challenges the va medical care system is experiencing steadily increasing number of veterans seeking care in va facilities va estimates that its medical services will be given to 39 million different patients in fy2001 up from 27 million in fy1997 initially medical care services were provided for these additional patients without substantially increasing appropriations to va for its medical care programs va improved its efficiency in the delivery of medical services by increasing the number of outpatient access points distributing resources from underutilized facilities to underserved areas and identifying nonappropriated funds that could be used to expand medical capabilities however congress appropriated 19 billion for fy2000 17 billion above the administrations initial request and the administration requested and congress has approved 203 billion for fy2001 crs7 potential conflicts between medical judgements and administrative practices va medical care professionals and va administrative staff are attempting to increase the number of veterans served by va medical staff by becoming more efficient without sacrificing the quality of care however these potentially competing objectives may be difficult to reconcile especially because the responsibility for meeting the objectives are handled differently by medical personnel and administrators how efficiently and effectively can va administrators manage health care resources when resource decisions are often made by medical staff with differing objectives clearly if all 25 million veterans sought care in va facilities the system would be unable to meet all of the demands thereby placed upon it on the other hand the provision of care to specific patients depends on the access such patients have to the services of individual providers va medical care personnel can operate with enough flexibility in the number of patients they see and the amount of time they spend with each patient so that the total amount of access that can be provided over period of time is largely indeterminable for any given level of resources reforming va medical care to meet the challenges the va hospital based medical care system is traceable to the end of world war ii and rapid construction of va hospitals to meet the expected medical needs of returning troops over the years however advances in medical care made it possible to have needed services available through clinics and other outpatient venues va was slower to adapt to these changes but in spite of rules that seemed to encourage hospitalization of veterans in order to assure their treatment va began to find effective care could be more efficiently provided on an outpatient basis especially with the development of selfadministered drugs to treat many conditions to accommodate these changes in medical practice combination of administrative and legislative decisions made major changes to the va health care system eligibility reform the 104th congress reformed the rules governing access to va health care until pl 104262 many veterans had clear rights to acute care but not to basic services leaving many veterans uncertain as to the medical benefits available to them and arguably resulting in inefficient use of resources substantial evidence existed that demands for va health care differed from one region to another and the distribution of medical resources around the country did not match that demand managing access theoretically access to va health care is governed through system in which veterans are enrolled in health plans according to schedule of priorities these priorities are based on eligibility criteria intended to preserve sufficient resources so that high priority veterans primarily those with serviceconnected conditions or who have disability compensation ratings for such conditions can be assured of receiving all care that might be medically indicated there is potential conflict between the objective of administrative staff to manage resources to stay within budgetary constraints while preserving resources to meet the medical needs of veterans with the highest priority for medical services and the objective of medical staff to see all patients with complaints about their health crs8 the medical profession views the treatment of patients medical requirements to be the primary purpose of their decisionmaking process and that professional commitment could transcend the administrative commitment to preserve scarce resources according to system of priorities unrelated to medical need generally appropriations have been sufficient so that priority categories 1 through 6 are assured of medical services in recent years because of greater efficiency in the managing of va medical resources priority 7 veterans have also been able to enroll in va medical plans if they choose to and thereby be assured of access to va medical services during the period of their enrollment while the enrollment period theoretically begins each october 1 coinciding with the beginning of fiscal year and the expected certainty of spending authority available for that fiscal year va does not require renewing enrollment nor does it have method for disenrolling veteran once the veteran applied for enrollment va plans on continuing to enroll all eligible veterans who apply during fy2001 veterans are not denied care currently va medical personnel can be expected to provide medical services to all veterans who appear at va medical facilities seeking care veterans seeking appointments may sometimes be discouraged by va administrative staff from having their medical needs served through va and encouraged to seek health care services elsewhere in the community in practice however all veterans presenting health complaints to va medical facilities are screened to determine their medical condition the disposition of most cases occurs simultaneously with that screening for instance veteran complaining of sore throat asks to see doctor va medical staff examine the patient diagnose an infection prescribe an appropriate antibiotic which is then filled at an onsite va pharmacy if during this screening patient is discovered as having an emergent condition condition that left untreated could threaten the health of the patient the medical staff can be expected to initiate an appropriate course of treatment without regard to eligibility status in the event that the medical staff commitment to address all complaints was to come into conflict with resource limitations vas medical care professionals would allocate the services they could provide according to the traditional triage model applicants would be given access to care based on the urgency and type of conditions presented and those veterans most in need of care would be given high priority for services regardless of those veterans overall place in the priority schedule administered by va health care resource management this potential sharp contradiction between medical and administrative priorities has not occurred appropriated resources and the shift of more services from inpatient to outpatient settings has allowed va to serve all veterans applying for care without denying care to any particular veteran with medical need identified by va medical professionals while some veterans have complained that services are not given to them in the same manner or location as they had previously experienced this change is not itself denial of care but rather byproduct of the efficiency efforts yet some areas of the country continue to feel the pinch of reduced va medical resources as programs dependent upon inpatient capacity give way to outpatient crs9 services shifting resources from underutilized inpatient care to outpatient clinics increases the number of veterans who can be served by the same number of va medical personnel 75 of the va medical care budget funds medical care personnel either as federal employees or through contracted care at the same time this shift in resources can result in the termination of programs that often rely upon inpatient capacity especially those concerned with mental health and substance abuse programs va patients tend to be older sicker poorer and more likely to have social problems and mental illness than persons using private health care facilities1 regional administration the va reorganized the medical system into 22 regional entities called veterans integrated service networks visns each visn manages all resources within the region consolidating and integrating service capabilities to avoid duplication and increase efficiency annual evaluations guide the allocation among visns and among units within visns va is developing unitcost data to more accurately assess patient costs and to identify differences in efficiencies across regions to provide veterans with clearer sense of the medical benefits they could expect to receive each visn established health plans to administer veterans health care these plans began enrolling veterans october 1 1998 currently all veterans applying for enrollment are accepted this practice will continue at least through fy2000 veterans can enroll in advance of seeking care severely disabled are exempt from enrollment as are veterans in current treatment program all others can enroll at the time they are seeking medical services reallocating resources to achieve efficiencies and improve access system for measuring the relative needs for resources among visns called the veterans equitable resource allocation vera guides the shift of resources according to methodology that identifies underutilization and rewards efficiency according to the general accounting office gao the objective of vera is to provide comparable resources for comparable workload so that veterans within the same priority categories have the same availability for care to the extent practical throughout the va healthcare system vera is predicated on the assumption that reallocation is necessary when one network is allocated more funds per veteran than another network new sources of funds instead of additional appropriations to make up the difference between appropriated funds and projected increases in medical care costs the administrations budgets for fy1998 fy1999 and fy2000 assumed revenues from new sources of funds va estimated that by fy2002 about 10 of the medical care budget could be derived from cost recovery medicare reimbursement and revenue from leases and service agreements the fy2000 budget revised this figure downward to 76 largely because the original assumption incorporated revenues from medicare that have not been authorized together with individual patient efficiency savings of 30 va estimated that the reforms could permit serving 20 increase in caseload without an increase to annual appropriations while the guideline estimates may not be accurate the thrust 1 fy2000 va budget submission v 2 medical programs p 28 crs10 of va medical care programs continues to be in the direction of more primary care provided to more veterans through increasing reliance on outpatient visits provided by expanding outpatient access costsharing for veterans medical care for the treatment of service connected conditions is free to veterans care for nonserviceconnected conditions is also free for veterans rated at 50 or greater for purposes of va compensation for serviceconnected conditions2 the largest category of other veterans eligible for free nonserviceconnected care have limited assets below 50000 and income below an annually adjusted standard in 2000 22887 single 27468 one dependent 1532 each additional dependent veterans awarded purple heart for injuries sustained during combat are exempt from copayments for medical services but may remain subject to copayments for pharmacy benefits other veterans who may be eligible for free care are those who were exposed to environmental contaminants such as agent orange during service in vietnam or who were prisonersofwar remaining veterans priority 7 are primarily veterans who do not have rating for compensable serviceconnected disability are not seeking care for condition potentially traceable to an environmental hazard encountered in vietnam or the persian gulf do not meet other specific criteria associated with the circumstances of the military service and have incomes and assets above the va medical care means test these priority 7 veterans can receive va care but are obligated for share of the costs of such care for inpatient care copayments are equivalent to the medicare costsharing schedule for 2000 veterans pay 776 for the first 90 days of hospitalization during any 365 day period plus 10 per day each additional 90 days requires copayment of onehalf that initial amount plus 10 per day the nursing home charge is equal to the full amount plus 5 per day for outpatient care veterans are obligated for 20 of the projected average cost of an outpatient visit this formula yields copayment of 5080 for outpatient visits in 2000 veterans single dependents with incomes above 8989 in 2000 are obligated for 2 for each monthly outpatient prescription filled through the va pharmacy system changes due in va copayment schedule under authority of the millennium health care act pl 106117 discussed later in this report under heading of that name va has been given the authority to revise the costsharing structure to bring copayments more into line with prevailing private sector practices these changes will greatly aid veterans who seek care in va facilities because of lack of health insurance elsewhere or because the insurance they have including medicare does not provide much in the way of coverage for prescription drugs priority 7 veterans often called category c veterans based on previous access priority schedule who seek care for nonserviceconnected condition from va medical facilities become obligated for copayments given the relatively high 2 although the law specifies that veterans with 50 or greater disability ratings are assurred free va medical care in practice va generally does not seek costsharing payments from veterans with serviceconnected disability ratings of 10 or greater crs11 copayment for va outpatient visit 5080 in 2000 many veterans express dismay when told that they owe an outpatient visit copayment even if they are only seeking to have prescription filled by va pharmacy at 2 per month copayment many of these veterans seek care from va because they have been given an expensive prescription by another medical care provider and they do not have insurance benefits that will pay the cost of that prescription frequently these veterans are covered by medicare and do not understand why they should need to see two providers at government expense when it is the same condition to be treated as result of instructions given to the department by pl 106117 va is working toward new copayment schedule with outpatient visits reportedly near 15 for the first visit for specific condition and prescription copayment of 5 monthly most veterans in priority categories 1 through 6 would not pay copayments for outpatient visits for medical care given for nonserviceconnected conditions although some veterans who qualify for free care because of low incomes may be obligated to pay copayments for prescribed medications it should be noted that va does not operate pharmacy in the same sense in which drugstore can be expected to fill prescriptions across the full spectrum of available medical supplies va operates pharmacy in conjunction with the treatment plans developed by va medical staff for treating specific conditions among its patientveterans in order to improve the efficacy of its treatments and to maximize the bargaining position of va pharmaceutical purchasing agents va staff developed limiting list called formulary that guides the va physician in prescribing drugs from among those that have similar effectiveness3 thus va physician must see veteran in order to prescribe drugs for that patient both to assure that va quality of care criteria are respected and will continue to develop through statistical examination of patient outcomes and to match the veterans prescription needs with those available through va pharmacy stepped up collections of outstanding costsharing obligations on july 14 2000 va began notifying veterans with outstanding obligations for copayments and deductibles that the department would become more aggressive in its efforts to recover the owed amounts citing requirements on the va contained in pl 99272 and pl 101508 and with reference to the debt collection improvement act of 1996 va informed veterans that outstanding costsharing obligations would be offset from other federal payments including for the first time from social security benefits to which the veteran is entitled limited to 15 of the benefit in excess of 750 per month federal employees who are also veterans with unpaid costsharing obligations for past va medical care may also have their federal pay offset to satisfy the outstanding amounts while authority for these offsets has existed for some time past offsets have been limited to amounts due for va disability compensation and federal income tax refunds medical care collections fund mccf veterans whose nonservice connected conditions are treated by va and who are not eligible for free care for 3 the va pharmacy formulary does not prevent va physician from prescribing outside the formulary provided the physician has medical justification for doing so crs12 such conditions are obligated to pay copayments and deductibles also thirdparty insurers who would be obligated for at least portion of the costs of veterans medical care costs if the veteran were to be treated by providers outside the va system are obligated to pay va portion of the cost of that care in the past vas mccf fund previously called the medical care cost recovery fund received all medical care cost collections each year va transferred the funds to the treasury after subtracting the cost of administering the collection procedures to enforce discipline on the program and to encourage medical facilities to be more aggressive in pursuing funds va had authority to collect the balanced budget act of 1997 requires va to bear the costs of mccf collections but lets the medical program keep the funds according to the administrations budget 667 million were collected during fy1998 and 583 million in fy1999 were expected to have collected 608 million in fy2000 and were projected to collect 639 million in fy2001 sharing arrangements and enhanced use leases va medical centers have the authority to enter into sharing agreements with other health care providers in the communities in which they are located va is authorized to obtain services by contract whenever such contracts would be more efficient than for va to provide the services directly in some instances specialized services are available from va that other community providers seek and va is authorized to collect and retain fees for those services this authority extends to support services and some va facilities partially offset their costs by selling such laundry or ambulance services to other health care providers in addition va has temporary authority extended by pl 106117 until december 31 2011 to enter into enhanced use leases in which va facilities andor services can be contracted by other entities after taking into consideration how the leasing arrangement would affect local commercial and community interests va can enter into leases of up to 75 years if it determines that the activities would not interfere with va programs and would in some way serve the interests of veterans these leases may be additional sources of revenue to the facilities and may serve to increase the use of capacity that would otherwise be underused medicare subvention many veterans advocates have suggested that va should also be reimbursed for nonserviceconnected care va provides veterans who are also covered by medicare medicare subvention meaning transfer or subsidy from the medicare trust funds is the term by which this proposal is known if medicare were to transfer funds to cover the cost of vas services to its existing caseload of patients who are also covered by medicare medicare program outlays could increase and va would experience an increase in spending authority on the other hand if va served additional veterans whose care is currently paid by medicare and if va provided that care less expensively than providers who would otherwise be reimbursed through medicare then real savings could be possible both to taxpayers and to medicare offset against this potential savings would be any costs accrued by va for services to additional patients and for benefits that va provides that medicare does not cover for its participants such as prescription drugs if subvention caused the government to provide more in total services than would crs13 otherwise have been provided overall federal spending would increase unless savings in the cost of providing those services through va instead of through medicare reimbursement of private health care providers equals or exceeds the cost of the additional services the 105th congress considered medicare subvention bills but ended with final action one bill hr 3828 to authorize pilot project at three locations for 3 years was reported by the house committee on ways and means with approval of the house committees on veterans affairs and commerce the pilot project would have permitted veterans in those three locations whose priority status requires them to share in the cost of their medical care called category c veterans in the bill to enroll in va plan and have their medicare benefits provided through that plan medicare would then pay va the same rate per covered person that it would pay for those persons to enroll in similar private prepaid plan approved by medicare the bill would also have permitted veterans who live in geographically remote areas and who have highpriority access to va health care called category veterans in the bill and who are also covered by medicare to receive their medicare benefits through one of vas visn health plans4 this approach to medicare subvention would require va and the department of health and human services hhs to coordinate the collection of data which would be analyzed to make sure that medicareeligible veteran receives less in medical benefits through va than would be received directly through medicare and that reimbursements to va from medicare do not exceed established limits in the 105th congress bill medicare would have been authorized to reimburse va for up to 50 million in the year 2000 75 million in 2001 and 100 million in subsequent years for care provided to category veterans and 50 million for each of 3 years for the category c veterans the approach had bipartisan support with 92 cosponsors but the 105th congress ended with the bill not acted upon by the full house the substance of hr 3828 was included in hr 4567 which passed the house on october 10 1998 but action was taken in the senate before the end of the 105th congress on february 24 1999 the senate passed s 4 bill to improve pay and retirement equity for members of the armed forces attached to the bill was an amendment to establish medicareva subvention demonstrations in up to 10 sites the proposed pilot projects would meet criteria for providing medicare benefits through va health care plans for certain veterans with coverage under the medicare program these plans would be regarded by the medicare program as qualified medicare providers on november 16 1999 the senate finance committee reported the medicare subvention demonstration for veterans act of 1999 s 1928 srept 106222 4 there is category b common practice in veterans health care discussions divides veterans into these two categories one of which has access to free va care while the other agrees to share in costs although the categories are not found in va law some years ago va law did categorize veterans according to access priority categories b and c crs14 which would establish up to eight demonstration sites to deliver medicarecovered services to certain medicareeligible veterans va would be authorized upon agreement with the department of health and human services hhs to establish an equal number of coordinated care and feeforservice plans one of each of which must be located within predominately rural area va would provide at minimum medicare benefits equivalent to those benefits received by medicare beneficiaries in other plans the medicare trust fund would reimburse va for medicare services it provides to these duallycovered veterans by up to 50 million annually va would serve the medicarecovered veterans in these plans in the most appropriate venue whether in va facility or through contracts with private health care providers unlike the house bill of the 105th congress only category 7 veterans those ineligible for higher priority free va care could join the demonstration projects the house bill of the 105th congress would have allowed enrollment in the demonstrations by veterans eligible for highpriority access to va care but who live in remote areas other requirements upon va and the medicare program are much the same as in the house bill of the 105th congress and would be coordinated between va and hhs late in the 2nd session of the 106th congress an amended version of the evolving medicare subvention proposal was deliberated during the development of legislation to enact comprehensive changes to medicare various participants including the house ways and means committee the house commerce committee the senate finance committee together with house and senate leadership proposed an agreement called the medicare medicaid and schip benefits and improvement and protection act of 2000 which was then attached to hr 2614 bill to amend the small business investment act the agreement passed the house on october 26 2000 but the provisions to establish medicare subvention pilot program were dropped from the bill before action was taken currently there is active legislation to bring about medicare subvention project for coordinating medical benefits for veterans with rights to both va and medicare finally language was included in hr 5109 va health care personnel act of 2000 which addressed issues in vamedicare subvention the provisions were dropped when other provisions in hr 5109 were added to s 1402 before its enactment the subvention provisions engendered some debate among veterans service organizations with the american legion and the veterans of foreign wars endorsing the provision and the disabled american veterans and the paralyzed veterans of america opposed to its enactment the provision would have permitted va to pay some of the costs associated with treatments given to veteran in non va medical facility when va determined that it is in the veterans medical interest to provide such care outside va for practical reasons such as the distance veteran might need to travel to reach an appropriate va medical facility four pilot projects were to be authorized and the projects selected were to be located in such way as to limit the number of veterans participating to more than 15 of those living in the area 70 of the veterans in the area must have travel of more than 2 hours to reach facility and the total that could be spent on the projects in any fiscal year was to be limited to 50 million the pilot projects would expire crs15 in 2005 and adverse effects on va medical facilities would have prompted changes in projects proponents of these provisions pointed to the increased access that would result from veterans becoming able to seek care closer to their homes and noted that the number of veterans seeking care from va is increasing fast enough to compensate for diminished demand at the facilities affected in effect the provisions would have allowed va to pay costs including copayments and deductibles for veterans in va plans who were also covered by other plans including medicare opportunities for veterans to seek care elsewhere alarms some veterans organizations who believe it could lead to an erosion of va specialization in veterans disability services and declines in the number of veterans seeking services at va medical facilities they conclude that such changes when combined with va efficiency moves shifting care from inpatient facilities to outpatient clinics would mean the eventual closing of va hospitals the millennium health care act pl 106117 near the end of the 1st session congress approved the millennium health care act hr 2116 the new law expands extended care services for veterans including geriatric evaluation nursing home care domiciliary services adult day health care noninstitutional alternatives to nursing home care home or residence assistance and respite care the act also authorizes va to pay for emergency care on behalf of uninsured enrolled veterans who are within 2 years of having received va health care at the time of the emergency the act also authorizes the creation of such capability to the level sufficient to assure access to the services for any veteran who needs such care for serviceconnected condition and to any veteran with serviceconnected disability rated at 70 or higher language in the act instructs va to increase emphasis on mental health services especially such services applicable to post traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse pl 106117 grants high priority access to va medical services for military retirees regardless of their placement in the priority system that governs the access of all veterans to va medical care this change would have the effect of placing priority access for military retirees ahead of veterans who do not qualify for free relatively highpriority care because they do not meet the standards for service connected free care and they do not have incomes and assets below vas means tested threshold also veterans awarded purple heart would be given access to free higher priority health care the new law also raises the visibility and accountability of va efforts to manage its extensive capital stock of buildings and other permanent medical care capability and support va would be required to consider alternatives and to draw upon funds for furthering these alternatives in any situation in which building wing service unit or other facility is subject to closing the purpose of the provisions would be to enable va and the communities in which the facilities are located to determine if facilities threatened with closure could be used in some other manner to serve veterans such as for convalescent care or other assisted living arrangements before that building is liquidated by demolition or sale to the private sector va would be permitted to retain any funds obtained through leasing or crs16 selling facilities and use such funds for the financing of other forms of disposition including conversions of the facilities for other veteran uses the new law authorizes va to increase from 2 monthly the copayment obligation on those veterans ineligible for free prescriptions establish maximum monthly and annual amount for veterans with multiple prescriptions and revise outpatient care copayments for higher income veterans va is also authorized under the act to establish nonprofit research corporations at va medical centers to facilitate research education and training to revise the priority system for the award of grants under the programs assisting in the funding of state veterans homes with priority given to renovation especially when considerations about patient safety are involved finally pl 106117 authorizes number of construction projects among which are ones that would provide domiciliary in orlando florida add longterm care facility at the lebanon pennsylvania complex complete renovations at va medical centers in fargo north dakota and atlanta georgia and demolish surplus and antiquated buildings at the leavenworth kansas medical facility other veterans issues legislation during the 2nd session of the 106th congress near the end of the preelection portion of the 2nd session of the 106th congress several bills affecting veterans benefits were enacted resulting in three new public laws in order to expedite action the final versions of the bills incorporated features from number of other bills among the provisions adopted are ones which would provide cost ofliving adjustment for serviceconnected disability and survivor compensation benefits hr 4850 one which would revise the limits that court decision placed on va when the departments employees render assistance to veteran filing claim for benefits hr 4864 and an omnibus bill s 1402 that made numerous changes to health care programs readjustment benefits va personnel management and compensation and certain other changes cost of living adjustment pl 106413 by enacting hr 4850 congress provided inflation increases to disability compensation received by veterans with serviceconnected conditions and to compensation paid to the survivors of such veterans with the exception of the serviceconnected disability and survivors programs veterans cash programs are fully and automatically adjusted each year for changes in the costofliving adjustment cola in the same manner granted to most federal benefit programs including social security why these two important federal obligations are not also automatically linked to the official measurement of changes to the costofliving is largely tactical instead of amending va law to make cola automatic the strong commitment to these programs means that legislation to provide an annual adjustment is sure to receive procedural attention even during the frantic days at the end of legislative session when floor time to consider bills is at premium to facilitate the passage of other veterans legislation when congress becomes pinched for time the house and senate committees on veterans affairs report legislation each year that provides for an increase to these programs equal to crs17 the increases automatically applied to most other entitlement benefits attaching to the bill other veterans legislation approved by house and senate conferees the veterans claims assistance act of 2000 pl 106475 this new law hr 4864 reversed 1999 decision of the court of appeals for veterans claims which found that va is required to help veterans obtain records relevant to claim they file with va only if it can be proved that the claim is wellgrounded by tradition and consistent with its interpretation of the statutes governing veterans benefits va had assumed considerable responsibility for assisting veterans as they seek benefits from va program in practice va claims processors exercised some discretion with respect to the assistance provided sometimes discouraging veterans from filing claims for which there was ample precedent of similar claims being denied on the other hand these same processors provided valuable assistance to veterans with claims that had some potential merit helping them identify sources of potentially useful information and supporting documentation in reviewing the disposition of recent claim morton v west currently on appeal to the us court of appeals the court of appeals for veterans claims called into question the regulations and manuals that provided guidance as to the respective obligations of both the veteran claimants and the va with respect to the filing of well grounded or plausible claim with va the court asserted that vas statutory obligation was more limited than their practices indicated and that the veteran had the sole responsibility of developing information that would lead to finding by va that the claim was well grounded that is that there was at least some basis for proceeding with developing case file only at that point could va become involved in providing assistance to veterans as they developed supporting evidence for their claims partially in response to the unfolding controversy about the departments obligations to assist veterans from the beginning of their claims process va proposed new regulations5 that would require most veterans to submit information demonstrating that their claims are plausible va would continue to assume responsibility to assist at all stages those veterans who may be presumed to be unable to prepare their own claims va believed the approach was consistent with existing law and would resolve the apparent conflict between the statutes and the practices of claims examiners by continuing to assist veterans who cannot help themselves while asking veterans and their representatives to gather some information that would be needed to begin the claims adjudication process the veteran service organizations were asked to participate in the refinement of the proposed regulations and to suggest categories of veterans who should be provided assistance even if their claims do not initially appear to be well grounded some veterans service organizations regarded the decision as significant step back in the kind of assistance that veterans seeking benefits had right to expect 5 proposed revision to 38 cfr sec 3159 december 2 1999 volume 64 of the federal register pages 67528 to 67534 crs18 from the departments staff and that the proposed regulations were inadequate protection to veterans who could find themselves unable to proceed with their claims under the new procedures hr 4864 and s 1810 the senate version of this legislation received substantial support within the veterans advocacy community the new law increased vas obligations to help veterans at the initial claims stage initially va voiced concerns that enactment of provisions could substantially increase va claims processing workloads without substantially changing the ultimate approval rate of applications for benefits although va claimed that the additional workload could have the effect of slowing down the claims process and lead to longer time periods before claims are adjudicated the department ultimately did not resist the legislations progress toward passage the veterans benefits and health care improvement act of 2000 pl 106419 on october 12 2000 congress approved an amended version of s 1402 which the senate had approved during the 1st session as the allvolunteer force educational assistance programs improvements act of 1999 before enactment conferees included provisions from several other bills that had been reported from either the house or senate committees on veterans affairs educational assistance provisions the new law contains many of the recommendations of the commission on servicemembers and veterans transition assistance discussed later in this report under heading of that name among provisions in the final bill are those which increase effective november 1 2000 the rates of veterans basic educational assistance under the montgomery gi bill mgib from 528 to 650 monthly for 3year enlistees and from 429 to 528 monthly for 2year enlistees permit certain

applied to other benefit programs permit the survivor and dependent education assistance payments to be paid retroactively to the date of the entitling event death or determination of 100 disability allow education assistance payments to be paid between terms for period of up to 8 weeks repeal the requirement that an mgib participant have completed high school diploma or equivalency certificate before ending their initial period of active duty repeal the requirement that mgib entitlement is predicated on completing an initial obligated period of service so that eligibility can be based on subsequent periods of service authorize va educational assistance programs to pay for vocational or professional certification andor licensing tests up to maximum of 2000 and crs19 extend through december 31 2008 certain va home loan guarantees and through september 30 2008 the authority for home loan fees foreclosure sales procedures and income verification rules in the va home loan guarantee program health care provisions before action on s 1402 was completed provisions of veterans affairs health care personnel act of 2000 hr 5109 were included the personnel provisions included ones which authorize annual comparability raises for va nurses similar to those provided other federal employees incorporate more localized data to assure that va nurses are compensated competitively with nurses in facilities outside va limit the extent to which va management can modulate nursing pay increases contrary to independent survey data provide for nurse participation in policy decisionmaking at network and medical centers levels revise and increase special pay for dentists add va pharmacists to occupations exempt from statutory caps on special pay rates require va to include physician assistants pas as consultants in the development of responsibility guidelines for pas authorize va to hire for two year appointments pas who have successfully completed the full course of training and are awaiting certification authorize temporary extensions of term appointments for medical staff doing vafunded research authorize va to waive state licensing requirements for va social workers who are undergoing pertinent training extend and modify employee buyouts through december 31 2002 authorize va to furnish veterans those accompanying veterans with temporary lodging in conjunction with treatments or services clarify language establishing va outpatient clinics at state veterans homes and provide sense of congress resolution encouraging joint vadod procurement of medical products including prescription drugs the bill would also increase vas efforts to monitor the relationship between active duty experience and subsequent health issues attaching the refined data to the veterans medical records monitor the post traumatic stress disorder experience and treatment approaches for veterans of vietnam extend the reporting requirements of va with respect to the departments handling of mentally ill veterans and refine the provisions by which va enters into leasing arrangements of va facilities and recaptures funds by those arrangements and require employers to grant leave to reservists who are called to participate as honor guards at funerals of veterans in addition to these were provisions authorizing additional construction projects primarily at va medical facilities among projects authorized are psychogeriatric care building at palo alto california 266 million utility plant and electrical vault at the medical center in miami florida 236 million seismic corrections clinical consolidations and other improvements at the center in long beach crs20 california 517 million and renovation of psychiatric nursing units at the center in murfreesboro tennessee 14 million other benefit provisions provisions of the veterans benefits act of 2000 which included provisions from other bills hr 3998 hr 3816 hr 4131 and hr 4376 were attached to the cola bill before house passage and subsequently incorporated into s 1402 before work was completed on that bill these bills would expand benefits under the programs for variety of veterans and family members among the provisions are those that would establish that stroke or heart attack incurred or aggravated by member of reserve component in the performance of duty during inactive duty training shall be considered

the 1nd session of the 106th congress in addition to the millennium health care act pl 106117 discussed earlier in this report congress enacted other legislation of interest to veterans during the 1st session of the 106th congress veterans benefits improvement act of 1999 pl 106117 as congress neared final consideration of the millennium health care act hr 2116 the house and senate veterans affairs committees combined features of several other bills hr 2280 s 1402 and added the language titling the final bill the veterans millennium health care and benefits act in addition to the health care

january 1999 increases for retired military with severe serviceconnected disabilities the fy2000 national defense authorization act pl 10665 includes provision that adds monthly payments for retired military personnel who have severe serviceconnected disabilities rated by va at 70 or above generally military retired pay and va compensation are offset against each other although va compensation is not subject to taxes on income and military retirement is taxable as ordinary income some military retiree advocates have long argued that retirees with serviceconnected compensation should be permitted to receive both opponents of concurrent receipt argue that such individuals should not be compensated twice for the same period of service once as retiree and again as compensation recipient pl 10665 provides taxable monthly payments of 100 for military retirees with serviceconnected conditions rated by va at 70 or 80 200 monthly for retirees with 90 ratings and 300 monthly for retirees

close family members of eligible veterans could continue to be buried in the same grave with that veteran without waiver hr 70 passed the house on march 23 1999 on july 26 1999 the senate approved s 1076 with language to accomplish similar purposes contained in the provisions of hr 70 veterans entrepreneurship and small business development act of 1999 pl 10650 on august 17 1999 the president signed hr 1568 originally reported from the committee on small business to assist veterans who own or would like to start businesses the new law raises the profile of veterans assistance in the small business administration sba by creating an office specifically charged with veterans business assistance the office of veterans business development will now oversee technical and informational assistance and will include servicedisabled veterans within the definition of handicapped individual for eligibility for sba business loans the sba is authorized to make loans to veterans who own businesses and who are called to active duty veterans are now eligible for participation in programs intended to give small business owners greater participation in federal procurement contracts sba will become more involved in assuring that veterans are not subject to discrimination in the startup and operation of small businesses and that they benefit from various programs intended to improve such opportunities for veterans finally sba is required to collect data on veterans small business opportunities and successes and report annually on veterans and their business ventures supplemental security income ssi payments for filipino veterans who have returned to the philippines pl 106169 the foster care independence act of 1999 pl 106169 contains incidental amendments to the ssi program one such change permits the continued payment of ssi benefits to filipino veterans of us armed forces service during world war ii when such veterans return to the philippines the benefits will be paid at level equivalent to 75 of the benefit level these veterans would receive if they remained in the us the 75 figure is intended to make these filipino veterans who return to the philippines financially about the same as they would be were they to be eligible in the philippines for wartime service pensions from va at the same 50 level paid for other filipino benefits administered by va veterans who are totally disabled and who have at least one day during period defined as wartime are eligible for va wartime pensions which like ssi are meanstested payments crs23 background on the issue of benefits for filipino veterans of world war ii during world war ii filipino citizens in the military forces of the army of the commonwealth of the philippines were drawn into that war under authority of us armed forces on the basis of legislation enacted in 1934 preparatory to philippine independence many of these filipino veterans believe that their service was active duty service in the us military that should qualify them for the same benefits as other veterans of active duty legislation passed in 1946 specifically excludes such filipino veterans from full veterans benefits and pressure to amend that exclusion has periodically surfaced since that time some of the filipino soldiers were disabled during the course of their service under us armed forces command and became eligible for serviceconnected compensation from va because of differences between the economies of the us and the commonwealth of the philippines the compensation payments were provided under federal law to these disabled filipino veterans at rate equivalent to 50 cents for each dollar that would be paid to similarly disabled veteran in the us armed forces regardless of whether the filipino veteran resided in the us or the philippine islands the disparity in payments for us residents entitled to va compensation has been recurring issue initially it was argued before congress by proponents of the lower payments that the distinction was necessary to prevent the benefits from becoming an inducement to seek residence in the us solely for that purpose some also argued that the commonwealth would reach political stability more easily if these disabled veterans remained in the philippines during the postwar period in recent years filipino advocates have pointed to the large number of filipino veterans in the us as legal residents and have called for legislation to address their claims for full benefits the administrations fy1999 and fy2000 budgets have called for legislation to pay disabled filipino veterans and their survivors residing in the us the full rate at an additional cost of 5 million during the first year and 25 million over 5 years legislation to provide these increased payments was included in pl 106377 va hud and independent agencies appropriations for fy2001 the insurance dividend hoax reappears on the internet the internet has made possible the dissemination through chain letter postings of numerous reports which give every appearance of being factually correct but which are in fact totally false one such disseminated false report tells of supposed dividend that congress has recently enacted and for which veterans are eligible if they apply rumors of this bonus have surfaced periodically through various forms of informal media for nearly 50 years defying vigorous attempts by va and congress to eradicate it from the common sense origin of the dividend rumor in 1950 va paid 27 billion in special dividends to 16 million world war ii veterans who had national service life insurance policies with premiums paid to 1948 the 1948 special dividend from that point forward the possibility of dividends has led to periodic rumors that congress has again passed such benefit or is considering doing so crs24 for instance in 1965 for unknown reason some newspapers published stories reporting of the special dividends that had been paid in the early 1950s as if the dividends were being paid at the time the stories were published while va attempted to squash the misinformation with factual stories each time the false reports surfaced the stories would take on local circulation life gradually drifting to more marginal print media such as newsletters flyers and local bulletins and sometimes accompanied by bogus application forms at some points va received as many as 20000 inquiries per week about this supposed dividend and in 1970 the volume of requesters prompted congress to enact legislation declaring steps to be taken whenever va was presented with such bogus applications the stories are false there has been recent legislation that would authorize special dividends dividends are not payable to current service members insured under the servicemans group life insurance sgli or veterans group life insurance vgli both of which are group policies without dividend concepts involved va does automatically pay dividends on some policies of other programs that have that intended feature but then only to veterans who have kept the policies in force in the event veteran is due one of these dividends it is paid automatically on the anniversary date of the policy and application for the payment is necessary transition from active duty to civilian life are readjustment programs inadequate one of the traditional responsibilities of va is to assist veterans in readjusting to civilian life readjustment assistance is also provided to servicedisabled veterans to enable them to achieve maximum independence in their daily lives as result of the decline in the numbers of veterans the importance of these readjustment programs is perhaps less evident than it has been during periods in which large numbers of troops were demobilized the veterans affairs committees in both houses of the 106th congress are considering legislative proposals based on recommendations of recent congressional commission that examined these programs most of the current programs originated with the gi bill of 1944 under the gi bill and subsequent additions and variations the va has spent over 65 billion training or educating more than 20 million veterans over 14 million veteran home loans have been guaranteed all veterans are also assured assistance in preparing for and finding employment educational assistance job retention rights preferences in federal hiring and with employers having federal contracts of 10000 or more per year guaranteed direct loans and insurance for veterans are among the kinds of assistance provided veterans some programs assisting in veterans readjustment are administered through agreements between va and other agencies including the departments of labor defense and transportation educational assistance the original gi bill was in part intended to help alleviate shortages in trained manpower as well as provide opportunities for veterans to better adapt to civilian life for many returning troops the gi benefits assisted in crs25 furthering education interrupted or postponed by war service while for others it provided an inducement to seek training they might otherwise never have pursued the combination of policy objectives helped both society and veterans adapt to postwar economic conditions the current version of the veterans education and training program called the montgomery gi bill mgib meets somewhat different objective with the end of conscription and the move to an all volunteer force congress enacted program that serves as recruiting inducement to young people considering their opportunities for future economic improvement the montgomery gi bill provides educational assistance to veterans who agree to have their military pay reduced by 100 per month for the first 12 months of active duty the money is not refundable if the participant does not elect to enroll in eligible education or training when the period of active duty is completed the mgib participant is eligible for monthly education benefits of 650 monthly for 36 months for 3year active duty enlistment and 528 monthly for enlistments of less than 3 years other amounts may be added as inducements to join difficult to fill active duty job assignments other somewhat lesser amounts may be paid to reservists and veterans whose eligibility is traceable to an earlier program benefits of the mgib program are granted cola each october commission on servicemembers and veterans transition assistance this congressional commission examined programs that help veterans adjust to civilian life after active duty in the armed forces concluding that some programs have become so outdated and program management so ineffective that they break faith with those who served and currently serve their nation in uniform the commissions recent report goes on to recommend fundamental and far reaching reforms to veterans programs and their administration6 the commissions proposals would enforce tight performance standards on veterans employment and training programs initiate common framework between va and the department of defense dod for the resolution of disability claims improve medical coverage for newly separating veterans coordinate va and dod medical care systems increase home loan opportunities and establish small business loan program and permit active duty military personnel to participate in the federal employees thrift savings plan tsp on the same basis as civilian federal workers proposal to increase education benefits perhaps the major recommendation of the commission concerns the role va education benefits play in recruitment of an adequate supply of young and able military personnel at issue is key finding of the commission while college attendance is major goal of high school graduates and their parents the value of mgib benefits toward college 6 report of the congressional commission on servicemembers and veterans transition assistance transmitted to the committees on veterans affairs armed services and national security of the senate and house of representatives of the united states january 14 1999 the commission was established by pl 104275 crs26 education is relatively less attractive than it once was other programs targeting the same population have increased in scope and generosity causing military service to be viewed as detour around college enrollment not as way to achieve itcongress appropriates billions of dollars for nonveteran education programs that are available to any american without enduring the risks and sacrifices inherent in military service veterans education conditioned on military service must offer substantial advantage over programs available to all americans the commission proposed substantial liberalization of the mgib eliminating its pay reduction in the first year of active duty and providing monthly stipend funds for books tuition and fees to attend any institution of higher learning in america for which they qualify to any veteran who has completed an enlistment of at least 4 years for enlistments of less than 4 years the commission recommends an increase to 600 monthly and providing the money at the beginning of an academic term versions of these changes were included in pl 106419 discussed above enacted late in the 2nd session of the 106th congress the ongoing issue of presuming service connections the relationship between risk exposure and subsequent disabilities introduction some veterans and their advocates believe that exposure to environmental toxins or unknown and mysterious diseases during military service has left many veterans vulnerable to an array of disabilities later in life in recent times congress has considered the concerns of veterans with claims arising from service in nuclear testing areas vietnam and the persian gulf authority for va to provide medical treatment for diseases presumed linked to radiation has been made permanent similar authority to receive high priority medical treatment for diseases presumed related to exposure to agent orange and other herbicides in vietnam expires at the end of 2002 authority for medical treatment for veterans who may have been exposed to toxic substances or environmental hazards during the persian gulf war expires at the end of 2001 authority to evaluate the health of spouses and children of persian gulf war veterans expires at the end of this year although major legislation has not been considered in the 106th congress the issue of presuming disabilities to be serviceconnected and the implications of such presumptions is of ongoing concern to congress and to veterans service organizations the following discusses the history and current status of this issue giving veterans the benefit of the doubt the nation has accepted an obligation to veterans who incur injury disease or aggravate an existing condition va law calls all of these disabilities while in service to the country health services cash payments and other benefits may be given to veterans who experience disabilities traceable to period of military service these disabilities need not have occurred in the line of duty or even be related to active duty for condition to be regarded as serviceconnected veterans need show only that the condition occurred or was aggravated as result of military service or arose during that period crs27 to receive benefits for serviceconnected disability veterans are required to document that their condition is related to their service the claim is often clearly documented by pertinent military records however with some disorders evidence of serviceconnection is inconclusive congress has sometimes granted presumption of serviceconnection so that veterans can be treated and given appropriate compensation while scientific studies attempt to determine whether correlation can be found between risks the veteran encountered during military service and the subsequent manifestation of disorder early in the 20th century these presumed serviceconnections permitted va and its administrative forerunners to treat veterans for variety of little understood ailments that they might have contracted during duty in faroff lands while many tropical diseases long defied routine diagnosis more familiar diseases such as malaria were diagnosed accurately and the sporadic recurrence of its symptoms over time were well known the passage of time between veterans exposure to risk and onset or recurrence of specific disease made the use of presumptions an attractive alternative to protracted examination of claim that was necessarily difficult to validate or rebut recent presumption issues current concern that latent illnesses could be related to toxic exposure during gulf war service was preceded by similar concern that certain diseases could be related to exposure to agent orange or other herbicides in vietnam that concern was preceded by concerns that certain diseases could be related to exposure to nuclear radiation during world war ii or during atomic testing in the 1950s in these cases policy objectives were based on the rationale that veterans should be given the benefitofthedoubt as to the treatment of illnesses potentially traceable to military service 1 these veterans were sick with serious diseases needing treatment 2 they did serve their country often in wartime combat zone and 3 capacity to provide the services existed if they were given high priority access from scientific standpoint the evidence necessary for va to conclude that particular presumption should be expanded to include additional diseases is not particularly high threshold generally speaking the law excludes extending presumptions to disorders in which scientific evidence has found correlation between exposure to risk and the contraction of disorder or when the disorder is attributable to another cause yet other scientific evidence even when inconclusive may be enough for the list of disorders with presumptive service link to be expanded presumptions and exposure to nuclear radiation from 1945 until 1963 the us exploded approximately 235 nuclear devices in the atmosphere potentially exposing an estimated 220000 military personnel to unknown levels of radiation some of these veterans later claimed that low level radiation released during the testing may be cause of certain adverse health consequences they had experienced in addition some veterans who had been among occupation forces in hiroshima and nagasaki after the atomic bomb attacks on those cities also claimed that they had experienced adverse health effects because of that occupation service crs28 while carcinogenic and other health effects of high radiation doses was well known scientific evidence about the longterm health consequences of exposure to low levels was inconclusive in 1987 congress chose not to abide by its long standing tradition that benefits should be paid only where substantive evidence is clearly available to establish that the disabling conditions existed while on active duty or are clearly related to such period of service instead congress accepted the conclusion that because the evidence of exposurelevel risk could not be verified it should depend instead on correlation of various diseases with radiation exposure pl 100321 included language establishing presumption that 13 diseases would be presumed to be serviceconnected if they manifested in veterans whose service histories included active duty in radiationrisk activity7 the va opposed passage of the bill arguing that existing law was sufficient to permit awarding benefits in cases in which the evidence linking diseases to radiation exposure was conclusive at the heart of the objection to the bill was the administrations claim that the overwhelming majority of veterans covered by the bill received very low doses of radiation whether they participated in the weapons tests or the occupation of hiroshima or nagasaki va examined scientific data on correlations between various cancers and radiation exposure at the level that had been experienced by the veterans and projected that of the 32000 to 34000 deaths from cancer that would otherwise occur among the 200000 veterans made eligible for the presumption under the law the additional exposure from their service experience would lead to 10 additional deaths the administration concluded that the issue really becomes whether the federal government should presume that all 32010 eventual cancers among atomic veterans are serviceconnected in order to assure that the 10 possible excess cases related to service are covered or whether it is better public policy to look at each case individually to separate the more deserving claims from those less deserving8 in spite of the va opposition the bill passed and subsequently has been amended to include additional diseases radiationexposed veterans continue to have various illnesses considered for inclusion within the presumption on february 25 1999 the senate before passage of s 4 amended it to include language offered by senator wellstone that increased the number of diseases for which presumption of serviceconnection would exist for disabilities experienced by radiationexposed veterans expanding presumptions to include exposure to agent orange congress also granted priority medical treatment to veterans who had been exposed to the defoliant agent orange the active ingredient in that defoliant is the chemical dioxin for which there is some evidence of diseasecausing potential by the time that congress enacted legislation authorizing the treatment of diseases possibly linked to radiation exposure increasing numbers of veterans of service in vietnam 7 hrept 100235 report from the house committee on veterans affairs to accompany the atomic veterans compensation act of 1987 pl 100321 8 ibid p 1011 crs29 were claiming serviceconnection for disabilities that they believed were related to exposure to agent orange when concern mounted that exposure to herbicides in vietnam could have posed health risk the department of defense examined its records to determine which personnel may actually have been exposed and what level of exposure they may have experienced however deployment records and troop movement data could not pinpoint exposure with accuracy congress drew the conclusion that exposure to agent orange or to other herbicides regardless of their toxicity at sufficient levels to be potentially diseasecausing had to be presumed given the widespread use of herbicides because exposure to toxic herbicides was presumed for any military personnel who served in vietnam during the period in which agent orange was used science need only find some evidence suggestive of an association between particular disease and exposure to herbicides at any level in order to validate presumption that the disease is serviceconnected presumption for spina bifida in 1996 congress amended va law to grant the presumption of serviceconnection to claims on behalf of children stricken by the disease spina bifida who are born to vietnam veterans spina bifida is birth related disease that can entail intensive and expensive assistance to the child for years the basis for this expansion was national academy of sciences nas report reviewing studies of correlation between toxic exposure of vietnam veterans and children born to them with spina bifida while the scientific studies were inconclusive nas did find some evidence suggestive of such correlation expanding presumptions and the persian gulf war syndrome after returning from service in the persian gulf war some veterans began complaining of illnesses that they thought might be attributable to their service there commonly reported symptoms included fatigue muscle and joint pain severe headaches and memory loss media reports began to characterize the array of symptoms as the gulf war syndrome although single illness with the multitude of symptoms has been diagnosed and common characteristics of the veterans circumstances have been identified other than persian gulf service on land or at sea although majority of ill veterans have been diagnosed with recognized disease significant number remain undiagnosed and appear to be suffering from multiple illnesses with overlapping symptoms and causes congress provided for all illness claims of persian gulf war veterans to be examined at va medical facilities illnesses diagnosed whenever possible symptoms treated if necessary and database created to facilitate further research into causes9 more than 100 federallyfunded research studies pertaining to gulf war illnesses are underway to date clinical studies have not found an unexplained increase in deaths hospitalizations or diagnosed diseases among the gulf war veteran population evidence has been found of new or unique disease connected to gulf war service 9 the dod medical registry and the va persian gulf health registry have had some clinical evaluation contact with about 100000 of the nearly 700000 gulf war veterans crs30 evidence steadily emerges that gulf war veterans were in complex environment contaminated by multiple chemical substances some of which had been introduced to improve the safety and comfort of friendly forces perhaps as many as 25000 american soldiers may have been exposed to chemical weapons while they were not actually used in combat some believe the destruction of the weapons released toxins that may have caused illnesses with delayed symptoms so far medical experts report that conclusive evidence has been presented that persian gulf war illnesses are related to chemical weapons but studies of the possible effects of multiple chemical exposure including the effects of lowlevel exposure to chemical weapons are underway the presidential advisory committee on gulf war veterans illnesses finding thatmany veterans clearly are experiencing medical difficulties connected to their service in the gulf war the advisory committee reviewed numerous studies of gulf war veterans and their health complaints the advisory committees report dated december 31 1996 concluded that scientific evidence had not produced causal link between symptoms and illnesses reported by gulf war veterans and exposure to pesticides chemical warfare agents biological warfare agents vaccines pyridostigmine bromide infectious diseases depleted uranium oil well fires and smoke and petroleum products nevertheless the advisory committee recommended further research in several areas including the medical risks especially longterm risks that might be related to multichemical exposure lowlevel exposure to chemical warfare agents and other toxic substances with recognized carcinogenic potential that were known to be present in the persian gulf war finally the report of the advisory committee emphasized the need to examine closely the relationship between wartime stress and the broad range of physiological and psychological illnesses currently being reported by gulf war veterans10 priority health care authority to provide high priority medical care for vietnam veterans with diseases presumed linked to herbicide exposure expires december 31 2002 authorization for priority health care for veterans with diseases presumed linked to radiation exposure has been made permanent pl 105368 extended high priority health care for persian gulf veterans through 2001 expanded coverage to include treatments for veterans dependents when their illnesses are related to the veterans gulf war service and required va to seek advice from the national academy of sciences on ways in which these veterans could be more effectively treated the law also established an independent mechanism recommended by the academy so that research into gulf war illness claims could be evaluated outside of the federal government federal research the dod va and hhs through the persian gulf veterans coordinating board have established comprehensive research program to provide information about the prevalence distribution and causes of illnesses among gulf war veterans according to gao report federal agencies spent total of 37 million on research on gulf war veterans illnesses through fy1996 and 10 report of the presidential advisory committee on gulf war veterans illnesses p 125 crs31 several additional projects are currently underway for additional information on federal research see crs report 9821 gulf war veterans illnesses federal research and legislative mandates potential for adverse effects of the persian gulf presumptions on future scientific studies in the absence of firm scientific evidence to the contrary congress has given veterans of the persian gulf war the benefitofthe doubt that their ailments may be connected to their military service however the basis for establishing scientifically link between an exposure to risk and the incidence of disease could be further eroded persian gulf war veterans were potentially exposed to large number of toxins and are now authorized to receive priority treatment for virtually unlimited list of symptoms researchers caution that it may be impossible to identify the causes of illness in many gulf war veterans because of the absence of baseline data on the health of military personnel and the lack of reliable data on levels of exposure to potential risks in their wartime environment in effect because both exposure to toxic risk and the presence of disorder are presumed the statistical relationship between the risk level for one and the incidence of the other may be indeterminable overcoming presumed serviceconnection tobacco related illnesses in the 105th congress action was taken to prevent serviceconnection to toxic risk after several years of study in 1997 va had concluded that nicotine addiction is disease that could be linked to tobacco use that began during military service thus if nicotine addiction has its origins in military service then secondary diseases linked to tobacco use were arguably serviceconnected while there are actual data on the number of total possible claims the potential number of claims was in the millions moreover the echo of serviceconnected claims could have continued for decades through compensation automatically paid to the dependents and survivors of veterans who die from serviceconnected conditions at issue was the governments responsibility when its military personnel made unwise health choices which were at least facilitated if not openly encouraged by government actions some argued that american taxpayers should not be held liable for illnesses caused by veterans decisions to use harmful tobacco products however as former va official pointed out during recent hearing our veterans were in many cases provided that first cigarette by our government as part of their daily food ration or as part of comfort pack clearly the government was the agent that ultimately gave those cigarettes to our veterans while some veterans advocates vigorously opposed changing the law others focused on securing some of the savings for veterans benefits provision restricting va from paying compensation to veterans for adverse effects of tobacco use was included in pl 105178 the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 similar proposal in the presidents fy1999 budget estimated the 5year savings at 169 billion 154 billion of that estimated savings were used to offset spending for highway projects and the remainder was directed toward improvements in various veterans benefits for further information
