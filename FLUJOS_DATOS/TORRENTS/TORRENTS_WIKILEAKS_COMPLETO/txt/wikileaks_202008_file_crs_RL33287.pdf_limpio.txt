protecting the privacy of phone records background according to recent press accounts and recent petition filed with the federal communications commission fcc by the electronic privacy information center epic numerous websites advertise the sale of personal telephone records1 specifically data brokers dvertise the availability of cell phone records which include calls to and from particular ce ll phone number the duration of such calls and may include the physical location of the cell phone in addition to selling cell phone call records many data brokers also claim to provide calling records for landline and voice over internet protoc ol voip phones as well as nonpublished phone numbers data brokers claim to be able to provide this information fairly quickly in few hours to few days although personal information such as social security numbers can be found on public documents phone records ar stored only by phone companies2 for this reason data brokers are alleged to have obtained phone records from the phone companies themselves albeit without their pproval it is also believed that data brokers have taken advantage of inadequa company security standards to gain access to customer telephone information da ta brokers are thought to employ three different practices to obtai n customer telephone records without the approval of the customer the first method ccurs when an employee of one of the phone companies sells the records to the data broker the second method occurs through practice called pretexting where data broker pr etends to be the owner of the phone and obtains the records from the telephone comp any under false pretenses the third method is employed when data broker obt ains the customers telephone records by accessing the customers account on the internet phone companies are believe d to have strict rules preventing and guarding against the employee sale of telephone r ecords and the unauthorized acquisition of customer information on the

datatheft investigations have shown that finding someone on the insi to bribe is not that difficult3 pretext calling for customer telephone r ecords occurs when the data broker or investigator pretends to be the ce ll phone account holde r and persuades phone company employees to releas the information the public availability of personal identifiers like the social security number makes it easier for someone to impersonate the account holder to convin ce the employee that they are the account holder telephone companies are encouraging customers to receive electronic statements and to access customer account s online typically online accounts are set up in advance to be activated at later date by the customer if someone can figure out how to activate and access the online account of the customer the call records can be obtained with respect to the issue of who is purchasing the phone records from data brokers epic recently investigated this question and concluded that attorneys are among the top users of private investigat ors and pretexting in response to its finding epic wrote to state bar ethics committees noting that it has become increasingly clear that attorneys are major consumers of pretexting services in this letter we request that appropriate action be taken to ensure that attorneys in your state are not employing investigators or ot her
