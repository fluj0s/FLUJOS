from tom wigley wigleymeekerucaredu to mike hulme mhulmeueaacuk subject re co2 concentrations date wed 19 may 1999 162151 0600 mdt cc mike maccracken mmaccracusgcrpgov dear mike yes i am aware of the confusion surrounding what the hadley centre did and why it is even messier than you realize i have forcing data sets more than one from jonathon gregory that differ from the numbers you gave in your email the hadley people have clearly screwed things up but their errors dont really matter given all of the uncertainties i didnt mention this because i thought that opening up that can of worms would confuse people even more in my view trying to keep things as simple as possible the key points are these 1 the hadcm2 run purports to be is92a and it is good approximation to this 2 their use of 1 compounded for co2 is reasonable approximation to the is92a ghg forcing which itself is uncertain 3 the climate model output is also uncertain 4 the pure co2 input to is92a is what i have distributed from the bern model 5 hence the best and simplest combination is to use hadcm2 climate output with these point 4 priori defined pure co2 concentrations for is92a on wed 19 may 1999 mike hulme wrote tom thanks for clarifying your thinking on this i still have problem with hadcm2 forcing and making sense of what hadley have published esp the numbers in the feb 1997 jclimate paper by mitchell and johns there they make it clear that the model was presented with co2equiv rising from 473ppmv in 1990 to 1414ppmv in 2100 ie 1 pa increase this seems precise and unambiguous so i dont think they do adjust the co2equiv growth ratio c2100c1990 to 3127 ie about 105 pa as you suggest this concentration scenario yielded 19902100 model forcing of 65wm2 sic close to that reported by mitchell and gregory in 1992 mitchell and johns 1997 using stuge my estimate for that is about 62wm2 both of these are quite bit higher than the 58wm2 forcing in ipcc sar for is92a with this apparently higher forcing i reasoned that all else being equal the actual co2 concentrations that are consistent with hadcm2 should also be higher that those cited in ipcc sar and hence we could not just use the co2 concentrations from magicc or the bern model hence my somewhat higher co2 estimates of 790ppmv by 2100 were arrived at by using pco2 279ppmv expf347ln2 where f is the proportion in magicc of total forcing due to co2 alone for is92a the mitchelljohns jclimate paper is confusing however because it also presents results in their table 1 which shows 19902100 hadcm2 forcing of only 55wm2 sic value that relates to their textcited value of 65wm2 only by using dq of 505wm2 ie the sensitivity of hadcm2 rather than dq 63wm2 yet the text of the paper continues to imply the hadcm2 forcing is 12 higher than kattenburg rather than 5 lower the bottom line the is92a sar forcing of 5758wm2 and dq of 63wm2 only yields co2equiv growth rate of just over 08 pa rising to nearly 09 pa if the hadcm2 dq of 505wm2 is used these are still some way short of 1 pa regards mike ps this is now more matter for my own curiousity since i agree that for most assessment purposes the wigleyjoos numbers are the best to use at 1536 180599 0600 you wrote dear all ive just read the emails of may 14 onwards regarding co2 i must say that i am stunned by the confusion that surrounds this issue basically i and maccracken are right and felzer schimel and to lesser extent hulme are wrong there is absolutely categorically doubt about this let explain 1 the hadley centre run is meant to simulate the climate change consequences of the full is92a emissions scenario 2 in this scenario there are the following concentration and forcing changes over 19902100 item c2100 dq19902100 co2 708 4350 ch4 3470 0574 n2o 414 0368 halos 0315 tropo3 0151 ghgs 5758 so4 dir 0284 so4 indir 0370 total 5104 these are the numbers i used in ch 6 of the sar they do not agree precisely with numbers in ch 2 because i used the models and formulae embedded in magicc the differences between ch 2 and ch 6 are irrelevant to the present issue 3 how does one simulate the combined effects of all the ghgs in climate model that only has co2 the standard way is to take the ghg radiative forcing ending in 5758wm2 in 2100 in this case and convert this to equivalent co2 concentration changes if one uses the old ipcc90 forcing formula for co2 which is what was used in the sar viz dq63 lncc0 then c2100c1990 is 2494 note that the 1 compounded change would be c2100c19901011102988 thus 1 compounded co2 gives roughly the correct forcing note that the actual co2 changes are not the co2 changes used in the model the model uses artificial co2 changes scaled up to account for forcing from other ghgs note that the actual co2 change is from 354ppmv in 1990 to 708ppmv in 2100 this is not 1 compounded increase note further that what mike hulme suggests in his point 8 is also wrong it is wrong to back out the co2 from forcings the co2 was specified priori note finally that mike does give the 708ppmv value in his point 9 using this would be ok but i recommend using the slightly different bern model results see below 4 now some minor wrinkles in the hadley centre model for co2 dq505 ln cc0 hence to get forcing of 5758wm2 they need to use c2100c19903127 note that this is little closer to the 1 compounded result than my above calculation the hadley centre may well have used slightly different total 19902100 ghg forcing than mine so they may have backed out compounded co2 increase rate even closer to 1 than the above in any event if they decided to go with 1 then this was perfectly reasonable choice in order to capture the total ghg forcing 5 the 708ppmv c2100 value is what comes out of my carbon cycle model in the sar in ch 2 we considered results from three different carbon cycle models mine the bern joos model and atul jains model for illustrations in the sar we used the bern model the mid2100 value with this model for is92a was 7117ppmv later version of this model used in ipcc tp4 gives 7115ppmv jains model gave 7123ppmv 6 the bottom line here is that for consistent pairing of hadley centre climate and co2 one must use the actual co2 numbers that went into calculating the radiative forcing not the equivalent co2 numbers the climate response reflects all ghgs whereas the plants are responding only to co2 7 i am attaching the joos co2 time series i recommend using the actual values rather than trying to fit compound co2 increase to themwhich in any event should not be done using just the end point values this however is your choice differences will be negligible in terms of plant response i hope this clarifies things it has always seemed pretty obvious and clear cut to i hope it will now to all
