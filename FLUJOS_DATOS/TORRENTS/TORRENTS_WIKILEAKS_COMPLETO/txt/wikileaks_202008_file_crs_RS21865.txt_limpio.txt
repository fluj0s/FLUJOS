rights in afghanistan and iraq has taken on new relevance following the usled military actions in afghanistan in 2001 and the invasion of iraq in 2003 and the subsequent reconstruction efforts one of the major questions facing the united states regarding the reconstruction process is the extent to which the united states can help women reintegrate into the political educational and economic spheres after long period of societal decline exacerbated by several major wars and in the case of iraq more than decade of economic sanctions advancing the position of women and committing adequate resources to women and girls education have both been linked on global level to the achievement of efficient and stable development particularly in post conflict regions1 1 see crs report rl32376

issues such as refugee care and resettlement health and job training these broader humanitarian and reconstruction programs may include women and children but have other points of focus as well making

in iraq5 although figures on total us spending on iraqi womens programs are not available the bush administration has launched some initiatives in the past year targeting women in light of increasing violence in iraq it is difficult to assess the extent to which these programs have been sustained6 congressional action in conference report language hrept 108337 accompanying the fy2004 emergency

programs will continue after the june 30 handover and will be administered through the local us embassy issues for congress challenges for women within afghanistan and iraq in the transition to postconflict environment afghan and iraqi women face particular challenges especially in climate of uncertainty and insecurity critical step in the promotion of womens participation in local and national governance will be their ability to register for and vote freely in elections campaign for political office and have full confidence in the design interpretation and implementation of their constitution congressional funding for democracy building will obviously have an impact on womens roles in each country particularly amid the ongoing security challenges other key issues include participation in the workforce educational opportunities and access to health care designating funds for women one of the key ways congress has had an impact on the situation for afghan women has been through series of legislative httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21865 earmarks to date in iraq although some funds have been designated to include women such as 10 million for the iraqi womens democracy initiative congress has not used legislative earmarks extensively for womens programs oversight and reporting similarly in terms of oversight and reporting the afghan women and children relief act of 2001 pl 10781 mandates that the state department submit an annual status report to congress on spending for afghan women such legislation or mandate has yet been developed for iraqi women but anticipated supplemental appropriations in early 2005 might provide greater specificity on funding allocations12 future developments in consideration of the funding appropriated in fy2003 and fy2004 there are some similarities in the approach taken by the united states to improve the lives of afghan and iraqi women however not only do afghanistan and iraq have different starting point in terms of economic development and assistance from the international community but the timetables for reconstruction are uniquely influenced by ongoing events on the ground although it is too soon to draw specific lessons learned from either country as congress examines the progress of reconstruction programs for women it may be important to consider the effect of religious versus secular forces the variation in local traditions and cultures and the differences between rural and urban communities to see if the assistance provided to afghan and iraqi women is effective and can be used as model in future postconflict regions 11 usaid accomplishments in iraq mar 2003 to mar 2004 march 18 2004 httpwwwwreliefwebintwrwbnsfscec16d9f9a47731085256e5c0056ee14 12 hconres 196 may 2003 and hconres 342
