updated september 24 2008 deborah d stine specialist in science and technology policy resources science and industry division the manhattan project the apollo program and federal energy technology rd programs comparative analysis summary some policymakers have concluded that the energy challenges facing the united states are so critical that concentrated investment in energy research and development rd should be undertaken the manhattan project which produced the atomic bomb and the apollo program which landed american men on the moon have been cited as examples of the success such rd investments can yield investment in federal energy technology rd programs of the 1970s in response to two energy crises have generally been viewed as less successful than the earlier two efforts this report compares and contrasts the three initiatives in 2007 dollars the cumulative cost of the manhattan project over 5 fiscal years was approximately 21 billion of the apollo program over 14 fiscal years approximately 96 billion of postoil shock energy rd efforts over 35 fiscal years 115 billion measure of the nations commitments to the programs is their relative shares of the federal outlays during the years of peak funding for the manhattan program the peak year funding was 1 of federal outlays for the apollo program 22 and for energy technology rd programs 05 another measure of the commitment is their relative shares of the nations gross domestic product gdp during the peak years of funding for the manhattan project and the apollo program the peak year funding reached 04 of gdp and for the energy technology rd programs 01 besides funding several criteria might be used to compare these three initiatives including perception of the program or threat goal clarity and the customer of the technology being developed by these criteria while the manhattan project and the apollo program may provide some useful analogies for thinking about an energy technology rd initiative there are fundamental differences between the forces that drove these historical rd success stories and the forces driving energy technology rd today critical differences include 1 the ability to transform the program or threat into concrete goal and 2 the use to which the technology would be put on the issue of goal setting for the manhattan project the response to the threat of enemy development of nuclear bomb was the goal to construct bomb for the apollo program the threat of soviet space dominance was translated into specific goal of landing on the moon for energy the response to the problems of insecure oil sources and high prices has resulted in multiple sometimes conflicting goals regarding use both the manhattan project and the apollo program goals pointed to technologies primarily for governmental use with little concern about their environmental impact for energy in contrast the hopedfor outcome depends on commercial viability and mitigation of environmental impacts from energy use although the manhattan project and the apollo program may provide some useful analogies for funding these differences may limit their utility regarding energy

took place from 1942 to 19462 beginning in 1939 some key scientists expressed concern that germany might be building an atomic weapon and proposed that the united states accelerate atomic research in response following the pearl harbor attack in december 1941 the united states entered world war ii in january 1942 president franklin d roosevelt gave secret tentative approval for the development of an atomic bomb the army corps of engineers was assigned the task and set up the manhattan engineer district to manage the project bomb research and design laboratory was built at alamos new mexico due to uncertainties regarding production effectiveness two possible fuels for the reactors were produced with uranium enrichment facilities at oak ridge tennessee and plutonium production facilities at hanford washington in december 1942 roosevelt gave final approval to construct nuclear bomb bomb 1 examples in the 110th congress include bills such as the new manhattan project for energy

manhattan project was deemed to have fulfilled its mission although some additional nuclear weapons were still assembled in 1946 the civilian atomic energy commission was established to manage the nations future atomic activities and the manhattan project officially ended according to one estimate the manhattan project cost 22 billion from 1942 to 1946 21 billion in 2007 dollars which is much greater than the original cost and time estimate of approximately 148 million for 1942 to 19443 general leslie groves who managed the manhattan project has written that members of congress who inquired about the project were discouraged by the secretary of war from asking questions or visiting sites4 after the project was under way for over year in february 1944 war department officials received essentially blank check for the project from congressional leadership who remained completely in the dark about the manhattan project according to groves and other experts5 the apollo program

1961 after the soviet union became the first nation to launch human into space the goals of the apollo program were to land americans on the moon and return them safely to earth to establish the technology to meet other national interests in space to achieve preeminence in space for the united states to carry out program of scientific exploration of the moon and to develop mans capability to work in the lunar environment8 the program included threepart spacecraft to take two astronauts to the moon surface support them while on the moon and return them to earth9 saturn rockets were used to launch this equipment in july 1969 apollo 11 achieved the goal of landing americans on the moon and returning them safely to earth the last lunar landing took place in december 1972 the apollo program

time americans began to experience rapidly rising prices for fuel and related goods and services12 until then energy rd had been focused on the development of nuclear power under the atomic energy commission aec after the manhattan project ended congress had established the aec to manage both civilian and military projects in the atomic energy act of 1946 pl 7958513 in response to the energy crisis congress subsumed the aec including the manhattan project facilities and other energy programs into the energy research and development administration erda which became the focus for federal energy technology rd and the nuclear regulatory commission nrc as part of the energy reorganization act of 1974 pl 9343814 in the department of energy organization act of 1977 pl 9591 congress decided to combine the activities of erda with approximately 50 other energy offices and programs in new department of energy doe which began operations on october 1 197715 in 1979 the iranian revolution

scale of funding for most of does energy rd programs dropped steadily during the 1980s see figure 1 the large energy technology demonstration projects funded during the late 1970s and early 1980s were viewed by some as too elaborate and insufficiently linked to either existing energy research or the marketplace16 well known example is the synthetic fuels corporation sfc17 the goal of sfc was to support large scale projects that industry was unwilling to support due to the technical environmental or financial uncertainties the program ended in 1986 due to 12 energy information administration

below funding table 1 provides comparison of the total and annual average program costs for the manhattan project apollo program and federal energy technology rd program since the first energy crisis annual average longterm 19742008 doe energy technology rd funding was approximately 3 billion in 2007 constant dollars as is the fy2008 budget and the fy2009 budget request21 in comparison the annual average funding in 2007 constant dollars for the manhattan project was 4 billion and for the apollo program and the doe energy technology program at its peak 19751980 was 7 billion at the time of peak funding the percentage of federal spending devoted to doe energy technology rd was half that of the manhattan project and onefifth that of the apollo program from an overall economy standpoint the percentage of the gross domestic product gdp spent on doe energy technology rd in the peak funding year was onefourth that spent on either the manhattan project or the apollo program as shown in figure 2 although cumulative funding for the doe energy technology rd program is greater than for the manhattan project or the apollo program the annual funding for each of the historical programs was higher than that for energy technology rd which occurred over greater number of years this is an important distinction the manhattan project and the apollo program were specific and distinct funding efforts whereas the national energy rd effort has been ongoing over longer period of time in all three cases rapid increase in funding was followed by rapid decline 21 for information on the doe

update doe data crs report rs22858 renewable energy rd funding history comparison with funding for nuclear energy fossil energy and energy efficiency rd by fred sissine threat perception the manhattan project and apollo project were both responses to perceived threats which compelled policymaker support for these initiatives the manhattan project took place during world war ii although the public might have been unaware of the potential threat of germanys use of nuclear weapons and the manhattan project the president and members of congress could feel confident about public support for the war effort of which the manhattan project was part similarly the apollo program took place during the cold war with the union of soviet socialist republics ussr when the ussr launched the sputnik satellite and first man into space the us public felt threatened by the potential that the ussr might take leadership in the development of space flight technology and potentially greater control of outer space president jimmy carter said that with the exception of preventing war this energy crisis is the greatest challenge that our country will face during our lifetime our decision about energy will test the character of the american people and the ability of the president and the congress to govern this nation this difficult effort will be the crs9 moral equivalent of war except that we will be uniting our efforts to build and not to destroy22 the threat to which investment in energy technology rd responds however is largely economic rather than military in addition the threat posed by climate change which is related to energy consumption will likely be gradual and long term23 goal clarity another issue is the degree to which there is clarity and consensus on the program goal the manhattan project had clear and singular goal the creation of nuclear bomb for the apollo program the goal was also clear and singular land american astronauts on the moon and return them safely to earth in the case of energy technology rd however the overall goal of clean affordable and reliable energy is multifaceted while energy independence has from time to time been rallying cry energy technology rd has in fact been driven by at least three not always commensurate goals resource and technological diversity commercial viability and environmental protection to help reduce the risk of dependence on single energy source diversity of resources and energy technologies have always been seen as goal of the energy rd program second unlike the manhattan project or the apollo program the doe energy technology rd program seeks ultimately to be commercially viable third the energy rd program must meet environmental goals including reducing the impact of energyrelated activities on land water air and climate change technology customer another comparison criterion is the customer for technologies that may result from the rd the government was the customer for both the manhattan project and apollo program the private sector is the ultimate customer for any energy technology developed as result of federal energy rd programs therefore the marketability of any technologies developed will be key determinant of the degree to which the program is successful moreover the inherent involvement of the private sector raises number of issues related to the appropriateness of different government roles some believe that focusing rd on one particular technology versus another may result in government instead of the marketplace picking winners and losers24 some experts believe that the most important driver for private sector deployment or commercialization is not the need for new technologies 22 president jimmy carter address to the nation on energy speech april 18

see crs report rl33528 industrial competitiveness and technological advancement debate over government policy by wendy h schacht crs10 but regulation or economic incentives25 others however believe that without government support and intervention the private sector is unlikely to conduct the rd necessary to achieve the public goal of clean affordable and reliable energy and that current technologies are insufficient to achieve this goal26 implications for congress when the manhattan project and the apollo program are used as analogies for future doe energy technology rd the following points may be important to consider to be equivalent in annual average funding doe energy technology rd funding would need to increase from approximately 3 billion in fy2008 to at least 4 billion per program year to match the manhattan project funding or 7 billion per program year to match apollo program funding levels or doe energy technology rd funding at its peak to be equivalent of peak year funding would require even greater increases in terms of federal outlays energy technology rd funding would need to increase from 05 to 1 manhattan project or 22 apollo program of federal outlays as percentage of gdp this funding would need to increase from 01 to 04 of gdp for both the manhattan project and the apollo program both the manhattan project and the apollo program had singular and specific goal for the manhattan project the response to the threat of enemy development of nuclear bomb was the goal to construct bomb for the apollo program the threat of soviet space dominance was translated into specific goal of landing on the moon for energy however the response to the problems of insecure oil sources and high prices has resulted in multiple sometimes conflicting goals both the manhattan project and the apollo program goals pointed to technologies primarily for governmental use with little concern about their environmental impact for energy in contrast the hoped for outcome depends on commercial viability and mitigation of the environmental impacts of the energy technologies developed although the manhattan project and the apollo program may provide some useful
