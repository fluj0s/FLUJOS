r212 data lecture given on 11 december 1962 thank you okay this is the what audience 11 december the 10th dec audience 11th the 11th how did you get up into the 11th the things youve been doing first lecture saint hill special briefing course december the 11th ad 12 okay well if it hadnt been for the work done in the v unit i wouldnt be able to give you this lecture there was little bit of an odd bit i wanted to know if these oppose lists that have been laying eggs on routine 212and you just didnt get anythingif those things extended would give you an item and on case after case both on the oppose and represent lists when you think you are skunked all you have to do is continue the list very simple very simple now lot of you think 212 is very complicated you think its very complicated activity frankly you can get experience with great rapidity on 212 id say within 150 hours of auditing on it if youre doing it right you ought to become quite an expert i said 150 hours of auditing because thats how long it took but of course remember i was piloting it from scratch and didnt know anything about it at the beginning so i think you ought to make it in hundred and fifty hours knowing all about it before you start isnt that terrible thats not snide professorial commentthats just fact now your troubles arent with 212 thats what were learning youre not having any trouble with 212youre just having trouble with auditing i think thats quite interesting mary sue pulled one tonight at the supper table that really had laughing she said offhandedly she says well theyre still using mid ruds for style thats marvelous you know gives you this gorgeous picture you see of the auditor sitting there busily getting in mid ruds for style see and its little things like pcs got 1825 missed withholds and 16 overts on the auditor and the list is incomplete and there youre getting into 212 the list doesnt even have to be incomplete and the auditor gets in the mid ruds and the needle is still good and dirty oh we had remark on report the other dayactually were having ball with this stuffwe had remark on report the other day that is an indicator of using the mid rud for style the auditor said well i got in the mid ruds for the session and got in the mid ruds for the list but i still had dirty needle so i determined and he went off in some other wild direction hes already handed you complete imponderable how in the name of god could you get in the mid ruds see for the session and get it in for the list and still have dirty needle see it wouldnt even matter if your list was incomplete youre not talking about list youre just talking about mid ruds to this pc and so there it is might take the random rudiment or something like that on some cases to pull the missed withholds but you sure couldnt wind up with anything less than clean needle so what i picked up about the middle of the weekwhat i picked up about the middle of the week was the fact that people were trying to start nulling lists that had dirty needles see there was dirty needle and they take the thing and the needles going zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz and they start the first one tiger waterbuck i dont know what theyre doing i dont know what they could be doing because they couldnt tell if it was reading or not reading now the only time you have to be able to learn to read through dirty needle is when the needle is so dirty that you cant tell what mid rud is out now you can do that that does pose problem its going tick tick ticketytick ticketytick and you say has anything been suppressed and it just keeps up the same ticketytick and you say has it been invalidated and it keeps up the same ticketytick and then you get to suggest and its doing the same ticketytick and you say well its probably fail to reveal and you get fail to reveal and its still the same ticketytick and actually it was the suppress and the invalidate but he had answers but didnt this is wild see trying to read through one of these needles to get the mid ruds inthat ill grant you takes some doing as an auditor that is sometimes little bit hard but i will tell you how to do that there is nothing much to it you just put the emeter aside and put in the mid ruds then come back and see if your needles clean you understand and very often you will have caught it the needle still wont be going tickety tick now variation of this is have you thought of anything but have you ever realized that this puts an awful lot of responsibility on the pc if you overuse that or try to make that substitute for the mid ruds you get this kind of situation will you please selfaudit for moment to straighten things out so that i can go on auditing you pc has guidance or anything like that you just say well im having rough time here lets see if you can help out something like that anything been suppressed and he tells you something anything being invalidated and he tells you something anything been suggested and he says and you say well anything you failed to reveal and he says i well yes as matter of fact there was and so forth well hes giving you some answers isnt he well it certainly is going to change the characteristics of that needle now you come back and look at the needle and its inits sufficiently clean so that you can read the remainders now you can run crosschecksomething like that you say lets justnow let make sure that all the suppressions are off of this this is the one most commonly neglected by the pc because suppress equals forget and you saw on demonstration one night and the pc did wonderfully i actually cleaned up every question i asked except the suppress remember that tv demonstration i had aabout quarterofadial drop on suppress and the pc said thats clean now why is that thats because suppress equals forget you realize some pc says to you i had an item moment ago but i sure dont know what it was hes told you that hes suppressed something now thats time for you to jump in there with all four feet and try to do this and that you make awful mistakes when the pc said i had an item but now ive forgotten it and you say what was it oh brother thats the time to wish that you hadnt gotten up that morning because your rudiments are going to go out from there on in see because the pc will earnestly try to remember this thing see actually its just an originso you just acknowledge it see later on hell think of it youve listed few more items and all of sudden the pc will probably startle you out of your stance as an auditor say hey hey wait minute wait minute wait minute that was pig pig what pig you see youve forgotten about the whole thing that was fifteen minutes ago you know it eventually percolates on up to the surface but oddly enough ifive made direct test of this for your benefit the pc says i had an item moment ago but ive forgotten it and you say okay it doesnt now show up as missed withhold or it doesnt show up as withhold which is very peculiar all right the pc says i had an item moment ago but now ive forgotten it and you say well what was it does anything suppress it did you suppress it or something well i must have suppressed it let see what it was and now it registers as missed withhold in other words you can key it in with your question of what was it you get too busy thats the trouble with you in handling your mid ruds and that sort of thing youre using them for stylea wonderful gag he looked awfully good using the mid ruds you know didnt have any effect on the pcs needle but it looked awfully good your most flagrant fault then is just failing to get clean needle which is an element of auditing before you start in you fail to get clean needle thats all and youre trying to take off and null list with the needle dirtied up with things that have nothing to do with the list and then you wonder if the list is complete or not and try to use the dirtiness of the needle to test whether or not the list is complete well it alla great many faults and errors can stem from just this one fact that you havent got clean needle what are the mid ruds for clean needle thats what theyre for they clean it up now goal finders model session is actually better than old model session providing you always put in big mid ruds now in r212 there is substitute for an auditor who knows his basic mechanics and were talking now about the basic mechanics of auditing auditor knows tr 0 1 2 3 4 auditor doesnt qanda auditor knows an emeter auditor can smooth out needle used to say put in the rudiments well actually dont care whether you put the rudiments in or notsmooth out the needle and then that makes sense see putting in the rudiments is not something that can be plumbed measured and weighed but you can sure take look at this needle and know that the rudiments have been put inor not if that needle has any kind of pattern of any kind whatsoever the rudiments are not in on that pc period thats all well that makes it pretty tough because most of the pcs that show up have got some kind of tick and tock and plish and plock well thats all caused by missed withholds so were back into the basics of auditingpulling missed withholds and so forth that sort of thing these are just fundamentals of auditinghas nothing to do with 212 now we utterly neglect the fundamentals of auditing and let some guy fumble all over the place with the fundamentals and then we add 212 on top of it as complication and of course weve got cows breakfast man it is mess well your needle is dirty from the fundamentals of auditing and its being dirtied up by an incomplete list and the last list you didnt complete now how the hell are you going to make any sense out of this well youve got to start in at the beginning and get in the fundamentals of auditing thats all now posing the problem of how to clean up needle how do you clean up needle you of course are just posing the problem of fundamental auditing and dont ever make mistake about this see youre just saying this is fundamental auditing you pull the missed withholds you straighten out auditing on this person you do this and you do that you actually could do it this way you could take an oldtime prepcheck take some period or period you just say in auditing has anything been suppressed or something like this you run an eighteenbutton prepcheck something like this and youre going to clean up the needle of course thats the long way to do it but it sure can be done itsyou couldyou could do it meterless except for the suppress button which would get you in trouble because it means forget and youd wind up at the other end of this well if you just did suppress and invalidate on this guy you know gave him prepcheck assistthis is getting very popular in new york right now people turning up after lot of auditing and the cchs and that sort of thing and their needle is just filthy and one of the boys in new york got the idea of prepcheck assist he straightened out one or two of these needles and he noticed that they were straightening out in just you know just four or five hours and hed had them straightyou know it was all smooth and fine so hes got atheyre given prepcheck assist whereby they merely clean up suppress and invalidate and thats quite interesting i dont know how far theyd get with that sort of thing because out of the eighteen buttons theres always one of them thats hotter than the remainder and its not always suppress and its not always invalidate but if you were to take an assessment of the eighteen buttons and get the couple that fell the most or get one that fell the most and then ran that for couple of hours and then assess it again and get the other one and ran that for an hour or two or whenever the pc said it was flat why youd clean up needle now this idea of needle pattern then is not something that you should i be blowing your brains out over similarly very very high tone arm is not something to go on worrying about because the exact activity which i just gave you will knock tone arm down this has nothing to do with 212 the data im giving you here it just has to do with basic stuff i mean we got lot of this stuff around i dont know maybe you can straighten out dirty needle with touch assist well weve had lot of stuff here for long time now just add this up and benefit from it and heres riches for you you see so this pc it goes ticktock bzz brrr bzzz ticktock and hes sitting down there and you try to put in this session see oh man that isnt going to go anyplace because it was dirty when he came into session see and you say well lets pull some missed withholds and this sort of straightens it out little bit and its still going tick and its still going tock and that sort of thing well you could sit down and pull missed withholds until it got clean but you also could run couplethe first two buttons just suppress and you know just in auditing has anything been suppressed you know we dont care if hes been audited for twelve years or one year see youre going to get someplace with this thing and then pull some missed withholds you see this is all basic fundamental stuff you put it all together and you dont get dogs breakfast you get very nice looking clean needle in other words dont try to run something fancy on case before the case is ready to run well how many hours should be invested in straightening out case before you start auditing them on something and so forth well damn few let tell you very very few very few indeed if youre very good at pulling missed missed withholdsmissed square withholdsyoure very very good at that you could probably straighten up the whole needle on that but ill tell you something else ive straightened out needle with 212 and thats weird one well how do you assess it well just genius you know you can read down list of stuff and if youre not stone blind and rock slammer you can see that something ticks more than something else you know that deadeasy so lets just be sensible about the thing you see lets take the old time rock slam test and lets hope weve got rock slammer sitting in front of us thats the easiest one to straighten out anybody can straighten out rock slammer thats deadeasy because you just simply find out whatever slams and oppose it see and crash crash the only time rock slammer gives you any trouble is when some other rock slammer has been trying to give him clean bill of health and hasnt reported that he slammed on scientology ron auditing and sessions see he hasnt reported this fact but he says hes clean well by this time the guy has got this all suppressed and you dont catch it right off the bat and then the case lays dead horses and then after while in desperation you just suddenly pull it out of the hat decide to give him the old testtiger drilling the buttons and see if one dirtyneedles well if hes had lot of dead horses and so forth do you know youd practically be justified even though it laid another egg just in picking the biggest read on the fundamental items and just opposing it just supposing the guy has been rock slammer see he didnt make progress so letswell lets just treat him like rock slammer see if we make any fun there see ive been working on itthis isnt rule that i can forecast but it very well may become onethat if case makes progress on 212 you treat him like rock slammer and oppose scientologyif you cant get the first three four key buttons you know see ron auditing scientology scientology organizations something like thatif you cant even pick out dirty needle see reada dirty read or something on one of those things well hell just at least oppose scientology that looks like it might one of these days become rule because weve wasted quite bit of time on just this factor of somebody says well save this birds bacon well now today nobody gives damn whether anybody was rock slammer or not particularly after you see that after persons been audited for little while he starts rock slamming on list one i dont know im going to get checked out on myself so theres disgrace in this this is cute trick some people have been pulling on this they saybecause they dont want to seem socially declassed they say it turns on pain and then you list it as though its terminal and its actually an oppterm and you just get loused up like fire drill so i have little rule that i will do on that sort of thing after somebody tells pain or sen on list one see if they tell pain then im going to give them lie test you know is there anything here that you disagree with now have you told anything in session that you thought id like to hear you know weve laid two or three eggs on this lately two cases right in this room opposed wrong way to see opposed as though they were terminals and actually it just gave the pc hell see because you oppose themyouve opposed an oppterm as though its terminal and of course youre writing backwards list youre putting the pc at effect and if you dont think that doesnt tear up their ears you get what i mean this thing actually is an oppterm and the pc says its terminal for some reason or other and then you treat it as terminal who or what would that terminal oppose and it just putsof course its an oppterm so in actual fact youre putting the pc at effect youre not putting the pc at cause and it messes them up well those are just some little things in passing on 212 but this needle is dirty i cant seem to make any headway out of the thing im not going to spend the next twentyfive hours straightening out needle because with one list with 212 itll get all dirty again anyhow see itll go through cycle of being clean and then getting dirty and then going clean again so you certainly dont want to waste the rest of your natural life poking around just trying to straighten out this needle so you need some method of straightening out the needle so you pull enough missed withholds off the pc so that you can do some kind of an assessment on list one and get into 212 as fast as you canif you take my advice on the thingand the first reliable item you find would deliver into your hands one of the cleanest looking needles youve seen in many day its as simple as that see ive seen needle nowive seen needle that was just bzzbzzzbzzbzzbzzzbzzbzzzzzzzz everythings stuck up couldnt get old model session rudiments in you know everything sort of hung up and messed up and so forth and i couldnt do any assessment and i couldnt even go over the dynamics and so forth one list that rock slammed and at the end of that list i had clean needle i hadnt even nulled the thing out yet you get what im talking about now i just listed it out till it was clean and there it was clean well what happened to all this pcs withholds and everything else well i was sitting ad center in the case and i actually found an itemtook some charge off the bankand there went clean needle see there went your dirty needledisappeared so here are two ways of approaching this thing theres not knowing any 212 not being able to enter the case not being able to assess being balked not having anything thatway to turn something like that and not having an auditor around who can pull missed withholds or somethingthey havent got the word yet you know something like this theres still something you could tell this auditor to do well just spend couple of hours on in auditing has anything been suppressed and in auditing has anything been invalidated when thats flat couple more hours of that and youll probably see the needle straighten up then coach the auditor in to say is there anything we nearly found out about you and how did you know the person thought that or why did you think so and get the rest of it up and you can straighten up needle so this is not twentyfivehour proposition or the next seventyfive hours or something like that because listen theres point at which the pcs anxiety is rekindled on noauditing basis that dirties the needle up again in other words theres point here where your efforts to clean up the needle dirty the needle up now you can always count on noauditing to dirty up needle always count on it to do so have you ever noticed this fact youre sitting there getting ready to null list youre sitting there getting ready to null list everything was very fine when you finished up that list you just had clean flowing needleeverything was fine but you stop at that point to make note on your auditors report to the effect that the tone arm is now at 35 and that this is this and that is that and the time is soandso and then you glance up and you look at the needle and its going tickety tock ticketytick ticketytick tick ticketytick tick tick well you could sit there then and get in your session mid ruds and you can clean up the needledont think you cant you can clean it up and then you turn back to your auditors report you see and next time you look at it its going ticketytock again thats anxiety the button anxiety is keying in there and the pc is in noauditing bind and so on actually the way ive been handling that particular phenomenon lately of the clean needle turns into dirty needle just because theresim taking breath to say the first word you know thats too long you know and im sayinglike this and the dirty needle turns on see well its just the pcs anxiety thats doing that kind of thing and ill just sail into the first one and then say it two or three times and say the next one two or three times and so forth now by crossing everything out as you go down through list you can also sometimes turn on dirty needle the pc gets anxious nothing is in you just keep making those ks you know making those ks making those ks making those ks making those ks well sooner or later youre going to decide that it has to be tested for suppress you test it for suppress and you promptly have dirty needle where did that dirty needle come from well it comes from the fact that the pc probably did suppress something but your asking for it keyed it in so it now registers and it wasnt active before but it is now but the main thing is the pc is scared youre going into mid ruds scared youre going into mid ruds so because theyre scared youre going into mid ruds they pull off and you now have dirty needle so this tends to discipline you not to put in the mid ruds so you do the whole list with heavy suppress on it well now those are thethose actions actually arent related to 212 theyre the actions of auditing you see theyre the actions of the pc being controlled and handled by the auditor dont you see this is the pcs anxieties about auditing the pcs confidence in the auditor the pc is insession or isnt insession and so forth the only thing i really get very alert for and really go to the mat and slow the whole session down to nothing is the pc in putting in mid ruds gives critical i get dirty needle and when i pick it up i find out it was the pc said that i had shuffled the paper loudly i know i wont have any luck now i know i wont be going anyplace now because that pc has got something i nearly found out i dont care if it was in the last three days or the last two days or in the session that pc has withhold from because that pc has given critical utterance and critical utterances are always underlain by an overtwithhold and thats the only thing i go alert for why do i go alert for that because that one critical utterance or that one attitude on the part of the pc will multiply and multiply and multiply and all of sudden im going to have screaming arc break that is the same situation that you run into an hour laterwith the pc trying to blow the session you see that im not being sarcastic but most auditors dont catch the missed withhold dont catch that arc break for an hour or an hour and half its long after theyve happened and youve got to become alert for that these are the fundamentals of auditing im talking about you see you got to become very alert for that youre putting in your mid ruds and you say well in this session has anything been suggested see and you get tick you say all right what was that and the pc said well yes you actually were saying some word little louder than the others and i thought you were suggesting that that was it thats enough man my next rudiment is nearly found out i donti dont play the motordrome game of riding the motorcycle on the vertical wall just for the cheers of the audience like some of you do if you will pardon my french because thats the one thing you cant monkey with is missed withhold see thats critical thats direct indicator great big black arrows immediately drop up in the sky and point directly to the pcs bank and they have engraved on them in gold letters which flame you see youve nearly found out something about this pc any indication of missed withhold causes to go after missed withholds pc little critical pc upset i go on the basis doesnt matter what i do as an auditor as long as im trying to audit the pc i dont merit criticism im not trying to punish the pc because the pcs criticizing and im not doing this because i dont like criticism im doing this because the session is going to blow up if i dont that is your first symptom of session blowing up pcs feeling little critical now lets move over into 212 you do couple of things wrong and youre going to be in mess and one of those things is you find slamming item and its slamming like crazy and you dont know what rock slam looks like so you dont i know that sounds incredible but there are two people here who didnt know what rock slam looked like now that sounds incredible but its true and dont you ever make that mistake in coaudit or teaching bunch of hpas hcas or something like that that you know that they know what rock slam looks like because you i say nobody could miss rock slam well let tell you people can miss rock slam they can miss them and just learn by that so this item is rock slamming like mad and for some reason or other the auditor doesnt want to embarrass the pc by pointing it out that he slams on auditor or something i dont know for what reasonor he doesnt know what rock slam is or something like thatbut he knows the thing was active so he represents it now listen it isnt always catastrophic you can get away with it often enough to make fool out of yourself all right ill give you the exact example youre standing in room burglar comes in the door with drawn gun and the telephone rings now youd feel little distracted wouldnt you and i think that if you picked up the telephone and found out it was unimportant that you would have tendency to swear as you slammed it down to take care of the other situation or something thereyoud be in an agitated state you get the idea split attention the command value of mr burglar with gun in his hand is terrific and somebodys saying look away from this thing all right the command value of rock slamming item is terrific and the persons attention isnt on the item that is slamming its on the reverse item its on the hidden item thats where their attention is mostly absorbed theyre slamming on gooney birds and the opposition terminal to gooney birds is hunters and you ask him who or what would gooney bird represent to you youve told them to take their attention off this hidden item hunters you dont even know what it is see and thats like the telephone ringing and they have to take their attention off the burglar see and it drives them around the bend they practically go out the bottom and when you get list one item and you dont oppose it if youre really mad at some rock slammer if hes really cost the organization thirtyfive thousand rand or something like thisi wont mention any areas and you really want to drive him potty and just have him so hell be out in the street waving guns in his hands ready to shoot somebody down or something like that find scientology rock slamming and then represent it all youve got to do is put represent list on scientology rock slamming item and hell go right around the bend he practically goes out through the bottom see theres hidden item there hes got his attention on this item and you tell him to put his attention on scientology and represent it and he cant do it its just nyahh see he doesnt know what hes got his attention on he just knows theres something dangerous there and youre telling him to take his attention off this dangerous thing and then to do represent on something hes only got his attention from or at dont you see youve messed up his attention see heres these two items smashed against each other his attention is totally fixated on the interrelationship between these two items this package these two reliable items against each other see thats what his attention is on and you take one of these and you start representing it youre telling him to take his attention off the other item and take it ahuuuzzzzzzzzz and he practically goes gibbering weve had two eases here slamming on list one that have been represented and boy they both almost went out the bottom and their antagonism on list one went up by the square zoooom dont you see they couldnt take this now if somebody had sat down and opposed the rock slamming itemjust like it says in 212 did it right in other wordswhy it just would have been as right as rain everything would have been fine and sweet and everything but case practically goes out the bottom now you got somebody whos slamming on three or four points of list one and you do nothing but represent lists on themoh brother thats happened here couple of times hardly anybody knew they were slamming on list one you seethis hadnt been isolated agh and they didnt know whether they were going or coming they just started out the bottom so its good way to get even with somebody if you find an item slamming nicely why represent it now if you really want case to fold up sooner or later if you find an item slamming nicely and you oppose it why stop listing just at the moment when you can barely null it to nothing and not find an item because now the item you took it from will not slam all the other slam seems to be gone and you dont see anything there and the case feels finefeels much betterbut youve got sleeper now youve got hidden pair in present time thats about the only big mistakes you can make of course you realize im just taking up 212 mistakes with you here if youafter you null the thing out if you continue to list the opposition items against the thingits not now slamming see you listed it out everything disappeared theres hardly even dirty needle left everythings gone now it all looks fine but you didnt come up with reliable item thats the only thing thats spooky about it all it just you didnt have an item after you opposed it see you start listing again on that opposition list and all of sudden the nicest biggest rock slam will turn on the original that you ever saw and youll get rock slamming item and all of sudden youll wind up withyoull have very nice big rock slamming item and youll have package in other words you can quit just short of getting package that probably would be the most puzzling mistake that you could make in 212 that would puzzle you this also happens with represent list youve got some dirty needle or something and youre representing it like mad and it represents into slamming list andnice long list and it nullseverything is out you have little bit of hard time keeping your mid ruds in but you get it you get it all nulled and you get clear on down to the bottom of it and youre theregot item and theres nothing there now and its all gone and everythings gone and you thought it was shoe trees orbut that was sort of the last one in you dont know well it all must have i know what it was they were all bonus packages you see youll always get an odd number of items one three fivei dont care what it is its always an odd number of items you get an even number of items that exactly match up on represent listthats very suspicious and probably has never happened and probably never will happen you get two items on represent list that go against each other and the whole thing folds up i think that would be almost too rare for you to include in your calculations the basic thing is the pc doesnt know about it in otherif you got bonus package you can practically count on the fact that there were three items slamming and that one of them is not yet on the list in other words if you do one of these washouts that youve been calling skunks if you think youve been skunkedit rock slammed and it all disappeared and now you havent got anything to show for it and u cant put anything on the line plot well you can put something on the line plot but it doesnt now slam youll be amazed all youve got to do is continue that list youve nulled it all dont you see and maybe you couldnt have continued it before you nulled it but the nulling of it helps you to continue it even though the pc has little bit of loss and so forth he can continue it much more easily now that its been nulled and hell give you stream of items and youll come up and therell be one going bang bang bang bang bang nice rs everythings fine got reliable item youve got something to oppose but lets say you were opposing this item on on on on on on on on on on and it comes to the end of the list and you can null the list so onthe danger point in 212 is at that point where the list is nullable but the item isnt on it and oddly enough that point can existso powerful and good are mid ruds see your auditing can be good enough actually to null list that isnt complete theres point where you couldnt null it dont you seethats just before this point but then you finally complete it up to point its got enough charge off of it so that it can be nulled and you have little hard time keeping the mid ruds in and you get it on out and then all of sudden everything goes flat everything goes flat everything disappears now this is contrary to an earlier lecture i gave you i want to give you point at this because i said if you exactly matched the things up this wouldpardon it may sound contrary to an earlier lecture i gave you i said if youd match the thing up exactly it would go psswwpssww psswwpssww and you wouldnt have much left of the package but let tell you something that can be interpreted as just by listing the thing out and nulling it it all disappears and you ask the pc what confronted what and the pc says well he guesses and so forth and that just isnt good enough the pcs got to know hes got to know for sure waterbuckstigers yeah those two went together bang you get the positiveness of the pc its very positive pcs never asking himself questions about this man thats it you know oh yes all my life ive just been terrified of water and so forth and this sort of thing and of course those things go together because i used to have bearing go down every once in while in my car and itd sort of make snarling sound and it would upset great deal on and on and on see he knows those two fit together oh yes that waterbuck that goes just up against tiger nothing else see well if you dont get that kind of phenomenon you havent vanished it down at the end now you just continue that list whether it was an oppose list or represent list and you all of sudden will see rock slam where the hell did that come from see youll see another rock slam turn on and now your list will null down to an item and the rock slam will come back on what you were opposing or come back on what you were representingit wont come back on what you were representing but itll come back on and make an ri and if youre opposing it will come back on the thing that youre opposing that is the correct statement now heres another mistake that is made people are abandoning lists which rock slam they had rock slams on them and so forth and theyre just abandoning them why well youll get disabused of this and youll get confused about what the score isand life in generalif youve taken rock slamming item and represented it rather than oppose it now if youve done that one you will now get rock slamming listthis is very bafflingwhich will go to nothing or itll just dirtyneedle forever and you cant seem to complete it and then you never go back and check the original item the item youre taking the represent from is slamming like crazy has been all this time the more you unburden it the more it slams in other words you had the item in the first place what the hell are you doing representing it in other words rock slamming item does not find another item by representing the only thing youre going to come up with on represent listyou may get bonus package or somethingbut the only thing youre going to come up with in actual fact is the item you started with youve got the rock slamming item why the hell are you doing 212 see why are you doing 2 you see what are you trying to find youve got it its sort of like bunch of firemen come up you know in their firetrucks and heres this whole apartment building on fire you know and the guys run around asking everybody in the neighborhood and phoning city hall and so forth trying to find out where the fire is you knowpaints blistering on the truck so they start fire prevention week in the area and start putting up fire prevention posters and that sort of thing and never take out single hose or do anything with the fire the pc gets very upset when you do things like this see how can you find an item that youve already got thats the question now heres sneak that happens which is not criticism of the auditor youve got an item its doing just little bit of bzz and you list and you go dirty needle and you get messy and youve got rock slams and its quite list and you go on and it doesnt seem to complete or something or others happening with it and so forth and you fail to test the item you got it from that item has been rock slamming for some little time now because you represented it it rock slams so although actually it does contain the modifier of when you get dirty needle and cant finish the list you do this in actual fact if youre very clever auditor you would always check what youre representing because it might be the item suppressed and the representing of the item cleans it up and lets it slam you see representing is very powerful auditing when you represent something you as good as prepcheck it and everything else you could probably take wrong goal and represent it and have it vanish see you get the idea i mean you could do lot of funny tricks with this thing called represent you do lot of odd tricks with this thing well dont then be surprised that you start out with something that is giving dirty needle and you do 280 items and you just dont seem to be getting anyplace and you go on to 500 items and you just dont seem to be getting anyplace and you go on to 750 items and you dont seem to be getting anyplace and so forth and all the time from about 50 items onward you have had the item its the one youre representing now sooner or later the pc is going to get kind of bugeyed as you go down that list its going to dirty needle and its going to be upsetting to the pc and so forth because now youve got his attention in bind see youre asking him to represent package its the burglar has walked in the door and the telephone rings and its his girlfriend telling him that she will be five minutes late because she didnt get lipstick from the store and could you remember to get some ginger ale as burglar says hes going to shoot in the next five minutes you see if you dont immediately write him out check for eight million quid or something fellows liable to bark at the girl under those circumstances and the pcs liable to bark at the auditor so youve strained actually the pcs attention because the pcs attention is what causes that rock slam now the earliest lecture on attention units was given back in elizabeth new jersey in 1950 in very early june all about attention units lets say that pc has certain number of attention units available totalyou know theoretical availabilityand hes got 90 percent of these tied up in the bank therefore hes got 10 percent of his attention units around in present time or available actually its not like that at all its something on the order of about one onehundredmillionth of his attention in present time and the remainder in the bank but that was the earliest lecture on this particular subject of course thats just an illustration thats just an illustration graphic sort of picture of what happens to the pc in other words his attention is trapped residually in certain portions of the bank and therefore he hasnt got much attention to spare elsewise nervous or anxious or frantic individual simply hasnt enough attention units to put on present time or whats come up and theyre all trapped elsewhere and youre making him take his attention off various places and things are collapsing in on him in these other places in order to handle this and he gets very frantic its simply symptom ofor he goes into apathy its symptom of not having enough attention in present time see and the less attention one has in present time the more one is likely to go down tone scale this exactly matches the old tone scale the less attention in present time the lessthe lower the tone of the individual is going to be and his concept of reality and all this sort of thing actually you can add up all of dianetics and early scientology and so forth just under the few words im just giving you here just giving you picture of course you know youve covered that ground but apply this now to the fact that we have found those things which have without any doubt whatsoever ensnared the greatest part of the pcs attention and those are attention traps to end all attention traps and when youve got rock slam you have spotted one of these attention traps and the rock slam is caused by the fury and franticness of his attention and opposed attentions and thatzzz thats what causes it now that amount of attention then is absorbed in the bank now you stir that up you put his attention on one of these items and then you go off to find another pair and you only find one of those soyou havent found pair yet see you only find oneand then you go off and you find another item get the idea now you couldnt find pair that time either for some reason or other and you finallyyou list that out you see and you havent opposed it you see youve had to go in with other lines like what would you rather not think about and who or what has been shot lately or something like this you see and you kept going in and youd find rock slam each time and then you only find one of the items you see how many of these singlesided items or half packages do you think youre going to find before the pc will get rs see thats the burning question what can the pc tolerate oddly enough the tolerance is sometimes very good and sometimes very bad it isnt constant if the thing is directly in present timeand the second lecture is about the phantom slambut strangely enough if the pc has thing right in present time that you havent found the package with but have ticked it and its right in present time and particularly if the thing he expects to help him and then you neglect this thing its leadpipe cinch that his attention has been all gathered up now he wont have any attention left to put on anything else and you just lay dead horses from there on im going to give you more lecture about that but right now im talking about the auditor who finds an item then doesnt find an opposition for it finds another item doesnt find an opposition for that finds another item almost finds another item gets list thats rock slamming abandons that and then all of sudden says i wonder why this pc doesnt rock slam anymore i wonder why thispcs getting better and so forth says he feels better and so on whats happened here see pinned his attention here pinned his attention there you know these this that uh vu vu hes got place to look now you know hes just sort ofthere he is you say why dont you rock slam bud in other words you can tie up case so that it wont rock slam by just making too many bypasses now this isnt really terribly serious now we now know whatyou see you can take the cases folderthats why my god always save all the pieces of paper and always put the date and the pcs name on it and what you did on that piece of paper for heavens sakes and this is why in my auditing over the past couple of months i finally have left three things which have got to be completed there are three back along the track there are an awful lot of packages but i know now that those three packages are not complete now that isnt enough to catch up with it and stop everything over the number of items that have been found the amount of attention that has been freed but brother i thank my stars that the records were complete all ive got to do right now is write few more things on the list and null them and ive got the item do you understand i didnt understand it earlier i was studying this but theyrei still had three of them now the number of these that you miss add up to the amount of stuck attention the pc has got on the track near present time and you can add that up to point where the pc wont go clear but if youve kept all the records it can very easily be straightened out thats whats important actually some auditor comes along and gets all the residual gain bang all the poor first auditor had to do was list five more on the oppose list you see and he would have had the rock slamming item and it would have gone together as package and the pc would have flown see212 is sneaker it produces better results done wrong than old techniques done right so auditors become too easily satisfied with its gains the pc is very happy about it and my god hes got thehes got this thing he just had to list five more and get the item and really package it up see and the pc would have taken off like cape canaveralnot cape canaveral rocket like russian rocket and everything would have been gorgeous see thats all he had to do but he didnt do it now we know now we know what class ii auditor is that knows 2i very well and is well trained and classified we know what he is he takes the folders and guides through the auditing of cases that have been done by class i auditors and straightens them out so this tells us at once what class iii auditor is you see he straightens out the incomplete lines and the failure to package of the class ii you see now we know what class iv auditor is see and he takes the eases that have not been completely packaged and straightened out by class iiis you see and he straightens those out and we finally find out what my class is i straighten out the class ivs in actual fact it is not dangerous to put this technique in clumsy handsnot at all dangerous to put it in clumsy hands because it has residual gain with this one proviso providing all the records are kept and providing the guy does say what he did doso above all else insist on that thats the first thing you insist on and the next thing you insist on that common ordinary good auditing gets done you know thats the next thing that hasnt anything to do with 212 dont you see now the next thing after that is that 212 is done right and effectively and thats about the order of importance and if that order of importance is followed why anybody will be able to pick up some case and put it back together again he can seehes gotlooks in there and he sees thesetheyve got list of five items as opposing the rock slamming item and theres thirtyeight strikes after each one of the five you see and right away he has some idea of what happened all hes got to do is complete that list and hes got it squared up those are your orders of importance if case cant do the basics of auditing then the auditing the case must be permitted to do is the simplest auditing that can be done in other words you just omit the mid ruds you just omit all of these odd balls and you get 210 thats heavily supervised coaudit sort of process you just omit everything that the auditor is goofing with and carry on from there but this is the waythis is the way 212 stacks up at the present time it itself is not complicated but somebody who is still learning to audit while doing 212 can find it very harassing and very complicated particularly when theyve missed rock slams and particularly when well they had all of list one slamming so they represent think item what would you rather not think about pc goes halfway around the bend they say there you see 212 but they actually never can quite say that it doesnt work because even if they did that that badly the pc still registers some gain so 212 is actually the first technique that falls into all these categories and its quite new it opens up new doors to auditing it opens up new doors to results supposing an auditor almost did it right and got lots of lists and he almost had items and so onbut he never checked anything out you took the pcs folder you studied it from the beginning found exactly where it is andthe casewith four or five hours of auditing you find twentyfour items youd suddenly get gain thatd make the pc just practically thetan exterior right there dont you see residual gain would all take place in very short period of time but the auditor that did it if you ask him would have been very satisfied with his own auditing saw the pc gain all the way the only thing that gives you trouble sometimes is you cannot quite make up your mind whether the item that youre going to oppose is actually slamming item or not and thats the only list you will ever lay an egg on because it gives you cyclic rock slam dirty needle clean rock slam dirty needle clean rock slam dirty needle clean and will probably go on doing it for the next fifteen thousand items thats the only bug there is where it really takes little bit of judgment because sometimes you say it isnt rock slamming anymore and you should have opposed it and sometimes you say well it was rock slamming so therefore im going to oppose it and you shouldnt so in that particular case you just learnone of these cyclic dirty needle sort of lists that go on and on and on on an oppositionyou learn what one of those things look like and after that youll know what youre listing okay thank you
