also deaf her individualized educa tion program iep provided that she should be educated in regular classroom use an fm hearing aid and receive instruction from tutor for the deaf for one hour each day and from speech therapist for three hours each week amys parents agreed with parts of the iep but insisted that she be provided signlanguage interpreter in all her academic classes the request for an interpreter was denied nd the rowleys pursued their due process remedies the district court found that amy was rema rkably welladjusted child who had an extraordinary rapport with her teachers the court also found that amy was performing better than the average child in her class and was advancing easily from grade to grade but was understanding consider ably less of what goes on in class than she could if she were not deaf this di sparity between amys achievement and her potential led the district court to conclude that she was not receiving free appropriate public edu cation this decision was affirmed by the court of appeals but the us supreme court reversed the supreme court noted that there was substantive language in idea regarding the level of education to be accorded to children with disabilities and observed that implicit in the congressi onal purpose of providing access to free appropriate public education is the requirement that the education to which access is provided be sufficient to confer some educationa l benefit upon the handicapped child8 the court concluded that the bas ic floor of opportunity provided by the act consists of access to specialized inst ruction and related services which are individually designed to provide educa tional benefit to th handicapped child9 the court held that the requirement of fape is met when child is provided with personalized instruction with sufficient support services to benefit educationally from that instruction this instruction must be provided at public expens meet the states educational standards must approximate the grade levels used in the states regular education and must comport with the childs iep the court found that when child with disability is mainstreamed the system itself monitors the

therefore the iep should be formulated in acco rdance with the requirements of the act and if the child is being educated in the regular classrooms of the public education system should be reasonably calculated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade11 however the states ar not required to maximize each childs potential12 if the child is progressing from grade to gr ade and making measurable and adequate gains the fape requirement is met the supreme court also stated that in ensuring that the requirements of the act have been met courts must be careful to avoid imposing their view of preferable educational methods upon the states the primary responsibility for formulating the education provided was left by idea to state and local educational agencies as the court noted determining when children w ith disabilities are receiving sufficient educational benefits to satisfy the requirements of the act presents more difficult problem13 than complying with requirements for access to educati on due to the wide spectrum of disabilities the court did not attempt to establish any one test for determining the adequacy of educational benefits and confined its analysis to the facts of the case rowley remains seminal decision under id ea and is often cited by courts attempting to determine the parameters of free appropriate public education however the lower courts have varied in how expansively they have interpreted rowley with some courts interpreting rowley to support schools ieps if the procedural requirements have been met even if the educational progress is minimal for example in fort zumwalt school district v clynes 14 the eighth circuit emphasized rowleys access to education requirement and held that the iep was adequate the court noted that the child was making progress earning passing marks and advancing to the next gr ade despite reading proficie ncy scores in the second to ninth percentile however the dissenting opinion described the childs achievement as trivial and argued that this cannot be the sort of education congress had in mind when it enacted idea15 other courts have read rowley more expansively for

educational benefit17 similarly the fifth circuit in cypressfairbanks i ndep school district v michael f 18 quoted from rowley and concluded that the educational benefit that an iep is designed to achieve must be meaningful19 in order to determine whether an iep meets this standard the cypressfairbanks court identified four factors 1 the program is individualized 2 the program is administered in the least restrictive environment 3 the services are provided in coor dinated and collabora tive manner and 4 positive academic and nonacademic benefits are demonstrated20 other courts have looked at academic achievement testing as well as grades to measure educational benefit for example in houston independent sc hool dist v bobby r 21 the court looked at the childs scores on the w oodcock johnson intellig ence and achievement test to determine the childs educational progress22 the application of the supreme courts analysis in rowley to current controversies is somewhat confused by the change in the usage of the term educational standards lthough the supreme court in rowley required that the instruction given to child with disability meet the states educational standards the term educational standards has take n on different meaning in recent years currently the term educational standards is likely to refer to specific contentbased standards that delineate what child shoul d know and be able to perform at various points in his or her educational career the 1997 amendments to idea23 reflected the standardsbased education movement pl 10517 significantly chan ged the iep requirements and required that the iep include among others statement of the childs present levels of educational performance including the ffect of the childs disability on the childs involvement and progress in the general curriculum nd statement of measurable annual goals designed to enable the child to progress in the general curriculum24 in addition in the statement of findings for the 2004 r eauthorization pl 108446 states that almost 30 years of research and experience has demonstrated that the education of children with disabilities can be made more effective by having high expectations

instruction and related services which are i ndividually designed to provide educational benefit to the handicapped child and that the instruction must meet the states educational standards26 given the fact that the standards based education movement as reflected in idea and the child left behind act nclba27 has raised the standards from what was required in the version of the law the supreme court interpreted questions could be raised concer ning the current application of rowley it could be argued that because the supreme court emphasized that courts must not impose their view of preferable educati onal methods on the states the change in the standards does not affect the core of the courts rowley holding however the court also stated that the childs access to education must be sufficient to confer some educational benefit and that states are not required to maximize each childs potential the supreme court has not overruled rowley and it could be argued that the rowley standard is flexible enough not to present conflict with subsequent changes in educational law relating to standardsbased instruction on the other hand one commentator has argued that th supreme court would not reach the same decision today as it did in rowley the cryptic and intangible rowley standard of benefit is rightfully dying if not alread dead by focusing on standards for all students and

decisions the current statutory provi sions regarding private schools are the result of several major amendments and w ith the exception of the recent per curiam decision in board of education of the city school distri ct of the city of new york v tom f32 the supreme court decisions on private schools are prior to the statutory changes in school committee of the town of burlington v department of

education in an unan imous decision written by justice rehnquist the supreme court held that the statutory provision granting courts the right to grant such relief as the court deems appropr iate

placement rather than pr oposed iep is proper under the act in the subsequent unanimous decision of florence county school district four v carter 34 the supreme court was again presente d with

the proposed iep violated idea on appeal to the supreme court the issu was whether the parents were barred from reimbursement because the private school did not meet the idea requirements for free appropriate public education the court held that reimbursement cannot be barred because of noncompliance with the requirements because these requirements in part require that the education be provided at public expense and under public supervision and direction35 and that these requirement s do not make sense in the context of parental placement36 similarly the failure of the private school to meet state education standards did not bar reimbur sement parents failure to select program known to be approved by the stat in favor of an unapproved option is not itself bar to reimbursement37 in the

under idea have involved the concept of related services and both ve involved the issue of what is medical service in irving independent school district v tatro 42 the court examined the case of an eightyearold girl with spina bifida who required clean intermittent catheterization cic and held that the school must pr ovide the service the court held that services affecting both the medical and edu cational needs of child must be provided under idea if 1 the child has disability so as to require special education 2 the service is necessary to help child with disability benefit from special education and 3 nurse or other qua lified person who is not physician can provide the service services that could be provided outside the school day would not need to be provided tatro drew bright line between servi ces that had to be provided by doctor and those that could be provide d by person who was not physician however after tatro some courts of appeals did not apply this bright line but used other factors such as the nature and extent of services this set the stage for another supreme court decision in 1999 cedar rapids community school district v garret f43 garret f involved child who was paralyzed from the neck down as result of motorcycle accident when he was four years old the child retained his mental capacities and was described by the court as friendly creative and intelligent young man for number of years his family arranged for his physical care during the school day but eventually they requested the school to accept financial responsibility for his healthcare services because the child was ventilator dependent these services we re fairly substantial and included providing suction on his tracheotomy tube and manually pumping air through an air bag when suction is being provided in addition he needed ssistance with catheterization and eating the school denied the parents request nd proposed test for related services in which the outcome would depend on series of factors such as whether the care was continuous and the cost of the services the court rejected this proposed test and used the same reasoning it had used in tatro finding that the medical services exclusion from the definition was limited to the services of physician or hospital this holding the court stated was in k eeping with the overarching purpose of idea to open the door of public edu cation to all qua lified children44httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33444crs9 45 20 usc 1415j for detailed disc ussion of stay put see crs report rl32753 individuals with disabilities education

the states must follow to receive these federal funds this public law contained re quirement that if there is dispute between the school and the parents of child with disability the child stays put in his or her current educational placement until the dispute is re solved using the due process procedures set forth in the statute the concept of stay put was placed in the statute to help eliminate the then common discriminatory practice of expelling children with disabilities from school revi sed stay put provision rema ins as law in the current version of idea45 honig v doe in 1988 the question of whether there was an implied exception to the stay put rule was presented to the supreme court in honig v doe 46 honig involved emotionally disturbed child ren one of whom had c hoked another student with sufficient force to leave abrasions on the childs neck and who had kicked out window while he was being escorted to the pr incipals office the other child in the honig case had been involved in stealing extorting money and making lewd comments the school had sought ex pulsion but the supreme court disagreed finding that congress very much meant to strip schools of the unilateral authority they had traditionally employed to exclude disabled students pa rticularly emotionally disturbed students from school47 however the court observed that this holding did not leave educators hamstrung wher student poses an immediate threat to the safety of others officials may tempor arily suspend him or her for up to 10 school days and in those cases in which the pa rents of truly dangerous child adamantly refuse to permit any change in pl acement the 10day respite gives sc hool officials an opportunity to invoke the aid of th courts under section 1415e2 which empowers courts to grant any appropriate relief48 this statement about the schools right to seek judicial relief has come to be know as honig injunction the supreme courts interpretation of idea in honig did not quell all concerns about discipline and children with disa bilities in 1994 congress amended ideas stay put provision to give schools the unila teral authority to remove child with disability to

on the school system the supreme court noted that the most plausible argument advanced by the parents was that in the inte rest of fairness the burden of proof should not be placed on party when the facts are peculiarly within the knowledge of his adversary65 school districts were seen as having natural advantag regarding the information but justice oconnor did not find this to be determinative because congress addressed this when it obliged schools to sa feguard the procedural rights of parents and to share information with them66 the court noted that idea provides parents with the right to review records to ve an independent ducational evaluation to have details about options c onsidered by the school distri ct as well as disclosure of evaluations and recommendations and to recei ve

considera tion of the entire statutory scheme the court examined ideas statutory language noting that one of the purposes of idea is to ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected69 this language was found to refe r to rights for both parents and children with disabilities similarly the court found that the establishment of procedural rights was required to ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected70 these provisions were found to support the finding that the parents of child with disability ve particular and personal interest in the goals of id ea and that idea includes provisions conveying rights to parents as well as to children the rights that idea provides for pare nts were found to encompass not only procedural but also substantive rights justice kennedy observed idea does not differentiate through isolat ed references to various procedures and remedies between the rights accorded to children and the rights accorded to parents it was argued that granting these rights would increase the costs to the states because parents may bring more lawsuits if they do not have the financial constraint of paying for an attorney however the court found that these concerns were not sufficient to support an argument under the spending cl ause that idea failed to provide clear notice before new condition or obligati on was placed on recipient of funds in addition justice kennedy observed that idea specifically allows courts to award attorneys fees to prevailing educational agency when parent has brought an action for an improper purpose such as to harass to cause unn ecessary delay or to needlessly increase the cost of litigation71 justice scalia joined by justice thomas concurred in the judgment in part and dissented in part these justices would have held that pare nts have the right to proceed pro under idea when they seek reim bursement for private school tuition or for violations of the parents procedur rights however justices scalia and thomas would not have allowed such suits when the suits sought judicial determination that the childs free appropriate public education was substantively inadequate
