suicide explosives or weapons vehicles parked illegally near facility buildings or near places where large numbers of people gather that might contain explosives unattended packages eg backpacks briefcases boxes that might contain explosives evidence of unauthorized acce ss to areas of the building containing heating ventilation and airconditioning hvac equipmentindicators of potential surveillance by terrorists include persons using or carrying videocameraobservation equipment in or near the facility over an extended period persons discovered with facility maps photos or diagrams with critical assets highlighted or notes regarding infrastructure or listing of personnel persons questioning religious facility employees offsite about practices pertaining to the facility and its operations persons parking standing or loitering in the same area over multipleday period with apparent reasonable explanation facility employees associating with suspicious individuals an increase in threats from unidentified sources by telephone postal mail or the email system andor an increase in reports of th reats from outside known reliable sources common vulnerabilities the following are key common vulnerabilities of religious facilities significant numbers of people of like faith gathered in single location at specified times making the facility ready target unrestricted access to religious services unrestricted access to peripheral areas such as contiguous parking areas and separate educational facilities building systems that are vulnerable to fire contamination via heating and cooling systems explosives and blocked emergency exits access by workers and maintenance staff who may not undergo background checks easy identification either by facility configuration or signage nonprofit status which may result in limited resources for security for official use only protective measures protective measures include equipment personnel and pro cedures designed to protect facility against threats and to mitigate the effects of an ttack protective measures for religious facilities include planning and preparedness designate an employee as security director develop comprehensive security plan and emergency response plan for the facility establish liaison and regular communication with local law enforcement and emergency responders conduct regular exercises with facility employees to test the security and em ergency response plans personnel conduct background checks on all employees incorporate security awaren ess into employee training programs maintain an adequate security force using both employees and congregation volunteers access control define the facility perimeter and areas within the facility that require access control limit access to congregation members and visitors to level consistent with facility operations keep vehicles away from critical assets and from areas where large numbers of people congregate require that all illegally parked vehicles be moved or have them towed provide adequate door and window locks barred entryways and fencing and gate locks to areas where access is to be limited add intrusion detection systems and alarms as appropriate train mail room and receiving personnel to recognize suspicious mail packages shipments or deliveries barriers evaluate the need for perimeter barriers eg fences berms concrete walls around the facility establish clear zone adjacent to sensitive or critical buildings keep zone free of vegetation and other obstructions to allow for continuous monitoring install barriers to protect doors and windows from small arms fire and explosive blast effects install barriers at hvac systems to prevent the introduction of chemical biological or radiological agents into the building communication and notification install systems that provide communication with all individuals at the facility including employees security force personnel congregation members and visitors develop notification protocol that specifies who should be contacted in emergencies monitoring surveillance inspection evaluate needs and design monitoring surveillance and inspection program that is consistent with facility operations and security requirements provide visual surveillance capability for sensitive and critical assets at the facility continuously monitor all people entering and leaving the facility train monitors to detect suspicious behavior infrastructure interdependencies ensure that the facility has adequate utility service capacity to meet normal and emergency needs secure dumpsters and other trash containers to prevent the hiding of explosives or other hazardous materials cyber security develop and implement security plan for computer and information systems hardware and software design and implement secure computer network architecture regularly review facility web site to ensure that sensitive information is provided incident response ensure that an adequate number of emergency response personnel are available at all times check the status of all emergency response equipment and supplies on regular basis identify entry and exit points to be used in emergencies ensure that employees are familiar with procedures for shutting off utility serv ices eg electricity natural gas in emergency situations more detailed information on religious
