smith resources science and industry division december 15 2004 abstract congress passed two laws to provide consumers greater access to local network television stations particularly via satellite first the satellite home viewer improvement act shvia part of pl 106113 was enacted in 1999 shvia allows not requires satellite companies to retransmit local broadcast network signal back into the same local market area from which it originates localintolocal concerned that satellite tv companies do not plan to oï¬€er localintolocal in all parts of the country congress passed the launching our communities access to local television act local part of pl 106553 in 2000 that act creates loan guarantee program that its supporters hope will ensure that consumers in small and rural markets receive local network tv stations via satellite or other technologies this report summarizes the provisions of shvia and local and the debate over whether company called northpoint should be able to use the same frequencies as satellites to transmit data and television using terrestrial systemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs204251 shvia is title i of the intellectual property and communications omnibus reform act of 1999 included by cross reference in the fy2000 consolidated appropriations act pl 106 113 the final version of the bill s 1948 was introduced in the closing days of the 106th congress 1st session to reflect changes the senate wanted to make to the conference version of hr 1554 hrept 106464 that had already pa ssed the house s 1948 was not reported from any committee and hence there is report language to accompany it the report on hr 1554 excluding the sections on the loan guarantee pr ogram and whether the compulsory license should extend to internet companies is indi cative of congressional views however congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received through the crs weborder code rs20425 updated december 15 2004 satellite television historical information on shvia and local marcia s smith resources science and industry division summary congress has passed veral laws to provide consumers greater access to local network television sta tions particularly via satellite the 1988 satellite home viewer act shva amended in 1994 was expanded in 1999 with the satellite home viewer improvement act shvia shvia allows not requires satellite companies to retransmit local broadcast network signal back into the same local market area from which it originates localintolocal concerned that satellite tv companies do not plan to offer localintolocal in all part s of the country congress then passed the launching our communities access to local television act local that act creates loan guarantee program to help ensure that consumers in small and rural markets receive local network tv st ations via satellite or other tec hnologies this historical report summarizes shvia and local and the debate over whether company called northpoint should be able to use the same freque ncies as satellites to transmit data and television using terrestri systems it does not address the 2004 satellite home viewer extension and reauthorization act shvera see crs report rs21768 instead this report will not be updated the satellite home viewer improvement act shvia the 1999 satellite home vi ewer improvement act1 shvia expands on and extends some provisions of the 1988 satellite home view er act shva as amended regarding consumer reception of television signals via satellite dishes two major companies echostar and directv subsidiary of news corp offer satellite televisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20425crs2 2 grade and grade b contours can be visualized as circles around tv stations transmitter indicating the strength of signal received within that area the grade contour is close to the transmitter and reception there is better than in the grade b contour but reception within the grade b contour is still considered acceptable the fcc describes these contours as follows quality acceptable to the median observer is expected to be available for at least 90 percent of the time at the best 70 percent of receiver locations at the outer limits of grade service in the case of grade b service the figures are 90 percent of the time and 50 percent of the locations fcc cable services bureau report f cc 9914 cs docket 98201 paragraph 33services today through their direct broadcast satellite dbs systems echostars service is called dish tv directvs programming is also distributed through the national rural telecommunications cooperative nrtc nd by pegasus communications another company rainbow dbs subsidiary of ca blevision offers comparatively small number of satellite channels though service called voom historical information on shva and the issues congress faced in revi sing it are available in crs report 98942 the 1999 law shvia provides consumer s greater access to broadcast network television programming via their satellite dishes the original law permitted rebroadcast of distant network signals to consumers who liv ed outside the grade b contour of broadcast network aff iliate stations the 1999 law tinues to permit that activity but also allows satellite companies to rebroadcast local network signals back into the same local market area they are not required to do so however local versus distant network signals the distinction between local and distant network signals is important to unders tanding shvia local signal is received within network television affiliates local area distant signal is from elsewhere in the country if consumer lives in denver and is receiving signal from denver network affiliate that is local signal if consumer lives in west virginia and is receiving signal from that denver network affiliate via satellite it is distant network signal who may receive distant network signals the original shva established the grade b2 contour as the determining factor as to whether particular household was eligible to receive distan t network signals via satellite consumers living inside the grade b contour were not allowed to receive such signals while those outside the contour in socalled white areas were allowed to receive them some satellite companies transmitted distant network signals to consumers inside grade b contours however leading to court challenges by the networks to try to force the satellite companies to obey the law based on decisions by miami judge in 1998 over 2 million consumers reportedly had or were scheduled to have distant networ k signals terminated by their satellite companies echostar appealed the decision to the supreme court in 2002 which declined to hear the case in the 1999 law congress grandfathere d consumers who had been receiving distant network signals illegally as long as th ey could not receive signal of grade a2 intensity for new subscribers however the original rules apply to receive distant network signals new subscribers must not be able to receive signal of grade b intensity as determined using the individual locati on longelyrice illr method for predicting signal strength established by the federal communications commission fcc in february 1999 shvia directed the fcc to re view whether the grad b standard shouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20425crs3 still be used for the purposes of shvia the fcc concluded it should fcc016 et docket 0090 consumers who believe they are not receiving grade or grade b signal despite predictive models showing that they are may seek waiver to receive distant network signals via satellite consumers must apply to their satellite company for the waiver the satellite company forwards the request to the local network affiliate there is time limit for the satellite company to take that ac tion once the request is received the local affiliate has 30 days to decide whether or not to grant the waiver if the waiver is granted or if action is taken by th affiliate the consumer may then receive distant network signals from the satellite company if waiver is denied consumers may then request signal intensity test from their satellite company the satellite company and the local affiliate are required jointly to choose someone to conduct th test the consumer does not bear the cost of the test instead the loser pays either the satellite company or the affiliate or the sa tellite company and the affiliate may choose so other method of paying the costs as long as the consumer does not pay exceptions were made for recreational vehicles as defined by depa rtment of housing nd urban development regulations commercial trucks as defined by department of transportation regulations and for consumers using large cband satellite dishes the rv or commercial truck cannot be fixed dwelling in summary the following consumers may receive distant network signals until december 31 2004 the period for which the compulsory license see below was extended if they do not receive signal of gr ade b intensity from the local affiliate of particular network if their satellite dish is installed on an rv or commercial truck or if they had been receiving distan t network signals illegally and those signals were terminated or schedul ed to be terminated under the 1998 miami court rulings and they do not receive signal of grade intensity from the local affiliate of the network consumers using cband dishes are not subject to the five year limitation they may receive distant network signals they were receiving before october 31 1999 indefinitely who may receive local signals shvia permits dbs companies to provide localintolocal service where local broadcast tv signal is transmitted up to the satellite and back down to cons umers in that same designated market area dma the law does not require the dbs com panies to provide this service there is considerable confusion on this point stemming in part from the fact the law also created must carry provision under must carry each dbs company must provide all local broadcast stations in particular market if it provides any local station in that market this does not mean that dbs companies must carry cal broadcast progra mming through out the country instead if dbs provider chooses to provide local broadcast programming in market it must carry all local tv stations in that market that wish to be carried with exceptions for duplicative programing and edu cational stations the dbs companies still may choose not to provide localintolo cal service in any particular markethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20425crs4 3 each tv station chooses whether or not it wants to be carried by the satellite company commercial stations choose between retransmissi on consent or must carry status under retransmission consent the station negotiates with the satellite company the terms under which the station will be carried usu ally involving payment of f ee by the satellite company and sometimes requiring the satellite company to carry other programming as well noncommercial stations and commercial stations that do not believe they can negotiate favorable retransmission consent arrangement may elect must carry status where there are payments by either party shvia also made four other cable regulations syndicated exclusivity sports blackout network nonduplication and retransmi ssion consent applicable to satellite companies the first three apply to retran smission of signals of nationally distributed superstations of those three only sports bl ackout applies to network stations and only if technically feasible and not economically prohib itive for more on retransmission consent see crs report rl32026 4 the rate set in 1997 27 cents per subscriber per month for both superstations and distant network stations was controversial see crs report 98140a the rates are set periodically under procedures of the copyright office of th library of congress shvia reduced the rate for distant network signals by 45 and for superstation signals by 30cable companies already were subject to must carry rules depending on the size of the cable system the must carry provisi ons for dbs went into effect on january 1 20023 the dbs companies oppose the must carry requirement see below and unsuccessfully attempted to overturn it in court according to their respective websites as of october 2004 echostar offered local intolocal in 152 markets and directv in 106 ma rkets both plan to add more markets as additional capacity becomes available there are 210 designated market areas dmas in the united states as identified by nielsen media research meaning that many smaller communities do not receive local signals via sa tellite dmas differ in size so the number of dmas served is not necessarily indicativ of the percentage of the population able to receive localintolocal when echostar passed the 100 dma mar k it reported that 83 of the population could receive its localintolo cal service directv asserts that it will provide localintolocal in at least 130 dmas by the end of 2004 which it says represents 92 of tv households cong ress passed the local act s ee below in 2000 to help ensure that small and rural areas that cannot obtain localintolocal service from echostar or directv can receive local television via other satellite or terrest rial technologies compulsory copyright license another issue regarding satellite retransmission of television programming concerns compensation to those who own the copyright on the programming u nder both the 1988 and 1999 laws sate llite carriers were given compulsory copyright license for restransmitting distant network and superstation signals that means that the copyright owners must make that programming available to the satellite companies at governmentset prices4 without such license the satellite companies woul d have to negotiate with each c opyright owner individually the 1999 law extended the compulsory license for di stant network signals for five years until december 31 2004 the 108th congress is considering whether to extend it further and whether to change how the prices are t see crs report rs21768 for retransmitting local signals however congress gave th satellite companies royaltyfree permanent compulsory copyright license cable has permanent compulsory copyright license copyright compensation is separate from business arrangements negotiated to obtain retransmission consent which is explained in footnote 3 belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20425crs5 table 1 summary of shvia provisions permits satellite companies to offer localintolocal television service makes mustcarry requirements effective for satellites on january 1 2002 makes syndicated exclusivity sports blackout and network nonduplication applicable to sate llite retransmissi on of nationally distributed superstations but for ne twork stations only sports blackout applies and only if technically feasible and not economically prohibitive allows subscribers who do not receive grade intensity signal andwhose distant network signals were terminated or were going to be terminated because of 1998 miami cour t rulings to have those signals restored or continued until decem ber 31 2004 grandfathering many of the subscribers affected by the 1998 court decision retains the grade b signal intensity standard as the criterion for who mayreceive distant network signals allows subscribers unable to receive grade b signal as well asrecreational vehicles and commercial trucks that are not fixed dwellings to receive more than two distant network signals of each television network on single day establishes process for consumers to seek waivers from local affiliatesto receive distant network signals if signal strength is in doubt at cost to the consumer allows cband satellite cu stomers to continue r eceiving distant network signals they were receiving as of october 31 1999 indefinitely extends the existing satellite copyright compulsory license for distant network and superstation signals until december 31 2004 and creates new compulsory license for local ne twork signals with sunset date reduces the rate set in 1997 for c opyright royalty payments satellite companies must pay by 45 for di stant network signals and 30 for superstation signals copyright fees may be charged for local signals eliminates the 90day waiting period for cable subscribers and allows satellite companies to offer national public broadcasting service pbs feed through january 1 2002 af ter that local pbs stations would have to be carried in markets where localintolocal service is provided the local act loan guarantees and northpoint in 1999 the conference version of hr 1554 would have created loan guarantee program to help ensure that subscribers in small and rural markets benefit from the local intolocal provisions even though echostar and directv do not plan to offer such service in all areas the provision was deleted befo re final passage because of objections by senator gramm that the proposal had not been sufficiently debated congress subsequently passed the launching our communities access to local television act local as title x of the fy2001 commer cejusticestate appropriations act as enacted by the fy2001 district of colu mbia appropriations act pl 106553 loan guarantees local created fourperson board consisting of the secretaries of treasury agriculture and commerce and the chairman of the federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20425crs6 reserve or their designees to select recipients of loan guarantees for up to 125 billion in loans generally 80 of the loan may be guaranteed the loans may be used to build systems to ensure that consumers throughout the country can receive local television signals the board is to take into acc ount whether project serves nonserved or underserved areas and whethe r it would provide highspeed internet access the act is technology neutral in that it does not specify whether local tv stations would be provided by satellite cable or other transmission media but places some limits on which cable companies are eligible the boards website is httpwwwusdagovruslocaltvboard the board issued regulations for the local television loan guarantee program in the december 23 2003 federal register pp 7441174433 an app lication period ended april 21 2004 one application was received on may 24 the board voted 31 to return that application because it was incomplete and then voted unanimously to open another 60day application period ho wever the board rescinded the latter decision on july 6 the loan guarantee program is administered by the rural utilities service in the department of agriculture which r eceived 280 million in the fy2002 agriculture appropriations act pl 10776 for the progra m section 6404 of the farm security and rural investment act pl107171 hr 2646 allocated 80 million for the program from the commodity credit corporation through december 31 2006 gao is required to review the program annually and criticized the slow progress of the program in its first such report gao04134 october 2003 its second report gao0518r october 2004 stressed the need for the board to accu rately accumulate and report administrative costs to meet federal cost accounting requi rements and determine what portion must be recovered through fees the northpoint provision local required the fcc to select an independent entity to conduct tests to termine whether terrestrial systems operating in the same frequency band as dbs sate llites 122127 gigahertz would cause unacceptable interference to dbs systems this is ofte n called the northpoint provision because company called northpoint technology through its broadwave subsidiary wants to operate terrestrial wireless system offering tv programming similar to that provided by dbs and data services it is seeking li cense from the fcc for th at terrestrial service designated mvdds multichanne l video distribution and data service until now the 122127 ghz band has been assigned only to satellites the fcc chose the mitre corporation to conduct the interference sts in 2001 and it concluded that the two systems could not coexist unless the mvdds systems use number of mitigating techniques dbs operators hailed the mitre report becau it concluded that mvdds would cause interference to their operations northpoint hailed the report because it said there were mitigating steps that could be taken the fcc decided that mvdds and dbs could coexist but dismissed without prejudice applications by northpoint and tw other companies to provide mvdds fcc 02116 et docket 98206 deciding to au ction the frequencies instead northpoint objected to that decision and chose not to pa rticipate in the auction other companies did however and the auction was comple ted on january 27 2004 raising 1187 million httphraunfossfccgovedocs _publicattachmatc hdoc243253a1pdf s 564 and hr 1320 as reported from the senate commerce
