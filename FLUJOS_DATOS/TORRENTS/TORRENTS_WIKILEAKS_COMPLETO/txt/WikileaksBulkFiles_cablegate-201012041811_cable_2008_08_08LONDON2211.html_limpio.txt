leslie told the charge august 28 that the uk shares the us view on the importance of providing support to georgia including economic and development assistance recent russian steps in georgia represent strategic tectonic shift in international relations leslie averred citing foreign secretary milibands august 27 speech in kyiv in which he warned russian president putin that he has big responsibility not to start new cold war end summary steps to support georgia 2 c the charge called on mariot leslie the fco dg for defense and intelligence and acting political director on august 28 to discuss recent developments in regard to georgia and deliver ref demarches leslie affirmed that the us and uk are on the same page that south ossetians and abkhazians should not participate in upcoming unsc meetings on georgia she stated that the august 27 g7 joint foreign ministers statement which condemns russias recognition of south ossetian and abkhazian independence mostly covers concerns about recent russian steps the uk she continued is absolutely right along with you and is trying to persuade others to follow the same course 3 c leslie said that hmg will continue to support economic and development assistance to georgia she noted that foreign secretary miliband agreed with secretary rice about the importance of economic aid to georgia and cited the august 2527 us interagency delegation led by under secretary of state jeffery she added that team from the uk department for international development dfid recently completed ten day visit to georgia and is in the process of drafting report of its mission hmg will host high level economic discussions with georgian delegation soon in london to discuss economic and development assistance note separately andrew gleadle from dfids humanitarian operations team told econoff that dfid would program the remaining gbp 15 million 3 million of its gbp 2 million georgia assistance pledge based on the missions report he expected dfid to focus on protection of human rights for displaced people seeking to return to their homes rather than foodshelter as these needs were already being met by other donors also karen pillay head of middle east cis and energy at hm treasury told econoff that hmg had received an economic assistance wish list from georgia but was awaiting the results of an imf needs assessment end

actions and in support of georgia within the eu one end of the scale involves discussions of possible esdp presence in georgia while economic aid acceleration is also under discussion strategic shiftbut not new cold war 5 c leslie told the charge that russias actions in georgia represent strategic tectonic shift in international relations citing foreign secretary milibands august 27 speech in kyiv ukraine in which miliband affirmed that putin has big responsibility not to start new cold war leslie observed that hmg is not calling this new cold war although recent events have strategic consequences and mark the end of the period that began in 1991 leslie stressed that milibands clear condemnation in his speech of russias actions has helped put the russians in the defensive position of having to justify their actions foreign minister lavrov is on the run note milibands speech affirms in the midst of the georgia crisisthe commitment of the united kingdom to support the democratic choices of the ukrainian people and states that the sight of russian tanks in neighboring country on the fortieth anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain the full text of the speech is available on the fcos website httpwwwfcogovuken end note 6 c asked by the charge whether in her view russias decision to go into georgia was part of an overall change of russian strategy leslie replied that she is still assessing if it was strategic decision or tactical decision with strategic consequences leslie stated that in her capacity as dg for defense and intelligence she would continue to evaluate the big strategic challenge from russia 7 c in separate meeting with cabinet office director general for foreign and defense policy margaret aldred to deliver ref points she pointed to foreign secretary milibands speech in kyiv as laying out hmgs strong condemnation of russian actions in georgia including moscows recognition of the two breakaway georgian enclaves echoing leslies comments she told pol minister counselor that moscows actions represented seismic shift in international relations and defining break with global relationships in place since the end of the cold war turning to the situation on the ground in georgia aldred said that the sixpoint peace plan negotiated by the french had clearly left room for russian forces to remain outside existing boundaries and the russians were taking maximalist advantage the west needs to be thinking what its response will be to this if the russians continue this approach she also referred to messages she had seen from tbilisi indicating that there were voices in georgia as well that wanted to resume military action the west had to send message to georgia as well warning against this visit londons classified website httpwwwintelinksgovgovwikiportalunit ed_kingdom lebaron
