of the 106th congress 1st session nears there are lastminute efforts to place one or more sanctions measures into bill that has its own momentum hr 434 the african growth and opportunity act is under consideration to carry variety of traderelated amendments it has been mentioned in the press as possible vehicle for s 757 the sanctions policy reform act it is also possible that hr 434 could advance food and medicine for the world act the senate agreed to food and medicine exemption language earlier in the session that language was excised from the agriculture appropriations bill in conference new version of the bill has been introduced as s 1771 in the senate and as hr 3140 in the house the 106th congress has under consideration more than 100 bills or joint resolutions to impose new sanctions ease current regimes or overhaul the entire process that the legislative and executive branches employ when considering the use of sanctions of these enactment of the enhancement of trade security and human rights through sanctions reform act hr 1244 or its counterpart the sanctions policy reform act s 757 could most change the way the united states uses sanctions as foreign policy tool the bills seek to clarify the use of unilateral sanctions in us foreign the bills revise procedures both branches follow before enacting or imposing sanctions and require extensive reporting on expected costs and benefits of sanctions the administration and many members of congress have spoken in favor of some sort of overhaul there are serious points of disagreem ent however between the two branches particularly when new proposals seek to reduce the presidents flexibility in using sanctions as foreign policy tool some suggest that there is postcold war trend toward sanctions becoming the method of first resort in foreign policy others contend that sanctions unilateral or otherwise are peacetime means to improving international behavior in important areas such as human rights or weapons proliferation and should not be avoided solely for trade concerns particular attention is paid to the domestic impact of sanctions frequently cited report issued by the institute for international economic april 1997 concludes that us unilateral sanctions may have cost us businesses some 1519 billion in 1995 the congressional budget office on the other hand has found that sanctions have had negligible effect on the overall us economy with loss of perhaps 1 billion in 1997 compared to us national income of 66 trillion this report addresses how and why sanctions are applied who has the authority under what terms that authority is exercised what objectiv the us government seeks to achieve or advance when imposing or lifting sanctions the secondary consequences of

increasingly relied on economic sanctions as means to establish and promote their foreign policy objectives and yet the efficacy of economic sanctions is considered controversial most recently the president announced that the united states would begin to ease some of the sanctions the united states has held against north korea since 1950 the change in policy which allows for freer trade investment financial transactions and travel between the two countries was arrived at after us coordinator for north korea policy and former us secretary of defense serving president bush william perry recommended taking number of steps to improve relations north korea agreed to refrain from testing its longrange taepo dong2 missile in exchange for move toward normalization including the lifting of some sanctions and continued negotiations between the two countries chairmen of the senate committee on foreign relations and house committee on international relations each had immediate adverse reactions to the presidents announcement representative gilman described the new usnorth korea relationship as one based on extortion with assurances that north korea has halted missile development or its program for weapons of mass destruction1 sanctions remain in place that were imposed against north korea for its support of international terrorism sanctions triggered by north korean entities involvement with proliferation of weapons of mass destruction also remain active as required by law congress and the executive branch have also been at odds in recent days over the use of sanctions or lack of use against indonesia russia and china and throughout the 106th congress over sanctions imposed against cuba india pakistan iraq iran and yugoslavia over the last several years the use of sanctions has come under substantial scrutiny for variety of reasons troubling reports of the lack of food and medical supplies available to the civilian population in iraq for example led

devastating toll on us wheat growers congress quickly moved to amend the law with the presidents support and signature that prohibited department of agriculture subsidization of us commercial wheat

however contended that the longerterm consequences of denying pakistan us agricultural commodities would have destabilized all of south asia and perhaps resulted in pakistan failing as state4 selling wheat to pakistan in turn invigorated larger discussion on the use of food and medicine in foreign policy excluding food and medicine from sanctions regimes was taken up but unfinished in the 105th

contend that the denial of foreign assistance should not be considered sanction their position is that foreign assistance is not an entitlement country should expect its availability the denial of foreign assistance is included in this discussion because it fits the definition used that is denial of foreign assistance to force targeted country to change its behavior is in keeping with coercive economic measures taken against one or more countries to force change in policies or at least to demonstrate countrys opinion about the others policiesas the close of the 106th congress 1st session

might consider when proposing them to help legislators judge when sanctions might be appropriate and the approach that might be most effective provided as well is an uncomplicated map of where sanctions policies and options currently may be found in us law defining economic sanctions generally economic sanctions might be defined as coercive economic measures taken against one or more countries to force change in policies or at least to demonstrate countrys opinion about the others policies8 the mostoften quoted study on sanctions defines the term as the deliberate governmentinspired withdrawal or threat of withdrawal of customary trade or financial relations9 economic sanctions typically include measures such as trade embargoes restrictions on particular exports or imports denial of foreign assistance10 loans and investments or control of foreign assets and economic transactions that involve us citizens or businesses these definitions of economic sanctions would exclude diplomatichttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97949crs5 démarches reductions in embassy staff or closing of embassies mobilizing armed forces or going to war tools clearly intended to change another countrys behavior through other than economic means the use of carrots eg granting most favorednation status for another year or offering economic or military assistance to country if it conforms to certain standards would not qualify as sanction issues related to economic sanctions in any sanctions debate one might consider the following questions to assess the benefits andor costs of imposing sanctions against country company or individual why do we apply sanctions economic sanctions are used when one country or alliance of countries wants to condemn or coerce change in the behavior of another country its government individuals or businesses that violates important international standards or threatens us national interests the us government might impose sanctions when other efforts to change behavior have failed such as diplomacy public suasion cultural and scientific exchanges state visits targeted technical assistance military training and education or other friendly means sanctions might be positioned at the middle of continuum between the extremes of complete cooperation and agreement at one end and to the other end open hostility use of force or allout war the united states has aimed sanctions at governments that consistently violate internationally recognized human rights at governments that sponsor international terrorism or harbor terrorists from elsewhere at governments individuals or corporations that engage in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction at individuals or governments that traffic narcotics at governments that conduct aggression against their neighbors threaten regional stability or threaten us security or foreign policy interests what objectives does the us government seek to achieve when it imposes sanctions united states policymakers do not always state the goals or objectives they hope to accomplish through the imposition of economic sanctions sanctions might be imposed when taking action seems not enough of response but at the same time policymakers might resist committing to stronger measures generally however the us government may choose to impose sanctions to express its condemnation of particular practice such as military aggression human rights violations militarization that destabilizes country its neighbors or the region proliferation of nuclear biological or chemical weapons or missiles political economic or military intimidation terrorism drug trafficking or extreme national political policies contrary to basic interests of values of the united states eg apartheid communism punish those engaged in objectionable behavior and deter its repetition make it more expensive difficult or timeconsuming to engage in objectionable behavior block the flow of economic support that could be used by the targeted entity against the united states or us interestshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97949crs6 11 government leaders also have range of diplomatic political cultural and military tools at their disposal to use instead of or in conjunction with economic sanctionsdissuade others from engaging in objectionable behavior isolate targeted country or company or individual force change or termination of objectionable behavior or coerce change in the leadership or form of government in targeted country who imposes sanctions the president has broad authority to impose sanctions either pursuant to declaring national emergency and then invoking powers vested in his office in the international emergency economic powers act or by exercising authority stated in various public laws some of which are described at the end of this report in other instances congress might take the lead either by conferring new presidential authority to impose sanctions or by requiring sanctions to be imposed unless the president determines and certifies that certain conditions have been met some sanctions are mandatory and are triggered automatically when certain conditions exist congress for example has required the imposition of sanctions when duly elected governments are overthrown by military coup detat or when any nonnuclear weapon state explodes nuclear device some behavior that would trigger the imposition of sanctions such as proliferation or support of international terrorism requires that the president or secretary of state determine and certify that violation of standard has occurred in most instances the administration has considerable flexibility in making such determinations and also has the authority to waive sanctions when imposed what tools are available all of the following economic policy tools have been used at one time or another triggered by variety of repugnant behaviors11 foreign assistance all or some programs could be terminated suspended limited conditioned or prohibited foreign assistance to particular organizations that operate in the targeted country could be curtailed us government arms sales and transfers military assistance and international military education and training imet funding could be similarly restricted scientific and technological cooperation assistance and exchanges could be reduced or halted both public and private sector financial transactions could be restricted assets in us jurisdictions could be seized or frozen or transactions related to travel or other forms of exchange could be limited or prohibited importation and exportation of some or all commodities could be curtailed by denying licenses closing off shipping terminuses or limiting related transactions government procurement contracts could be canceled or deniedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97949crs7 12 hufbauer gary clyde and kimberly ann elliott tess cyrus and elizabeth winston us economic sanctions their impact on trade jobs

overseas private investment corporation trade and development agency or exportimport bank could be curtailed aviation maritime and surface access to the united states could be canceled or denied certain acts associated with sanctionable behavior could be made criminal offense making the targeted individual subject to fines or imprisonment additionally sanctions could be applied against those individuals businesses or countries that continue to trade with or support targeted individuals businesses or countries how likely is it that sanctions will achieve the stated goal effectiveness is the most difficult aspect of sanctions policy to evaluate the impact cost and benefit of sanctions cannot be considered in vacuum recent study considers geographic proximity common language volume of trade countrys relative wealth and membership in common trading bloc all factors that might determine the success or failure of unilaterally imposed sanctions regime12 one should also consider the united states relative importance in terms of trade culture scientific and intellectual exchanges and history to the targeted country how important to the targeted country is our economic cooperation is the united states significant trading partner or only marginally engaged consider for example that at the time that sanctions were imposed against the former yugoslavia the united states took in only about 5 percent of that countrys exports the support of more substantial trading partners in europe was needed to have any hope of having an impact united states businesses frequently argue that us sanctions that hinder their exports or imports in turn benefit their foreign competitors some contend that staying engaged as trading partners or investors in problem country will have better longterm effect the united states seeks to isolate cuba for example while cubas european trading partners contend that full trade relations afford them opportunities to discuss human rights concerns with the island nation of course relatively modest goals that do not challenge the vital interests of the targeted country or person are more likely to be achieved than are farreaching goals such as change in the form of government change in its leadership or relinquishinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97949crs8 13 denial of food and medicine the impact of the us embargo on health nutrition in cuba

citterritory the smaller the goal the more likely it can be achieved similarly the lesser the cost of imposing sanctions the more sellable and manageable the policy will be to the implementing country or alliance of countries what secondary consequences might sanctions have whether or not successful in achieving their central purpose sanctions sometimes have undesirable perhaps unexpected fallout sanctions against former yugoslavia for example were particularly hard on the economies of serbias neighboring states at the same time some analysts argue sanctions against serbia and montenegro actually bolstered nationalist political movements there in another instance longstanding sanctions against south africa in the 1980s some speculate led that nation to develop weapons manufacturing capabilities conventional and nuclear that remain cause for concern today most recently when the united states campaigned for european friends to join in sanctions against iran by blocking investment in irans oil fields in 1995 for example nearly all of europe declined pointing out that they were running out of fuel sources that were not under some sanctions regime short while later trading partners of nigeria found themselves wanting to punish that country for human rights issues but were unable to restrict trade with yet another oil producer other secondary and unintended consequences arise in nearly all cases where sanctions are applied for some duration analysts express concern for the impact on the nongovernmental population particularly if food medicine or other basic human needs are affected recent study of the impact of us sanctions policy on health and nutrition in cuba concluded that us restrictions on that countrys ability to import food and medicine has dramatically harmed the health and nutrition of large numbers of ordinary cuban citizens13 the state department has countered these charges incidentally with documentation of increased humanitarian shipments of medicine and other healthrelated supplies to cuba from the united states in recent years and with statistics that indict the cuban government for misuse of their own treasury and inattention to its own people indeed the state department reports that the united states since 1992 has become the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to cuba14 similar reports abound regarding iraq and the impact of sponsored multilateral sanctions with those supporting sanctions and those favoring lifting the sanctions for humanitarian reasons arguing equally passionately15 nearer to home loss of trade the impact on us jobs potential loss of procurement contracts or other trade relations loss of confidence in the reliability of american suppliers subject to unilateral economic prohibitions all need to be factored in two senate committees held hearings on agricultural commodities sanctions in may 1999 where witnesses representing the agricultural sector spoke about the impact of denying american farmers access to markets in terrorist states herb karst president of the national barley growers association testified that us policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97949crs9 16 prepared testimony of herb karst president of the national barley growers association before the senate committee on agriculture nutrition and forestry may 11 1999 17 the domestic costs of sanctions on foreign commerce by congressional budget office march 1999 52 p 18 prepared testimony of jan paul acton assistant director of the natural resources and commerce division congressional budget office before the house committee on international relations june 3 1998removed us grain exporters from 35 of the global market for barley growers he estimated that us sanctions against libya and iran in 199798 blocked us growers from more than 9 of the world barley market or more than twice what us barley growers otherwise exported for that time period16 the congressional budget office cbo on the other hand has found that sanctions on foreign commerce have had negligible effect on the overall us economy in report prepared at the request of the house committee on international relations cbo found that many sanctions do not add to restrictions on commerce and that when they do the cost is often small because commerce with the targeted state is small as it might be with developing countries that loss to the us economy overall is offset by funds saved by forgoing foreign aid or trade promotion funding or that domestic business finds other markets for both import and export17 earlier research by cbo put the domestic cost of sanctions at less than 1 billion in lost national income per year compared with total national income of 66 trillion for 1997 the year on which cbo based its analysis even this cost was thought likely to be only shortterm that exporters would find replacement markets and recover at the same time cbo did note that sanctions could result in sharp disruption to and dislocation of specific us firms and workers18 one might consider then how the potential secondary costs of imposing sanctions incurred by surrounding states civilian populations in the targeted states or even by domestic interests compare to the benefit of achieving the stated goal for what duration will the secondary costs have to be borne what longterm damage might the secondary costs inflict and what is the cost if any of doing nothing what change is required for the sanctions to be lifted when sanctions are imposed via enactment of public law what is required to terminate the restrictions is usually clearly stated if policy is unevenly applied however the standard might be less clear china for example as nonmarket economy is denied permanent most favored nation status on the basis of laws relating to trade nonmarket economies and emigration the annual debate to renew chinas mfn status however rarely has much to do with freedom of emigration of chinas population if sanctions are applied for lengthy period other problems arise or the circumstances that triggered the sanctions at the outset might evolve the sought after change in behavior could be redefined over time or multilateral or domestic support for the sanctions could deteriorate in some instances sanctions are imposed to achieve goal that is unclear everchanging or perhaps unattainable in such circumstances if the sanctions are lifted or waived it may effectively signal friendly change of policy if the us government terminates sanctions when it appears that the targeted country has not budged at all from its sanctionable behavior however future attempts tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97949crs10 achieve standard of behavior through sanctions may be compromised the constantly changing political landscape of the former yugoslavia over the last seven years provides numerous incidents to demonstrate the dilemma of sending confusing signals to allies as well as the sanctioned state wou ld multilateral sanctions be more desirable and achievable it is generally agreed that sanctions imposed by all or most of the nations on which targeted country relies for trade and support such as through the united nations or other multinational organization stand much better chance of having an impact than unilateral restrictions or prohibitions consensus is difficult to reach among countries considering another countrys behavior however and as result multilateral sanctions are imposed infrequently comprehensive multilateral sanctions are even more rare attempts that fail to solidify international opinion against one countrys objectionable behavior can actually give support to those committing the behavior for example every year the united states is condemned by the general assembly for its unilateral sanctions regime against cuba current law each sanction has its own duration severity and comprehensiveness or selectivity each section of law has its own terms for triggering the imposition as well as reporting on easing or tightening waiving and terminating the sanction some laws make sanctions mandatory others provide discretionary authority to the president or his delegate to impose sanctions nearly all laws include some sort of waiver authority that allows the president to not impose the sanction even if an incident warrants it only few laws specifically spell out what recourse congress might take when it finds itself in disagreement with the executive branch on the imposition waiving or termination of sanction some laws generally authorize the executive branch to make and carry out foreign policy and would not be considered sanctions legislation at first glance such authority is often cited when the president changes policy to the detriment of targeted country using legislative authority to cut foreign assistance for example might be an administrative decision or it might be step taken to punish country in violation of any number of international standards disallowing participation in various tradesupporting programs such as the overseas private investment corporation or the exportimport bank might be change in policy to recognize countrys graduation from such needs or it might be considered punitive step taken to change the recipient countrys behavior the following list is intended to serve only as guide to where the authority to impose sanctions stands in the law careful reading of the public law text is required to determine the intent of the sanctions what triggers their imposition the extent of the sanction and what is required to have the restrictions lifted the list groups laws into broad foreign policy categories brief note of what form the sanction might take is included parenthetically many of the restrictions of foreign assistance will be found in the fy1999 foreign operations appropriations act such law is enacted anew each fiscal year or in absence of an appropriations act continuing resolution may extend the terms of previous years appropriations act for specific countries any law written specifically to address conditions in or relations with that
