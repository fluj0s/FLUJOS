bills generally originate in the house and senate agriculture committees which have lead jurisdiction over usda programs regulating the safety of red meats poultry and processed egg products therefor the new farm law generally applies to these usda programs nonusda food safety legislation is pe nding before other congressional committees for example the chairmen of the house energy

wwwcrsgovcommerce and the senate hea lth education labor and pe nsions committees have been circulating draft safety bills primarily affecting f oods other than meat and poultry such food safety bills include items that are within the purview of the food and drug administration fda at the us departme nt of health and human services hhs2 stateinspected meat and poultry us meat and poultry slaughter facilities and processing plants have operated for many decades under one of two parallel insp ection systems the one familiar to most people is the federal meat and poultry insp ection system administered by usdas food safety and inspection service fsis th other is made up of 27 separate state administered inspection programs although thes state programs are to be equal to the fsis program stateinspected products cannot enter interstate commer ce many of these states and the plants they oversee have long sought legislation to end this prohibition section 11015 of the enacted farm bill amends the federal meat inspection act fmia 21 usc 601 et seq and the pou ltry products inspection act ppia 21 usc 451 et seq in order to authorize new opti n program for stateinspected plants this program is to supplement rather than re place the existing federalstate cooperative inspection program in states that choose to participate federally employed coordinator would supervise state employees in plants that want to ship across state lines eligible plants would be limited to those with 25 or fewer employees except that plants with between 25 and 35 employees could apply for coverage within the first three years of enactment the law sets fede ral reimbursement for state costs under the new program at 60 the current federalstate cooperative inspection program pr ovides reimbursement at 50 of costs products inspected under the new program would carry the federal mark of inspection other provisions prohibit federally inspected establishments from participation establish new t echnical assistance division to assist the states and require periodic audits by usda among other things see crs report rl34202 stateinspected meat and pou ltry issues for congress notification and recall requirements fsis periodically announces recalls of meat and poultry products sold in the united states frequently involving c oncerns about pathogen contamination linkages to outbreaks of foodborne illness nd other safety problems these recalls which fsis can request but not mandate under current w raise issues of consumer confidence in the meat and poultry supply and in the adequacy of usda overs ight at issue is the need if any for changes in recall policies including prompter notification when potentially adulterated products enter the market veral pending food sa fety bills include various food recall and notification requirement s see crs report rl34313 the usdas authority to recall meat and poultry products in the enacted 2008 farm bill section 11017 food

misbrandedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22886crs3 3 according to usda data approximately 85 of all us seafood consumption including but not limited to catfish is from imports per capita basis this compares with an approximately 15 import share for all us food consumption see crs report rl34198 us food and agricultural imports safeguards and selected issues meat or poultry product has ente red commerce this notifica tion requirement is in lieu of somewhat more prescriptive provision in the senatepassed ve rsion that would have created reportable meat and poultry registries the registries would have been similar in concept to the registry in the food nd drug administration amendments act of 2007 pl 11085 which now requires the secretary of hhs to create registry for reporting fdaregulated foods with safety problems see crs report rs22779 food safety provisions in the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 section 11017 of the new farm law also requires meat and poultry establishments to prepare and maintain recall plans and any reassessments of their process control plans and to have them available for usda insp ectors to review and copy catfish inspection and grading under the fmia usda conducts mandatory continuous inspection of most red meats and of the livestock from which they are derived the ppia sets similar requirements for poultry and poultry meats under the federal f ood drug and cosmetic act ffdca 21 usc 301 et seq the safety of virtually ll other foods including fish and shellfish is regulated by fda under an entirely different system section 11016b of the enacted 2008 farm bill desi gnates catfish as defined by the secretary of agriculture as an amenab species that is subject to mandatory inspection under the fmia the amendment w ill apply to companies that process catfish for food it further directs usda to take into account the conditions under which the catfish is raised and transported to processing establishment and to consult with fda conferees in report language noted that dditional seafood species were not included but that the secretary already has authority under the fmia to bring others in the inspection provision reportedly was urged by the us catfish industry which has faced strong competitive pressure from foreig n catfish producers particul arly in asia where us interests allege unacceptable types and levels of veterinary drugs are more frequently used3 the conference report states the intent of congress that catfish be subject to continuous inspection and that imported cat fish inspection programs be found to be equivalent under usda regulati ons before foreign catfish may be imported into the united states section 11016a amends the agricultural marketing act of 1946 7 usc 1622 to require usda to establish voluntary gr ading program for catfish which producers could opt into and pay for with user fees as exists in other usda quality grading programs authorized by the 1946 act the section also authorizes producers of other farmraised fish and shellfish species to apply for voluntary grading services country of origin labeling the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 10816 require d

tool for consumers who want to know where their food originates others counter that manda ting such labeling serves useful purpose congress twice postponed implementation for all cool requirements except for seafood as it continued to argue over the need for and likely impacts of this new mandate this debate culminated with the inclusion of veral cool modificati ons in the enacted 2008 farm

goat meat chicken macadamia nuts pecans and ginseng several dditional amendments are aimed at easing recordkeeping and verification requirements and at lowering penalties for noncompliance first section 11002 changes the labeling re quirements for fresh meats by creating four broad categories of labels us country of origin can only be used for meats from an animal exclusively born raised and slaughtered in the united states or present here before july 15 2008 three other categories are for products with multiple countries of origin imported for immediate slaughter or exclusively of foreign origin for ground meats from the covered species the label must list all or all reasonably possible countries of origin for fresh produce covere d nuts and ginseng us state region or locality designation is sufficient for denoting us country of origin wild and farm raised fish continue to have their own parate definitions in the amended cool second section 11002 permits usda to aud it any person who prepares stores handles or distributes covered commodity to verify compliance not just retailers however these persons cannot be required to maintain records for cool other than those maintained in the course of the normal conduct of the bus iness finally noncompliance penalties ar lowered to 1000 from 10000 for each violation omitted food safety provisions the senatepassed version of the farm bill contained number of other food safety related provisions that are not in the final law these included congressional bipartisan food safety commission to st udy and make recommendations to modernize food safety programs which the president would have to use to devel op proposed legislative changes requirement that usda and hhs issue sanitary food tran sportation regulations and prohibition on fda issuing final risk ssessment and on lifting voluntary moratorium on meat and milk from cloned animals and offspring until completion of newly mandated national academy of sciences and usda st udies on their safety and market impacts respectively4 housepassed provision to author ize implementation of qualityrelated food safety programs under sp ecialty crop marketing orders also was omitted from the conference bill conferees indicat ed that such programs alr eady are authorized under the agricultural adjustment act of 1935 whether any of these or similar provisions will re emerge in other pending legi slation remains to be seen
